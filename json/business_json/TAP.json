Risk Factors\n.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $1,910.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased $168.7 million from $2,079.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to the unfavorable timing of working capital, partially offset by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items. The unfavorable timing of working capital was primarily driven by the timing of cash paid for our payables as well as higher payments in the current year for 2023 annual incentive compensation, partially offset by the timing of cash receipts.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $648.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, decreased $193.7 million from $841.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to cash paid in the prior year for an acquisition and other investing activities, as well as higher proceeds in the current year from the sale of the U.S. craft businesses.\n46\nTable of \nContent\ns\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $1,138.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, increased $157.0 million from $981.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher Class B common stock share repurchases and a payment to acquire the noncontrolling interest in CBPL, partially offset by lower net debt repayments.\nCapital Resources, including Material Cash Requirements\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $969.3 million, compared to $868.9 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in cash and cash equivalents from December 31, 2023, was primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities, as well as the issuance of new EUR 800 million 3.80% senior notes due 2032. This was partially offset by debt repayments, including the repayment of our EUR 800 million 1.25% senior notes which matured in July 2024, capital expenditures, Class B common stock share repurchases, dividend payments and payment to acquire the noncontrolling interest in CBPL. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n for additional detail.\nThe majority of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in a variety of highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. These investments are viewed by management as low-risk investments on which there are little to no restrictions regarding our ability to access the underlying cash to fund our operations as necessary. While we have some investments in prime money market funds at times, these are classified as cash and cash equivalents; however, we continually monitor the need for reclassification under the SEC requirements for money market funds, and the potential that the shares of such funds could have a net asset value of less than one dollar. We also utilize cash pooling arrangements to facilitate the access to cash across our geographies.\nWorking Capital \nWe actively manage our working capital to ensure we are able to meet our short-term obligations and to provide more favorable timing of cash inflows. These efforts include optimizing our inventory levels and managing our payment terms on accounts payable and accounts receivable.\nBorrowings\nWe repaid our EUR 800 million 1.25% senior notes upon their maturity on July 15, 2024, using the cash proceeds from our EUR 800 million 3.80% senior notes issued on May 29, 2024, and cash on hand. Refer to \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9, \"Debt\"\n for details.\n47\nTable of \nContent\ns\n                                           \nBased on the credit profile of our lenders that are party to our credit facilities, we are confident in our ability to draw on our revolving credit facility if the need arises. On June 3, 2024, we amended our existing $2.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date from June 26, 2028 to June 26, 2029. As of December 31, 2024, we had $2.0 billion available to draw on our amended and restated $2.0 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, we had no borrowings drawn on this amended and restated multi-currency revolving credit facility and no commercial paper borrowings.\nWe intend to further utilize our cross-border, cross currency cash pool as well as our commercial paper programs for liquidity as needed. We also have CAD, GBP and USD overdraft facilities across several banks should we need additional short-term liquidity.  \n48\nTable of \nContent\ns\nUnder the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include customary events of default and specified representations, warranties and covenants, as well as covenants that restrict our ability to incur certain additional priority indebtedness (certain thresholds of secured consolidated net tangible assets), certain leverage threshold percentages, create or permit liens on assets and restrictions on mergers, acquisitions and certain types of sale lease-back transactions. \n The maximum net debt to EBITDA leverage ratio, as defined by the amended and restated multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement, was 4.00x as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions and covenants, have met such financial ratios and have met all debt payment obligations. All of our outstanding senior notes as of December 31, 2024, rank pari-passu. \nSee \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 9, \"Debt\"\n for further discussion of our borrowings and available sources of borrowings, including lines of credit.\nGuarantees\nWe guarantee indebtedness and other obligations to banks and other third parties for some of our equity method investments and consolidated subsidiaries. Guarantees of the outstanding third-party debt of our equity method investments, which are classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets, have been excluded from the material cash requirements table below. See\n Part II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3, \"Investments\"\n and \nPart II - Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for further discussion.\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nA summary of our material cash requirements from our contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024, based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, is as follows.\n \nPayments due by period\n \nTotal\n2025\n2026-2027\n2028-2029\n2030 and thereafter\n \n(In millions)\nDebt obligations excluding finance leases\n$\n6,117.5 \n$\n20.4 \n$\n2,364.1 \n$\n2.2 \n$\n3,730.8 \nInterest payments on debt obligations\n3,021.4 \n234.0 \n396.1 \n324.2 \n2,067.1 \nFinance leases\n85.2 \n13.0 \n25.9 \n16.3 \n30.0 \nRetirement plan expenditures\n(1)\n368.5 \n41.3 \n74.7 \n74.0 \n178.5 \nOperating leases\n252.3 \n52.7 \n79.1 \n40.9 \n79.6 \nOther long-term obligations\n(2)\n1,773.4 \n394.3 \n622.3 \n387.1 \n369.7 \nTotal obligations\n$\n11,618.3 \n$\n755.7 \n$\n3,562.2 \n$\n844.7 \n$\n6,455.7 \nSee Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, \nNote 9, \"Debt,\n\"\n \nNote 8, \"Leases\n,\n\"\n \nNote 11, \"Employee Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits,\"\n \nNote 10, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,\"\n and \nNote 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for additional information. \n(1)\nPrimarily represents expected benefit payments under our OPEB plans through 2033. The net underfunded liability as of December 31, 2024, of our defined benefit pension plans (excluding our overfunded plans) and OPEB plans is $34.9 million and $423.0 million, respectively. Defined benefit pension plan contributions in future years will vary based on a number of factors, including actual plan asset returns and interest rates, and thus, have been excluded from the above table.\n(2)\nSee \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for further discussion of the majority of the other long-term obligations which includes supply and distribution and advertising and promotions commitments.

Our short-term credit ratings are A-2, Prime-2 and R-2, respectively. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and it may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the applicable rating agency.\nCapital Expenditures\nWe incurred $720.8 million, and paid $674.1 million, for capital improvement projects worldwide for the year ended December 31, 2024, excluding capital spending by equity method joint ventures, representing an increase of $32.2 million from the $688.6 million of capital expenditures incurred for the year ended December 31, 2023. We continue to focus on where and how we employ our planned capital expenditures, with an emphasis on obtaining required returns on invested capital as we determine how to best allocate cash within the business.\nContingencies\nWe are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, environmental litigation and indemnities associated with our sale of Kaiser to FEMSA. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for further discussion. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nRefer to \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements. As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any other material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make judgments and estimates that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosures. Our estimates are based on historical experience, current trends and various other assumptions we believe to be relevant under the circumstances. We review the underlying factors used in our estimates regularly, including reviewing the significant accounting policies impacting the estimates, to ensure compliance with U.S. GAAP. However, due to the uncertainty inherent in our estimates, actual results may be materially different. We have identified the accounting estimates below as critical to understanding and evaluating the financial results reported in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor a complete description of our significant accounting policies, see \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"\n.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nOur defined benefit pension plans cover certain current and former employees in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. Benefit accruals for the majority of employees in our U.S. and U.K. plans have been frozen and the plans are closed to new entrants. In the U.S., we also participate in, and make contributions to, multi-employer pension plans. Further, our OPEB plans provide medical benefits for retirees and their eligible dependents as well as life insurance and, in some cases, dental and vision coverage, for certain retirees in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The defined benefit pension plans are primarily funded, but all OPEB plans are unfunded. We also offer defined contribution plans in each of our segments. \n50\nTable of \nContent\ns\nAccounting for pension and OPEB plans requires that we make assumptions that involve considerable judgment which are significant inputs in the actuarial models that measure our net pension and OPEB obligations and ultimately impact our earnings. These include the discount rate, long-term expected rate of return on assets, and plan asset fair value determination, which are important assumptions used in determining the plans' funded status and annual net periodic pension and OPEB costs. Further assumptions include inflation considerations and health care cost trends. We evaluate these critical assumptions at least annually on a plan and country-specific basis. We also, with the help of actuaries, periodically evaluate other assumptions involving demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future. While we believe that our assumptions are appropriate, significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our net pension and postretirement benefit obligations and related expense. The following discussion focuses on assumptions that are deemed to have the most material impact on our pension and OPEB liabilities and net periodic benefit cost.\nDiscount Rates\nThe assumed discount rates are used to present value future benefit obligations based on each plan's respective estimated duration. Our pension and OPEB discount rates are based on our annual evaluation of high quality corporate bonds in various markets based on appropriate indices and actuarial guidance. We believe that our discount rate assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and OPEB obligations and related expense.\nAs of December 31, 2024, on a weighted-average basis, the discount rates used were 5.41% for our defined benefit pension plans and 5.15% for our OPEB plans. The change from the weighted-average discount rates of 4.74% for our defined benefit pension plans and 4.64% for our OPEB plans as of December 31, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in interest rates in 2024, particularly for our U.S. and U.K. plans.\nA 50 basis point change in our discount rate assumptions would have had the following effects on the projected benefit obligation balances as of December 31, 2024, for our pension and OPEB plans:\nDecrease in discount rate\nIncrease in discount rate\n(In millions)\nUnfavorable (favorable) impact to projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024\nPension obligation\n$\n119.2 \n$\n(109.1)\nOPEB obligation\n16.6 \n(16.3)\nTotal impact to the projected benefit obligation\n$\n135.8 \n$\n(125.4)\nOur U.K. pension plan includes benefits linked to inflation. The above sensitivity analysis does not consider the implications to inflation resulting from the above contemplated discount rate changes. This sensitivity holds all other assumptions constant. \nLong-Term Expected Rate of Return on Assets\nThe assumed long-term expected return on assets is used to estimate the actual return that will occur on each individual funded plan's respective plan assets in the upcoming year. We determine each plan's EROA with substantial input from independent investment specialists, including our actuaries and our outsourced investment consultants. In developing each plan's EROA, we consider current and expected asset allocations, historical market rates as well as historical and expected returns on each plan's individual asset classes. In developing future return expectations for each of our plan's assets, we evaluate general market trends as well as key elements of asset class returns such as expected earnings growth, yields and spreads. The calculation includes inputs for interest, inflation, credit and risk premium (active investment management) rates and fees paid to service providers. Based on the above factors and expected asset allocations, we have assumed, on a weighted-average basis, an EROA of 5.70% for our defined benefit pension plan assets for cost recognition in 2025. This is an increase from the weighted-average rate of 5.47% we assumed for 2024, primarily due to the increase in interest rates in 2024 causing higher expected future fixed income returns. We believe that our EROA assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions or actual returns that differ significantly from estimated returns may materially affect our net periodic pension costs.\n51\nTable of \nContent\ns\nA 50 basis point change in our EROA assumptions made at the beginning of 2024 would have had the following effects on 2024 net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs.\n \nDecrease in EROA\nIncrease in EROA\n \n(In millions)\n(Unfavorable) favorable impact to the 2024 net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost\n$\n(13.9)\n$\n13.9 \nFair Value of Plan Assets\nThe fair value of plan assets is determined by us using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment is required in selecting an appropriate methodology and interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value, especially in the absence of quoted market values in an active market. Changes in these assumptions or the use of different market inputs may have a material impact on the estimated fair values or the ultimate amount at which the plan assets are available to satisfy our plan obligations. \nHealth Care Cost Trend Rates\nThe assumed health care cost trend rates represent the rates at which health care costs are assumed to increase and are based on actuarial input and consideration of historical and expected experience. We use these trends as a significant assumption in determining our postretirement benefit obligation and related costs. Changes in our projections of future health care costs due to general economic conditions and those specific to health care will impact this trend rate. An increase in the trend rate would increase our obligation and expense of our postretirement health care plan. We believe that our health care cost trend rate assumptions are appropriate; however, significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our postretirement benefit obligations and related costs. As of December 31, 2024, the health care trend rates used were ranging ratably from 7.00% in 2025 to 3.57% in 2040, which is a slight increase from our assumed health care trend rates ranging ratably from 6.75% in 2024 to 3.57% in 2040 as of December 31, 2023. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 11, \"Employee Retirement Plans and Postretirement Benefits\"\n for further information.\nContingencies, Environmental and Litigation Reserves\nContingencies, environmental and litigation reserves are recorded when probable, using our best estimate of loss. These estimates involve significant judgment and are based on an evaluation of the range of loss related to such matters and where the amount and range can be reasonably estimated. These matters are generally resolved over a number of years and only when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. Following our initial determination, we regularly reassess and revise the potential liability related to any pending matters as new information becomes available. Unless capitalization is allowed or required by U.S. GAAP, environmental and legal costs are expensed when incurred. We disclose pending loss contingencies when the loss is deemed reasonably possible, which requires significant judgment. As a result of the inherent uncertainty of these matters, the ultimate conclusion and actual cost of settlement may materially differ from our estimates. We recognize contingent gains upon the determination that realization is assured beyond a reasonable doubt, regardless of the perceived probability of a favorable outcome prior to achieving that assurance. In the instance of gain contingencies resulting from favorable litigation, due to the numerous uncertainties inherent in a legal proceeding, gain contingencies resulting from legal settlements are not recognized in income until cash or other forms of payment are received. If significant and probable, we disclose as appropriate.\nSee \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for a discussion of our contingencies, environmental and litigation reserves as of December 31, 2024.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Valuation\nWe evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that may indicate potential impairment. Our annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is performed as of October 1, the first day of the last fiscal quarter. We evaluate our other definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when evidence exists that certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying values of goodwill and intangible assets were approximately $5.6 billion and $12.2 billion, respectively, with the goodwill balance entirely attributed to the Americas reporting unit.  \n52\nTable of \nContent\ns\nWe use a combination of discounted cash flow analyses and market approaches to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units and an excess earnings approach to determine the fair values of our indefinite-lived brand intangible assets. Our discounted cash flow projections include assumptions for growth rates for sales, costs and profits, which are based on various long-range financial and operational plans of each reporting unit or each indefinite-lived intangible asset. Additionally, discount rates used in our goodwill analysis are based on weighted-average cost of capital, driven by the prevailing interest rates in geographies where these businesses operate, as well as the credit ratings, financing abilities and opportunities of each reporting unit, among other factors. Discount rates for the indefinite-lived intangible analysis by brand largely reflect the rates supporting the overall reporting unit valuation but may differ to adjust for country or market specific risk associated with a particular brand, among other factors. Our market-based valuations utilize earnings multiples of comparable public companies, which are reflective of the market in which each respective reporting unit operates. The key assumptions used to derive the estimated fair values of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets represent Level 3 measurements.\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows, specifically, an inability to execute on our strategic initiatives including our premiumization efforts or an increase in costs driven by inflation or other factors that could significantly impact our immediate and long range results, prolonged weakness in consumer demand or other competitive pressures adversely affecting our long-term volume trends, changes in trends and consumer preferences within the industry towards other brands or product categories, unfavorable working capital changes or an inability to successfully implement our cost savings initiatives, (ii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions that significantly differ from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a global pandemic, recession or evolving beer industry), (iii) significant unfavorable changes in tax rates, (iv) volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country-specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital, (v) sensitivity to market multiples; and (vi) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing, distribution or sale of alcoholic beverages.  \nIf actual performance results differ significantly from our projections or we experience significant fluctuations in our other assumptions, a material impairment loss may occur in the future. See \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 6, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\"\n for further discussion and presentation of these amounts.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Test\nAs of the October 1, 2024, testing date, the fair value of the Americas reporting unit was determined to be in excess of its carrying amount and therefore no goodwill impairment charge was recorded. The Americas reporting unit continues to be at a heightened risk of future impairment as the fair value exceeded its respective carrying value by less than 15%. The fair value of the Americas reporting unit decreased during the current year, primarily due to lower market multiples and lower forecasted cash flow projections, with the decreases largely driven by more challenging U.S. industry expectations. This is partially offset by a decrease to the discount rate as a result of reductions in the interest rate environment. Specifically, the discount rate used in developing our annual fair value estimates for the Americas reporting unit in the current year was 8.25% based on market-specific factors, as compared to 9.00% used as of the October 1, 2023, annual testing date. A 50 basis point increase in our discount rate assumption, holding all other assumptions and inputs constant, would not have resulted in an impairment of the Americas reporting unit.\nCurrent projections used for the Americas reporting unit testing reflected growth assumptions associated with our continued plan to consistently grow our core power brand revenue, aggressively premiumize our portfolio, scale and expand beyond beer, invest in our capabilities and invest in our people, communities and planet, all of which are intended to benefit the projected cash flows of the business. While progress has been made on this strategy, including the strengthening of our core brands, there is not enough historical data yet to adequately predict future impacts and forecasted future cash flows are inherently at risk given that the strategies are still in progress. In addition, while we have included in our forecasted future cash flows estimates for expected cost inflation and adjusted our volumes to be reflective of the current beer industry trends, there is still inherent risk in achieving our goals. If our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that further impairment charges may be recorded in the future. \n53\nTable of \nContent\ns\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nThe fair values of the \nCoors \nbrands in the Americas (inclusive of our \nCoors\n brand in the U.S. and \nCoors\n distribution agreement in Canada), the \nMiller \nbrands in the U.S., the \nCarling \nbrands in the U.K. and the \nStaropramen \nbrands in EMEA&APAC are sufficiently in excess of their respective carrying values as of the October 1, 2024 annual testing date, with each having over 15% cushion of fair value over book value. We utilize Level 3 fair value measurements in our impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. The future cash flows used in the analyses are based on internal cash flow projections utilizing our long range plans and include significant assumptions by management. A 50 basis point increase in our discount rate assumptions would not have resulted in an impairment of any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nAs of the October 1, 2023, testing date, the carrying value of the \nStaropramen\n family of\n \nbrands in EMEA&APAC was determined to be in excess of its fair value such that a partial impairment loss of $160.7 million was recorded in our consolidated statements of operations during the fourth quarter of 2023. \nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe continuously monitor the performance of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets for potential triggering events suggesting an impairment review should be performed or useful lives should be re-assessed. Due to a reduction in forecasted cash flows associated with one of our asset groups, we identified this as a triggering event during the fourth quarter of 2024 and performed a recoverability test for the long-lived assets at the asset group level but concluded that the recoverability test passed and no impairment was recorded. No other material triggering events were identified in either 2024 or 2023 related to our definite-lived intangible assets or other definite-lived assets. \nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Judgment is required in determining our consolidated provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by many different tax authorities.\nWe are periodically subject to income tax audits in various foreign and domestic jurisdictions, which can involve questions regarding our tax positions and result in additional income tax liabilities assessed against us. Settlement of any challenge resulting from these tax controversies can result in a variety of resolutions including no change, a complete disallowance, or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits. We measure and record the tax benefits from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our estimated liabilities related to these matters are adjusted in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations for examination expires or when additional information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits requires the use of assumptions and significant judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates made are reasonable, actual results could differ and resulting adjustments could materially affect our effective tax rate and tax provision.\nWhen cash is available after satisfying working capital needs and all other business obligations, we may distribute current earnings and the associated cash from a foreign subsidiary to its U.S. parent, and record the tax impact associated with the distribution. However, to the extent current earnings of our foreign operations exist and are not otherwise distributed or planned to be distributed, such earnings accumulate. These accumulated earnings are not considered permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. The taxes associated with any future repatriation of undistributed earnings are anticipated to be insignificant.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, including the reversal of existing temporary differences, historical and projected operating results, and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. The realization of tax benefits is evaluated by jurisdiction and the realizability of these assets can vary based on the character of the tax attribute and the carryforward periods specific to each jurisdiction. \nThere are proposed or pending tax law changes in various jurisdictions in which we do business. As discussed in \nPart II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12, \"Income Tax\"\n, we recognize the impacts of changes in tax law upon enactment, and therefore, proposed changes in tax law, regulations and rules are not reflected within our tax provision. As a result, such changes may, upon ultimate enactment, result in material impacts to our financial statements.\n54\nTable of \nContent\ns\nITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nIn the normal course of our global operations, we are exposed to market risks associated with volatile interest rates, foreign currency exchange fluctuations and commodity price risks. To manage our exposure to these market risks, we enter into certain supplier-based and market-based hedging transactions. Such transactions are allowed under our risk management policy and are monitored closely with clear controls around the activities. Our market-based transactions include a variety of derivative financial instruments, none of which are used for trading or speculative purposes. The counterparties to these market-based transactions are generally highly rated institutions. Our objective is to manage our exposures and to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows as a result of changes in underlying rates and costs.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to volatility in interest rates with regard to our current and future debt offerings. Specifically, we are exposed to U.S. Department of Treasury rates, Canadian government rates and SOFR, or any such alternatives like SONIA or EURIBOR, for example. We may from time to time enter into interest rate swaps on our current debt obligations as our hedging strategy is to achieve our desired fixed-to-floating rate debt profile such that we manage the volatility in earnings as well as the cost of funding our operations. Further, we may enter into forward starting interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to the volatility of interest rates associated with future interest payments on a forecasted debt issuance. \nIn May 2023, we amended our 2026 forward starting interest rate swaps to replace LIBOR with SOFR. Subsequent to this transition, we are no longer exposed to LIBOR. As of December 31, 2024, the following table presents our fixed rate debt and forward starting interest rate swaps as well as the impact of an absolute 1% adverse change in interest rates on their respective fair values. Notional amounts and fair values are presented in USD based on the applicable exchange rates as of December 31, 2024. See \nPart II - Item 8.

We closely monitor our operations in each country and seek to adopt appropriate strategies that are responsive to foreign currency fluctuations. Our financial risk management policy is intended to mitigate a portion of the potentially unfavorable impact of exchange rates on our earnings and cash flows.\nChanges in foreign currency exchange rates affect the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, transaction gains and losses associated with intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries, royalty agreements and transactions denominated in currencies other than the USD, and their related cash flows, specifically related to the purchase of production inputs and imports, as well as our foreign currency-denominated debt. See \nPart II - Item, 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 1. \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"\n for our accounting policy over the accounting for translation adjustments and foreign currency transactions.\nApproximately $3.7 billion, or 32%, of our net sales were denominated in functional currencies other than the USD for the year ended December 31, 2024. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the CAD and the GBP, may have a material impact on our reported results. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net sales denominated in GBP and CAD approximated $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, for each respective currency.\nWe manage our foreign currency exposures through foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedges. Our EUR foreign-denominated debt is designated as a net investment hedge of our investment in a EUR functional currency subsidiary in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency translational impacts. Accordingly, the changes in fair value of the net investment hedge due to the fluctuations in the spot rate are recorded to AOCI until a liquidation or deconsolidation event at which point the accumulated gains and losses will be reclassified into earnings. Our foreign currency forward contracts manage our exposure related to certain royalty agreements, the purchase of production inputs and imports that are denominated in currencies other than the entity's functional local currency and other foreign currency exchange exposure.\n55\nTable of \nContent\ns\nThe following table includes details of our foreign currency forwards used to hedge our foreign exchange rate risk as well as the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the related foreign currency exchange rates on the fair value of the foreign currency forwards. Notional amounts and fair values are presented in USD based on the applicable exchange rate as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

We specifically hedge our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas, barley, diesel and aluminum, including surcharges relating to our aluminum exposures. We utilize market-based derivatives and supplier-based mechanisms, specifically a combination of purchase orders, long-term supply contracts and over-the-counter financial instruments to mitigate our commodity price risk by reducing price volatility for select commodities that are used in our supply chain. \nThe following table includes details of our commodity swaps used to hedge commodity price risk as well as the impact of a hypothetical 10% adverse change in the related commodity prices on the fair value of the derivatives. The following table excludes our commodity options because we have offsetting buy and sell positions. Notional amounts and fair values are presented in USD based on the applicable exchange rate as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Joubert\nPresident & Chief Executive Officer\nChief Financial Officer\nMolson Coors Beverage Company\nMolson Coors Beverage Company\nFebruary 18, 2025\nFebruary 18, 2025\n58\nTable of \nContent\ns\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Molson Coors Beverage Company\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Molson Coors Beverage Company and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of stockholders’ equity and noncontrolling interests, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 appearing under Item 15(c) (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n \nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions \nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n59\nTable of \nContent\ns\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment - Americas Reporting Unit \nAs described in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance related to the Americas reporting unit was $5,582 million as of December 31, 2024. The carrying value of goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that may indicate potential impairment. The Company’s annual impairment test is performed as of the first day of the fiscal fourth quarter. The evaluation involves comparing the reporting unit’s fair value to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds its respective carrying value, then management would conclude that no impairment has occurred. If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, the Company would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. A combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach is used by management to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting unit may include the following, as disclosed by management, (i) growth rates for sales, costs of goods sold and profits, which are based on various long-range financial and operational plans; (ii) prolonged weakening of economic conditions; or (iii) significant unfavorable changes in income tax rates, environmental or other regulations, including interpretations thereof, terminal growth rate, market multiples and/or weighted-average cost of capital. Management concluded that the fair value of the Americas reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value and therefore no goodwill impairment charge was recorded. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment for the Americas reporting unit is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Americas reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to the weighted average cost of capital, growth rates for sales and growth rates for costs of goods sold; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Americas reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Americas reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow analysis and market approach used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow analysis and market approach; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of significant assumptions used by management related to the weighted average cost of capital, growth rates for sales and growth rates for costs of goods sold. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to growth rates for sales and growth rates for costs of goods sold involved evaluating whether the significant assumptions used were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Americas reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the Company’s discounted cash flow analysis and market approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the weighted average cost of capital assumption.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n \nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\n \nFebruary 18, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

Accounting Policies\nUnless otherwise noted in this report, any description of \"we,\" \"us\" or \"our\" includes Molson Coors Beverage Company (\"MCBC\" or the \"Company\"), principally a holding company, and its operating and non-operating subsidiaries included within its reporting segments. \nOur reporting segments include the Americas and EMEA&APAC. Our Americas segment operates in the U.S., Canada and various countries in Latin America, and our EMEA&APAC segment operates in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Montenegro, the Republic of Ireland, Romania, Serbia, the U.K., various other European countries and certain countries within the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. \nUnless otherwise indicated, information in this report is presented in USD and comparisons are to comparable prior periods. 2024, 2023 and 2022 refers to the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Our primary operating currencies, other than the USD, include the CAD, the GBP and our Central European operating currencies such as the EUR, CZK, RON and RSD.\nOur consolidated financial statements and related disclosures reflect new accounting pronouncements adopted during the year as discussed in \nNote 2, \"New Accounting Pronouncements.\"\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and our majority-owned and controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries, as well as certain VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n \nUse of Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions used to determine certain amounts that affect the financial statements are reasonable, based on information available at the time they are made. To the extent there are differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements may be materially affected.\nAcquisitions and Buyouts\nOn October 31, 2024, we further increased our investment in ZOA for cash consideration of $\n53\n million, bringing our ownership interest to \n51\n% subsequent to the closing of the transaction. As a result, we have recorded the transaction as a business combination, with ZOA included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition within the Americas reporting segment. See \nNote 3, \"Investments\"\n for further discussion.\nIn March 2024, our CBPL partner exercised a put option under our partnership agreement in which we acquired the remaining \n49.9\n% ownership interest resulting in a cash payment of $\n89\n million on October 21, 2024, which was recorded as a cash outflow from financing activities. See the redeemable noncontrolling interest section of this footnote for further discussion of this transaction.\nOn August 7, 2023, we acquired a \n75\n% equity interest in Blue Run, a U.S. based high end whiskey business, for a purchase price of $\n77\n million, which included cash paid of $\n64\n million. The acquisition is aligned with our strategy to expand beyond the beer aisle and enhance our presence in the spirits category.\nThe Blue Run acquisition was accounted for as a business combination, with $\n88\n million allocated to a definite-lived brand intangible asset to be amortized over a \n15\n-year period and the remainder primarily allocated to other working capital balances and goodwill for the amount in excess of the net identifiable assets acquired. A noncontrolling interest was recognized at fair value based on a Monte Carlo simulation model and is recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets based on the contractual terms of the agreement. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented as the impact is not material to our consolidated statements of operations or consolidated balance sheets. \n69\nTable of Contents\nSupplier Financing\nWe are the buyer under a supplier finance program with Citibank N.A. (\"Citi\" or \"the bank\"), with $\n145.1\n million and $\n147.5\n million confirmed as valid and outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We recognize these unpaid balances in \naccounts payable and other current liabilities\n on our consolidated balance sheets. Under the program, we agree to pay the bank the stated amount of confirmed invoices from our designated suppliers on the original maturity dates of the invoices. We have no involvement in establishing the terms or conditions of the arrangement between the suppliers and the bank and do not participate in such transactions. Either Citi or us may terminate the agreement upon at least \n30\n days written notice. We do not provide secured legal assets or other forms of guarantees under the arrangement. Our current payment terms with the majority of the suppliers participating in the supplier finance program generally range from \n60\n to \n120\n days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. \nThe rollforward of our outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under our supplier finance program for the year ended December 31, 2024 was as follows:\n(In millions)\nConfirmed obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2023\n$\n147.5\n \nInvoices confirmed during the year\n590.8\n \nConfirmed invoices paid during the year\n(\n590.7\n)\nEffect of foreign exchange rate changes\n(\n2.5\n)\nConfirmed obligations outstanding as of December 31, 2024\n$\n145.1\n \nGovernment Assistance \nWe receive government assistance in the form of tax credits and grants, including tax credits from government agencies in certain jurisdictions around job creation and retention, as well as capital investment initiatives. This includes, but is not limited to, refundable and non-refundable property and income tax credits in various state and other local jurisdictions. We recognize amounts received from government assistance programs, including non income tax credits and grants, as a reduction to MG&A expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, when it is probable we will receive the funds and have met the conditions, if any, required by the government assistance program. If we receive the government assistance at a point in time for services to be completed over a future time period, the cash received is initially recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as other liabilities, and amortized as a reduction to MG&A expenses over the service period of the agreement. No programs are material individually or in the aggregate.\n \nRevenue Recognition\nOur net sales represent the sale of beer, malt beverages and other adjacencies, net of excise tax. Sales are stated net of incentives, discounts and returns. Sales of products are for cash or otherwise agreed upon credit terms. Our payment terms vary by location and customer, however, the time period between when revenue is recognized and when payment is due is not significant. Our revenue generating activities have a single performance obligation and are recognized at the point in time when control transfers and our obligation has been fulfilled, which is when the related goods are shipped or delivered to the customer, depending upon the method of distribution and shipping terms. Where our products are sold under consignment arrangements, revenue is not recognized until control has transferred, which is when the product is sold to the end customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for the sale of our product. The cost of various programs, such as price promotions, rebates and coupons, are treated as a reduction of sales. In certain of our markets where legally permitted, we make cash payments to customers such as slotting or listing fees, or payments for other marketing or promotional activities. These cash payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue unless we receive a distinct good or service. Specifically, a good or service is considered distinct when it is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract, we receive a benefit from the good or service and the benefit is separable from the sale of our product to the customer.\nCertain payments made to customers are conditional on the achievement of volume targets, marketing commitments or both. If paid in advance, we record such payments as prepayments and amortize them over the relevant period to which the customer commitment is made (generally up to \nfive years\n). When the payment is not for a distinct good or service, or fair value cannot be reasonably estimated, the amortization of the prepayment or the cost as incurred is recorded as a reduction of revenue. Where a distinct good or service is received and fair value can be reasonably estimated, the cost is included as MG&A expenses. The amounts deferred are reassessed regularly for recoverability over the contract period and are impaired where there is objective evidence that the benefits will not be realized or the asset is otherwise not recoverable. Separately, as discussed below, we analyze whether these advance payments contain a significant financing component for potential adjustment to the transaction price.\n70\nTable of Contents\nOur primary revenue generating activity represents the sale of beer and other beverages to customers, including both domestic and exported product sales. Our customer could be a distributor, retail or on-premise outlet, depending on the market. The majority of our revenues are generated from brands that we own and brew ourselves; however, we also import or brew and sell certain non-owned partner brands under licensing and related arrangements. In addition, primarily in the U.K., we sell other beverage companies' products to on-premise customers to provide them with a full range of products for their retail outlets. We refer to this as the \"factored brand business.\" Sales from this business are included in our net sales and cost of goods sold when ultimately sold. In the factored brand business, we normally purchase inventory, which includes excise taxes charged by the vendor, take orders from customers for such brands, negotiate with the customers on pricing and invoice customers for the product and related costs of delivery. In addition, we incur the risk of loss when we are in possession of the inventory and for the receivables due from the customers. Revenues for owned brands, partner and imported brands, as well as factored brands are recognized at the point in time when control is transferred to the customer as discussed above. \nOther Revenue Generating Activities\nWe contract manufacture for other brewers in some of our markets. These contractual agreements require us to brew, package and ship certain brands for these brewers, who then sell the products to their own customers in their respective markets. Revenues under contract brewing arrangements are recognized when our obligation related to the finished product is fulfilled and control of the product transfers to these other brewers.\nWe also have licensing agreements with third party partners who brew and distribute our products in various markets across our segments. Under these agreements, we are compensated based on the amount of products sold by our partners in these markets at an agreed upon royalty rate or profit percentage. We apply the sales-based royalty practical expedient to these licensing arrangements and recognize revenue as product is sold by our partners at the agreed upon rate. \nDisaggregation of Revenue\nWe have evaluated our primary revenue generating activities under the disaggregation disclosure criteria outlined within the guidance and concluded that disclosure at the geographical segment level depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. We have also evaluated our other revenue generating activities and concluded that these activities are not material for separate disclosure. See \nNote 18, \"Segment Reporting,\"\n for disclosure of revenues by geographic segment.\nVariable Consideration\nOur revenue generating activities include variable consideration which is recorded as a reduction of the transaction price based upon expected amounts at the time revenue for the corresponding product sale is recognized. For example, customer promotional discount programs are entered into with certain distributors for certain periods of time. The amount ultimately reimbursed to distributors is determined based upon agreed-upon promotional discounts which are applied to distributors' sales to retailers. Other common forms of variable consideration include volume rebates for meeting established sales targets, and coupons and mail-in rebates offered to the end consumer. The determination of the reduction of the transaction price for variable consideration requires that we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amounts of revenue and liabilities recorded. We estimate this variable consideration, including analyzing for a potential constraint on variable consideration, by taking into account factors such as the nature of the promotional activity, historical information and current trends, availability of actual results and expectations of customer and consumer behavior.\nWe do not have standard terms that permit return of product; however, in certain markets where returns occur we estimate the amount of returns as variable consideration based on factors including historical return experience and adjust our revenue accordingly. Products that do not meet our high quality standards are returned by the customer or recalled and destroyed and are recorded as a reduction of revenue. The reversal of revenue is recorded upon determination that the product will be recalled and destroyed. We estimate the costs required to facilitate product returns and record them in cost of goods sold as required.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, adjustments to revenue from performance obligations satisfied in the prior period due to changes in estimates in variable consideration were immaterial.\n71\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Financing Component and Costs to Obtain Contracts\nIn certain of our businesses where such practices are legally permitted, we make loans or advanced payments to retail outlets that sell our brands. For arrangements that do not span greater than one year, we apply the practical expedient available under ASC 606 and do not adjust the transaction price for the effects of a potential significant financing component. We further analyze arrangements that span greater than one year on an ongoing basis to determine whether a significant financing component exists. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, no arrangements were material individually or in the aggregate. \nAdvance payments to customers, where legally permitted, are deferred and amortized as a reduction to revenue over the expected period of benefit and tested for recoverability as appropriate. All other costs to obtain and fulfill contracts are expensed as incurred based on the nature, significance and expected benefit of these costs relative to the contract.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nWe continually evaluate whether our revenue generating activities and advanced payment arrangements with customers result in the recognition of contract assets or liabilities. These assets and liabilities were immaterial as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Separately, trade receivables, net including affiliate receivables, approximates receivables from contracts with customers. \nShipping and Handling\nFreight costs billed to customers for shipping and handling are recorded as revenue. Shipping and handling expense related to costs incurred to deliver product are recognized within cost of goods sold. We account for shipping and handling activities that occur after control has transferred as a fulfillment cost as opposed to a separate performance obligation, and the costs of shipping and handling are recognized concurrently with the related revenue.\n \nExcise Taxes\nExcise taxes on alcohol products are government-imposed taxes based on measurable attributes like alcohol content, volume, or beverage type, aimed at generating revenue and regulating consumption. Excise taxes are shown in a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations as a reduction of sales. In the consolidated balance sheets, excise taxes are generally recognized as a current liability within accounts payable and other current liabilities, with the liability subsequently reduced when the taxes are remitted to the tax authority. In cases where excise taxes are prepaid, they are recorded within other current assets, net.\n \nCost of Goods Sold\nOur cost of goods sold includes costs we incur to make and ship beer and other beverages. These costs include brewing materials, such as barley, hops and various grains. Packaging materials, including aluminum, glass bottles, aluminum cans, cardboard and paperboard are also included in our cost of goods sold. Additionally, our cost of goods sold contains manufacturing expenses including both direct and indirect labor, shipping and handling including freight costs, utilities, maintenance costs, warehousing costs, purchasing and receiving costs, depreciation, promotional packaging, other manufacturing overheads and costs to purchase factored and other non-owned brands from suppliers, as well as the cost to facilitate product returns.\n \nMarketing, General and Administrative Expenses\nMG&A expenses include marketing expenses, including the direct costs related to the selling of a product or brand, media advertising (television, radio, digital, print), tactical advertising (signs, banners, point-of-sale materials) and promotion costs on both local and national levels. The creative portion of our advertising activities is expensed as incurred. Production costs of advertising and promotional materials are recorded as a prepaid asset and expensed when the advertising is first run. Additionally, marketing expenses include amortization costs associated with definite-lived brand intangible assets and certain depreciation costs related to marketing related assets. Total marketing and advertising expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization costs, were approximately $\n1.1\n billion, $\n1.1\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nMG&A expenses also include general and administrative costs for functions such as finance, legal, human resources and information technology. These costs primarily consist of compensation, benefits and outside services, as well as bad debt expense related to our allowance for doubtful accounts. Unless capitalization is allowed or required by U.S. GAAP, legal costs are expensed when incurred. These costs also include our marketing and sales organizations, including compensation, benefits and other overhead costs, including travel and entertainment expenses. This line item additionally includes share-based compensation and certain depreciation costs related to non-production equipment.\n72\nTable of Contents\nShare-based compensation is recognized using a straight-line method over the vesting period of the awards. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating share-based compensation expense. Our share-based compensation plan and the awards within it contain provisions that accelerate vesting of awards upon change in control, retirement, disability or death of eligible employees and directors. Our share-based awards are considered vested when the employee's retention of the award is no longer contingent on providing service, which for certain awards can result in immediate recognition for awards granted to retirement-eligible individuals or accelerated recognition for awards granted to individuals that will become retirement eligible within the stated vesting period. Also, if less than the stated vesting period, we recognize these costs over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved.\nOther Operating Income (Expense), net\nOur other operating income (expense), net items represent charges incurred or benefits realized that we believe are significant to our current operating results warranting separate classification; specifically, such items are considered to be one of the following:\n•\nrestructuring charges, including certain employee-related charges, asset abandonment-related losses, fees on termination of significant operating agreements and other related exit or disposal charges; \n•\nintangible and tangible asset impairments, excluding goodwill; \n•\ngains and (losses) on disposal of investments; and\n•\nother significant items deemed to warrant separate classification within operating income\nThese items classified as other operating income (expense), net are not necessarily non-recurring, however, they are generally deemed to be incremental to income earned or costs incurred through normal operations.\n \nInterest Expense, net\nOur interest costs are primarily associated with borrowings to finance our operations and strategic acquisitions. Interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents across our business is recorded as interest income. \nWe capitalize interest cost as a part of the original cost of acquiring certain fixed assets if the cost of the capital expenditure and the expected time to complete the project are considered significant. Generally, we use the weighted average cost of borrowing of outstanding long-term debt to calculate capitalized interest.\n \nOther Non-Operating Income (Expense), net\nOur other non-operating income (expense), net classification primarily includes gains and losses associated with activities not directly related to our operations. For instance, aggregate unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the remeasurement and settlement of foreign-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, as well as certain gains or losses on sales of non-operating assets and the mark-to-market activity associated with certain equity securities and other investments are classified in this line item. These gains and losses are included in the respective reporting unit; however, foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances and realized and unrealized changes in fair value on instruments not designated in hedging relationships related to financing and other treasury-related activities remain unallocated. The initial recording of foreign-denominated transactions are classified based on the nature of the transaction, with the unrealized or realized foreign exchange gains or losses resulting from the subsequent remeasurement of the monetary asset or liability, and its ultimate settlement, classified in other non-operating income (expense), net.\n \nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets, liabilities and certain unrecognized gains and losses recorded in AOCI. We apply the intraperiod tax allocation rules to allocate our provision for income taxes between continuing operations and other categories of earnings, such as OCI, when we meet the criteria prescribed by U.S. GAAP. \nThe tax benefit from an uncertain tax position is recognized only if it is determined that the tax position will more likely than not be sustained based on its technical merits. We measure and record the tax benefits from such a position based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest, penalties and offsetting positions related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense with interest and penalties being recorded to income tax benefit (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\n \n73\nTable of Contents\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nOCI represents income and losses for the reporting period, including the related tax impacts, which are excluded from net income (loss) and recognized directly within AOCI as a component of equity. OCI also includes amounts reclassified to the consolidated statements of operations during the reporting period that were previously recognized within AOCI. Amounts remaining within AOCI are expected to be reclassified out of AOCI in the future, at which point they will be recognized within the consolidated statement of operations as a component of net income (loss). We recognize OCI related to the translation of assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in currencies other than the USD, unrealized gains and losses on the effective portion of our derivatives designated in cash flow hedging relationships and derivative and non-derivative instruments designated in net investment hedging relationships, actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs related to our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans, as well as our proportionate share of our equity method investments' OCI. Additionally, when we do not have the expectation or intent to cash settle certain of our intercompany note receivable and note payable positions in the foreseeable future, the remeasurement of these instruments is recorded as a component of foreign currency translation adjustments within OCI. We release stranded tax effects from AOCI using either a specific identification approach or portfolio approach based on the nature of the underlying item.\n \nEarnings Per Share\nBasic EPS is computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the additional dilutive effect of our potentially dilutive securities, which include RSUs, DSUs, PSUs and stock options. The dilutive effects of our potentially dilutive securities are calculated using the treasury stock method. Our calculation of weighted-average shares includes Class A common stock and Class B common stock and Class A exchangeable shares and Class B exchangeable shares. All classes of stock have in effect the same dividend rights and share equitably in undistributed earnings. Holders of Class A common stock receive dividends only to the extent dividends are declared and paid to holders of Class B common stock. See \nNote 14, \"Stockholders' Equity\"\n for further discussion of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock and Class A exchangeable shares and Class B exchangeable shares. We have no unvested outstanding equity share awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends.\nAnti-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, were \n1.2\n million, \n0.6\n million and \n3.1\n million shares, respectively.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash consists of cash on hand and bank deposits. Cash equivalents represent highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Our cash deposits are maintained with multiple, reputable financial institutions. \nDividends\nOn November 21, 2024, our Company's Board declared a dividend of $\n0.44\n per share, paid on December 20, 2024 to shareholders of Class A and Class B common stock of record on December 6, 2024. Shareholders of exchangeable shares received the CAD equivalent of dividends declared on Class A and Class B common stock, equal to CAD \n0.61\n per share. During the year ended December 31, 2024, dividends declared to eligible shareholders totaled $\n1.76\n per share, with the CAD equivalent equal to CAD \n2.39\n per share. During the year ended December 31, 2023, dividends declared to eligible shareholders totaled $\n1.64\n per share with the CAD equivalent equal to CAD \n2.19\n per share. During the year ended December 31, 2022, dividends declared to eligible shareholders totaled $\n1.52\n per share with the CAD equivalent equal to CAD \n1.95\n per share.\nNon-Cash Activity\nNon-cash investing activities includes movements in our guarantee of indebtedness of certain equity method investments. See \nNote 3, \"Investments\"\n for further discussion. We also had other non-cash activities related to capital expenditures incurred but not yet paid of $\n297.8\n million, $\n254.9\n million and $\n234.3\n million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In addition, we had non-cash activities related to certain issuances of share-based awards. See \nNote 16, \"Share-Based Payments\"\n for further details.\nOther than the activity mentioned above and the supplemental non-cash activity related to the recognition of leases discussed in \nNote 8, \"Leases,\"\n there was no other significant non-cash activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \n74\nTable of Contents\nTrade Receivables \nWe record trade receivables at net realizable value. This carrying value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible amounts to reflect any loss anticipated on the trade receivable balances. We calculate this allowance based on our country-specific history of write-offs, level of past-due accounts based on the contractual terms of the receivables and our relationships with and the economic status of our customers, which may be impacted by current macroeconomic and regulatory factors specific to the country of origin. This methodology takes into consideration historical loss experience and current and forecasted changes in cash flows based on internal and external information.\n The allowance for doubtful accounts was $\n8.9\n million and $\n12.7\n million as of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, respectively.  \nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. We regularly assess the shelf-life of our inventories and reserve for those inventories when it becomes probable the product will not be sold within our freshness specifications. In addition, we reserve for those inventories associated with discontinued SKUs or seasonal or other packaging material changes.\nOther Current Assets\nOther current assets include prepaid assets, maintenance and operating supplies, promotion materials and derivative assets that are expected to be recognized or realized within the next \n12\n months. Maintenance and operating supplies include our inventories of spare parts, which are kept on hand for repairs and maintenance of machinery and equipment. The majority of spare parts within our business include motors, fillers and other components that are required to maintain a normal level of production in the event that expected maintenance and/or repairs are required. These parts are classified within current assets as they are reasonably expected to be used during the normal operating cycle of the business and are reserved for excess and obsolescence, as appropriate.\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are reviewed periodically and have the following ranges: buildings and improvements: \n20\n-\n40\n years; production and office equipment \n3\n-\n25\n years; and software: \n3\n-\n7\n years. Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. Costs of enhancements or modifications that substantially extend the capacity or useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated accordingly. Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. When property, plant and equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our consolidated balance sheets and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Our asset groups are generally identified at the segment level with the exception of certain businesses or locations which may operate on a more stand-alone basis. \nReturnable containers are recorded at acquisition cost and consist of returnable bottles, kegs, pallets and crates that are both in our direct control within our breweries, warehouses and distribution facilities and those that we indirectly control in the market through our agreements with our customers and other brewers and for which a deposit is received. The deposits received on our returnable containers in the market are recorded as deposit liabilities, included within accounts payable and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. We estimate that the loss, breakage and deterioration of our returnable containers is comparable to the depreciation calculated on an estimated useful life of up to \n4\n years for bottles, \n5\n years for pallets, \n7\n years for crates and \n15\n years for returnable kegs. We also own and maintain other equipment in the market related to delivery of our products to end consumers, for example on-premise dispense equipment and refrigeration units. This equipment is recorded at acquisition cost and depreciated over lives of up to \n7\n years, depending on the market, reflecting the use of the equipment, as well as the loss and deterioration of the asset.\nThe costs of acquiring or developing internal-use computer software, including directly-related payroll costs for internal resources, are capitalized and classified within property, plant and equipment. Software maintenance and training costs are expensed in the period incurred.\nProperty, plant and equipment held under finance lease are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life or the lease term, whichever is shorter. Finance lease assets for which ownership is transferred at the end of the lease, or there is a purchase option that we are reasonably certain to exercise, are depreciated over the useful life that would be assigned if the asset were owned.\n75\nTable of Contents\nCloud Computing Arrangements\nCloud computing arrangement implementation costs incurred in hosting arrangements that are service contracts are recorded within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized cloud computing arrangement implementation costs are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining term of the contract.\n Amortization expense was $\n11.3\n million, $\n7.9\n million and $\n6.2\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. \nThe following table presents the gross and net value of capitalized cloud computing implementation costs associated with active hosting arrangements.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions)\nCloud computing implementation costs\n$\n71.9\n \n$\n56.5\n \nLess: accumulated amortization\n(\n32.0\n)\n(\n20.8\n)\nCloud computing implementation costs, net\n$\n39.9\n \n$\n35.7\n \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is allocated to the reporting unit in which the business that created the goodwill resides. A reporting unit is an operating segment, or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management. As of the date of the completion of our 2024 impairment testing, we have concluded that we have \ntwo\n reporting units, Americas and EMEA&APAC.\n See further discussion in \nNote 6, \"Goodwill and Intangibles.\"\nAs required, we evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill at the reporting unit level and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually or when an interim triggering event occurs that may indicate potential impairment. Our annual test is performed as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter, October 1. The testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets uses estimates and assumptions affected by factors such as economic and industry conditions along with changes in operating performance. The evaluation involves comparing the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value to its carrying value. If the fair value exceeds its respective carrying value, then we conclude that no impairment has occurred. If the carrying value exceeds its fair value, we would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to the excess up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit or balance of the respective indefinite-lived intangible asset.     \nWe continuously monitor the performance of our other definite-lived intangible assets and evaluate for impairment when evidence exists that certain triggering events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Significant judgments and assumptions are required in such impairment evaluations. Definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets as this approximates the pattern in which the assets economic benefits are consumed. \nGoodwill impairments are recorded to goodwill impairment on the consolidated statements of operations whereas impairments of intangible assets are recorded to o\nther operating income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations\n.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe apply the equity method of accounting to investments that we do not control but where we exercise significant influence or VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary. We use the cumulative earnings approach for determining cash flow presentation of cash distributions received from equity method investments. Distributions received are included in our consolidated statements of cash flows as operating activities, unless the cumulative distributions exceed our portion of the cumulative equity in the net earnings of the equity method investment, in which case the excess distributions are deemed to be returns of the investment and are classified as investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\n See \nNote 3, \"Investments\"\n for further information regarding our equity method investments. There are no related parties that own interests in our equity method investments as of December 31, 2024.\n76\nTable of Contents\nDerivative Hedging Instruments\nWe use derivatives as part of our normal business operations to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange, commodity prices, production and packaging material costs and for other strategic purposes related to our core business. We enter into derivatives for risk management purposes only, including derivatives designated in hedge accounting relationships as well as those derivatives utilized as economic hedges. We do not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. We recognize our derivatives on the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value and classify them in either current or non-current assets or liabilities based on each contract's respective unrealized gain or loss position and each contract's respective maturity. Consistent with our policy, our current derivative agreements do not allow us to net positions with the same counterparty and therefore, we present our derivative positions gross on our consolidated balance sheets.\nChanges in fair values of outstanding cash flow and net investment hedges are recorded in OCI, until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the underlying hedged item or the sale of the underlying net investment, respectively. Effective cash flow hedges offset the gains or losses recognized on the underlying exposure in the consolidated statements of operations, or for net investment hedges, the foreign exchange translation gain or loss recognized in AOCI. Changes in fair value of outstanding fair value hedges and the offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged item are recognized in earnings. Changes in fair value of the derivative attributable to components allowed to be excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and recognized in earnings over the life of the hedge. \nWe record realized gains and losses from derivative instruments in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Changes in unrealized gains and losses for derivatives not designated in a hedge accounting relationship are recorded directly in earnings each period and are also recorded in the same financial statement line item as the hedged item/forecasted transaction. Cash flows from the settlement of derivatives, including both economic hedges and those designated in hedge accounting relationships, appear in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same categories as the cash flows of the hedged item unless the instruments are deemed to contain an other-than-insignificant financing element, in which case the cash flows related to this instrument will be classified as financing activities.\nIn accordance with authoritative accounting guidance, we do not record the fair value of derivatives for which we have elected the Normal Purchase Normal Sale (\"NPNS\") exemption. We account for these contracts on an accrual basis, recording realized settlements related to these contracts in the same financial statement line items as the corresponding transaction.\nLeases\nWe enter into contractual arrangements for the utilization of certain non-owned assets, primarily real estate and equipment, which are evaluated as finance or operating leases upon commencement and are accounted for accordingly. We assess whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. For all contractual arrangements deemed to be leases (other than short-term leases, which have a duration of one year or less), as of the lease commencement date, we recognize on the consolidated balance sheets a liability for our obligation related to the lease and a corresponding asset representing our right to use the underlying asset over the period of use. \nFor leases that qualify as short-term leases, we have elected, for all classes of underlying assets, to not apply the balance sheet recognition requirements of ASC 842, and instead, we recognize the lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have also made the election, for our existing real estate and equipment classes of underlying assets, to account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. \nOur leases have remaining lease terms of up to approximately \n15\n years. Certain of our lease agreements contain options to extend or early terminate the agreement. The lease term used to calculate the right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability at commencement includes the impacts of options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. When determining whether it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option at commencement, we consider various existing economic factors, including real estate strategies, the nature, length and terms of the agreement, as well as the uncertainty of the condition of leased equipment at the end of the lease term. Assumptions made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events requiring a lease modification. Additionally, for certain equipment leases involving groups of similar leased assets with similar lease terms, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease right-of-use assets and liabilities.\nThe discount rate used to calculate the present value of the future minimum lease payments is the rate implicit in the lease, when readily determinable. As the rate implicit in the lease is rarely readily determinable, we use our incremental borrowing rate relative to the leased asset in all other cases.\n77\nTable of Contents\nCertain of our leases include variable payments, primarily for items such as property taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with leased assets. These variable payments are excluded from the measurement of our lease assets and liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nLease-related expense is recorded within either COGS or MG&A expenses on the consolidated statements of operations, depending on the function of the underlying leased asset, with the exception of interest on finance lease liabilities, which is recorded within interest expense on the consolidated statements of operations.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\nWe maintain retirement plans for the majority of our employees. We offer different types of plans, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and OPEB plans. Each plan is managed locally and in accordance with respective local laws and regulations. BRI and BDL, two of our equity method investments, maintain defined benefit, defined contribution and OPEB plans as well. \nWe recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension and OPEB plan as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets. The funded status of a plan, measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation, and the related net periodic pension cost are calculated using a number of significant actuarial assumptions. Changes in net periodic pension cost and funding status may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions.\nWe use the fair value approach to calculate the market-related value of pension plan assets used to determine net periodic pension cost, which includes measuring the market-related value of plan assets at fair value for purposes of determining the expected return on plan assets and amount of gain or loss subject to amortization. \nProjected benefit obligation is the actuarial present value as of the measurement date of all benefits attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date using assumptions as to future compensation levels and years of service if the plan benefit formula is based on those future compensation levels and years of service. Accumulated benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of benefits (whether vested or unvested) attributed by the plan benefit formula to employee service rendered before the measurement date and based on employee service and compensation, if applicable, prior to that date. Accumulated benefit obligation differs from projected benefit obligation in that it includes no assumption about future compensation levels and years of service.\nWe employ the corridor approach for determining each plan's potential amortization from AOCI of deferred gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from estimates, into other pension and postretirement (benefit) cost, net. This approach defines the \"corridor\" as the greater of 10% of the projected benefit obligation or 10% of the market-related value of plan assets and requires amortization of the excess net gain or loss that exceeds the corridor over the average remaining service periods of active plan participants. For plans closed to new entrants and the future accrual of benefits, the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants (including retirees) is used.\n \nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nCertain of our noncontrolling interests have redemption features that are outside of our control, such as those subject to put options exercisable at a future date. We account for these as redeemable noncontrolling interests and present the balances outside of stockholders’ equity on the consolidated balance sheets. \nRedeemable NCI is recorded as the higher of the carrying value after accounting for attribution of net income (loss) or the redemption value. For preferred NCI shares and common NCI shares redeemable at an amount other than fair value, adjustments to redemption value, as appropriate, are recognized through net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interest on the consolidated statements of operations. For common NCI shares redeemable at fair value, adjustments to redemption value are recognized within equity.\n \n78\nTable of Contents\nOut of Period Adjustment\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we identified certain errors in the historical accounting for NCI with redemption features outside of our control under the terms of our CBPL partnership agreement and within certain other immaterial investments. Since the inception of these partnerships dating back to as early as 2002, we had historically accounted for the NCI within permanent equity with no adjustments to redemption value. Rather, our partners' shares should have been presented as redeemable NCI through the date of exercise of the redemption feature, with adjustments to the redemption value being recorded each reporting period as necessary. Furthermore, in March 2024, our CBPL partner exercised its put option requiring us to acquire their \n49.9\n% ownership interest. Since the exercise was irrevocable, the NCI became mandatorily redeemable at that time and should have been reclassified to accounts payable and other current liabilities. These errors resulted in a reclassification of $\n65\n million from noncontrolling interests, of which $\n49\n million was reclassified to accounts payable and other current liabilities for CBPL and $\n16\n million was reclassified to redeemable noncontrolling interests for the other immaterial investments in our consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the errors resulted in a cumulative understatement of $\n34.5\n million to net income attributable to NCI and a corresponding cumulative overstatement to net income attributable to MCBC in our consolidated statements of operations. The errors were corrected through an out of period adjustment as of and for the three months ended September 30, 2024. Management assessed the impact of the errors and deemed them to not be material to any prior periods or 2024 results. In October 2024, we obtained the final redemption value and as a result, during the third quarter of 2024, we recorded an adjustment of $\n45.8\n million to increase the mandatorily redeemable NCI liability prior to its final settlement, with the adjustment recorded to interest expense.\nOther\n \nthan the addition of redeemable noncontrolling interest discussed in \nNote 3, \"Investments\"\n there was no material activity to redeemable NCI for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, or 2022. \nFair Value Measurements\nThe carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximate fair value as recorded due to the short-term nature of these instruments. The fair value of derivatives is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows utilizing observable market interest, foreign exchange and commodity rates adjusted for non-performance credit risk associated with our counterparties (assets) or with MCBC (liabilities), as appropriate. See \nNote 10, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\"\n for additional information. Based on current market rates for similar instruments, the fair value of long-term debt is presented in \nNote 9, \"Debt.\"\nU.S. GAAP guidance for fair value includes a hierarchy that prioritizes fair value measurements based on the types of inputs used for the various valuation techniques (market approach, income approach and cost approach). Our financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1—Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date.\nLevel 2—Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are less active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that reflect the assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. We develop these inputs based on the best information available, including our own data.\nForeign Currency \nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies that are the functional currencies for the respective operations are translated at the prevailing exchange rate at the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are reported as a separate component of OCI. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in earnings for the period. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective period throughout the year.\nSubsequent Events\nEffective February 1, 2025, we obtained exclusive rights via a license agreement to produce, market and sell Fever-Tree products in the U.S. In connection with this agreement, we acquired the shares of the Fever-Tree USA, Inc. entity, with the immaterial acquisition to be accounted for as a business combination and consideration to be allocated primarily to working capital balances. Further, we made an investment of approximately $\n90\n million in Fever-Tree Drinks Plc, a listed entity on the London Stock Exchange (LSE:FEVR). The investment will be accounted for at fair value under ASC 321.\n79\nTable of Contents\nOn February 12, 2025, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $\n0.47\n per share, to be paid on March 14, 2025, to shareholders of Class A and Class B common stock of record on February 27, 2025. Shareholders of exchangeable shares will receive the CAD equivalent of dividends declared on Class A and Class B common stock.\n2. \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted \nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, S\negment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,\n authoritative guidance intended to improve reportable segment disclosures and to enhance disclosures about significant reportable segment expenses. The amendments require additional disclosures for both annual and interim periods including disclosures of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss as well as other segment items by reportable segment, among other disclosures. We adopted this guidance starting in this annual report. The adopted guidance impacted the presentation and disclosure of our segment reporting footnote but did not have an impact either on segment reporting identification or on our financial position or results of operations. See \nNote 18, \"Segment Reporting\"\n for further details.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, \nLiabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, \nauthoritative guidance intended to provide consistent and transparent disclosures for a buyer in a supplier finance program by requiring disclosures of key program terms, the amount of obligations that have been confirmed as valid with the finance provider that are deemed outstanding as of the end of the period, a description of the financial line item in which this unpaid balance resides and a rollforward of the obligations including the amount of obligations confirmed and paid. We adopted this guidance starting in the first quarter of 2023 with the exception of the rollforward disclosure requirement which was adopted prospectively starting in this annual report. See \nNote 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"\n for further details.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nIncome Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n, aimed at enhancing transparency in income statement disclosures by requiring entities to disclose additional disaggregated information about significant expenses. This guidance is effective for us starting with our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2027 and the subsequent interim periods, with prospective and retrospective application allowed and early adoption permitted. We are still assessing the impact of the ASU, including the timing and method of adoption, however, we expect the guidance to impact disclosures only and not to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, authoritative guidance intended to enhance transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. The amendments are focused on two specific disclosure areas: the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. More disaggregated income tax information, particularly at an individual jurisdiction level (country, state or local territory), is required in both disclosures if certain quantitative thresholds are met. The amendments to the rate reconciliation require the use of specific categories, with disclosure of percentages and reporting currency amounts. If not already evident, further explanation of the nature, effect and underlying causes of the reconciling items must be included. The amendments to the income taxes paid disclosure require reporting of net income taxes paid disaggregated by federal (national), state and foreign. This guidance is effective for us starting with our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2025. We have the option to apply the guidance prospectively or retrospectively and we are still considering which method to apply. When adopted, we expect the guidance to have an impact on disclosures only and to not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nOther than the items noted above, there have been no new accounting pronouncements not yet effective or adopted in the current year that we believe have a significant impact, or potential significant impact, to our consolidated financial statements.\n3. \nInvestments \nOur investments include both equity method and consolidated investments. Those entities identified as VIEs have been evaluated to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary. The VIEs included under \"Consolidated VIEs\" below are those for which we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and accordingly, we have consolidated these entities. We have not provided any financial support to any of our VIEs during the year ended December 31, 2024, that we were not previously contractually obligated to provide. Amounts due to and due from our equity method investments are recorded as affiliate accounts payable and affiliate accounts receivable which are presented within accounts payable and other current liabilities and trade receivables, net respectively on the consolidated balance sheets. See below under \"Affiliate Transactions\" for further details.\n80\nTable of Contents\nAuthoritative guidance related to the consolidation of VIEs requires that we continually reassess whether we are the primary beneficiary of VIEs in which we have an interest. As such, the conclusion regarding the primary beneficiary status is subject to change and we continually evaluate circumstances that could require consolidation or deconsolidation. Our consolidated VIEs are RMMC and RMBC as well as other immaterial entities. Our unconsolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2024 are BRI, BDL and TYC, as well as other immaterial investments.\nCobra U.K. was a historical consolidated VIE, however, during the year ended December 31, 2024, our partner exercised a put option under our partnership agreement which has resulted in our acquisition of the remaining \n49.9\n% ownership interest. The transaction was finalized on October 21, 2024, resulting in a cash payment of $\n89\n million which was recorded as a cash outflow from financing activities. See further discussion of this transaction in \nNote 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"\n.\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we sold our \n57.5\n% controlling interest in Truss to Tilray Brands for an immaterial amount and recognized a loss of $\n11\n million within other operating income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of operations upon deconsolidation of the business. During the second quarter of 2023, HEXO Corp, our joint venture partner in Truss, was acquired by Tilray Brands and this transaction had no impact on Molson Coors' ownership in the joint venture or on our consolidated results. Prior to the sale of our controlling interest, Truss was recorded as a consolidated VIE in the comparative periods presented.\nBoth BRI and BDL have outstanding third party debt which is guaranteed by their respective shareholders. As a result, we have a guarantee liability of $\n30.1\n million and $\n35.4\n million recorded as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, which is presented within accounts payable and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and represents our proportionate share of the outstanding balance of these debt instruments. The offset to the guarantee liability was recorded as an adjustment to our respective equity method investment within the consolidated balance sheets. The resulting change in our equity method investments during the year due to movements in the guarantee represents a non-cash investing activity.\nEquity Method Investments\nBRI\nBRI is a beer distribution and retail network for the Ontario region of Canada, with majority of the ownership residing with Molson Canada 2005, Labatt Breweries of Canada LP (a subsidiary of ABI) and Sleeman Breweries Ltd. (a subsidiary of Sapporo International). We hold a \n50.9\n% ownership interest in BRI. BRI charges the brewers service fees which are based on costs incurred, net of other revenues earned, and is allocated in accordance with the operating agreement to its owners based on volume of products sold in the Ontario market.\n \nAttributable income (loss) from our ownership of BRI is recorded to cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. Based on the existing structure, control is shared and we do not anticipate becoming the primary beneficiary in the foreseeable future. \nSee \"Affiliate Transactions\" below for BRI affiliate due to and due from balances as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to trade receivables and payables for sales to external customers and costs incurred by BRI offset by administrative fees charged and paid by MCBC (which may be in a payable or receivable position depending on the amount under or over charged).\nBDL\nBDL is a distribution operation owned by Molson Canada 2005 and Labatt Breweries of Canada LP (a subsidiary of ABI) that, pursuant to an operating agreement, acts as an agent for the distribution of their products in the western provinces of Canada. The \ntwo\n owners share equal voting control of this business. We hold a \n35.0\n% ownership interest in BDL.\nBDL charges the owners service fees that are designed so the entity operates at break-even profit levels and annually, operates on a cash neutral basis. This service fee is based on costs incurred, net of other revenues earned, and is allocated in accordance with the operating agreement to the owners based on volume of products sold in these provinces. Attributable income (loss) from our ownership of BDL is recorded to cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. See \"Affiliate Transactions\" section below for BDL affiliate due to and due from balances as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, related to trade receivables and payables for sales to external customers and costs incurred by BDL offset by administrative fees charged and paid by MCBC (which may be in a payable or receivable position depending on the amount under or over charged).\n81\nTable of Contents\nZOA\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we increased our investment in ZOA, an energy drink company operating in the U.S. and Canada, bringing our ownership interest to \n40\n%, on a fully diluted basis. The increase in ownership resulted in the transition of accounting for our investment from the fair value method under ASC 321 to equity method investment accounting under ASC 323 on a prospective basis and the cash outflow associated with the investment is reflected within other in the investing activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows. Subsequent to the investment, the carrying value of our recorded ownership investment exceeded our ratable portion of underlying equity in the net assets of ZOA and this basis difference was fully allocated to equity method goodwill. \nOn October 31, 2024, we cancelled our existing warrant to purchase additional shares in ZOA and instead entered into a separate subscription agreement. Through this new subscription agreement, we increased our investment in ZOA for cash consideration of $\n53\n million, bringing our ownership interest to \n51\n% subsequent to the closing of the transaction. We have recorded the transaction as a business combination, with ZOA included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition within the Americas reporting segment. The acquisition is aligned with our strategy to expand beyond beer.\nUpon consolidation, we recognized a gain of $\n77.9\n million in other operating income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations, representing the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our previously held equity interest on the acquisition date.\nThe acquisition resulted in the recognition of $\n275.5\n million of goodwill, which is partially deductible for tax purposes by the partnership members. Our share of the tax deductible goodwill is $\n47.2\n million. The goodwill is attributable to anticipated synergies from further leveraging of the Company’s distribution and supply chain network and scale. The acquisition also resulted in the recognition of $\n58.0\n million of a definite-lived brand intangible asset to be amortized over a \n15\n-year life, with the remainder primarily allocated to working capital balances and $\n44.4\n million of cash, of which $\n39.0\n million was related to investment proceeds retained by ZOA. Additionally, noncontrolling interest of $\n130.9\n million was recognized at fair value and is recorded as redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheets. Based on the contractual terms of the agreement, we have the ability to exercise a call option to purchase the shares of certain noncontrolling interest holders at fair value beginning in 2027. In the event we do not exercise our call option at the end of our call option window, these noncontrolling interest holders have a drag along right that would require us to sell our interest in ZOA along with their interest to a willing third party. \nThe fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest and our previously held equity interest was determined based on the estimated fair value of the shares at the time of the transaction, based on the utilization of an option pricing model for a hypothetical liquidation scenario and supported by the calculated enterprise value under a discounted cash flow method under the income approach, with estimated future cash flows of the entity discounted using a rate of return reflecting the entity’s presumed risk. As the inputs are not observable in the market, these represent Level 3 measurements.  \nPro forma results of operations have not been presented as the impact is not material to our results of operations or financial position.\nOther\nWe have certain other immaterial equity investments we enter into from time to time that align with our organizational strategies and growth initiatives.\nThe total balance of our equity method investments was $\n108.9\n million and $\n222.7\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Our equity method investments are all within the Americas segment and are included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are not considered significant for disclosure of financial information on either an individual or aggregated basis and there were no significant undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023, for any of these companies. We consider each of our equity method investments to be affiliates.\n82\nTable of Contents\nAffiliate Transactions\nAmounts due from and due to affiliates as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, are as follows:\nAmounts due from affiliates\nAmounts due to affiliates\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions)\nBRI\n$\n4.5\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1.6\n \nBDL\n1.9\n \n3.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \nOther\n7.4\n \n4.2\n \n6.3\n \n5.2\n \nTotal\n$\n13.8\n \n$\n7.4\n \n$\n6.3\n \n$\n6.8\n \nConsolidated VIEs\nCBPL was a consolidated VIE until the third quarter of 2024 upon acquisition of the remaining interest in the entity and Truss was a consolidated VIE until the third quarter of 2023 when the business was sold. \nRocky Mountain Metal Container\nRMMC, a Colorado limited liability company, is a joint venture with Ball Corporation in which we hold a \n50\n% interest. Our U.S. business has a can and end supply agreement with RMMC. Under this agreement, we purchase substantially all of the output of RMMC. RMMC manufactures cans and ends at our facilities, which RMMC is operating under a use and license agreement. As RMMC is a limited liability company (\"LLC\") classified as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, the income tax consequences flow to the joint venture partners. Beginning on December 31, 2026, Ball has an option to sell its ownership interest to us and we have the right to purchase Ball's interest. \nRocky Mountain Bottle Company\nRMBC, a Colorado limited liability company, is a joint venture with Owens-Brockway Glass Container, Inc. in which we hold a \n50\n% interest. Our U.S. business has a supply agreement with RMBC under which we agree to purchase output approximating the agreed upon annual plant capacity of RMBC. RMBC manufactures bottles at our facilities, which RMBC is operating under a lease agreement. As RMBC is classified as a partnership for U.S. tax purposes, the income tax consequences flow to the joint venture partners.\nThe following summarizes the assets and liabilities of our consolidated VIEs (including noncontrolling interests and excluding goodwill):\n \nAs of\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nTotal Assets\nTotal Liabilities\nTotal Assets\nTotal Liabilities\n \n(In millions)\nRMMC/RMBC\n$\n230.3\n \n$\n29.8\n \n$\n261.6\n \n$\n24.7\n \nOther\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2.8\n \n$\n3.3\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, for RMMC/RMBC, $\n64.0\n million and $\n113.6\n million were recorded in inventories, net and property, plant and equipment, net, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets.

The amount is also impacted by foreign exchange rates, as a significant amount of intangible assets, other than goodwill, are denominated in foreign currencies.\n85\nTable of Contents\nBased on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, the estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets for the next five years is as follows: \nYear\nAmount\n \n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n203.5\n \n2026\n$\n186.5\n \n2027\n$\n127.5\n \n2028\n$\n126.0\n \n2029\n$\n125.9\n \nAmortization expense of intangible assets was $\n206.4\n million, $\n207.3\n million and $\n208.1\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. This expense was primarily presented within MG&A in our consolidated statements of operations. \nAnnual 2024 Impairment Assessment\nWe completed our required annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of October 1, 2024, the first day of our fourth quarter, using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach in the determination of fair value and concluded that the fair value of the Americas reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value and therefore \nno\n goodwill impairment charge was recorded.\nThe fair value of the Americas reporting unit decreased in the current year primarily due to lower market multiples and lower forecasted cash flow projections, with the decreases largely driven by more challenging U.S. industry expectations. This was partially offset by a decrease to the discount rate as a result of fluctuations in the interest rate environment. Specifically, the discount rate used in developing our annual fair value estimates for the Americas reporting unit in the current year was \n8.25\n% based on market-specific factors, as compared to \n9.00\n% used as of the October 1, 2023 annual testing date. \nThe Americas reporting unit continues to be at a heightened risk of future impairment as the fair value exceeded its respective carrying value by less than \n15\n%. We continue to focus on growing our core power brand net sales, aggressively premiumizing our portfolio and scaling and expanding beyond beer. While progress has been made on these strategies over recent years, including the strengthening of our core brands, the growth targets included in management’s forecasted future cash flows are inherently at risk given that the strategies are still in progress. Additionally, the fair value determinations are sensitive to changes in the beer industry environment, broader macroeconomic conditions and market multiples or discount rates that could negatively impact future analyses, including the impacts of cost inflation, increases to interest rates and other external industry factors impacting our business. The key assumptions used to derive the estimated fair values of our reporting units represent Level 3 measurements.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets \nAs of the October 1, 2024 testing date, the fair values of the \nCoors \nbrands in the Americas (inclusive of our \nCoors\n brand in the U.S. and \nCoors\n distribution agreement in Canada), the \nMiller \nbrands in the U.S., the \nCarling \nbrands in the U.K. and the \nStaropramen \nbrands in EMEA&APAC are sufficiently in excess of their respective carrying values as of the annual testing date, with each having over \n15\n% cushion of fair value over book value.\nWe utilized Level 3 fair value measurements in our impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. An excess earnings approach is used to determine the fair values of these assets as of the testing date. The future cash flows used in the analysis are based on internal cash flow projections based on our long range plans and include significant assumptions by management as noted below. \nSeparately, we performed a qualitative assessment of our water rights indefinite-lived intangible assets in the U.S. to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair values of these assets were greater than their respective carrying amounts. Based on this qualitative assessment, we determined that a full quantitative analysis was not necessary.\n86\nTable of Contents\nKey Assumptions\nFair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. If our assumptions are not realized, it is possible that impairment charges may need to be recorded in the future. Examples of events or circumstances that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the underlying key assumptions and ultimately impact the estimated fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets may include such items as: (i) a decrease in expected future cash flows, specifically, an inability to execute on our strategic initiatives including our premiumization efforts or increase in costs driven by inflation or other factors that could significantly impact our immediate and long range results, a prolonged weakness in consumer demand or other competitive pressures adversely affecting our long-term volume trends, changes in trends and consumer preferences within the industry towards other brands or product categories, unfavorable working capital changes and an inability to successfully implement our cost savings initiatives, (ii) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions that significantly differ from our assumptions in timing and/or degree (such as a global pandemic, recession or evolving beer industry), (iii) significant unfavorable changes in tax rates, (iv) volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country-specific factors which could result in a higher weighted-average cost of capital, (v) sensitivity to market multiples and (vi) regulation limiting or banning the manufacturing, distribution or sale of alcoholic beverages.\nBased on known facts and circumstances, we evaluate and consider recent events and uncertain items, as well as related potential implications, as part of our annual assessment and incorporate them into the analyses as appropriate. These facts and circumstances are subject to change and may impact future analyses. For example, we continue to monitor the challenges within the beer industry for further weakening or additional systemic structural declines, as well as for adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions such as cost inflation and the potential impacts this may have on our immediate or long range results. We also continuously monitor the market inputs used in calculating our discount rates, including risk-free rates, equity premiums and our cost of debt, which could result in a meaningful change to our weighted-average cost of capital calculation, as well as the market multiples used in our impairment assessment. Substantial changes in any of these inputs could lead to a material impairment. Furthermore, increased volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country-specific factors, including, but not limited to, extended or future government intervention in response to inflation, could also result in a meaningful change to our weighted-average cost of capital calculation and other inputs used in our impairment assessment.\nAnnual 2023 Impairment Assessment\nWe completed our required annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis as of October 1, 2023 and concluded that the fair value of the Americas reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value amount and, therefore, \nno\n goodwill impairment charge was recorded.\nIn conjunction with the annual 2023 goodwill impairment analysis, we also evaluated the indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible assets within our Americas and EMEA&APAC reporting units and concluded that the carrying value of the \nStaropramen\n family of brands in EMEA&APAC was determined to be in excess of its fair value such that a partial impairment loss of $\n160.7\n million was recorded within other operating income (expense), net. The decline in fair value in 2023 was impacted by reductions in management forecasts as well as macroeconomic factors including an increase in the discount rate. No other impairments were recorded for our other indefinite-lived or definite-lived intangible assets. \nDefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Other Long-Lived Assets\nWe continuously monitor the performance of our definite-lived assets for potential triggering events suggesting an impairment review should be performed. Due to a reduction in forecasted cash flows associated with one of our asset groups, we identified this as a triggering event during the fourth quarter of 2024 and performed a recoverability test for the long-lived assets at the asset group level but concluded that the recoverability test passed and no impairment was recorded. No other material triggering events were identified in either the year ended December 31, 2024 or 2023 related to definite-lived intangible assets or other long-lived assets.\n87\nTable of

senior notes were issued in 2016 in order to partially fund the financing of the MillerCoors acquisition (USD Notes, EUR Notes and CAD Notes). Total remaining debt issuance costs capitalized in connection with these senior notes including underwriting fees, discounts and other financing related costs, were $\n24.0\n million as of December 31, 2024, and are being amortized over the respective and remaining terms. \n(3)\nWe entered into forward starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge interest rate volatility for a \n10-year\n period until the swaps were settled on September 18, 2015. We are amortizing a portion of the resulting loss from AOCI to interest expense over the remaining term of the CAD \n500\n million \n3.44\n% senior notes maturing July 2026 (\"2026 CAD notes\"), up to the full \n10-year\n term of the interest rate swaps. The amortizing loss resulted in an increase in our effective cost of borrowing compared to the stated coupon rates by \n0.4\n% on the 2026 CAD notes. See \nNote 10, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\"\n for further details on the forward starting interest rate swaps.\n(4)\nOn May 29, 2024, MCBC issued EUR \n800\n million \n3.8\n% senior notes with a maturity of June 15, 2032 (\"EUR 2032 Senior Notes\"). The issuance resulted in total proceeds of $\n863.7\n million, net of underwriting fees and discounts. Total debt discounts and debt issuance costs capitalized in connection with these senior notes, including underwriting fees, were approximately $\n7.1\n million and are being amortized over the term of the EUR 2032 Senior Notes. The EUR 2032 Senior Notes began accruing interest upon issuance, with interest payments due annually. Additionally, upon issuance we designated the EUR 2032 Senior Notes as a hedge of our investment in a EUR functional currency subsidiary. See \nNote 10, \"Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\"\n for further details. \n(5)\nOn May 3, 2012, we issued approximately $\n1.9\n billion of senior notes with $\n1.1\n billion remaining due in 2042. The total remaining debt issuance costs capitalized in connection with these senior notes, including the underwriting fees and discounts, were $\n7.8\n million as of December 31, 2024, and are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2042 senior notes.\n90\nTable of Contents\n(6)\nOur short-term borrowings include bank overdrafts, borrowings on our overdraft facilities and other items.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $\n13.0\n million in bank overdrafts and $\n59.0\n million in bank cash related to our cross-border, cross-currency cash pool for a net positive position of $\n46.0\n million. As of December 31, 2023, we had $\n16.5\n million in bank overdrafts and $\n75.5\n million in bank cash related to our cross-border, cross-currency cash pool for a net positive position of $\n59.0\n million.\nIn addition, we have CAD, GBP and USD overdraft facilities under which we had \nno\n outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023. \nA summary of our short-term facility availability is presented below. See \nNote 13, \"Commitments and Contingencies\"\n for further discussion related to letters of credit. \n•\nCAD unlimited overdraft facility at CAD Prime plus \n0.50\n%\n•\nGBP \n10\n million overdraft facility at GBP Base Rate plus \n2.25\n%\n•\nUSD \n10\n million overdraft facility at USD Prime plus \n5\n%\nDebt Fair Value Measurements\nWe utilize market approaches to estimate the fair value of certain outstanding borrowings by discounting anticipated future cash flows derived from the contractual terms of the obligations and observable market interest and foreign exchange rates. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the fair value of our outstanding long-term debt (including the current portion of long-term debt) was approximately $\n5.7\n billion and $\n5.9\n billion, respectively. All senior notes are valued based on significant observable inputs and classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying values of all other outstanding long-term borrowings and our short-term borrowings approximate their fair values and are also classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper\nOn June 3, 2024, we amended our existing $\n2.0\n billion multi-currency revolving credit facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date from June 26, 2028 to June 26, 2029. The amendment did not change the borrowing capacity of the revolving credit facility, which allows us to issue a maximum aggregate amount of $\n2.0\n billion in commercial paper or other borrowings at any time at variable interest rates. The $\n150\n million sub-facility available for the issuance of letters of credit remains unchanged. We use this facility from time to time to leverage cash needs to fund the repayment of debt upon maturity and for working capital or general purposes.\nWe had \nno\n borrowings drawn on the amended and restated multi-currency revolving credit facility and \nno\n commercial paper borrowings as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\nDebt Covenants\nUnder the terms of each of our debt facilities, we must comply with certain restrictions. These include customary events of default and specified representations, warranties and covenants, as well as covenants that restrict our ability to incur certain additional priority indebtedness (certain thresholds of secured consolidated net tangible assets), certain leverage threshold percentages, create or permit liens on assets, and restrictions on mergers, acquisitions and certain types of sale lease-back transactions. \nUnder the amended and restated $\n2.0\n billion revolving credit facility, we are required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio, calculated as net debt to EBITDA (as defined in the amended and restated multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement) of \n4.00\nx, measured as of the last day of each fiscal quarter through maturity of the credit facility. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we were in compliance with all of these restrictions and covenants, have met such financial ratios, and have met all debt payment obligations. All of our outstanding senior notes as of December 31, 2024, rank pari-passu. \n91\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024, the aggregate principal debt maturities of long-term debt and short-term borrowings excluding finance leases, based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, were as follows:\nYear\nAmount\n \n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n20.4\n \n2026\n2,350.0\n \n2027\n14.1\n \n2028\n0.5\n \n2029\n1.7\n \nThereafter\n3,730.8\n \nTotal\n$\n6,117.5\n \nThe future maturities of finance leases are disclosed in \nNote 8, \"Leases.\"\nInterest\n \nFor the years ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n \n(In millions)\nInterest incurred\n$\n295.1\n \n$\n243.4\n \n$\n257.4\n \nInterest capitalized\n(\n12.4\n)\n(\n9.4\n)\n(\n6.8\n)\nInterest expensed\n$\n282.7\n \n$\n234.0\n \n$\n250.6\n \n10. \nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nOverview and Risk Management Policies\nWe use derivatives as part of our normal business operations to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency, commodity price risk and for other strategic purposes related to our core business. We have established policies and procedures that govern the risk management of these exposures. Our primary objective in managing these exposures is to decrease the volatility of cash flows affected by changes in the underlying rates and prices. \nTo achieve our objectives, we enter into a variety of financial derivatives, including foreign currency exchange, commodity, interest rate, cross currency swaps as well as options. We also enter into physical hedging agreements directly with our suppliers to manage our exposure to certain commodities.\nCounterparty Risk\nWhile, by policy, the counterparties to any of the financial derivatives we enter into are major institutions with minimum investment grade credit ratings of BBB- by Standard & Poor's (or the equivalent) or Baa3 by Moody's, we are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties. This credit risk is generally limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts, should any of these counterparties fail to perform as contracted.\nWe have established a counterparty credit policy and guidelines that are monitored and reported to management to assist in managing this risk. As an additional measure, we utilize a portfolio of institutions either headquartered or operating in the same countries that we conduct our business. In calculating the fair value of our derivative balances, we also record an adjustment to recognize the risk of counterparty credit and our own non-performance risk, as appropriate.\nPrice and Liquidity Risks\nWe base the fair value of our derivative instruments upon market rates and prices. The volatility of these rates and prices are dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy. The current fair values of our contracts could differ significantly from the cash settled values with our counterparties. As such, we are exposed to price risk related to unfavorable changes in the fair value of our derivative contracts.\n92\nTable of Contents\nWe may be forced to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expected settlement date upon the occurrence of certain contractual triggers including a change of control, termination event or other breach of agreement. This could have a negative impact on our liquidity. For derivative contracts that we have designated as hedging instruments, early cash settlement would result in the timing of our hedge settlement not being matched to the cash settlement of the forecasted transaction or firm commitment. We may also decide to cash settle all or a portion of our derivative contracts before the expected settlement date through negotiations with our counterparties, which could also impact our cash position.\nDue to the nature of our counterparty agreements, we are not able to net positions with the same counterparty across business units. Thus, in the event of default, we may be required to early settle all out-of-the-money contracts, without the benefit of netting the fair value of any in-the-money positions against this exposure.\nCollateral\nWe do not receive and are not required to post collateral unless a change of control event occurs. This termination event would give either party the right to early terminate all outstanding swap transactions in the event that the other party consolidates, merges with, or transfers all or substantially all of its assets to, another entity, and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity that has assumed such party's obligations is materially weaker than that of such party. As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any collateral posted with any of our counterparties.\nDerivative Accounting Policies\nOverview\nOur forward starting interest rate swaps and most of our foreign currency forwards are designated in hedging relationships as cash flow hedges. In certain situations, we may execute derivatives that do not qualify for, or we do not otherwise seek, hedge accounting but are determined to be important for managing risk. For example, our commodity swaps and commodity options are not designated in hedge accounting relationships. These outstanding economic hedges are measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. We have historically elected to apply the NPNS exemption to certain contracts, as applicable. These contracts are typically transacted with our suppliers and include risk management features that allow us to fix the price on specific volumes of purchases for specified delivery periods. We also consider whether any provisions in our contracts represent embedded derivative instruments as defined in authoritative accounting guidance and apply the appropriate accounting. \nHedge Accounting Policies\nWe formally document all relationships receiving hedge accounting treatment between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions pursuant to prescribed guidance. We also formally assess effectiveness both at the hedge's inception and on an ongoing basis, specifically whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in mitigating the risk designated as being hedged and whether those hedges may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. Specific to net investment hedges, we have elected to use the spot-to-spot methodology to assess effectiveness.\nWe discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when (i) the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a forecasted future transaction; (ii) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised; (iii) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; (iv) management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate; or (v) management decides to cease hedge accounting.\nWhen we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively, but it continues to be probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the originally expected period, the existing gain or loss on the derivative remains in AOCI for cash flow hedges and net investment hedges or in the carrying value of the hedged item for fair value hedges and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will no longer occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses in AOCI are recognized immediately in earnings. In all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding, we carry the derivative at its fair value on the consolidated balance sheets until maturity, recognizing future changes in the fair value in current period earnings.\n93\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Derivative/Hedge Positions\nNet Investment Hedges\nOn May 29, 2024, we issued EUR \n800\n million \n3.8\n% senior notes maturing June 15, 2032. Concurrent with the issuance of these senior notes, we designated the principal of the senior notes as a net investment hedge of our investment in a EUR functional currency subsidiary in order to hedge a portion of the related foreign currency translational impacts and, accordingly, we have and will continue to record the changes in the carrying value due to fluctuations in the spot rate to AOCI. See \nNote 9, \"Debt\"\n for further discussion of the EUR \n800\n million \n3.8\n% senior notes. \nIn 2016, we issued EUR \n800\n million \n1.25\n% senior notes which matured on July 15, 2024, to partially fund the MillerCoors acquisition. Concurrent with the issuance of these senior notes, we designated the principal of the senior notes as a net investment hedge of our investment in our Europe business in order to hedge a portion of the foreign currency translational impacts and, accordingly, recorded the changes in the carrying value due to fluctuations in the spot rate to AOCI until it was de-designated on May 29, 2024. Upon de-designation, the associated net investment hedge was discontinued. The accumulated gains and losses associated with the settled net investment hedge will remain in AOCI until a liquidation or deconsolidation event at which point the accumulated gains and losses will be reclassified into earnings.\nForward Starting Interest Rate Swaps\nDuring 2018, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional amount totaling $\n1.5\n billion with termination dates of July 2021, May 2022 and July 2026. The swaps had effective dates mirroring the terms of the forecasted debt issuances. Under the agreements, we are required to early terminate these swaps at the time we expect to issue the related forecasted debt. We designated these contracts as cash flow hedges. As a result, the unrealized mark-to-market gains or losses are recorded to AOCI until termination at which point the realized gain or loss of these swaps at issuance of the hedged debt are reclassified from AOCI and amortized to interest expense over the term of the hedged debt. \nIn June 2021, we early terminated our $\n250.0\n million forward starting interest rate swap that was originally set to terminate in July 2021. This forward starting interest rate swap was rolled forward to May 2022 through a cashless settlement. The new May 2022 forward starting interest rate swap was incremental to our existing May 2022 forward starting interest rate swap that was executed in 2018, both of which were hedging our forecasted debt issuance expected to occur during 2022. In late April 2022, the forward starting interest rate swaps associated with the $\n500\n million \n3.5\n% senior notes that we repaid upon maturity on May 1, 2022 were terminated and settled. The immaterial loss on settlement of the swaps was recorded through interest expense during the second quarter of 2022.\nIn 2015, we entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with a notional of CAD \n600\n million in order to manage our exposure to the volatility of interest rates associated with the future interest payments on the forecasted CAD debt issuances. The swaps had a termination date of September 2025 mirroring the terms of initially forecasted CAD debt issuances. Under these agreements, we were required to early terminate these swaps at the approximate time we issued the previously forecasted debt. We designated these swaps as cash flow hedges and accordingly, a portion of the CAD \n39.2\n million ($\n29.5\n million at settlement) loss on the swaps was reclassified from AOCI and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the 2026 CAD senior notes up to the full \n10-year\n term of the swaps. Additionally, in 2023 we repaid our CAD \n500\n million \n2.84\n% senior notes upon maturity which resulted in an acceleration of amortization of the loss for an immaterial amount. The remaining unamortized portion of the loss in AOCI as of December 31, 2024, was $\n2.4\n million. \nForeign Currency Forwards\nWe have financial foreign exchange forward contracts in place to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. We hedge foreign currency exposure related to certain royalty agreements, exposure associated with the purchase of production inputs and imports that are denominated in currencies other than the entity's functional currency and certain other foreign exchanges exposures. These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency transactions. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge these future forecasted transactions up to a \n60\n month horizon. \nIn the second quarter of 2023, we entered into approximately CAD \n260\n million (approximately $\n195\n million USD) of foreign exchange forward contracts to manage our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations related to the repayment of our CAD \n500\n million \n2.84\n% senior notes that matured on July 15, 2023. These contracts were not designated in hedge accounting relationships; as such, changes in the fair value were recorded in other non-operating income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. These contracts settled on July 12, 2023 in advance of the senior notes repayment for an immaterial amount.\n94\nTable of Contents\nCommodity Swaps and Options\nWe have financial commodity swap and option contracts in place to hedge changes in the prices of natural gas, aluminum, including surcharges relating to our aluminum exposures, barley and diesel. These contracts allow us to swap our floating exposure to changes in these commodity prices for a fixed rate. These contracts are not designated in hedge accounting relationships. As such, changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations. We hedge forecasted purchases of natural gas, aluminum and diesel each up to \n60\n months out in the future for use in our supply chain, in line with our risk management policy. Further, we hedge forecasted purchases of barley based on crop year and physical inventory management. For purposes of measuring segment operating performance, the unrealized changes in fair value of the swaps not designated in hedge accounting relationships are reported in Unallocated outside of the segment specific operating results until such time that the exposure we are managing is realized. At that time, we reclassify the gain or loss from Unallocated to the respective operating segment, allowing our operating segments to realize the economic effects of the derivative without the resulting unrealized mark-to-market volatility.\nDerivative Fair Value Measurements\nWe utilize market approaches to estimate the fair value of our derivative instruments by discounting anticipated future cash flows derived from the derivative's contractual terms and observable market interest, foreign exchange and commodity rates. The fair values of our derivatives also include credit risk adjustments to account for our counterparties' credit risk, as well as our own non-performance risk, as appropriate.\nThe table below summarizes our derivative assets and (liabilities) that were measured at fair value as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.

Depending on the location and benefit program, we provide either defined benefit pension or defined contribution plans to our employees. Each plan is managed locally and in accordance with respective local laws and regulations. We have defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. Additionally, we offer OPEB plans to a portion of our Canadian, U.S. and Central European employees which are unfunded plans. Our equity method investments, BRI and BDL, maintain defined benefit, defined contribution and postretirement benefit plans as well; however, those plans are excluded from this disclosure as BRI and BDL are not consolidated entities. \nFurther, in the U.S., we participate in and make contributions to multi-employer pension plans. Contributions to multi-employer pension plans were $\n3.7\n million, $\n4.1\n million and $\n3.6\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, the U.S. postretirement health plan qualifies for the federal subsidy under the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (“the Act”) because the prescription drug benefits provided under our postretirement health plan for Medicare eligible retirees generally require lower premiums from covered retirees and have lower co-payments and deductibles than the benefits provided in Medicare Part D and, accordingly, are actuarially equivalent to or better than the benefits provided under the Act. The benefits paid, including prescription drugs, were $\n31.1\n million, $\n31.2\n million and $\n33.0\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There were no subsidies received for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n97\nTable of Contents\nCurrent Year Annuity Contract Purchases \nOn September 26, 2024, we purchased annuity contracts for \ntwo\n of our Canadian pension plans which transferred approximately $\n344\n million of pension plan liabilities, along with the associated administration of benefits, to an insurance company using the plan's respective pension plan assets. These transactions had no impact on the amount, timing or form of the retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. As a result of the transaction, we reduced the respective pension plan liabilities and assets and remeasured any remaining pension plan liabilities and assets using updated actuarial assumptions. We elected the practical expedient to perform the remeasurement as of the nearest calendar month-end date, which was September 30, 2024. A total settlement loss of $\n34.0\n million was recorded to other pension and postretirement benefit (costs), net in the consolidated statements of operations during the third quarter of 2024.

December 31, 2022, primarily consisted of a settlement loss of $\n8.0\n million that was recorded as a result of the annuity purchase for a certain Canadian pension plan, partially offset by a

Obligations under the OPEB plans are determined by the application of the terms of medical, dental, vision and life insurance plans, together with relevant actuarial assumptions and health care cost trend rates. \nThe weighted-average rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation for defined pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for OPEB plans, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, were as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\nPension\nOPEB\nPension\nOPEB\nWeighted-average assumptions\nDiscount rate\n5.41\n%\n5.15\n%\n4.74\n%\n4.64\n%\nRate of compensation increase\n2.00\n%\nN/A\n2.00\n%\nN/A\nHealth care cost trend rate\nN/A\nRanging ratably from \n7.00\n% in 2025 to \n3.57\n% in 2040\nN/A\nRanging ratably from \n6.75\n% in 2024 to \n3.57\n% in 2040\nThe change to the weighted-average discount rates used for our defined benefit pension plans and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2024, from December 31, 2023, was primarily due to an increase in interest rates in 2024, particularly for our U.S. and U.K. plans.\nInvestment Strategy\nThe obligations of our defined benefit pension plans in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. are supported by assets held in trusts for the payment of future benefits. The business segments are obligated to adequately fund these asset trusts. The underlying investments within our defined benefit pension plans include cash and short-term instruments, debt securities, investment funds and other investments. Investment allocations reflect the customized strategies of the respective plans.\n100\nTable of Contents\nThe plans use liability driven investment strategies in managing defined pension benefits. For all defined benefit pension plan assets, the plans have the following primary investment objectives:\n(1)\noptimize the long-term return on plan assets at an acceptable level of risk and manage projected future cash contributions;\n(2)\nmaintain a broad diversification across asset classes and among investment managers; and\n(3)\nmanage the risk level of the plans' assets in relation to the plans' liabilities.\nEach plan's respective allocation targets promote optimal expected return and volatility characteristics given a focus on a long-term time horizon for fulfilling the plans' obligations. All assets are managed by external investment managers with an intent to either match or outperform their benchmark. The plans use different asset managers in the U.S., U.K. and Canada and each plan's respective asset allocation could be impacted by a change in asset managers. \nOur investment strategies for our defined benefit pension plans also consider the funded status for each plan. For defined benefit pension plans that are highly funded, assets are invested primarily in fixed income holdings that have a similar duration to the associated liabilities. For plans with lower funding levels, the fixed income component is managed in a similar manner to the highly funded plans. In addition to this liability-matching fixed income allocation, these plans also contain exposure to return generating assets including: equities, real estate, debt and other investments held with the goal of producing higher returns, which may also have a higher risk profile. These investments are diversified by investing globally with limitations placed on issuer concentration.\nBoth our Canadian and U.K. plans hedge a portion of the foreign exchange exposure between plan assets that are not denominated in the local plan currency and the local currency as the Canadian and U.K. pension liabilities will be settled in CAD and GBP, respectively.\nTarget Allocations\nThe following compares target asset allocation percentages with actual asset allocations on a weighted-average asset basis as of December 31, 2024.\n \nTarget\nallocations\nActual\nallocations\nEquities\n6.1\n%\n6.4\n%\nFixed income\n75.4\n%\n72.7\n%\nReal estate\n4.1\n%\n4.1\n%\nAnnuities and longevity swap\n13.7\n%\n13.7\n%\nOther\n0.7\n%\n3.1\n%\nSignificant Concentration Risks\nWe periodically evaluate our defined benefit pension plan assets for concentration risks. As of December 31, 2024, we did not have any individual underlying asset position that composed a significant concentration of each plan's overall assets. However, we currently have significant plan assets invested in U.K., U.S. and Canadian government fixed income holdings. A provisional credit rating downgrade for any of these governments could negatively impact the asset values.\nFurther, as our benefit plans maintain exposure to non-government investments, a significant system-wide increase in credit spreads would also negatively impact the plan asset values. In general, equity and fixed income risks have been mitigated by company-specific concentration limits and by utilizing multiple equity managers. We do have significant amounts of assets invested with individual fixed income and hedge fund managers, therefore, the plans use outside investment consultants to aid in the oversight of these managers and fund performance.\nValuation Techniques\nWe use a variety of industry accepted valuation techniques to value our plan assets. The techniques vary depending upon instrument type. Whenever possible, we prioritize the use of observable market data in our valuation processes. We use market, income and cost approaches to value our plan assets as of period end. See \nNote 1, \"Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\"\n for additional information on our fair value methodologies and accounting policies. We have not changed our fair value techniques used to value plan assets this year.\n101\nTable of Contents\nMajor Categories of Plan Assets\nAs of December 31, 2024, our major categories of plan assets included the following:\n•\nCash and short-term instruments—Includes cash, trades awaiting settlement, bank deposits, short-term bills and short-term notes. Our \"trades awaiting settlement\" category includes payables and receivables associated with asset purchases and sales that are awaiting final cash settlement as of year end due to the use of trade date accounting for our pension plans assets. These payables normally settle within a few business days of the purchase or sale of the respective asset. We include these items in Level 1 of this hierarchy, as the values are derived from quoted prices in active markets. Short-term instruments are included in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as these are highly liquid instruments that are valued using observable inputs, but their asset values are not publicly quoted.\n•\nDebt securities—Includes various government and corporate fixed income securities, interest and inflation-linked assets such as bonds and swaps, collateralized securities and other debt securities. The majority of the plans' fixed income assets trade on \"over the counter\" exchanges, which provides observable inputs that are the primary data used to determine each individual investment's fair value. We also use independent pricing vendors, as well as matrix pricing techniques. Matrix pricing uses observable data from other similar investments as the primary input to determine the individual security's fair value. Government and corporate fixed income securities are generally classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using observable inputs. Assets included in our collateralized securities include mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, which are considered Level 3 due to the use of the significant unobservable inputs in deriving these assets' fair values.\n•\nAnnuities and longevity swap—Includes assets to mitigate risks of certain plans including buy-in annuities and longevity swap insurance contracts. Non-participating annuity buy-in insurance policies are purchased to mitigate volatility in cash flows associated with a portion of covered plan members. The fair value of non-participating contracts fluctuate based on changes in the obligation associated with covered plan members. The longevity swap insurance contract alleviates risk from fluctuations in estimated life expectancy of covered participants. The fair value of the longevity swap insurance contract is calculated by taking the present value of the expected cash flows from the floating leg on a prevailing market best estimate of mortality, including market views of fees, less the present value of the fixed leg payments that the plan is required to make under the contract including the contractual fees. The prevailing market best estimate of mortality is determined based on the effect of actual plan mortality experience of covered participants, a revised view on future improvements in mortality rates and a view on how risk fees have changed for this type of contract since inception. These values are considered Level 3 due to the use of the significant unobservable inputs used in deriving the asset's fair value.\n•\nOther—Includes repurchase agreements, recoverable taxes for taxes paid and awaiting reclaim due to the tax exempt nature of the pension plan and private equity. Repurchase agreements are agreements where our plan has created an asset exposure using borrowed assets, creating a repurchase agreement liability, to facilitate the trade. The assets associated with the repurchase agreement are included in the other category in the fair value hierarchy, and the corresponding repurchase agreement liability is classified as Level 1 in the hierarchy, as the liability is valued using quoted prices in active markets. When determining the presentation of our target and asset allocations for repurchase agreements, we are viewing the asset type, as opposed to the investment vehicle, and accordingly include the associated assets within fixed income, specifically interest and inflation linked assets. We include recoverable tax items in Level 1 of this hierarchy, as these are cash receivables and the values are derived from quoted prices in active markets. Private equity is included in Level 3 as the values are based upon the use of unobservable inputs.\n•\nNAV per share practical expedient—Includes our debt funds, equity funds, hedge funds, real estate fund holdings and private equity funds. The market values for these funds are based on the net asset values multiplied by the number of shares owned. \n102\nTable of Contents\nFair Value Hierarchy\nThe following presents our fair value hierarchy for our defined benefit pension plan assets excluding investments using the NAV per share practical expedient (in millions):\n \n \nFair value measurements as of December 31, 2024\n \nTotal as of\nDecember 31, 2024\nQuoted prices\nin active\nmarkets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nobservable\ninputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nunobservable\ninputs\n(Level 3)\nCash and cash equivalents\n \n \n \n \nCash\n$\n42.6\n \n$\n42.6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nBank deposits, short-term bills and notes\n40.5\n \n—\n \n40.5\n \n—\n \nDebt\nGovernment debt securities\n290.6\n \n—\n \n290.6\n \n—\n \nInterest and inflation linked assets\n415.0\n \n—\n \n402.7\n \n12.3\n \nAnnuities and longevity swap\nBuy-in annuities and longevity swap\n373.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n373.6\n \nOther\nRepurchase agreements\n(\n244.2\n)\n(\n244.2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nRecoverable taxes\n0.1\n \n0.1\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPrivate equity\n5.7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n5.7\n \nTotal fair value of investments excluding NAV per share practical expedient\n$\n923.9\n \n$\n(\n201.5\n)\n$\n733.8\n \n$\n391.6\n \nThe following presents our total fair value of plan assets including the NAV per share practical expedient for our defined benefit pension plan assets:\nTotal as of\nDecember 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nFair value of investments excluding NAV per share practical expedient\n$\n923.9\n \nFair value of investments using NAV per share practical expedient\nDebt funds\n1,266.2\n \nEquity funds\n175.7\n \nReal estate funds\n82.3\n \nPrivate equity funds\n28.8\n \nHedge funds\n250.5\n \nTotal fair value of plan assets\n$\n2,727.4\n \n103\nTable of Contents\nThe following presents our fair value hierarchy for our defined benefit pension plan assets excluding investments using the NAV per share practical expedient (in millions):\n \n \nFair value measurements as of December 31, 2023\n \nTotal as of\nDecember 31, 2023\nQuoted prices\nin active\nmarkets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant\nobservable\ninputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant\nunobservable\ninputs\n(Level 3)\nCash and cash equivalents\n \n \n \n \nCash\n$\n39.5\n \n$\n39.5\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nBank deposits, short-term bills and notes\n26.4\n \n—\n \n26.4\n \n—\n \nDebt\nGovernment debt securities\n452.3\n \n—\n \n452.3\n \n—\n \nCorporate debt securities\n119.3\n \n—\n \n119.3\n \n—\n \nInterest and inflation linked assets\n629.9\n \n—\n \n616.0\n \n13.9\n \nCollateralized debt securities\n0.3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n0.3\n \nAnnuities and longevity swap\nBuy-in annuities and longevity swap\n449.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n449.8\n \nOther\nRepurchase agreements\n(\n285.8\n)\n(\n285.8\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nRecoverable taxes\n0.2\n \n0.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPrivate equity\n10.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n10.6\n \nTotal fair value of investments excluding NAV per share practical expedient\n$\n1,442.5\n \n$\n(\n246.1\n)\n$\n1,214.0\n \n$\n474.6\n \nThe following presents our fair value hierarchy including the NAV per share practical expedient for our defined benefit pension plan assets:\nTotal as of\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions)\nFair value of investments excluding NAV per share practical expedient\n$\n1,442.5\n \nFair value of investments using NAV per share practical expedient\nDebt funds\n1,263.9\n \nEquity funds\n260.7\n \nReal estate funds\n126.3\n \nPrivate equity funds\n37.8\n \nHedge funds\n265.7\n \nTotal fair value of plan assets\n$\n3,396.9\n \n104\nTable of Contents\nFair Value: Level Three Rollforward\nThe following presents our Level 3 Rollforward for our defined pension plan assets excluding investments using the NAV per share practical expedient.\nAmount\n(In millions)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n487.0\n \nTotal gain or loss (realized/unrealized)\n \nRealized gain (loss)\n—\n \nUnrealized gain (loss) included in AOCI\n(\n34.2\n)\nPurchases, issuances, settlements\n(\n2.7\n)\nForeign exchange translation (loss) gain\n24.5\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n474.6\n \nTotal gain or loss (realized/unrealized)\n \nRealized gain (loss)\n1.2\n \nUnrealized gain (loss) included in AOCI\n(\n70.8\n)\nPurchases, issuances, settlements\n(\n5.4\n)\nForeign exchange translation (loss) gain\n(\n8.0\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n391.6\n \nExpected Cash Flows\nDefined benefit pension plan contributions in future years will vary based on a number of factors, including actual plan asset returns and interest rates. We fund pension plans to meet the requirements set forth in applicable employee benefits laws. We took and continue to take steps to reduce our exposure to our pension obligations. Such steps include the closure of the U.K. and U.S. pension plans to future earnings of service credit, benefit modifications in certain Canada plans and the entering into of buy-in and buy-out contracts for certain plans. We may also voluntarily increase funding levels to meet financial goals. Our U.K. pension plan is subject to a statutory valuation for funding purposes every \nthree years\n. The most recent valuation as of June 30, 2022, indicated that the plan does not have a funding deficit relative to the plan's statutory funding objective, and therefore, no MCBC contributions are currently required.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2025, we expect to make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of approximately $\n4\n million and benefit payments under our OPEB plans of approximately $\n38\n million based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, we anticipate utilizing approximately $\n9\n million of surplus from certain Canadian defined benefit pension plans to fund employer contributions to certain Canadian defined contribution plans. Plan funding strategies are influenced by employee benefits, tax laws and plan governance documents.\nExpected future benefit payments for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans for the next ten years, based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, are as follows:\nExpected benefit payments\nPension\nOPEB\n \n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n206.9\n \n$\n37.6\n \n2026\n194.6\n \n37.4\n \n2027\n194.8\n \n37.3\n \n2028\n196.0\n \n37.2\n \n2029\n197.6\n \n36.8\n \n2030-2034\n1,008.2\n \n178.5\n \n105\nTable of Contents\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe offer defined contribution plans for the majority of our U.S., Canadian and U.K. employees. The investment strategy for defined contribution plans are determined by each individual participant from the options we have made available as the plan sponsor. U.S. non-union employees are eligible to participate in qualified defined contribution plans which provide for employer contributions ranging from \n5\n% to \n11\n% of eligible compensation (certain employees were also eligible for additional employer contributions). In addition, U.S. union employees are eligible to participate in a qualified defined contribution plan which provides for employer contributions based on factors associated with various collective bargaining agreements. The employer contributions to the U.K. plans can range up to \n10\n% of employee compensation and in Canada plans range from \n4\n% to \n10\n%. Both employee and employer contributions are made in cash in accordance with participant investment elections. \nWe recognized costs associated with defined contribution plans of $\n89.6\n million, $\n76.8\n million and $\n73.0\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn addition, we have other deferred compensation and nonqualified defined contribution plans. We have voluntarily funded these liabilities through rabbi trusts. These assets are invested in publicly traded mutual funds whose performance is expected to closely match changes in the plan liabilities. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the plan liabilities were equal to the plan assets and were included in other liabilities and other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, respectively.\n \n12. \nIncome Tax\nOur income (loss) before income taxes on which the provision for income taxes was computed was as follows:\n \nFor the years ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n \n(In millions)\nDomestic\n$\n1,398.3\n \n$\n1,486.0\n \n$\n228.4\n \nForeign\n104.7\n \n(\n233.5\n)\n(\n290.9\n)\nTotal\n$\n1,503.0\n \n$\n1,252.5\n \n$\n(\n62.5\n)\nThe components of the provision for income taxes were as follows:\n \nFor the years ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n \n(In millions)\nCurrent\n \n \n \nFederal\n$\n152.1\n \n$\n200.7\n \n$\n146.1\n \nState\n21.2\n \n22.1\n \n22.3\n \nForeign\n54.5\n \n37.3\n \n(\n17.2\n)\nTotal current tax (benefit) expense\n$\n227.8\n \n$\n260.1\n \n$\n151.2\n \nDeferred\n \n \n \nFederal\n$\n109.7\n \n$\n75.0\n \n$\n56.4\n \nState\n13.3\n \n27.8\n \n(\n26.2\n)\nForeign\n(\n5.5\n)\n(\n66.8\n)\n(\n57.4\n)\nTotal deferred tax (benefit) expense\n$\n117.5\n \n$\n36.0\n \n$\n(\n27.2\n)\nTotal income tax (benefit) expense\n$\n345.3\n \n$\n296.1\n \n$\n124.0\n \n106\nTable of Contents\n \nA reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate was as follows:\n \nFor the years ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n($ in millions)\nStatutory federal income tax rate\n21.0\n \n%\n$\n315.7\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n263.0\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n(\n13.1\n)\nState income taxes, net of federal benefits\n1.3\n \n%\n19.0\n \n2.4\n \n%\n30.6\n \n6.1\n \n%\n(\n3.8\n)\nEffect of foreign tax rates\n(\n1.2\n)\n%\n(\n17.9\n)\n(\n2.4\n)\n%\n(\n30.5\n)\n92.6\n \n%\n(\n57.9\n)\nEffect of foreign tax law and rate changes\n(\n0.1\n)\n%\n(\n1.0\n)\n0.9\n \n%\n11.5\n \n(\n0.8\n)\n%\n0.5\n \nEffect of unrecognized tax benefits\n0.7\n \n%\n11.3\n \n0.8\n \n%\n9.5\n \n(\n20.5\n)\n%\n12.8\n \nChange in valuation allowance\n1.3\n \n%\n19.6\n \n0.2\n \n%\n2.5\n \n1.1\n \n%\n(\n0.7\n)\nAcquisition related permanent items\n(\n0.2\n)\n%\n(\n3.2\n)\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \nGoodwill impairment\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n—\n \n(\n287.0\n)\n%\n179.3\n \nOther, net\n0.2\n \n%\n1.8\n \n0.7\n \n%\n9.5\n \n(\n10.9\n)\n%\n6.9\n \nEffective tax rate / Tax (benefit) expense\n23.0\n \n%\n$\n345.3\n \n23.6\n \n%\n$\n296.1\n \n(\n198.4\n)\n%\n$\n124.0\n \nThe higher effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 when compared to the U.S federal statutory rate was primarily related to the impact of a valuation allowance that was recorded on deferred tax assets as a result of the sale of certain U.S. craft businesses in the third quarter of 2024. The sale resulted in the realization of a capital loss for U.S. federal tax purposes. We believe it is unlikely that the deferred tax asset generated by the capital loss will be recognized, and as a result, a $\n20.0\n million valuation allowance was recorded. The effective tax rate was further impacted by the net effect of acquisition-related permanent items, including: (i) the non-taxable gain of $\n77.9\n million recognized upon the consolidation of ZOA in the fourth quarter of 2024, and (ii) the $\n45.8\n million of non-deductible interest expense recorded in the third quarter of 2024 to increase the mandatorily redeemable NCI liability of CBPL to the final redemption value.\nThe higher effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 when compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate was not significant and was due to the impacts of state income taxes, foreign tax rates and the impact of a foreign statutory tax rate change enacted in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nThe lower effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 when compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate was primarily due to the impact of the $\n845.0\n million partial goodwill impairment, recorded within our Americas segment in the fourth quarter of 2022, which related to goodwill not deductible for tax purposes.\nRecently, intergovernmental entities such as the Organization for Economic Development (\"OECD\") and European Union (\"EU\") have proposed changes to the existing tax laws of member countries, including model rules introduced by the OECD for a new 15% global minimum tax. In December 2022, the EU member states agreed to incorporate the 15% global minimum tax into their respective domestic laws effective for fiscal years beginning on or after December 31, 2023. In addition, several non-EU countries, including Canada and the U.K., have proposed and/or adopted legislation consistent with the OECD global minimum tax framework. The global minimum tax, which is now effective in countries with enacted legislation, did not materially impact our financial or cash tax position in the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. We continue to evaluate the impact on future periods as previously-enacting countries issue related guidance and additional countries consider adoption of the global minimum tax rules.\nOur foreign businesses operate in jurisdictions with statutory income tax rates that differ from the U.S. federal statutory rate. Specifically, the statutory income tax rates in the countries in Europe in which we operate range from \n9\n% to \n25.8\n%, and Canada has a combined federal and provincial statutory income tax rate of approximately \n26\n%. \n107\nTable of Contents\n \nAs of\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n(In millions)\nDeferred tax assets\n \nCompensation-related obligations\n$\n47.1\n \n$\n43.2\n \nPension and postretirement benefits\n14.2\n \n23.7\n \nTax credit carryforwards\n37.8\n \n36.0\n \nTax loss carryforwards\n305.3\n \n312.8\n \nAccrued liabilities and other\n216.4\n \n202.5\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n79.9\n)\n(\n61.9\n)\nDeferred tax assets\n$\n540.9\n \n$\n556.3\n \nDeferred tax liabilities\n \n \nFixed assets\n348.6\n \n354.9\n \nPartnerships and investments\n44.9\n \n38.7\n \nIntangible assets\n2,738.3\n \n2,679.9\n \nDerivative instruments\n42.3\n \n12.2\n \nAccrued liabilities and other\n13.4\n \n—\n \nDeferred tax liabilities\n$\n3,187.5\n \n$\n3,085.7\n \nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$\n2,646.6\n \n$\n2,529.4\n \nOur deferred tax valuation allowances are primarily the result of uncertainties regarding the future realization of recorded tax benefits on tax loss carryforwards from operations in various jurisdictions. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if, based upon available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We have evaluated the realizability of our deferred tax assets in each jurisdiction by assessing the adequacy of expected taxable income, including the reversal of existing temporary differences, historical and projected operating results and the availability of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Based on this analysis, we have determined that the valuation allowances recorded in each period presented are appropriate. The higher valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2024 related to the realization of a capital loss for U.S. federal tax purposes following the sale of certain of our U.S. craft businesses. We believe it is unlikely that the capital loss will be recognized, and as a result, a $\n20.0\n million valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset was recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have deferred tax assets for U.S. tax loss and credit carryforwards that expire between 2025 and 2044 of $\n90.6\n million and U.S. tax losses that may be carried forward indefinitely of $\n14.0\n million. We have foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards that expire between 2025 and 2044 of $\n189.5\n million and foreign tax losses that may be carried forward indefinitely of $\n40.2\n million.\nThe following table presents our net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\n \nAs of\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n(In millions)\nDomestic deferred tax liabilities\n$\n2,184.0\n \n$\n2,029.7\n \nForeign deferred tax assets\n38.6\n \n123.7\n \nForeign deferred tax liabilities\n501.2\n \n623.4\n \nNet deferred tax liabilities\n$\n2,646.6\n \n$\n2,529.4\n \nThe total foreign deferred tax assets above are presented within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and domestic and foreign deferred tax liabilities above are presented within deferred tax liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had remaining unrecognized tax benefits recorded within other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets of $\n11.6\n million and $\n5.0\n million, respectively. The remaining balance of our unrecognized tax benefits was recorded within deferred tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Annual tax provisions included amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examination of prior year tax returns; however, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues may differ materially from the amount accrued. We recognized immaterial interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of income taxes on our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. If we were to prevail on all uncertain tax positions, the reversal of this accrual, inclusive of interest and penalties, would result in a benefit of $\n49.1\n million. As of December 31, 2024, we do not anticipate material changes to our remaining unrecognized tax benefit position within the next 12 months.    \nWe file income tax returns in most of the federal, state and provincial jurisdictions in the U.S., Canada and various countries in Europe. Tax years through 2013 are closed in the U.S. In Canada, tax years through 2019 are closed or have been settled through examination except for issues relating to intercompany cross-border transactions, which are separately closed or have been settled through examination for tax years through 2016. Tax years through 2014 are closed for most European jurisdictions in which we operate, with statutes of limitations varying from \n3\n to \n7\n years for most jurisdictions.\nWhen cash is available after satisfying working capital needs and all other business obligations, we may distribute current earnings and the associated cash from a foreign subsidiary to its U.S. parent, and record the tax impact associated with the distribution. However, to the extent current earnings of our foreign operations exist and are not otherwise distributed or planned to be distributed, such earnings accumulate. These accumulated earnings are not considered permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. The taxes associated with any future repatriation of undistributed earnings are anticipated to be insignificant.\n13. \nCommitments and Contingencies\nLetters of Credit \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $\n45\n million outstanding in letters of credit with financial institutions. These letters primarily expire throughout 2025 and $\n12\n million of the letters contain a feature that automatically renews the letter for an additional year if no cancellation notice is submitted. These letters of credit are being maintained as security for deferred compensation payments, reimbursements to insurance companies, reimbursements to the trustee for pension payments, deductibles or retention payments made on our behalf, various payments due to governmental agencies, operations of underground storage tanks and other general business purposes and are not included on our consolidated balance sheets. \nGuarantees and Indemnities\nWe guarantee indebtedness and other obligations to banks and other third parties for some of our equity method investments and consolidated subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the consolidated balance sheets include liabilities related to these guarantees of $\n34.2\n million and $\n36.9\n million, respectively. See \nNote 3, \"Investments\"\n for further detail.\n109\nTable of Contents\nKaiser\nIn 2006, we sold our entire equity interest in our Brazilian unit, Cervejarias Kaiser Brasil S.A. (\"Kaiser\") to FEMSA Cerveza S.A. de C.V. (\"FEMSA\"). The terms of the sale agreement require us to indemnify FEMSA for certain exposures related to tax, civil and labor contingencies arising prior to FEMSA's purchase of Kaiser and certain purchased tax credits. Our exposure related to the tax, civil and labor indemnity claims is capped at $\n68\n million, with the indemnity limited to settlement amounts in excess of amounts disclosed for existing contingencies at the date of sale and reduced by any subsequent settlements including offsetting impacts of any favorable amounts. Related to the purchased tax credits, we settled a portion of our tax credit indemnity obligation during 2010. The maximum potential claims amount for the remainder of the purchased tax credits was $\n12.2\n million as of December 31, 2024. \nOur estimates for a recorded liability consider a number of scenarios for the ultimate resolution of these issues, the probabilities of which are influenced not only by legal developments in Brazil but also by management's intentions with regard to various alternatives that could present themselves leading to the ultimate resolution of these issues. The liabilities are impacted by changes in estimates regarding amounts that could be paid, the timing of such payments, adjustments to the probabilities assigned to various scenarios and foreign currency exchange rates. Our indemnity may cover certain fees and expenses that Kaiser incurs to manage any cases finally determined to be unsuccessful through the administrative and judicial systems. Based on our assessment of the probability of these indemnities, we have recorded an immaterial amount as of December 31, 2024.\nFuture settlement procedures and related negotiation activities associated with these contingencies are largely outside of our control. Due to the uncertainty involved with the ultimate outcome and timing of these contingencies, significant adjustments to the carrying values of the indemnity obligations have been recorded to date and additional future adjustments may be required. These liabilities are denominated in Brazilian Reais and are therefore, subject to foreign exchange gains or losses. As a result, these foreign exchange gains and losses are recorded within other non-operating income (expense), net.\nPurchase Obligations\nWe have various long-term supply contracts and distribution agreements with unaffiliated third parties and our joint venture partners to purchase materials used in production and packaging and to provide distribution services. Certain supply contracts provide that we purchase certain minimum levels of materials throughout the terms of the contracts. Additionally, we have various long-term non-cancelable commitments for advertising, sponsorships and promotions, including marketing at sports arenas, stadiums and other venues and events. \nThe future aggregate minimum required commitments under these purchase obligations are shown in the table below based on foreign exchange rates as of December 31, 2024. The amounts in the table do not represent all anticipated payments under long-term contracts. Rather, they represent unconditional, non-cancelable purchase commitments under contracts with remaining terms greater than one year.\nYear\nSupply and Distribution\nAdvertising and Promotions\n \n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n132.6\n \n$\n200.5\n \n2026\n192.8\n \n163.4\n \n2027\n87.9\n \n109.4\n \n2028\n94.5\n \n88.1\n \n2029\n89.7\n \n100.1\n \nThereafter\n265.3\n \n72.5\n \nTotal\n$\n862.8\n \n$\n734.0\n \nTotal purchases under our long-term unconditional, non-cancellable supply and distribution contracts were approximately $\n0.4\n billion, during each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n110\nTable of Contents\nLitigation, Other Disputes and Environmental\nRelated to litigation, other disputes and environmental issues, we had an aggregate accrued contingent liability of $\n71.1\n million and $\n70.2\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. While we cannot predict the eventual aggregate cost for litigation, other disputes and environmental matters in which we are currently involved, we believe adequate reserves have been provided for losses that are probable and estimable. Additionally, as noted below, there are certain loss contingencies that we deem reasonably possible for which a range of loss is not estimable at this time; for all other matters, we believe that any reasonably possible losses in excess of the amounts accrued are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are involved in other disputes and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business. While it is not feasible to predict or determine the outcome of these proceedings, in our opinion, based on a review with legal counsel, other than as noted, none of these disputes or legal actions are expected to have a material impact on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm our business.\nOn February 12, 2018, Stone Brewing Company filed a trademark infringement lawsuit in federal court in the Southern District of California against Molson Coors Beverage Company USA LLC (\"MCBC USA\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of our Company, alleging that the\n Keystone\n brand had “rebranded” itself as “Stone” and was marketing itself in a manner confusingly similar to Stone Brewing Company's registered Stone trademark. Stone Brewing Company sought treble damages and disgorgement of MCBC USA's profit from\n Keystone\n sales. MCBC USA subsequently filed an answer and counterclaims against Stone Brewing Company. On May 31, 2018, Stone Brewing Company filed a motion to dismiss MCBC USA's counterclaims and for a preliminary injunction seeking to bar MCBC USA from continuing to use “STONE” on \nKeystone Light \ncans and related marketing materials. In March 2019, the court denied Stone Brewing Company’s motion for preliminary injunction and its motion to dismiss MCBC USA's counterclaims. The jury trial began on March 7, 2022. The jury returned a verdict in which it concluded that trademark infringement had occurred and awarded Stone Brewing Company $\n56.0\n million in damages. The jury also found that no \"willful\" trademark infringement had occurred. The trial court subsequently denied Stone Brewing Company’s motion for permanent injunction, motion for disgorgement of profits and motion for treble damages. Judgment was entered on September 8, 2022. Both parties filed post-trial motions, including MCBC USA’s renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial and/or remittitur and Stone Brewing Company’s motion for partial new trial of equitable issues. The court denied both parties' post-trial motions on September 25, 2023. On October 24, 2023, MCBC USA filed a notice of appeal in the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, oral argument was heard in November 2024, and on December 30, 2024, the 9th Circuit affirmed the judgment. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company had a recorded accrued liability of $\n60.6\n million within accounts payable and other current liabilities and $\n58.5\n million within other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets reflecting the best estimate of probable loss in this case based on the judgment plus associated post-judgment interest. On January 29, 2025, the Company paid $\n60.6\n million in final resolution of this matter.\nRegulatory Contingencies\nThe Province of Ontario and Molson Canada 2005, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of our Company, Labatt Brewing Company Limited, Sleeman Breweries Ltd. (collectively, the \"Representative Owners\") and BRI, operating under the name The Beer Store (\"TBS\") are parties to a Master Framework Agreement (\"MFA\") that dictates the terms of the beer distribution and retail systems in the Province of Ontario. In December 2023, the Province of Ontario notified the Representative Owners and TBS that it would not be renewing the MFA after the initial term expires on December 31, 2025. An Early Implementation Agreement (\"EIA\") was entered into on May 23, 2024, between the Province of Ontario, the Representative Owners and TBS concerning the intended features of the future marketplace for beer distribution and retail systems in the Province of Ontario. The EIA was effective July 18, 2024, with provisions continuing until December 31, 2030, except certain provisions which end December 31, 2025. TBS shall remain the primary distributor of beer to all retailers from the commencement date of the EIA to the end of the agreement, December 31, 2030. In summary, the EIA removed grocery store pack size restrictions on beer, wine, cider and ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages as of July 18, 2024, in addition to allowing for the expansion of licensed sale of beer, wine and ready-to-drink alcoholic beverages to all convenience stores which began on September 5, 2024 and all eligible grocery and big-box grocery stores which began on October 31, 2024.     \n111\nTable of Contents\nThe Province of Ontario will provide financial support to TBS and the representative owners of up to CAD \n225\n million through reimbursement of costs incurred in connection with the early implementation and to TBS in connection with the operation of the agreed upon retail footprint through December 31, 2025. The EIA requires TBS to maintain at least \n386\n retail locations in Ontario to support recycling, cash and carry and to preserve employment through June 30, 2025. Subsequently, TBS has the right to close retail locations to reduce the number of retail locations to a minimum of \n300\n by December 31, 2025. From January 1, 2026, onward, TBS will have full discretion to maintain an adequate number of retail locations determined by TBS in its sole and absolute discretion. Due to the anticipated increased competition from grocery stores and convenience stores, TBS anticipates closing stores during the year ended December 31, 2025, in line with the allowable reduction under the EIA with future closures dependent on the evolution of the expanded retail marketplace. We continue to evaluate the impacts of the EIA and the expected future marketplace for beer distribution and retail systems in the Province of Ontario on our results of operations.\nEnvironmental \nWhen we determine it is probable that a liability for environmental matters or other legal actions exists and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable, an estimate of the future costs is recorded as a liability in the financial statements. Costs that extend the life, increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of our assets or are incurred to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination may be capitalized. Other environmental costs are expensed when incurred. Total environmental expenditures recognized for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were immaterial to our consolidated statements of operations. \nAmericas\nOur Canada brewing operations are subject to provincial environmental regulations and local permit requirements. Our Longueuil, Chilliwack and Toronto breweries have water treatment facilities to pre-treat wastewater before it goes to the respective local governmental facility for final treatment. We have environmental programs in Canada including organization, monitoring and verification, regulatory compliance, reporting, education and training and corrective action.\nIn Canada, we sold a chemical specialties business in 1996. We are still responsible for certain aspects of environmental remediation, undertaken or planned, at those chemical specialties business locations. We have established provisions for the costs of these remediation programs.\nIn the U.S., we were previously notified that we are or may be a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\") under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or similar state laws for the cleanup of sites where hazardous substances have allegedly been released into the environment. We cannot predict with certainty the total costs of cleanup, our share of the total cost, the extent to which contributions will be available from other parties, the amount of time necessary to complete the cleanups or insurance coverage.\nLowry\nWe are one of a number of entities named by the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") as a PRP at the Lowry Superfund site in Colorado. This landfill is owned by the City and County of Denver (\"Denver\") and is managed by Waste Management of Colorado, Inc. (\"Waste Management\"). In 1990, we recorded a \npretax charge\n of $\n30\n million, a portion of which was put into a trust in 1993 as part of a settlement with Denver and Waste Management regarding the then-outstanding litigation. Our settlement was based on an assumed remediation cost of $\n120\n million (in 1992 adjusted dollars). We are obligated to pay a portion of future costs in excess of that amount.\nWaste Management provides us with updated annual cost estimates through 2032. We review these cost estimates in the assessment of our accrual related to this issue. Our expected liability is based on our best estimates available.\nBased on the assumptions utilized, the present value and gross amount of the costs as of December 31, 2024 are approximately $\n4\n million and $\n6\n million, respectively. Cost estimates were discounted using a \n4.53\n% risk-free rate of return. We did not assume any future recoveries from insurance companies in the estimate of our liability and none are expected.\nConsidering the estimates extend through the year 2032 and the related uncertainties at the site, including what additional remedial actions may be required by the EPA, new technologies and what costs we are required to cover, the estimate of our liability may change as further facts develop. We cannot predict the amount of any such change, but additional accruals in the future are possible.\n112\nTable of Contents\nOther\nIn prior years, we were notified by the EPA and certain state environmental divisions that we are a PRP, along with other parties, at the East Rutherford and Berry's Creek sites in New Jersey and the Chamblee site in Georgia. Certain former non-beer business operations, which we discontinued use of and subsequently sold, were involved at these sites. Potential losses associated with these sites could increase as remediation planning progresses.\nWe are aware of groundwater contamination at some of our properties in Colorado resulting from historical, ongoing or nearby activities. There may also be other contamination of which we are currently unaware. \nEMEA&APAC\nWe are subject to the requirements of governmental and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations within each of the countries in which we operate.\n Compliance with these laws and regulations did not materially affect our 2024\n \ncapital expenditures, results of operations or our financial or competitive position, and we do not currently anticipate that they will do so in 2025.\n14. \nStockholders' Equity\nChanges to the number of shares of capital stock outstanding were as follows:\n \nCommon stock\noutstanding\nExchangeable\nshares outstanding\n \nClass A\nClass B\nClass A\nClass B\n \n(Share amounts in millions)\nBalance as of December 31, 2021\n2.6\n \n200.6\n \n2.7\n \n11.1\n \nShares issued under equity compensation plans\n— \n0.3\n \n— \n— \nPurchase of treasury shares\n— \n(\n1.0\n)\n— \n— \nShares exchanged for common stock\n— \n0.1\n \n— \n(\n0.1\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n2.6\n \n200.0\n \n2.7\n \n11.0\n \nShares issued under equity compensation plans\n— \n0.4\n \n— \n— \nPurchase of treasury shares\n— \n(\n3.4\n)\n— \n— \nShares exchanged for common stock\n— \n1.6\n \n— \n(\n1.6\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n2.6\n \n198.6\n \n2.7\n \n9.4\n \nShares issued under equity compensation plans\n— \n0.8\n \n— \n— \nPurchase of treasury shares\n— \n(\n10.9\n)\n— \n— \nShares exchanged for common stock\n— \n2.2\n \n— \n(\n2.2\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n2.6\n \n190.7\n \n2.7\n \n7.2\n \nExchangeable Shares\nThe Class A exchangeable shares and Class B exchangeable shares were issued by Molson Coors Canada Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Company. The exchangeable shares are substantially the economic equivalent of the corresponding shares of Class A and Class B common stock that a Molson Inc. shareholder would have received in the merger of Adolph Coors Company with Molson Inc. in February 2005, if the holder had elected to receive shares of Molson Coors common stock. Exchangeable shareholders receive the CAD equivalent of dividends declared on Class A and B common stock on the date of declaration. Holders of exchangeable shares also receive, through a voting trust, the benefit of Molson Coors voting rights, entitling the holder to \none\n vote on the same basis and in the same circumstances as one corresponding share of Molson Coors common stock.\n113\nTable of Contents\nVoting Rights\nEach holder of record of Class A common stock, Class B common stock, Class A exchangeable shares and Class B exchangeable shares is entitled to \none\n vote for each share held, without the ability to cumulate votes on the election of directors. Our Class B common stock has fewer voting rights than our Class A common stock and holders of our Class A common stock have the ability to effectively control or have a significant influence over company actions requiring stockholder approval. Specifically, holders of Class B common stock voting together as a single class have the right to elect \nthree\n directors of the Molson Coors Board of Directors, as well as the right to vote on certain additional matters as outlined in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation (as amended, the \"Certificate\"), such as merger agreements that require approval under applicable law, sales of all or substantially all of our assets to unaffiliated third parties, proposals to dissolve MCBC, and certain amendments to the Certificate that require approval under applicable law, each as further described and limited by the Certificate. The Certificate also provides that holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock shall vote together as a single class, on an advisory basis, on any proposal to approve the compensation of MCBC's named executive officers.\nConversion Rights\nThe Certificate provides for the right of holders of Class A common stock to convert their stock into Class B common stock on a \none\n-for-one basis at any time. The exchangeable shares are exchangeable at any time, at the option of the holder on a \none\n-for-one basis for corresponding shares of Molson Coors common stock. Therefore, a portion of our authorized and unissued Class A and Class B common shares are reserved to meet exchange requirements.\nShare Repurchase Program\nOn September 29, 2023, our Board approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $\n2.0\n billion of our Company's Class B common stock excluding brokerage commissions and excise taxes, with an expected program term of \nfive years\n. This repurchase program replaces and supersedes any repurchase program previously approved by our Board, including the program approved during the first quarter of 2022. The number, price, structure and timing of the repurchases under the program, if any, will be at our sole discretion and future repurchases will be evaluated by us depending on market conditions, liquidity needs, restrictions under our debt arrangements and other factors. Share repurchases may be made in the open market, in structured transactions, or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not oblige us to acquire any particular amount of our Company's Class B common stock. The Board may suspend, modify or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice. \nThe following table presents the shares repurchased and aggregate cost, including brokerage commissions and excise taxes incurred, under the current and superseded share repurchase programs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nFor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nShares repurchased\n10,907,779\n \n3,454,694\n995,000\nAggregate cost (in millions)\n$\n645.2\n \n$\n212.7\n \n$\n51.5\n \n114\nTable of Contents\n15. \nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n \nMCBC stockholders' equity\n \nForeign\ncurrency\ntranslation\nadjustments\nGain (loss) on\nderivative\ninstruments\nPension and\npostretirement\nbenefit\nadjustments\nEquity method\ninvestments\nAccumulated\nother\ncomprehensive\nincome (loss)\n \n(In millions)\nAs of December 31, 2021\n$\n(\n558.7\n)\n$\n(\n131.0\n)\n$\n(\n275.1\n)\n$\n(\n41.2\n)\n$\n(\n1,006.0\n)\nForeign currency translation adjustments\n(\n356.1\n)\n— \n1.2\n \n— \n(\n354.9\n)\nCumulative translation adjustment reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss)\n(1)\n12.1\n \n— \n— \n— \n12.1\n \nGain (loss) recognized on net investment hedges\n53.2\n \n— \n— \n— \n53.2\n \nUnrealized gain (loss) recognized on derivative instruments\n— \n209.7\n \n— \n— \n209.7\n \nDerivative instrument activity reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss)\n— \n12.9\n \n— \n— \n12.9\n \nNet change in pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities recognized in other comprehensive income (loss)\n— \n— \n(\n78.2\n)\n— \n(\n78.2\n)\nPension and other postretirement activity reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss)\n— \n— \n(\n2.1\n)\n— \n(\n2.1\n)\nOwnership share of unconsolidated subsidiaries' other comprehensive income (loss)\n— \n— \n— \n18.7\n \n18.7\n \nTax benefit (expense)\n(\n25.7\n)\n(\n59.4\n)\n19.1\n \n(\n4.9\n)\n(\n70.9\n)\nAs of December 31, 2022\n$\n(\n875.2\n)\n$\n32.2\n \n$\n(\n335.1\n)\n$\n(\n27.4\n)\n$\n(\n1,205.5\n)\nForeign currency translation adjustments\n113.5\n \n— \n—\n \n— \n113.5\n \nCumulative translation adjustment reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss)\n(2)\n(\n0.7\n)\n— \n— \n— \n(\n0.7\n)\nGain (loss) recognized on net investment hedges\n(\n26.5\n)\n— \n— \n— \n(\n26.5\n)\nUnrealized gain (loss) recognized on derivative instruments\n— \n(\n3.6\n)\n— \n— \n(\n3.6\n)\nDerivative instrument activity reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss)\n— \n1.3\n \n— \n— \n1.3\n \nNet change in pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities recognized in other comprehensive income (loss)\n— \n— \n(\n8.5\n)\n— \n(\n8.5\n)\nPension and other postretirement activity reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss)\n— \n— \n(\n15.0\n)\n— \n(\n15.0\n)\nOwnership share of unconsolidated subsidiaries' other comprehensive income (loss)\n— \n— \n— \n15.4\n \n15.4\n \nTax benefit (expense)\n10.9\n \n0.7\n \n5.9\n \n(\n4.2\n)\n13.3\n \nAs of December 31, 2023\n$\n(\n778.0\n)\n$\n30.6\n \n$\n(\n352.7\n)\n$\n(\n16.2\n)\n$\n(\n1,116.3\n)\nForeign currency translation adjustments\n(\n339.9\n)\n— \n— \n— \n(\n339.9\n)\nCumulative translation adjustment reclassified from noncontrolling interest to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n(3)\n(\n3.5\n)\n— \n— \n— \n(\n3.5\n)\nGain (loss) recognized on net investment hedges\n54.6\n \n— \n— \n— \n54.6\n \nUnrealized gain (loss) recognized on derivative instruments\n— \n70.6\n \n— \n— \n70.6\n \nDerivative instrument activity reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss)\n— \n(\n0.3\n)\n— \n— \n(\n0.3\n)\nNet change in pension and other postretirement benefit assets and liabilities recognized in other comprehensive income (loss)\n— \n— \n(\n10.1\n)\n— \n(\n10.1\n)\nPension and other postretirement activity reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss)\n(4)\n— \n— \n24.3\n \n— \n24.3\n \nOwnership share of unconsolidated subsidiaries' other comprehensive income (loss)\n— \n— \n— \n(\n0.5\n)\n(\n0.5\n)\nTax benefit (expense)\n(\n20.2\n)\n(\n17.3\n)\n(\n3.9\n)\n0.1\n \n(\n41.3\n)\nAs of December 31, 2024\n$\n(\n1,087.0\n)\n$\n83.6\n \n$\n(\n342.4\n)\n$\n(\n16.6\n)\n$\n(\n1,362.4\n)\n(1)\nAs a result of the completion of the sale of our non-operating India entity during the year ended December 31, 2022, the associated cumulative foreign currency translation adjustments were reclassified from AOCI and recognized within other operating income (expense), net. \n(2)\nAs a result of the sale of our interest in Truss, the associated cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment was reclassified from AOCI.

See further discussion of this transaction in \nNote 11. \"Employee Retirement P\nlans and Postretirement Ben\nefits\n.\"\nWe have significant levels of net assets denominated in currencies other than USD due to our operations in foreign countries, and therefore we recognize OCI gains and/or losses when those items are translated to USD.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we granted \n0.4\n million, \n0.5\n million and \n0.5\n million RSUs, respectively, with a weighted-average market value of $\n61.89\n, $\n54.97\n and $\n52.05\n each, respectively. Prior to vesting, RSUs have no voting rights but participate in dividends.\nDSU awards, under the Directors' Stock Plan pursuant to the Incentive Compensation Plan, are granted based on elections made by non-employee directors of MCBC that enable them to receive all or one-half of their annual cash retainer in the form of DSUs or stock. The DSU awards are issued at the market value equal to the price of our stock at the date of the grant. The DSUs are paid in shares of stock upon termination of service. Prior to vesting, DSUs have no voting rights but participate in dividends. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we granted a small number of DSUs.\nPSU awards are granted with a target value established at the date of grant and vest upon completion of a service requirement. The settlement amount of the PSUs is determined based on market and performance metrics, which include our total shareholder return performance relative to the stock market index defined by each award and specified internal performance metrics designed to drive greater shareholder return. PSU compensation expense is based on fair values assigned to the market and performance metrics upon grant. For the PSUs granted in 2022 and 2023, the market metric is based upon a Monte Carlo model, with the market metric remaining constant throughout the vesting period of \nthree years\n while the performance metric is based upon the market value equal to the price of our stock at the date of grant, varying based on a multiplier tied to projected performance metric attainment. Beginning in 2024, we granted PSU awards that had a performance metric with a market metric modifier, for which a fair value was assigned for the award upon grant utilizing a Monte Carlo model and total expense is based on the projected performance metric attainment. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we granted \n0.2\n million, \n0.3\n million and \n0.3\n million PSUs, respectively, each with a weighted-average fair value of $\n64.83\n, $\n62.31\n and $\n62.98\n, respectively.\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market value of a share of Class B common stock on the date of grant. Stock options have a term of \nten years\n and generally vest over \nthree years\n. Beginning in 2024, the pool of recipients for stock options expanded to include additional employees. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we granted \n0.8\n million, \n0.2\n million and \n0.3\n million options, respectively, each with a weighted-average fair value of $\n16.13\n, $\n13.38\n and $\n12.16\n, respectively.\nBeginning with awards granted in 2020, RSU and PSU awards entitle participants to receive dividends earned during the vesting period, subject to the performance, vesting and other conditions, including forfeiture, applicable to the respective awards.\nThe following table presents the pre-tax and after-tax share-based compensation expense.\n \nFor the years ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n \n(In millions)\nPre-tax share-based compensation expense\n$\n43.1\n \n$\n44.9\n \n$\n33.6\n \nTax benefit\n(\n8.5\n)\n(\n7.8\n)\n(\n5.9\n)\nAfter-tax share-based compensation expense\n$\n34.6\n \n$\n37.1\n \n$\n27.7\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $\n58.1\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost from all share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Incentive Compensation Plan related to unvested awards.

Expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and implied volatility of our stock. The expected term of stock options is estimated based upon observations of historical employee option exercise patterns and trends of those employees granted options in the respective year. \nThe fair values of each PSU granted during the year ended December 31, 2024 and the fair value of the market metric for each PSU granted during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were determined on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model to simulate total stockholder return for MCBC and peer companies with the following weighted-average assumptions.  \nFor the years ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.32\n%\n4.42\n%\n1.58\n%\nVolatility range\n15.88\n% - \n66.30\n%\n17.19\n% - \n35.87\n%\n22.65\n% - \n45.30\n%\nWeighted-average volatility\n25.38\n%\n32.58\n%\n35.93\n%\nExpected term (years)\n2.8\n2.8\n2.8\nWeighted-average fair market value\n$\n64.83\n$\n62.31\n$\n62.98\nThe risk-free interest rates utilized for periods throughout the expected term of the PSUs are based on a zero-coupon U.S. Department of Treasury security yield at the time of grant. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock as well as the stock of our peer firms, as shown within the volatility range above, for a period from the grant date consistent with the expected term. The expected term of PSUs is calculated based on the grant date to the end of the performance period. No dividend yield is utilized in the model as participants are entitled to dividends earned during the vesting period of each respective award.\n17. \nOther Operating Income (Expense), net\nWe have recorded incurred charges or realized benefits that we believe are significant to our current operating results warranting separate classification in other operating income (expense), net.\n \nFor the years ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\n \n(In millions)\nRestructuring\n(1)\nEmployee-related charges\n$\n(\n2.6\n)\n$\n(\n4.1\n)\n$\n(\n6.0\n)\nAsset abandonment and other restructuring costs\n(\n104.2\n)\n—\n \n(\n3.1\n)\nIntangible and tangible asset impairments, excluding goodwill\n(2)\n—\n \n(\n160.8\n)\n(\n36.3\n)\nGains (losses) on disposals and other\n(1)(3)\n41.4\n \n2.2\n \n6.8\n \nOther operating income (expense), net\n$\n(\n65.4\n)\n$\n(\n162.7\n)\n$\n(\n38.6\n)\n(1)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we made the decision to wind down or sell certain of our U.S. craft businesses and related facilities and recorded employee-related and asset abandonment charges, including accelerated depreciation in excess of normal depreciation of $\n93.6\n million. In addition, we recognized a loss of $\n41.2\n million related to the disposal of the sold businesses. We expect to continue to incur incremental restructuring charges during the first quarter of 2025 through completion of wind down and closure of certain remaining U.S. craft facilities. Remaining charges are estimated to total approximately $\n15\n million to $\n20\n million, consisting primarily of accelerated depreciation.\n(2)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized a partial impairment charge of $\n160.7\n million to our indefinite-lived intangible asset related to the \nStaropramen\n family of\n \nbrands within our EMEA&APAC segment. The indefinite-lived intangible asset was measured at fair value primarily using a market approach with Level 3 inputs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we identified a triggering event related to the former Truss joint venture asset group within our Americas segment and recognized an impairment loss of $\n28.6\n million, of which $\n12.1\n million was attributable to the noncontrolling interest. The asset group was measured at fair value primarily using a market approach with Level 3 inputs.\n119\nTable of Contents\n(3)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we further increased our investment in ZOA resulting in consolidation and recognized a gain of $\n77.9\n million representing the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of our previously held equity interest on the acquisition date. \nDuring the third quarter of 2023, we sold our \n57.5\n% controlling interest in Truss in Canada to Tilray Brands and recognized a loss of $\n11.1\n million upon deconsolidation of the business.\n \n18. \nSegment Reporting \nOur reporting segments are based on the key geographic regions in which we operate and include the Americas and EMEA&APAC segments. Our Americas segment operates in the U.S., Canada and various countries in Latin America and our EMEA&APAC segment operates in Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Montenegro, the Republic of Ireland, Romania, Serbia, the U.K., various other European countries and certain countries within the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. We also have certain activity that is not allocated to our segments, which has been reflected as Unallocated below.\nThe Company’s CODM who reviews our \ntwo\n reporting segments is the President and Chief Executive Officer. The primary measure of profitability is income (loss) before income taxes. The CODM assesses income (loss) before income taxes to compare current results to budgeted and prior year results at the segment level to assess segment performance. This metric is also used to evaluate the income (loss) generated from segment assets and deciding whether to reinvest in the segment, reallocate resources to another segment, or for other purposes such as dividends or share repurchases.\nReporting Segments \nAmericas \nThe Americas segment consists of our production, marketing and sales of our owned brands and partner brands in the U.S., Canada and various countries in Latin America. We have contract brewing agreements to brew, package, market, distribute and/or sell certain products in the Americas as well as joint venture arrangements in Canada to distribute and sell beer in Ontario and the western provinces of Canada.\nEMEA&APAC\nThe EMEA&APAC segment consists of our production, marketing and sales of our owned brands and partner brands in the U.K., Central Europe and various other European countries, along with certain countries within the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. The EMEA&APAC segment includes the sale of factored brands in the U.K. which occurs when we distribute beer, wine, spirits and other products owned and produced by other companies to the on-premise channel such as bars and restaurants. \nUnallocated\nWe also have certain activity that is not allocated to our segments, which has been reflected as Unallocated below. Specifically, Unallocated primarily includes certain financing-related activities such as interest expense and interest income, foreign exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances as well as realized and unrealized changes in fair value on derivative instruments not designated in hedging relationships related to financing and other treasury-related activities. Unallocated activity also includes the unrealized changes in fair value on our commodity swaps not designated in hedging relationships recorded within cost of goods sold, which are later reclassified when realized to the segment in which the underlying exposure resides. Additionally, only the service cost component of net periodic pension and OPEB cost is reported within each operating segment and all other components remain in Unallocated.\nSummarized Financial Information\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nConsolidated net sales represent sales to third-party external customers less excise taxes. Inter-segment transactions impacting net sales and income (loss) before income taxes eliminate upon consolidation and are primarily related to the Americas segment royalties received from and sales to the EMEA&APAC segment. \n120\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present net sales and other activity by segment to arrive at income (loss) before income taxes as well as a reconciliation of

Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management necessarily applies its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such disclosure controls and procedures that, by their nature, can only provide reasonable assurance regarding management's control objectives. Also, we have investments in certain unconsolidated entities that we do not control or manage.\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n123\nTable of Contents\nOur Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, with assistance from other members of management, assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the framework and criteria established in\n Internal Control—Integrated Framework \n(2013 Framework), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. \nAn independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their report which appears in Part II—Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. \nITEM 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION \nOther than as set forth below, during the three months ended December 31, 2024, no directors or officers \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n a \"Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\" or a \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,\" as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nOn \nNovember 14, 2024\n, \nGavin Hattersley\n, our \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer and Director\n, \nentered\n into a pre-arranged stock trading plan intended to qualify as a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (the \"Hattersley 10b5-1 Sales Plan\"). The Hattersley 10b5-1 Sales Plan provides for the potential exercise of vested stock options and the associated sale of up to \n155,789\n shares of the Company's Class B common stock generated from the exercise of the aforementioned options between February 27, 2025 and \nFebruary 27, 2026\n.

The sale resulted in the realization of a capital loss for U.S. tax purposes. We believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset generated by the capital loss will not be recognized, and as a result, a $\n20.0\n million valuation allowance was recorded for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. Deduction amounts are primarily due to the re-evaluation of deferred tax assets.\nThe impacts of changes in income tax rates on deferred tax valuation allowances are reported in the additions or deductions column accordingly.\n \nITEM 16.    FORM 10-K SUMMARY\nNone.\nSIGNATURES\nPursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.\nMOLSON COORS BEVERAGE COMPANY\nBy\n \n/s/ GAVIN D.K.
