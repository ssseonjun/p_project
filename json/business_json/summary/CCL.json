The FuelEU Maritime regulation and the Energy Taxation Directive (ETD) are also on the agenda .\n FuelEU Maritime is a long-term framework designed to reduce maritime emissions by increasing the use of sustainable alternative fuels . The regulation requires compliance with the maximum limits of GHG intensity of energy used on board . Proposed amendments to the ETD will introduce new tax rates based on the energy content and environmental impact rather than volume .\n We are committed to providing a healthy environment for all of our guests and crew .

We have successfully used biofuel as a replacement for fossil fuel on 6 ships .\n There are significant supply and cost challenges that must be resolved before viability is reached . Service Power Packages (or Power Saver Packs) upgrades are the main part of our ongoing energy efficiency investment program . Upon completion, these upgrades are expected to deliver approx. nmental benefits compared to using fossil fuels alone through their GHG reductions .\n LNG is a fossil fuel and generates GHG emissions, but its direct CO2 emissions are lower than those of conventional fuels . ALS cushions the flat bottom of a ship’s hull with air bubbles, reducing frictional resistance and the propulsive power required to drive the ship through the water . We have ten LNG powered cruise ships in operation as of November 30, 2024 .\n LNG’s advantage over conventional fuels in terms of reduced GHG emissions is expected to grow . The type of tank and system arrangements that we have on our LNG-fueled ships also allows for future conversion to other low GHG fuels such as green methanol . LNG ships are also built with larger fuel tanks, with the space necessary to retrofit for other fuels .\n Carnival Corporation & plc’s GHG emissions inventory management plan follows the guidance in The Greenhouse Gas Protocol and ISO 14064-1:2018 .
