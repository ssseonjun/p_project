    "item1": "Item 1. Business - Environmental Matters\" for additional information.\nSustainability\nIncreasing attention has been focused on a broad range of corporate activities under the heading of “sustainability”, which has resulted in a significant increase in the number of requests from interested parties for information on sustainability topics. These parties range from investor groups focused on environmental, social, governance and other matters to non-investors concerned with a variety of public policy matters. Often the scope of the information sought is very broad and not necessarily relevant to an issuer’s business or industry. As a result, a number of private groups have proposed to standardize the subject matter constituting sustainability, either generally or by industry. Those efforts remain ongoing. In addition, certain of these private groups have advocated that the SEC promulgate regulations requiring specific sustainability reporting under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ’34 Act), or that issuers voluntarily include certain sustainability disclosure in their ’34 Act reports. In March 2024, the SEC finalized climate disclosure rules for public companies. The rules require public companies to disclose, among other things, direct and indirect GHG emissions and information related to climate-related targets or goals that are material to the company’s business, results of operations or financial condition. As of April 2024, the SEC issued a “stay” on its climate-related disclosure rules, temporarily pausing implementation pending judicial review. PPL cannot predict the final legal requirements or when the requirements will be effective.\nAs has been PPL’s practice, to the extent sustainability issues have or may have a material impact on the Registrants’ financial condition or results of operation, PPL discloses such matters in accordance with applicable securities law and SEC regulations. With respect to other sustainability topics that PPL deems relevant to investors but that are not required to be reported under applicable securities law and SEC regulation, PPL will continue each spring to publish its annual sustainability report including tracking reductions related to the company's goal to reduce carbon emissions and post that report on its corporate website at \n56\n \nTable of Contents\nwww.pplweb.com and on www.pplsustainability.com. Neither the information in such annual sustainability report nor the information at such websites is incorporated in this Form 10-K by reference, and it should not be considered a part of this Form 10-K. In preparing its sustainability report, PPL is guided by the framework established by the Global Reporting Initiative, which identifies environmental, social, governance and other subject matter categories. PPL also participates in efforts by the Edison Electric Institute and American Gas Association to provide the appropriate subset of sustainability information that can be applied consistently across the electric and gas utility industries. Additionally, PPL consults widely used reporting frameworks for discrete sustainability topics, including corporate political contributions and climate-related issues. PPL also responds to the climate survey of CDP, a not-for-profit organization based in the United Kingdom formerly known as the Carbon Disclosure Project, that runs the global disclosure system that enables investors, companies, cities, states and regions to measure and manage their environmental impacts.\nCybersecurity\nSee “",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for a discussion of competitive factors affecting the Registrants.\n \nNew Accounting Guidance\nSee Note 1 and Note 20 for a discussion of significant new accounting guidance adopted and pending adoption as of December 31, 2024.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies\nFinancial condition and results of operations are impacted by the methods, assumptions and estimates used in the application of critical accounting policies. The following accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of the reported financial condition or results of operations and require management to make estimates or other judgments of matters that are inherently uncertain. Changes in the estimates or other judgments included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the Financial Statements (these accounting policies are also discussed in Note 1 to the Financial Statements). Senior management has reviewed with PPL's Audit Committee these critical accounting policies, the following disclosures regarding their application, and the estimates and assumptions regarding them.\nDefined Benefits \n(All Registrants)\nCertain of the Registrants and/or their subsidiaries sponsor or participate in certain qualified funded and non-qualified unfunded defined benefit pension plans and both funded and unfunded other postretirement benefit plans. See Notes 1, 7 and 10 to the Financial Statements for additional information about the plans and the accounting for defined benefits.\nA summary of plan sponsors by Registrant and whether a Registrant or its subsidiaries sponsor (S) or participate in and receives allocations (P) from those plans is shown in the table below.\nPlan Sponsor\nPPL\n \nPPL Electric\n \nLG&E\n \nKU\nPPL Services\nS\n \nP\n \n \n \n \nLKE \n \n \n \n \nP\n \nP\nManagement makes certain assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. As such, annual net periodic defined benefit costs are recorded in current earnings or regulatory assets and liabilities based on estimated results. Any differences between actual and estimated results are recorded in AOCI or, in the case of PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, regulatory assets and liabilities for amounts that are expected to be recovered through regulated customer rates. These amounts in AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized to income over future periods. The significant assumptions are:\n•\nDiscount Rate - In selecting the discount rates for defined benefit plans, the plan sponsors start with a cash flow analysis of the expected benefit payment stream for their plans. The plan-specific cash flows are matched against the coupons and \n57\n \nTable of Contents\nexpected maturity values of Aa-rated non-callable (or callable with make-whole provisions) bonds that could be purchased for a hypothetical settlement portfolio. The plan sponsors then use the single discount rate derived from matching the discounted benefit payment stream to the market value of the selected bond portfolio.\n•\nExpected Return on Plan Assets - The expected long-term rates of return for pension and other postretirement benefits are based on management's projections using a best-estimate of expected returns, volatilities and correlations for each asset class. Each plan's specific current and expected asset allocations are also considered in developing a reasonable return assumption.\n•\nRate of Compensation Increase - Management projects employees' annual pay increases, which are used to project employees' pension benefits at retirement. In selecting a rate of compensation increase, plan sponsors consider past experience, the potential impact of movements in inflation rates and expectations of ongoing compensation practices.\nSee Note 10 to the Financial Statements for details of the assumptions selected for pension and other postretirement benefits. A variance in the assumptions could significantly impact accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. \nThe following tables reflect changes in certain assumptions based on the Registrants' primary qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. The inverse of this change would have the opposite impact on accrued defined benefit liabilities or assets, reported annual net periodic defined benefit costs and AOCI or regulatory assets and liabilities. The sensitivities below reflect an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption.\nIncrease (Decrease)\nActuarial assumption\n \nDiscount Rate\n(0.25 \n%)\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\n(0.25 \n%)\nRate of Compensation Increase\n0.25 \n%\nIncrease (Decrease)\n(Increase) Decrease\n(Increase) Decrease\nIncrease (Decrease)\nIncrease (Decrease)\nActuarial assumption\nDefined Benefit\nAsset\nDefined Benefit\nLiabilities\nAOCI\n(pre-tax)\nNet Regulatory\nAssets\nDefined Benefit\nCosts\nPPL\n \n \n \n \nDiscount rates\n$\n(19)\n$\n(73)\n$\n26 \n$\n66 \n$\n7 \nExpected return on plan assets\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n10 \nRate of compensation increase\n(2)\n(6)\n2 \n6 \n1 \nPPL Electric\n \n \n \n \nDiscount rates\n— \n(31)\n— \n31 \n2 \nExpected return on plan assets\nn/a\nn/a\n— \nn/a\n4 \nRate of compensation increase\n— \n(2)\n— \n2 \n1 \n \n \n \n \nLG&E\nDiscount rates\n(8)\n1 \nn/a\n9 \n1 \nExpected return on plan assets\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n1 \nRate of compensation increase\n(1)\n— \nn/a\n1 \n— \nKU\nDiscount rates\n(6)\n1 \nn/a\n7 \n1 \nExpected return on plan assets\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n1 \nRate of compensation increase\n(1)\n— \nn/a\n1 \n— \nIncome Taxes\n \n(All Registrants)\nSignificant management judgment is required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. \n58\n \nTable of Contents\nThe need for valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment. Valuation allowances are initially recorded and reevaluated each reporting period by assessing the likelihood of the ultimate realization of a deferred tax asset. Management considers numerous factors in assessing the expected realization of a deferred tax asset, including the reversal of temporary differences, future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Any tax planning strategy considered in this assessment must meet the recognition and measurement criteria for the valuation of a deferred tax asset. When evaluating the need for valuation allowances, the uncertainty posed by potential or expected legislative change on such factors is also considered by management. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future.\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities \n(All Registrants)\nPPL Electric, LG&E, KU and RIE are subject to cost-based rate regulation. As a result, the effects of regulatory actions are required to be reflected in the financial statements. Assets and liabilities are recorded that result from the regulated ratemaking process that may not be recorded under GAAP for non-regulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in regulated customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover costs that are expected to be incurred in the future, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose.\nManagement continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory and political environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, recent rate orders to the Registrants and other regulated entities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation. Based on this continual assessment, management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery. This assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state and federal levels and is subject to change in the future. If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the regulatory asset would be written-off. Additionally, the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of recovery of regulatory assets.\nSee Note 7 to the Financial Statements for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities recorded at December 31, 2024 and 2023, as well as additional information on those regulatory assets and liabilities. All regulatory assets are either currently being recovered under specific rate orders, represent amounts that are expected to be recovered in future rates or benefit future periods based upon established regulatory practices.\nPrice Risk Management \n(PPL)\nSee \"Financial Condition - Risk Management\" above.\nGoodwill Impairment \n(PPL, LG&E and KU) \nGoodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. The reporting units of PPL include the Kentucky Regulated reporting unit, the Pennsylvania Regulated reporting unit, and the Rhode Island Regulated reporting unit. LG&E and KU are each single reporting units\n. \nA goodwill impairment test is performed annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit may be greater than the reporting unit's fair value. \nThe fair value of a reporting unit is compared with the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit.\nPPL, for its reporting units, and individually, LG&E and KU, may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. \nAs of October 1, 2024, PPL, for its reporting units, and individually, LG&E and KU, elected to perform the qualitative step zero evaluation of goodwill. These evaluations considered the excess of fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit that was calculated during step one of the quantitative impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the relevant events and circumstances that occurred since those tests were performed including:\n59\n \nTable of Contents\n•\ncurrent year financial performance versus the prior year,\n•\nchanges in planned capital expenditures,\n•\nthe consistency of forecasted free cash flows,\n•\nearnings quality and sustainability,\n•\nchanges in market participant discount rates,\n•\nchanges in long-term growth rates,\n•\nchanges in PPL's market capitalization, and\n•\nthe overall economic and regulatory environments in which these regulated entities operate.\nBased on these evaluations, management concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying value. As such, the step one quantitative impairment test was not performed and no impairment was recognized. \nSee \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Impairment (Excluding Investments)\" in Note 1 to the Financial Statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment tests. See Note 17 to the Financial Statements for information on goodwill balances by reportable segment at December 31, 2024.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n \n(LG&E and KU)\nARO liabilities are required to be recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. Initial obligations are measured at estimated fair value. An ARO must be recognized when incurred if the fair value of the ARO can be reasonably estimated. An equivalent amount is recorded as an increase in the value of the capitalized asset and amortized to expense, regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities over the asset's useful life.\nIn determining AROs, management must make significant judgments and estimates to calculate fair value. Fair value is developed using an expected present value technique based on assumptions of market participants that consider estimated retirement costs in current period dollars, inflated to the anticipated retirement date and discounted back to the date the ARO was incurred. Changes in assumptions and estimates included within the calculations of the fair value of AROs could result in significantly different results than those identified and recorded in the financial statements. Estimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the ARO estimate. Any change to the capitalized asset is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset.\nSee \"Long-Lived and Intangible Assets - Asset Retirement Obligations\" in Note 1, Note 7 and Note 18 to the Financial Statements for additional information on AROs.\nAt December 31, 2024, the total recorded balances and information on the most significant recorded AROs were as follows.\n \nMost Significant AROs\nTotal\nARO\nRecorded\nAmount\nRecorded\n% of Total\nDescription\nLG&E\n$\n84 \n$\n63 \n75 \nPonds, landfills and natural gas mains\nKU\n64 \n35 \n55 \nPonds and landfills\nThe most significant assumptions surrounding AROs are the forecasted retirement costs (including settlement dates and the timing of cash flows), discount and inflation rates. At December 31, 2024, a 10% increase to retirement cost would increase these ARO liabilities by $8 million at LG&E and $8 million at KU. A 0.25% decrease in the discount rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $5 million at LG&E and $1 million at KU and a 0.25% increase in the inflation rate would increase these ARO liabilities by $4 million at LG&E. There would be no significant change to the annual depreciation expense of the ARO asset or the annual accretion expense of the ARO liability as a result of these changes in assumptions.\n \nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenues\n \n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nFor RIE, LG&E and KU, revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of actual meter reads taken throughout the month, estimates are recorded for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of deliveries to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. The unbilled revenue \n60\n \nTable of Contents\nestimates reflect consideration of factors including daily load models, estimated usage for each customer class, the effect of current and different rate schedules, the meter read schedule, the billing schedule, actual weather data, and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures.\nOther Information\n \n(All Registrants)\n \nPPL's Audit Committee has approved the independent auditor to provide audit and audit-related services, tax services and other services permitted by Sarbanes-Oxley and SEC rules. The audit and audit-related services include services in connection with statutory and regulatory filings, reviews of offering documents and registration statements, and internal control reviews.\nITEM 7A.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in\n Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 13, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities– Impact of Rate-Regulation on Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and Related Disclosures – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company owns and operates four cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulatory commissions to enable the regulated utility to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. \nRegulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates.  The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific rate orders or, in certain \n62\n \nTable of Contents\ncases, regulatory commission precedent for transactions or events. While the Company has indicated that it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the regulatory commissions will not approve full recovery of and return on such costs or approve recovery on a timely basis in future regulatory decisions.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in continually assessing whether the regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, and recent rate orders. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation due to its inherent complexities. \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by regulatory commissions included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s internal controls over evaluating the likelihood of recovery or refund in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management’s internal controls over the recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe obtained and read relevant regulatory orders issued by the regulatory commissions for the Company and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate-regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nMorristown, New Jersey\n  \nFebruary 13, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2015.\n63\n \nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nTo the Shareowner and the Board of Directors of PPL Electric Utilities Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of PPL Electric Utilities Corporation and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\").

Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation due to its inherent complexities. \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by regulatory commissions included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s internal controls over evaluating the likelihood of recovery or refund in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets and liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management’s internal controls over the recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe obtained and read relevant regulatory orders issued by the regulatory commissions for LG&E and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\n•\nWe evaluated LG&E’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate-regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nLouisville, Kentucky\nFebruary 13, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015.\n67\n \nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nTo the Stockholder and the Board of Directors of Kentucky Utilities Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Kentucky Utilities Company (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities– Impact of Rate-Regulation on Regulatory Assets and Liabilities and Related Disclosures – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, Kentucky Utilities Company (KU) is a cost-based rate-regulated utility for which rates are set by regulatory commissions to enable the regulated utility to recover the costs of providing electric service and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. \nRegulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates.  The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific rate orders or, in certain cases, regulatory commission precedent for transactions or events. While KU has indicated that it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the regulatory commissions will not approve full recovery of and return on such costs or approve recovery on a timely basis in future regulatory decisions.\n68\n \nTable of Contents\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in continually assessing whether the regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the applicable regulatory environments, the ability to recover costs through regulated rates, and recent rate orders.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n(All Registrants)\nGeneral\nCapitalized terms and abbreviations appearing in the combined notes to financial statements are defined in the glossary. Dollars are in millions, except per share data, unless otherwise noted. The specific Registrant to which disclosures are applicable is identified in parenthetical headings in italics above the applicable disclosure or within the applicable disclosure for each Registrants' related activities and disclosures. Within combined disclosures, amounts are disclosed for any Registrant when significant.\nBusiness and Consolidation\n(PPL)\nPPL is a utility holding company that, through its regulated subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in: 1) the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas, primarily in Kentucky; 2) the transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Pennsylvania; and 3) the transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas in Rhode Island. Headquartered in Allentown, PA, PPL's principal subsidiaries are LG&E, KU, RIE and PPL Electric. PPL's corporate level financing subsidiary is PPL Capital Funding.\n95\n \nTable of Contents\nOn March 17, 2021, PPL WPD Limited entered into a share purchase agreement to sell PPL's U.K. utility business, which prior to its sale substantially represented PPL's U.K. Regulated segment, to a subsidiary of National Grid plc. The sale was completed on June 14, 2021. The results of operations of the U.K. utility business are classified as Discontinued Operations on PPL's Statements of Income for 2022. PPL has elected to separately report the cash flows of continuing and discontinued operations on the Statements of Cash Flows for 2022. Unless otherwise noted, the notes to these financial statements exclude amounts related to discontinued operations. See Note 9 for additional information.\nOn May 25, 2022, PPL Rhode Island Holdings, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PPL, acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric from National Grid U.S., a subsidiary of National Grid plc. Narragansett Electric, whose service area covers substantially all of Rhode Island, is primarily engaged in the transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and the distribution and sale of natural gas. The results of Narragansett Electric are included in the consolidated results of PPL from the date of the acquisition. Following the closing of the acquisition, Narragansett Electric provides services doing business under the name Rhode Island Energy (RIE). See Note 9 for additional information.\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nPPL Electric's principal business is the transmission and distribution of electricity to serve retail customers in its franchised territory in eastern and central Pennsylvania and the regulated supply of electricity to retail customers in that territory as a PLR.\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\n \nLG&E and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas. LG&E and KU maintain their separate identities and serve customers in Kentucky under their respective names. KU also serves customers in Virginia under the Old Dominion Power name.\n \n(All Registrants)\nThe financial statements of the Registrants include each company's own accounts as well as the accounts of all entities in which the company has a controlling financial interest. Entities for which a controlling financial interest is not demonstrated through voting interests are evaluated based on accounting guidance for Variable Interest Entities (VIEs). The Registrants consolidate a VIE when they are determined to have a controlling interest in the VIE and, as a result, are the primary beneficiary of the entity. Amounts consolidated under the VIE guidance are not material to the Registrants. \nAll significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated.\nThe financial statements of PPL, LG&E and KU include their share of any undivided interests in jointly owned facilities, as well as their share of the related operating costs of those facilities. See Note 11 for additional information.\nRegulation\n(All Registrants) \nPPL Electric, RIE, LG&E and KU are cost-based rate-regulated utilities for which rates are set by regulators to enable PPL Electric, RIE, LG&E and KU to recover the costs of providing electric or gas service, as applicable, and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders. Base rates are generally established based on a future test period. As a result, the financial statements are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP and reflect the effects of regulatory actions. Regulatory assets are recognized for the effect of transactions or events where future recovery of underlying costs is probable in regulated customer rates. The effect of such accounting is to defer certain or qualifying costs that would otherwise currently be charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities are recognized for amounts expected to be returned through future regulated customer rates. In certain cases, regulatory liabilities are recorded based on an understanding or agreement with the regulator that rates have been set to recover expected future costs, and the regulated entity is accountable for any amounts charged pursuant to such rates and not yet expended for the intended purpose. The accounting for regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities is based on specific ratemaking decisions or precedent for each transaction or event as prescribed by the FERC or the applicable state regulatory commissions. See Note 7 for additional details regarding regulatory matters.\nAccounting Records\nThe system of accounts for regulated entities is maintained in accordance with the Uniform System of Accounts prescribed by the FERC and adopted by the applicable state regulatory commissions.\n96\n \nTable of Contents\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nLoss Accruals\nPotential losses are accrued when (1) information is available that indicates it is \"probable\" that a loss has been incurred, given the likelihood of uncertain future events and (2) the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Accounting guidance defines \"probable\" as cases in which \"the future event or events are likely to occur.\" The Registrants continuously assess potential loss contingencies for environmental remediation, litigation claims, regulatory penalties and other events. Loss accruals for environmental remediation are discounted when appropriate.\nThe accrual of contingencies that might result in gains is not recorded, unless realization is assured.\nEarnings Per Share\n \n(PPL)\nEPS is computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method for computing EPS that treats a participating security as having rights to earnings that would otherwise have been available to common shareowners. Share-based payment awards that provide recipients a non-forfeitable right to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities.\nPrice Risk Management\n(All Registrants)\nInterest rate contracts are used to hedge exposure to changes in the fair value of debt instruments and to hedge exposure to variability in expected cash flows associated with existing floating-rate debt instruments or forecasted fixed-rate issuances of debt. Derivative instruments pursuant to regulator approved plans to manage commodity price risk associated with natural gas purchases to reduce fluctuations in natural gas prices and costs associated with these derivatives instruments are generally recoverable through approved cost recovery mechanism. Similar derivatives may receive different accounting treatment, depending on management's intended use and documentation.\nCertain contracts may not meet the definition of a derivative because they lack a notional amount or a net settlement provision. In cases where there is no net settlement provision, markets are periodically assessed to determine whether market mechanisms have evolved to facilitate net settlement. Certain derivative contracts may be excluded from the requirements of derivative accounting treatment because NPNS has been elected. These contracts are accounted for using accrual accounting. Contracts that have been classified as derivative contracts are reflected on the balance sheets at fair value. \nCash inflows and outflows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing activities on the Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the classification of the hedged items.\nPPL and its subsidiaries have elected not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.\nDerivative transactions may be marked to fair value through regulatory assets/liabilities at PPL Electric, RIE, LG&E and KU, if approved by the appropriate regulatory body. These transactions generally include the effect of interest rate swaps or commodity gas contracts that are included in customer rates.\nSee Notes 15 and 16 for additional information on derivatives.\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nTo meet their obligations as last resort providers of electricity supply to their customers, PPL Electric and RIE have entered into certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative. However, NPNS has been elected for these contracts.\n97\n \nTable of Contents\nRevenue \n(All Registrants)\nOperating revenues are primarily recorded based on energy deliveries through the end of each calendar month. Unbilled retail revenues result because customers' bills are rendered throughout the month, rather than at the end of the month. For RIE, LG&E and KU, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh or Mcf by the estimated average price per kWh or Mcf. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. For PPL Electric, unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying the actual unbilled volumes by the applicable tariff price.\nPPL Electric's, RIE's, LG&E's and KU's base rates are determined based on cost of service. Some regulators have also authorized the use of additional alternative revenue programs, which enable PPL Electric, RIE, LG&E and KU to adjust future rates based on past activities or completed events. Revenues from alternative revenue programs are recognized when the specific events permitting future billings have occurred. Revenues from alternative revenue programs are required to be presented separately from revenues from contracts with customers. These amounts are, however, presented as revenues from contracts with customers, with an offsetting adjustment to alternative revenue program revenue, when they are billed to customers in future periods. See Note 3 for additional information.\nFinancing and Other Receivables\n(All Registrants)\nAccounts receivable are reported on the Balance Sheets at the gross outstanding amount adjusted for an allowance for doubtful accounts. Financing receivables include accounts receivable, with the exception of those items within accounts receivable that are not subject to the current expected credit loss model.\nFinancing receivable collectability is evaluated using a current expected credit loss model, consisting of a combination of factors, including past due status based on contractual terms, trends in write-offs and the age of the receivable. Specific events, such as bankruptcies, are also considered when applicable. The Registrants also evaluate the impact of observable external factors on the collectability of the financing receivables to determine if adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts should be made based on current conditions or reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made based on the results of these analyses. Accounts receivable are written off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible.\nPPL Electric, RIE, LG&E and KU have identified one class of financing receivables, “accounts receivable - customer”, which includes financing receivables for all billed and unbilled sales with customers. All other financing receivables are classified as other.\nThe changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts are included in the following table. Amounts relate to financing receivables, except as noted. \nAdditions\nBalance at\nBeginning of Period\nCharged to Income\nDeductions (a)\nBalance at\nEnd of Period\nPPL\n \n \n \n2024\n$\n130\n \n$\n109\n \n$\n85\n \n$\n154\n \n(c)\n2023\n95\n \n87\n \n52\n \n130\n \n(c)\n2022\n69\n \n78\n \n52\n \n95\n \n(c)\nPPL Electric\n \n \n \n \n2024\n$\n50\n \n$\n56\n \n$\n65\n \n$\n41\n \n(b)\n2023\n33\n \n52\n \n35\n \n50\n \n(b)\n2022\n35\n \n27\n \n29\n \n33\n \n(b)\nLG&E\n \n \n \n2024\n$\n6\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n3\n \n2023\n4\n \n4\n \n2\n \n6\n \n2022\n3\n \n6\n \n5\n \n4\n \n98\n \nTable of Contents\nAdditions\nBalance at\nBeginning of Period\nCharged to Income\nDeductions (a)\nBalance at\nEnd of Period\nKU\n \n \n \n2024\n$\n2\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n2\n \n2023\n3\n \n3\n \n4\n \n2\n \n2022\n3\n \n6\n \n6\n \n3\n \n(a)\nPrimarily related to uncollectible accounts written off.\n(b)\nIncludes $\n2\n million, $\n3\n million and $\n3\n million related to other accounts receivable at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n(c)\nIncludes $\n39\n million, $\n41\n million and $\n36\n million related to other accounts receivable at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \nCash\n(All Registrants)\nCash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nBank deposits and other cash equivalents that are restricted by agreement or that have been clearly designated for a specific purpose are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents. On the Balance Sheets, the current portion of restricted cash and cash equivalents is included in \"Other current assets,\" while the noncurrent portion is included in \"Other noncurrent assets.\" See Note 15 for a reconciliation of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash reported within the Balance Sheets to the amounts shown on the Statements of Cash Flows.\n(All Registrants)\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Registrants value certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities at fair value. Generally, the most significant fair value measurements relate to price risk management assets and liabilities, investments in securities in defined benefit plans, and cash and cash equivalents. PPL and its subsidiaries use, as appropriate, a market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models) and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) to measure the fair value of an asset or liability. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk.\nThe Registrants classify fair value measurements within one of three levels in the fair value hierarchy. The level assigned to a fair value measurement is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\n•\nLevel 1\n - quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\n•\nLevel 2\n - inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n•\nLevel 3\n - unobservable inputs that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to measure the asset or liability at fair value.\n99\n \nTable of Contents\nAssessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment that considers factors specific to the asset or liability. As such, the Registrants' assessment of the significance of a particular input may affect how the assets and liabilities are classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nInvestments\nGenerally, the original maturity date of an investment and management's intent and ability to sell an investment prior to its original maturity determine the classification of investments as either short-term or long-term. Investments that would otherwise be classified as short-term, but are restricted as to withdrawal or use for other than current operations or are clearly designated for expenditure in the acquisition or construction of noncurrent assets or for the liquidation of long-term debts, are classified as long-term.\nInvestments in entities in which a company has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for under the equity method. All other investments are carried at cost or fair value. These investments are included in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Balance Sheets. Earnings from these investments are recorded in \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" on the Statements of Income.\nShort-term investments generally include certain deposits as well as securities that are considered highly liquid or provide for periodic reset of interest rates. Investments with original maturities greater than three months and less than a year, as well as investments with original maturities of greater than a year that management has the ability and intent to sell within a year, are included in \"Other current assets\" on the Balance Sheets.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nPP&E is recorded at original cost, unless impaired. If impaired, the asset is written down to fair value at that time, which becomes the new cost basis of the asset. PP&E acquired in business combinations is recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition. Original cost for constructed assets includes material, labor, contractor costs, certain overheads and financing costs, where applicable. Included in PP&E are capitalized costs of software projects that were developed or obtained for internal use. The cost of repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred. The Registrants record costs associated with planned major maintenance projects in the period in which work is performed and costs are incurred.\nAFUDC is capitalized at PPL Electric and RIE as part of the construction costs for cost-based rate-regulated projects for which a return on such costs is recovered after the project is placed in service. AFUDC is capitalized at LG&E and KU for certain projects as part of the construction cost of approved projects. LG&E and KU are generally provided a return on construction work in progress for other projects. The debt component of AFUDC is credited to \"Interest Expense\" and the equity component is credited to \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" on the Statements of Income.\nThe Registrants capitalize interest costs as part of construction costs.\n \nCapitalized interest, including the debt component of AFUDC, for the years ended December 31 is as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPPL\n$\n20\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n7\n \nPPL Electric \n9\n \n7\n \n5\n \nLG&E\n3\n \n1\n \n—\n \nKU\n4\n \n1\n \n—\n \nDepreciation\n \nDepreciation is recorded over the estimated useful lives of property using various methods including the straight-line, composite and group methods. When a component of PP&E that was depreciated under the composite or group method is retired, the original cost is charged to accumulated depreciation. When all or a significant portion of an operating unit that\nwas depreciated under the composite or group method is retired or sold, the property and the related accumulated depreciation account is reduced and any gain or loss is included in income, unless otherwise required by regulators. RIE, LG&E and KU accrue costs of removal net of estimated salvage value through depreciation, which is included in the calculation of customer rates over the assets' depreciable lives in accordance with regulatory practices. Cost of removal amounts accrued through depreciation rates are accumulated as a regulatory liability until the removal costs are incurred. For LG&E and KU, all ARO depreciation expenses are reclassified to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. See \"Asset Retirement Obligations\" below \n100\n \nTable of Contents\nand Note 7 for additional information. PPL Electric records net costs of removal when incurred as a regulatory asset. The regulatory asset is subsequently amortized through depreciation over a five-year period, which is recoverable in customer rates in accordance with regulatory practices.\nFollowing are the weighted-average annual rates of depreciation, for regulated utility plant, for the years ended December 31:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPPL\n3.20\n \n%\n3.26\n \n%\n3.21\n \n%\nPPL Electric\n2.52\n \n%\n2.62\n \n%\n2.75\n \n%\nLG&E\n4.02\n \n%\n4.00\n \n%\n4.16\n \n%\nKU\n3.86\n \n%\n3.95\n \n%\n4.01\n \n%\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n \nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination.\nOther acquired intangible assets are initially measured based on their fair value. Intangibles that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives based upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used. Costs incurred to obtain, renew or extend terms of an intangible asset are capitalized.\nWhen determining the useful life of an intangible asset, including intangible assets that are renewed or extended, PPL and its subsidiaries consider:\n•\nthe expected use of the asset;\n•\nthe expected useful life of other assets to which the useful life of the intangible asset may relate;\n•\nlegal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life;\n•\nthe company's historical experience as evidence of its ability to support renewal or extension;\n•\nthe effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors; and,\n•\nthe level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset.\nAsset Impairment (Excluding Investments)\nThe Registrants review long-lived assets that are subject to depreciation or amortization, including finite-lived intangibles, for impairment when events or circumstances indicate carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nA long-lived asset classified as held and used is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If impaired, the asset's carrying value is written down to its fair value.\nA long-lived asset classified as held for sale is impaired when the carrying amount of the asset (disposal group) exceeds its fair value less cost to sell. If impaired, the asset's (disposal group's) carrying value is written down to its fair value less cost to sell.\nPPL, LG&E and KU review goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a reporting unit may be greater than the unit's fair value. Additionally, goodwill must be tested for impairment in circumstances when a portion of goodwill has been allocated to a business to be disposed. PPL's, LG&E's and KU's reporting units are primarily at the operating segment level.\nGoodwill recognized upon the acquisition of Narragansett Electric was assigned for impairment testing by PPL to its reporting units expected to benefit from the acquisition, which were the Rhode Island Regulated reporting unit, the Pennsylvania Regulated reporting unit and the Kentucky Regulated reporting unit. See Note 9 for additional information regarding the acquisition.\nPPL, for its reporting units, and individually, LG&E and KU, may elect either to initially make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of an impairment of goodwill or to bypass the qualitative evaluation and test goodwill for impairment using a quantitative test. If the qualitative evaluation (referred to as step zero) is elected and the assessment results in a determination that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is not necessary. However, the quantitative impairment test is required if management concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount based on the step zero assessment. If the \n101\n \nTable of Contents\ncarrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nAs of October 1, 2024, PPL, for its reporting units, and individually, LG&E and KU, elected to perform the qualitative step zero evaluation of goodwill. These evaluations considered the excess of fair value over the carrying value of each reporting unit that was calculated during step one of the quantitative impairment tests performed in the fourth quarter of 2022, and the relevant events and circumstances that occurred since those tests were performed including:\n•\ncurrent year financial performance versus the prior year,\n•\nchanges in planned capital expenditures,\n•\nthe consistency of forecasted free cash flows,\n•\nearnings quality and sustainability,\n•\nchanges in market participant discount rates,\n•\nchanges in long-term growth rates,\n•\nchanges in PPL's market capitalization, and\n•\nthe overall economic and regulatory environments in which these regulated entities operate.\nBased on these evaluations, management concluded it was not more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units was less than their carrying value. As such, the step one quantitative impairment test was not performed and no impairment was recognized.\n \n(\nPPL, LG&E and KU\n)\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n \nPPL and its subsidiaries record liabilities to reflect various legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets. Initially, this obligation is measured at fair value and offset with an increase in the value of the capitalized asset, which is depreciated over the asset's useful life. Until the obligation is settled, the liability is increased through the recognition of accretion expense classified within \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income\n \nto reflect changes in the obligation due to the passage of time. For LG&E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal.\nEstimated ARO costs and settlement dates, which affect the carrying value of the ARO and the related capitalized asset, are reviewed periodically to ensure that any material changes are incorporated into the latest estimate of the ARO. Any change to the capitalized asset, positive or negative, is generally amortized over the remaining life of the associated long-lived asset. See Note 7 and Note 18 for additional information on AROs.\nCompensation and Benefits\nDefined Benefits\n \n(All Registrants)\nCertain PPL subsidiaries sponsor various defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. An asset or liability is recorded to recognize the funded status of all defined benefit plans with an offsetting entry to AOCI or, for LG&E, KU, RIE and PPL Electric, to regulatory assets or liabilities. Consequently, the funded status of all defined benefit plans is fully recognized on the Balance Sheets.\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets, which is calculated by rolling forward the prior year market-related value with contributions, disbursements and long-term expected return on investments. One-fifth of the difference between the actual value and the expected value is added (or subtracted if negative) to the expected value to determine the new market-related value.\nPPL and its subsidiaries, excluding RIE, use an accelerated amortization method for the recognition of gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plans. Under the accelerated method, actuarial gains and losses in excess of \n30\n% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over one-half of the required amortization period. Actuarial gains and losses in excess of \n10\n% of the greater of the plan's projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets and less than \n30\n% of the plan's projected benefit obligation are amortized on a straight-line basis over the full required amortization \n102\n \nTable of Contents\nperiod. RIE uses the standard amortization method under GAAP for recognition of gains and losses for its defined benefit pension plan.\nSee Note 7 for a discussion of the regulatory treatment of defined benefit costs and Note 10 for a discussion of defined benefits.\nStock-Based Compensation\n \n(PPL)\nPPL has several stock-based compensation plans for purposes of granting stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units to certain employees as well as stock units and restricted stock units to directors. PPL grants most stock-based compensation awards in the first quarter of each year. PPL recognizes compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards based on the fair value method. Forfeitures of awards are recognized when they occur. All awards are recorded as equity or a liability on the Balance Sheets. Stock-based compensation expense is primarily included in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income.\n \nTaxes\nIncome Taxes\n(All Registrants)\nPPL and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return.\nSignificant management judgment is required in developing the Registrants' provision for income taxes, primarily due to the uncertainty related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns and valuation allowances on deferred tax assets. \nThe Registrants use a two-step process to evaluate uncertain tax positions. The first step requires an entity to determine whether, based on the technical merits supporting a particular tax position, it is more likely than not (greater than a 50% chance) that the tax position will be sustained. This determination assumes that the relevant taxing authority will examine the tax position and is aware of all the relevant facts surrounding the tax position. The second step requires an entity to recognize in its financial statements the amount of the benefit of a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition criterion. The benefit recognized is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a likelihood of realization upon settlement that exceeds \n50\n%. Unrecognized tax benefits are classified as current to the extent management expects to settle the uncertain tax position by payment or receipt of cash within one year of the reporting date. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised by taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued and may materially impact the financial statements of the Registrants in future periods. At December 31, 2024, no significant changes in unrecognized tax benefits were projected over the next 12 months.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for accounting purposes and their basis for income tax purposes, as well as the tax effects of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\nThe Registrants record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amounts that are more-likely-than-not to be realized. The need for valuation allowances requires significant management judgment. If the Registrants determine that they are able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of recorded net deferred tax assets, adjustments to the valuation allowances increase income by reducing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. Likewise, if the Registrants determine that they are not able to realize all or part of net deferred tax assets in the future, adjustments to the valuation allowances would decrease income by increasing tax expense in the period that such determination is made. The amount of deferred tax assets ultimately realized may differ materially from the estimates utilized in the computation of valuation allowances and may materially impact the financial statements in the future\n.\nThe Registrants defer investment tax credits when the credits are generated and amortize the deferred amounts over the average lives of the related assets. With respect to acquired renewable tax credits, pursuant to the IRA, any benefit is recognized in the period the credits can be utilized.\nThe Registrants recognize tax-related interest and penalties in \"Income Taxes\" on their Statements of Income.\nThe Registrants use the portfolio approach method of accounting for deferred taxes related to pre-tax OCI transactions. The portfolio approach involves a strict period-by-period cumulative incremental allocation of income taxes to the change in income and losses reflected in OCI. Under this approach, the net cumulative tax effect is ignored. The net change in unrealized gains \n103\n \nTable of Contents\nand losses recorded in AOCI under this approach would be eliminated only on the date the investment portfolio is classified as held for sale or is liquidated.\nSee Note 6 to the Financial Statements for income tax disclosures.\nThe provision for the Registrants' deferred income taxes related to regulatory assets and liabilities is based upon the ratemaking principles reflected in rates established by relevant regulators. The difference in the provision for deferred income taxes for regulatory assets and liabilities and the amount that otherwise would be recorded under GAAP is deferred and included on the Balance Sheets in noncurrent \"Regulatory assets\" or \"Regulatory liabilities.\"\n(PPL Electric, LG&E and KU) \nThe income tax provision for PPL Electric, LG&E and KU is calculated in accordance with an intercompany tax sharing agreement, which provides that taxable income be calculated as if PPL Electric, LG&E, KU and any domestic subsidiaries each filed a separate return. Tax benefits are not shared between companies. The entity that generates a tax benefit is the entity that is entitled to the tax benefit. The effect of PPL filing a consolidated tax return is taken into account in the settlement of current taxes and the recognition of deferred taxes.\nAt December 31, the following intercompany tax receivables (payables) were recorded: \n2024\n2023\nPPL Electric\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n(\n21\n)\nLG&E\n(\n2\n)\n(\n5\n)\nKU\n(\n5\n)\n(\n3\n)\nTaxes, Other Than Income\n \n(All Registrants)\nThe Registrants present sales taxes in \"Other current liabilities\" on the Balance Sheets.

Fuel costs for electricity generation are charged to expense as used. For RIE, natural gas supply costs are charged to expense when delivered to customers.

However, there are certain guarantees excluded from the scope of accounting guidance and other guarantees that are not subject to the initial recognition and measurement provisions of accounting guidance that only require disclosure. See Note 12 for further discussion of guarantees.\nNew Accounting Guidance Adopted \n(All Registrants)\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nEffective December 31, 2024, the Registrants retrospectively adopted accounting guidance to improve segment disclosures. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The standard also requires public entities to disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) and explain how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. Certain segment-related disclosures that previously were required only on an annual basis will be required to be disclosed in interim periods. In addition, public entities that have a single reportable segment are now required to provide segment disclosures.\nThe adoption of this guidance resulted in the Registrants including the required additional disclosures within the notes to the financial statements. See Note 2 for additional information.\n2. Segment and Related Information \n(PPL)\nPPL is organized into \nthree\n segments, broken down by geographic location: Kentucky Regulated, Pennsylvania Regulated, and Rhode Island Regulated.\nThe Kentucky Regulated segment consists primarily of the regulated electricity generation, transmission and distribution operations conducted by LG&E and KU, as well as LG&E's regulated transmission, distribution and sale of natural gas.\nThe Pennsylvania Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution operations of PPL Electric.\nThe Rhode Island Regulated segment includes the regulated electricity transmission and distribution and natural gas distribution operations of RIE, which was acquired in May of 2022.\n\"Corporate and Other\" primarily includes corporate level financing costs, certain unallocated corporate costs, and certain non-recoverable costs incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of Rhode Island Energy and the financial results of Safari Energy, prior to its sale on November 1, 2022. \"Corporate and Other\" is presented to reconcile segment information to PPL's consolidated results and is not a reportable segment. \nPPL's CODM is the Corporate Leadership Council (CLC), which is a management committee that is comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Legal Officer.\nThe CLC uses financial metrics including segment net income, earnings from ongoing operations, earnings per share and return on equity, as well as various operational metrics to assess segment performance and make investment and resource decisions.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n(All Registrants)\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which the Registrants and PPL’s segments generate their revenues.\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nPennsylvania Regulated Segment Revenue\nThe Pennsylvania Regulated segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from PPL Electric’s tariff-based distribution and transmission of electricity.\nDistribution Revenue\nPPL Electric provides distribution services to residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and governmental end users of energy. PPL Electric satisfies its performance obligation to its distribution customers and revenue is recognized over time as electricity is delivered and simultaneously consumed by the customer. The amount of revenue recognized is the volume of electricity delivered during the period multiplied by the price per tariff, plus a monthly fixed charge. This method of recognition fairly presents PPL Electric's transfer of electric service to the customer as the calculation is based on volumes delivered, and the price per tariff and the monthly fixed charge are set by the PAPUC. Customers are typically billed monthly and outstanding amounts are normally due within \n21\n days of the date of the bill. \nDistribution customers are \"at will\" customers of PPL Electric with no term contract and no minimum purchase commitment. Performance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with PPL Electric’s retail account contracts.\nCertain customers have the option to obtain electricity from other suppliers where PPL Electric facilitates the delivery. In those circumstances, revenue is only recognized for providing delivery of the commodity to the customer.\nTransmission Revenue\nPPL Electric generates transmission revenues from a FERC-approved PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff. An annual revenue requirement for PPL Electric to provide transmission services is calculated using a formula-based rate. This revenue requirement is converted into a daily rate (dollars per day). PPL Electric satisfies its performance obligation to provide transmission services and revenue is recognized over time as transmission services are provided and consumed. This method of recognition fairly presents PPL Electric's transfer of transmission services as the daily rate is set by a FERC approved formula-based rate. PJM remits payment on a weekly basis.\nPPL Electric's agreement to provide transmission services contains no minimum purchase commitment. The performance obligation is limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, PPL Electric has no unsatisfied performance obligations.\n(PPL)\nRhode Island Regulated Segment Revenues\nThe Rhode Island Regulated segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from RIE’s regulated tariff-based transmission and distribution of electricity and regulated tariff-based distribution of natural gas.\nDistribution Revenue\nDistribution revenues are primarily from the sale of electricity, natural gas, and related services to retail customers. Distribution sales are regulated by the RIPUC, which is responsible for approving the rates and other terms of services as part of the rate making process. Natural gas and electric distribution revenues are derived from the regulated sale and distribution of electricity and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers within RIE’s service territory under the tariff rates. The performance obligation related to distribution sales is to provide electricity and natural gas to customers on demand. The \n109\n \nTable of Contents\nperformance obligation is satisfied over time because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the electricity or natural gas as services are provided. RIE records revenues related to the distribution sales based upon the approved tariff rate and the volume delivered to the customers, which corresponds with the amount RIE has the right to invoice. Customers are typically billed monthly and outstanding amounts are normally due within \n21\n days of date of the bill.\nDistribution revenue also includes estimated unbilled amounts, which represent the estimated amounts due from retail customers as a result of customer's bills rendered throughout the month, rather than bills being rendered at the end of the month. Unbilled revenues are determined based on estimated unbilled sales volumes and then applying tariff rates to those volumes. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. This method of recognition fairly presents RIE's transfer of electricity and natural gas to the customer as the amount recognized is based on actual and estimated volumes delivered and the tariff rate per unit of energy and any applicable fixed charges or regulatory mechanisms as approved by the respective regulatory body.\nDistribution customers are \"at will\" customers of RIE with no term contract and no minimum purchase commitment. Performance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with RIE's retail account contracts.\nCertain customers have the option to obtain electricity or natural gas from other suppliers where RIE facilitates the delivery. In those circumstances, revenue is only recognized for providing delivery of the commodity to the customer.\nTransmission Revenue\nRIE’s transmission services are regulated by the FERC and coordinated with ISO – New England (ISO-NE). As of January 1, 2023, RIE is a transmission operator. These revenues arise under tariff/rate agreements and are collected primarily from RIE’s distribution customers. The revenue is recognized over time as transmission services are provided and consumed. This method of recognition fairly presents RIE’s transfer of transmission services as the daily rate is set by a FERC-approved formula-based rate.\nRIE's agreement to provide transmission services contains no minimum purchase commitment. The performance obligation is limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, RIE has no unsatisfied performance obligations.\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nKentucky Regulated Segment Revenue\n \nThe Kentucky Regulated Segment generates substantially all of its revenues from contracts with customers from LG&E's and KU's regulated tariff-based sales of electricity and LG&E's regulated tariff-based sales of natural gas.\nLG&E and KU are engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Kentucky and, in KU's case, Virginia. LG&E also engages in the distribution and sale of natural gas in Kentucky. Revenue from these activities is generated from tariffs approved by applicable regulatory authorities including the FERC, KPSC and VSCC. LG&E and KU satisfy their performance obligations upon LG&E's and KU's delivery of electricity and LG&E's delivery of natural gas to customers. This revenue is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by LG&E and KU. The amount of revenue recognized is the billed volume of electricity or natural gas delivered multiplied by a tariff rate per-unit of energy, plus any applicable fixed charges or additional regulatory mechanisms. Customers are billed monthly and outstanding amounts are typically due within \n22\n days of the date of the bill. Additionally, unbilled revenues are recognized as a result of customers' bills rendered throughout the month, rather than bills being rendered at the end of the month. Unbilled revenues for a month are calculated by multiplying an estimate of unbilled kWh or Mcf delivered but not yet billed by the estimated average cents per kWh or Mcf. Any difference between estimated and actual revenues is adjusted the following month when the previous unbilled estimate is reversed and actual billings occur. This method of recognition fairly presents LG&E's and KU's transfer of electricity and LG&E's transfer of natural gas to the customer as the amount recognized is based on actual and estimated volumes delivered and the tariff rate per-unit of energy and any applicable fixed charges or regulatory mechanisms as set by the respective regulatory body.\nLG&E's and KU's customers generally have no minimum purchase commitment. Performance obligations are limited to the service requested and received to date. Accordingly, there is no unsatisfied performance obligation associated with these customers.\n110\n \nTable of Contents\n(All Registrants)\nThe following table reconciles \"Operating Revenues\" included in each Registrant's Statement of Income with revenues generated from contracts with customers for the years ended December\n \n31:\n2024\nPPL\nPPL Electric\nLG&E\nKU\nOperating Revenues (a)(b)\n$\n8,462\n \n$\n2,876\n \n$\n1,648\n \n$\n1,964\n \nRevenues derived from:\nAlternative revenue programs (c)\n5\n \n(\n19\n)\n13\n \n16\n \nOther (d)\n(\n23\n)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\n$\n8,444\n \n$\n2,842\n \n$\n1,657\n \n$\n1,976\n \n2023\nPPL\nPPL Electric\nLG&E\nKU\nOperating Revenues (a)(b)\n$\n8,312\n \n$\n3,008\n \n$\n1,613\n \n$\n1,884\n \nRevenues derived from:\nAlternative revenue programs (c)\n1\n \n5\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n5\n)\nOther (d)\n(\n23\n)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\n$\n8,290\n \n$\n2,998\n \n$\n1,608\n \n$\n1,875\n \n2022\nPPL\nPPL Electric\nLG&E\nKU\nOperating Revenues (a)(b)\n$\n7,902\n \n$\n3,030\n \n$\n1,798\n \n$\n2,074\n \nRevenues derived from:\nAlternative revenue programs (c)\n(\n92\n)\n(\n56\n)\n9\n \n5\n \nOther (d)\n(\n24\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n4\n)\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\n$\n7,786\n \n$\n2,960\n \n$\n1,801\n \n$\n2,075\n \n(a)\nPPL includes $\n2,024\n million, $\n1,851\n million and $\n1,038\n million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 of revenues from external customers reported by the Rhode Island Regulated segment. PPL Electric represents revenues from external customers reported by the Pennsylvania Regulated segment and LG&E and KU, net of intercompany power sales and transmission revenues, represent revenues from external customers reported by the Kentucky Regulated segment. See Note 2 for additional information.\n(b)\nPPL's transition services agreement associated with the RIE acquisition ended in the third quarter of 2024. In conjunction with the completion of the agreement, PPL conformed the presentation of RIE's and the Rhode Island Regulated segment’s net metering charges with the presentation of the other segments, resulting in an increase in Operating Revenues and a corresponding increase in Energy purchases beginning on January 1, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net metering of $\n175\n million was included in Energy purchases on PPL's Statement of Income. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, $\n146\n million and $\n79\n million of net metering was presented as a reduction of Operating Revenues on PPL's Statement of Income. \n(c)\nThis line item shows the over/under collection of rate mechanisms deemed alternative revenue programs with over-collections of revenue shown as positive amounts in the table above and under collections as negative amounts. \n(d)\nRepresents additional revenues outside the scope of revenues from contracts with customers such as leases and other miscellaneous revenues.\nThe following table shows revenues from contracts with customers disaggregated by customer class for the years ended December\n \n31:\nResidential\nCommercial\nIndustrial\nOther (a)\nWholesale - municipality\nWholesale - other (b)\nTransmission\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nPPL\n2024\nPA Regulated\n$\n1,502\n \n$\n418\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n818\n \n$\n2,842\n \nRI Regulated (c)\n1,150\n \n593\n \n91\n \n10\n \n—\n \n—\n \n176\n \n2,020\n \nKY Regulated\n1,510\n \n1,028\n \n635\n \n323\n \n23\n \n63\n \n—\n \n3,582\n \nTotal PPL\n$\n4,162\n \n$\n2,039\n \n$\n773\n \n$\n390\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n63\n \n$\n994\n \n$\n8,444\n \n111\n \nTable of Contents\nResidential\nCommercial\nIndustrial\nOther (a)\nWholesale - municipality\nWholesale - other (b)\nTransmission\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\n2023\nPA Regulated\n$\n1,649\n \n$\n444\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n54\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n796\n \n$\n2,998\n \nRI Regulated\n640\n \n228\n \n20\n \n793\n \n—\n \n—\n \n170\n \n1,851\n \nKY Regulated\n1,458\n \n1,001\n \n637\n \n272\n \n22\n \n50\n \n—\n \n3,440\n \nCorp and Other\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \nTotal PPL\n$\n3,747\n \n$\n1,673\n \n$\n712\n \n$\n1,120\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n50\n \n$\n966\n \n$\n8,290\n \n2022\nPA Regulated\n$\n1,647\n \n$\n491\n \n$\n85\n \n$\n54\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n683\n \n$\n2,960\n \nRI Regulated\n299\n \n101\n \n9\n \n478\n \n—\n \n—\n \n101\n \n988\n \nKY Regulated\n1,637\n \n1,068\n \n662\n \n323\n \n28\n \n97\n \n—\n \n3,815\n \nCorp and Other\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n23\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n23\n \nTotal PPL\n$\n3,583\n \n$\n1,660\n \n$\n756\n \n$\n878\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n97\n \n$\n784\n \n$\n7,786\n \nPPL Electric\n2024\n$\n1,502\n \n$\n418\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n818\n \n$\n2,842\n \n2023\n$\n1,649\n \n$\n444\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n54\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n796\n \n$\n2,998\n \n2022\n$\n1,647\n \n$\n491\n \n$\n85\n \n$\n54\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n683\n \n$\n2,960\n \nLG&E\n2024\n$\n754\n \n$\n518\n \n$\n188\n \n$\n147\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n50\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,657\n \n2023\n$\n751\n \n$\n517\n \n$\n189\n \n$\n104\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,608\n \n2022\n$\n835\n \n$\n551\n \n$\n199\n \n$\n141\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,801\n \nKU\n2024\n$\n756\n \n$\n510\n \n$\n447\n \n$\n176\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n64\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,976\n \n2023\n$\n707\n \n$\n484\n \n$\n448\n \n$\n168\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n46\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,875\n \n2022\n$\n802\n \n$\n517\n \n$\n463\n \n$\n182\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n83\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,075\n \n(a)\nPrimarily includes revenues from pole attachments, street lighting, other public authorities and other non-core businesses.

This resulted in certain customer revenues for the Rhode Island Regulated segment, which were previously presented in the \"Other\" category, being presented in the \"Residential\", \"Commercial\" or \"Industrial\" customer classes beginning on January 1, 2024. Applying the previous methodology to 2024 revenues would result in $\n469\n million of Residential, $\n372\n million of Commercial and $\n88\n million of Industrial for the Rhode Island Regulated segment being presented as \"Other\" for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAs discussed in Note 2, PPL segments its business by geographic location. Revenues from external customers for each segment/geographic location are reconciled to revenues from contracts with customers in the footnotes to the tables above.

PPL and LG&E are currently reviewing the revenue procedure to determine what impact the guidance may have on their financial statements.\n7. Utility Rate Regulation\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\n(All Registrants)\nPPL, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU reflect the effects of regulatory actions in the financial statements for their rate-regulated utility operations. Regulatory assets and liabilities are classified as current if, upon initial recognition, the entire amount related to an item will be recovered or refunded within a year of the balance sheet date.\n121\n \nTable of Contents\n(PPL)\nRIE is subject to the jurisdiction of the RIPUC, the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers, and the FERC. RIE operates under a FERC-approved open access transmission tariff. RIE's base distribution rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on rate base. Certain other recovery mechanisms exist to recover expenses and capital investments with a return on rate base separate from the base distribution rate case process.\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nLG&E is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC and the FERC, and KU is subject to the jurisdiction of the KPSC, the VSCC and the FERC.\nLG&E's and KU's Kentucky base rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on capitalization (common equity, long-term debt and short-term debt) including adjustments for certain net investments and costs recovered separately through other means. As such, LG&E and KU generally earn a return on regulatory assets.\n(PPL and KU)\nKU's Virginia base rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except for regulatory assets and liabilities related to the levelized fuel factor, accumulated deferred income taxes, pension and postretirement benefits, and AROs related to certain CCR impoundments, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the calculation of Virginia base rates, no return is earned on the related assets.\nKU's rates to municipal customers for wholesale power requirements are calculated based on annual updates to a formula rate that utilizes a return on rate base (net utility plant plus working capital less accumulated deferred income taxes and miscellaneous deductions). As all regulatory assets and liabilities, except accumulated deferred income taxes, are excluded from the return on rate base utilized in the development of municipal rates, no return is earned on the related assets. \n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nPPL Electric is subject to the jurisdiction of the PAPUC and the FERC. PPL Electric's distribution base rates are calculated based on recovery of costs as well as a return on distribution rate base (net utility plant plus a working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions). PPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC tariff that allows for recovery of transmission costs incurred, a return on transmission-related rate base (net utility plant plus a working capital allowance less plant-related deferred taxes and other miscellaneous additions and deductions) and an automatic annual update. See \"Transmission Formula Rate\" below for additional information on this tariff. All regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from distribution and transmission return on investment calculations; therefore, generally no return is earned on PPL Electric's regulatory assets.\n(All Registrants)\nThe following table provides information about the regulatory assets and liabilities of cost-based rate-regulated utility operations at December 31:\n122\n \nTable of Contents\n \nPPL\nPPL Electric\nLG&E\nKU\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCurrent Regulatory Assets:\n \n \n \n \nRate adjustment mechanism\n$\n95\n \n$\n118\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nRenewable energy certificates\n14\n \n14\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDerivative instruments\n3\n \n51\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nSmart meter rider\n7\n \n6\n \n7\n \n6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nStorm damage expense rider\n68\n \n12\n \n68\n \n12\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTransmission service charge\n44\n \n43\n \n27\n \n31\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTransmission formula rate\n14\n \n5\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nISR deferral\n22\n \n11\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nGas line tracker\n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTCJA customer refund and recovery\n21\n \n—\n \n21\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDSIC\n8\n \n7\n \n8\n \n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nOther\n20\n \n26\n \n—\n \n1\n \n4\n \n7\n \n1\n \n3\n \nTotal current regulatory assets \n$\n320\n \n$\n293\n \n$\n133\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n3\n \nNoncurrent Regulatory Assets:\n \n \n \nDefined benefit plans \n$\n967\n \n$\n887\n \n$\n473\n \n$\n417\n \n$\n226\n \n$\n217\n \n$\n149\n \n$\n136\n \nPlant outage cost\n30\n \n38\n \n—\n \n—\n \n7\n \n10\n \n23\n \n28\n \nNet metering\n147\n \n112\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEnvironmental cost recovery\n96\n \n99\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nStorm costs\n113\n \n97\n \n22\n \n—\n \n20\n \n15\n \n29\n \n14\n \nUnamortized loss on debt\n20\n \n22\n \n3\n \n3\n \n9\n \n10\n \n6\n \n7\n \nInterest rate swaps\n4\n \n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTerminated interest rate swaps\n53\n \n58\n \n—\n \n—\n \n31\n \n34\n \n22\n \n24\n \nAccumulated cost of removal of utility plant\n173\n \n178\n \n173\n \n178\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAROs\n280\n \n289\n \n—\n \n—\n \n75\n \n76\n \n205\n \n213\n \nRetired asset recovery\n83\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n83\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDerivative instruments\n1\n \n8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nGas line inspections\n24\n \n21\n \n—\n \n—\n \n22\n \n19\n \n2\n \n2\n \nAdvanced metering infrastructure\n28\n \n15\n \n—\n \n—\n \n14\n \n7\n \n14\n \n8\n \nOther\n41\n \n43\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n8\n \n7\n \nTotal noncurrent regulatory assets\n$\n2,060\n \n$\n1,874\n \n$\n673\n \n$\n598\n \n$\n491\n \n$\n395\n \n$\n458\n \n$\n439\n \nPPL\nPPL Electric\nLG&E\nKU\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCurrent Regulatory Liabilities:\nGeneration supply charge\n$\n52\n \n$\n51\n \n$\n52\n \n$\n51\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nTCJA customer refund and recovery\n—\n \n5\n \n—\n \n5\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAct 129 compliance rider\n2\n \n15\n \n2\n \n15\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTransmission formula rate\n1\n \n21\n \n—\n \n18\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nRate adjustment mechanism\n71\n \n72\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEnergy efficiency\n25\n \n23\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nGas supply clause\n—\n \n15\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n15\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDSM\n17\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n7\n \n—\n \n10\n \n1\n \nEnvironmental cost recovery\n12\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n6\n \n—\n \n6\n \n—\n \nOther\n43\n \n22\n \n3\n \n2\n \n1\n \n1\n \n6\n \n—\n \nTotal current regulatory liabilities\n \n$\n223\n \n$\n225\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n91\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n22\n \n$\n1\n \n123\n \nTable of Contents\nPPL\nPPL Electric\nLG&E\nKU\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNoncurrent Regulatory Liabilities:\n \n \n \n \nAccumulated cost of removal of utility plant\n$\n1,022\n \n$\n996\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n314\n \n$\n306\n \n$\n408\n \n$\n399\n \nPower purchase agreement - OVEC\n10\n \n19\n \n—\n \n—\n \n7\n \n13\n \n3\n \n6\n \nNet deferred taxes\n1,899\n \n1,977\n \n739\n \n763\n \n439\n \n459\n \n498\n \n523\n \nDefined benefit plans\n294\n \n252\n \n100\n \n73\n \n24\n \n20\n \n65\n \n59\n \nTerminated interest rate swaps\n54\n \n57\n \n—\n \n—\n \n27\n \n29\n \n27\n \n28\n \nEnergy efficiency\n16\n \n5\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nOther\n40\n \n34\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n8\n \n3\n \nTotal noncurrent regulatory liabilities\n$\n3,335\n \n$\n3,340\n \n$\n839\n \n$\n836\n \n$\n815\n \n$\n827\n \n$\n1,009\n \n$\n1,018\n \n`\nFollowing is an overview of selected regulatory assets and liabilities detailed in the preceding tables. Specific developments with respect to certain of these regulatory assets and liabilities are discussed in \"Regulatory Matters.\"\nDefined Benefit Plans\n(All Registrants)\nDefined benefit plan regulatory assets and liabilities represent prior service cost and net actuarial gains and losses that will be recovered in defined benefit plans expense through future base rates based upon established regulatory practices and, generally, are amortized over the average remaining service lives of plan participants. These regulatory assets and liabilities are adjusted at least annually or whenever the funded status of defined benefit plans is remeasured.\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nAs a result of previous rate case settlements and orders, the difference between pension cost calculated in accordance with LG&E's and KU's pension accounting policy and pension cost calculated using a \n15\n-year amortization period for actuarial gains and losses and settlements are recorded as a regulatory asset. As of December 31, 2024, the balances were $\n79\n million for PPL, $\n44\n million for LG&E and $\n35\n million for KU. As of December 31, 2023, the balances were $\n86\n million for PPL, $\n46\n million for LG&E and $\n40\n million for KU.\n \n(PPL)\nRIE is subject to a pension rate adjustment mechanism whereby the difference in amounts allowed to be recovered in rates versus actual costs of RIE’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans that are to be recovered from or passed back to customers in future periods, are also recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities.\n(All Registrants)\nStorm Costs\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU have the ability to request from the PAPUC, the KPSC and the VSCC, as applicable, the authority to treat expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory asset and defer such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes. Once such authority is granted, LG&E and KU can request recovery of those expenses in a base rate case and begin amortizing the costs when recovery starts. PPL Electric can recover qualifying expenses caused by major storm events, as defined in its retail tariff, over \nthree years\n through the Storm Damage Expense Rider commencing in the application year after the storm occurred. LG&E's and KU's regulatory assets for storm costs approved for base rate recovery are being amortized through various dates ending in 2031.\nAs provided in the Amended Settlement Agreement (ASA), RIE has the authority from the RIPUC to treat certain incremental O&M expenses related to specific extraordinary storms as a regulatory asset and defer such costs for regulatory accounting and reporting purposes. Once all expenses for the extraordinary storm have been finalized, RIE files a final accounting of those storm expenses with the RIPUC that is subject to review by the RIPUC and the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers.\n124\n \nTable of Contents\nUnamortized Loss on Debt\nUnamortized loss on reacquired debt represents losses on long-term debt refinanced, reacquired or redeemed that have been deferred and will be amortized and recovered over either the original life of the extinguished debt or the life of the replacement debt (in the case of refinancing). Such costs are being amortized through 2053 for PPL Electric, through 2042 for KU, and through 2044 for LG&E.\nAccumulated Cost of Removal of Utility Plant\nRIE, LG&E and KU charge costs of removal through depreciation expense with an offsetting credit to a regulatory liability. The regulatory liability is relieved as costs are incurred.\nPPL Electric does not accrue for costs of removal. When costs of removal are incurred, PPL Electric records the costs as a regulatory asset. Such deferral is included in rates and amortized over the subsequent \nfive\n-year period.\nNet Deferred Taxes\nRegulatory liabilities associated with net deferred taxes represent the future revenue impact from the adjustment of deferred income taxes required primarily for excess deferred taxes and unamortized investment tax credits, largely a result of the TCJA. \n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nDistribution System Improvement Charge (DSIC)\n \nThe DSIC is authorized under Act 11 and is considered an alternative ratemaking mechanism providing more timely cost recovery of qualifying distribution system capital improvements. DSIC is charged to all customers taking distribution service as a percentage of total distribution revenue (excluding State Tax Adjustment Surcharge). DSIC is capped at 5% of the total amount billed to all customers for distribution service (including reconcilable riders) which provides a safeguard for customers. PPL Electric is permitted to utilize the DSIC mechanism so long as the rolling 12-month ROE for the applicable period does not exceed the PAPUC ROE in the company’s PAPUC quarterly financial report filing. The DSIC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year.\nGeneration Supply Charge (GSC)\nThe GSC is a cost recovery mechanism that permits PPL Electric to recover costs incurred to provide generation supply to PLR customers who receive basic generation supply service. The recovery includes charges for generation supply, as well as administration of the acquisition process. In addition, the GSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior periods is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent rate filing period.\nTransmission Service Charge (TSC)\nPPL Electric is charged by PJM for transmission service-related costs applicable to its PLR customers. PPL Electric passes these costs on to customers, who receive basic generation supply service through the PAPUC-approved TSC cost recovery mechanism. The TSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year.\nRIE arranges transmission service on behalf of its customers and bills the costs of those services to customers, pursuant to its Transmission Service Cost Adjustment Provision. \nThe TSC contains a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from customers is either refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year.\nTransmission Formula Rate\nPPL Electric's transmission revenues are billed in accordance with a FERC-approved Open Access Transmission Tariff that utilizes a formula-based rate recovery mechanism. Under this formula, beginning in 2023, rates are put into effect on January 1st of each year based upon actual expenditures from the most recently filed FERC Form 1, forecasted capital additions, and other data based on PPL Electric’s books and records. 2023 was considered a transitional period as the calendar year rate \n125\n \nTable of Contents\napproved by FERC became effective April 1, 2023. Rates are compared during the year to the estimated annual expenses and capital additions that will be filed in PPL Electric’s annual FERC Form 1, filed under the FERC's Uniform System of Accounts. Under the mechanism, any difference between the revenue requirement in effect and actual expenditures incurred for that year is recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability, and the regulatory asset or regulatory liability is to be recovered from or returned to customers starting one year after the conclusion of the rate year.\nStorm Damage Expense Rider (SDER)\nThe SDER is a reconcilable automatic adjustment clause under which PPL Electric annually will compare actual storm costs to storm costs allowed in base rates and refund or recover any differences from customers. In the 2015 rate case settlement approved by the PAPUC in November 2015, it was determined that reportable storm damage expenses to be recovered annually through base rates will be set at $\n20\n million. The SDER will recover from or refund to customers the applicable expenses from reportable storms as compared to the $\n20\n million recovered annually through base rates. \nAct 129 Compliance Rider\nIn compliance with Pennsylvania's Act 129 of 2008 and implementing regulations, PPL Electric is currently in Phase IV of the energy efficiency and conservation plan which was approved in March 2021. Phase IV allows PPL Electric to recover the maximum $\n313\n million over the \nfive\n-year period, June 1, 2021 through May 31, 2026. The plan includes programs intended to reduce electricity consumption. The recoverable costs include direct and indirect charges, including design and development costs, general and administrative costs and applicable state evaluator costs. The rates are applied to customers who receive distribution service through the Act 129 Compliance Rider. The actual Phase IV program costs are reconcilable after each 12-month period, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered over the next rate filing period. \nSmart Meter Rider (SMR)\nAct 129 requires each electric distribution company (EDC) with more than 100,000 customers to have a PAPUC approved Smart Meter Technology Procurement and Installation Plan (SMP). As of December 31, 2019, PPL Electric replaced substantially all of its old meters with meters that meet the Act 129 requirements under its SMP. In accordance with Act 129, EDCs are able to recover the costs and earn a return on capital of providing smart metering technology. PPL Electric uses the SMR to recover the costs to implement its SMP. The SMR is a reconciliation mechanism whereby any over- or under-recovery from prior years is refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent quarters.\nUniversal Service Rider (USR)\nThe USR provides for recovery of costs associated with universal service programs, OnTrack and Winter Relief Assistance Program (WRAP), provided by PPL Electric to residential customers. OnTrack is a special payment program for low-income households and WRAP provides low-income customers a means to reduce electric bills through energy saving methods. The USR rate is applied to residential customers who receive distribution service. The actual program costs are reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year.\nTCJA Customer Refund and Recovery\nAs a result of the reduced U.S federal corporate income tax rate as enacted by the TCJA, the PAPUC ruled that these tax benefits should be refunded to customers. Timing differences between the recognition of these tax benefits and the refund of the benefit to the customer creates a regulatory liability. PPL Electric's liability is being credited back to distribution customers through a temporary negative surcharge and remains in place until PPL Electric files and the PAPUC approves new base rates. The TCJA is reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year.\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nFuel Adjustment Clauses\nLG&E's and KU's retail electric rates contain a fuel adjustment clause, whereby variances in power purchases and the cost of fuel to generate electricity, including transportation costs, from the costs embedded in base rates are adjusted in LG&E's and KU's rates. The KPSC requires formal reviews at six-month intervals to examine past fuel adjustments and at two-year intervals to review past operations of the fuel adjustment clause and, to the extent appropriate, may conduct public hearings and \n126\n \nTable of Contents\nreestablish the fuel charge included in base rates. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered within \n12\n months. \nKU also employs a levelized fuel factor mechanism for Virginia customers using an average fuel cost factor based primarily on projected fuel costs and load for the fuel year (12 months ending March 31). The Virginia levelized fuel factor allows fuel recovery based on projected fuel costs for the fuel year plus an adjustment for any under- or over-recovery of fuel expenses from the prior fuel year. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and are typically recovered or refunded within \n12\n months.\nAROs\nAs discussed in Note 1, for LG&E and KU, all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal.\nPower Purchase Agreement - OVEC\nAs a result of purchase accounting associated with PPL's acquisition of LG&E and KU, the fair values of the OVEC power purchase agreement were recorded on the balance sheets of LG&E and KU with offsets to regulatory liabilities. The regulatory liabilities are being amortized using the units-of-production method until March 2026, the expiration date of the agreement at the date of the acquisition. LG&E's and KU's customer rates continue to reflect the original contracts. See Notes 12 and 17 for additional discussion of the power purchase agreement.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nLG&E's unrealized gains and losses are recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Interest expense from existing swaps is realized and recovered over the terms of the associated debt, which matures in 2033.\nTerminated Interest Rate Swaps\nNet realized gains and losses on all interest rate swaps are recovered through regulated rates. As such, any gains and losses on these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities and are primarily recognized in \"Interest Expense\" on the Statements of Income over the life of the associated debt.\nPlant Outage Costs\nFrom July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2021, plant outage costs were normalized for ratemaking purposes based on an average level of expenses. Plant outage expenses that were greater or less than the average will be collected from or returned to customers, through future base rates. Effective July 1, 2021, under-recovered plant outage costs are being amortized through 2029 for LG&E and KU.\nAdvanced Metering Infrastructure\nIn 2021 orders from the KPSC, LG&E and KU received approval to record regulatory assets comprised of the operating expenses associated with implementation of the AMI project and the incremental difference between AFUDC accrued at LG&E’s and KU’s weighted average cost of capital and that calculated using the methodology approved by the FERC. Recovery of these costs will be determined in the base rate case proceeding following the completion of the AMI implementation project.\n(PPL)\nDerivative Instruments\nDerivative instruments that qualify for recovery from, or refund to, customers through future rates are recorded at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities in the period in which the change occurs. The balance is reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year.\n127\n \nTable of Contents\nEnergy Efficiency\n \nThe energy efficiency mechanism is designed to collect the estimated costs of RIE’s energy efficiency plan for the upcoming calendar year. Any differences between revenue billed to customers through RIE's energy efficiency charge and the costs of RIE’s energy efficiency programs, as approved by the RIPUC, are recorded as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. The final annual over or under collection is reconciled in the next year's energy efficiency plan filing, as part of the reconciliation factor calculation. RIE may file to change the energy efficiency plan charge at any time should significant over-or under-recoveries occur.\nNet Metering\nThe net metering mechanism provides for recovery of costs associated with customer-installed on-site generation facilities, including the costs of renewable generation credits. Net metering is reconcilable annually, and any over- or under-recovery from customers will be refunded to, or recovered from, customers through the adjustment factor determined for the subsequent year.\nRate Adjustment Mechanisms\nIn addition to commodity costs, RIE is subject to a number of additional rate adjustment mechanisms whereby a regulatory asset or regulatory liability is recognized resulting from differences between actual revenues and the underlying cost being recovered or differences between actual revenues and targeted amounts as approved by the RIPUC. The rate adjustment mechanisms are reconcilable, and any over- or under-recovery from customers are to be refunded or recovered annually in the subsequent year.\nRenewable Energy Certificates\n \nThe Renewable Energy Certificates regulatory asset represents deferred costs associated with RIE's compliance obligation with the Rhode Island Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS). The RPS is legislation established to foster the development of new renewable energy sources. The regulatory asset will be recovered over the next year.\nTaxes Recoverable through Future Rates\nTaxes recoverable through future rates represent the portion of future income taxes that are anticipated to be recovered through future rates based upon established regulatory practices. Accordingly, this regulatory asset is recognized when the offsetting deferred tax liability is recognized. For general-purpose financial reporting, this regulatory asset and the deferred tax liability are not offset; rather, each is displayed separately. This regulatory asset is expected to be recovered over the period that the underlying book-tax timing differences reverse and the actual cash taxes are incurred.\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nEnvironmental Cost Recovery\nKentucky law permits LG&E and KU to recover the costs, including a return of operating expenses and a return of and on capital invested, of complying with the Clean Air Act and those federal, state or local environmental requirements, which apply to coal combustion wastes and by-products from coal-fired electricity generating facilities. The KPSC requires reviews of the past operations of the environmental surcharge for six-month and two-year billing periods to evaluate the related charges, credits and rates of return, as well as to provide for the roll-in of ECR amounts to base rates each two-year period. The KPSC has authorized return on equity of \n9.35\n% for existing approved ECR projects. The ECR regulatory asset or liability represents the amount that has been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanism and is typically recovered or refunded within \n12\n months.\nRIE's rate plans provide for specific rate allowances for RIE's share of the estimated costs to investigate and perform certain remediation activities at sites with which it may be associated, with variances deferred for future recovery from, or return to, customers. RIE believes future costs, beyond the expiration of current rate plans, will continue to be recovered through rates. The regulatory asset represents the excess of amounts incurred for RIE's actual site investigation and remediation costs versus amounts received in rates.\n128\n \nTable of Contents\n(PPL and LG&E)\nGas Supply Clause\n \nLG&E's natural gas rates contain a gas supply clause, whereby the expected cost of natural gas supply and variances between actual and expected costs and customer usage from prior periods are adjusted quarterly in LG&E's rates, subject to approval by the KPSC. The gas supply clause previously included a separate natural gas procurement incentive mechanism, which allowed LG&E's rates to be adjusted annually to share savings between the actual cost of gas purchases and market indices, with the shareholders and the customers during each performance-based rate year (12 months ending October 31). The operation of this incentive mechanism expired on October 31, 2024, but savings achieved through October 31, 2024 will be included in LG&E’s rates through October 31, 2026. The regulatory assets or liabilities represent the total amounts that have been under- or over-recovered due to timing or adjustments to the mechanisms and are typically recovered or refunded within \n18\n months.\nRetired Asset Recovery (RAR) Rider\nThe RAR rider was established by KPSC orders in 2021 to provide recovery of and return on the remaining investment in certain electric generating units, including the remaining net book value of each unit, materials and supplies that cannot be used at other plants and any associated removal costs, upon their retirement over a ten-year period following retirement. Costs included as of December 31, 2024 represent the remaining net book value and materials and supplies that cannot be used as a result of the retirement of Mill Creek Unit 1. The associated removal costs will be added to the RAR rider regulatory asset or regulatory liability as costs are incurred.\nRegulatory Matters\nRhode Island Activities\n \n(PPL)\nAdvanced Metering Functionality (AMF)\nIn 2021, RIE filed its Updated AMF Business Case and Grid Modernization Plan (GMP) with the RIPUC in accordance with the Amended Settlement Agreement (ASA) approved by the RIPUC in August 2018, and which among other things, sought approval to deploy smart meters throughout the service territory. After PPL completed the acquisition of RIE, RIE filed a new AMF Business Case with the RIPUC in 2022, consisting of a detailed proposal for full-scale deployment of AMF across its electric service territory. \nOn September 27, 2023, the RIPUC unanimously approved RIE to deploy an AMF-based metering system for the electric distribution business. RIE is authorized to seek recovery of the approved capital investment through the ISR process with an overall multi-year cap on recovery at approximately $\n153\n million, subject to certain terms, conditions and limitations with respect to the potential offsets and recoverability of certain costs. RIE is required to continue spending even if above the recovery cap, until it achieves the functionalities outlined in the AMF Business Case. RIE filed with the RIPUC for approval of (i) an updated electric Service Quality Plan on December 27, 2023, (ii) additional compliance tariff provisions regarding recovery and updated cost schedules to reflect the RIPUC's decision on December 22, 2023, and (iii) electric and gas tariff advice filings for RIPUC Automatic Meter Reading/AMF meter opt-out tariff provision on September 19, 2024. The RIPUC approved RIE’s revised service quality metrics with certain modifications on August 1, 2024 and October 30, 2024. In addition, the RIPUC approved RIE’s AMR/AMF opt-out tariff provisions for electric and natural gas with modifications on December 19, 2024 for effect January 1, 2025, and approved the proposed updated fees to be assessed at the start of the AMF roll-out. On January 7, 2025, RIE filed compliance tariffs to reflect the RIPUC’s ruling, which they approved at their January 23, 2025 Open Meeting.\nGrid Modernization Plan (GMP)\nRIE filed a new GMP with the RIPUC on December 30, 2022. The new GMP filing consists of a holistic suite of grid modernization investments that will provide RIE with the tools and capability to manage the electric distribution system more granularly considering a range of distributed energy resources adoption levels, accelerated by Rhode Island's climate mandates, while at the same time maintaining a safe and reliable electric distribution system. The GMP is an informational guidance document that supports the grid modernization investments to be proposed in future electric ISR plans. Consequently, RIE did not request approval from the RIPUC for any specific investments or seek cost recovery as part of the GMP; rather, RIE requested the RIPUC issues an order affirming RIE's compliance with its obligation to file a GMP that meets the requirements of the ASA. At an Open Meeting on November 21, 2024, the RIPUC unanimously ruled that RIE satisfied the requirement to file a GMP. This decision does not represent a ruling on the GMP and the docket will remain open, though RIE does not expect further action on this docket. \n129\n \nTable of Contents\nFY 2025 Gas ISR Plan\nOn December 22, 2023, RIE filed its FY 2025 Gas ISR Plan with the RIPUC with a budget that includes $\n185\n million of capital investment spend plus up to an additional $\n11\n million of contingency plan spending in connection with the PHMSA's potential enactment of regulations during FY 2025 that, if enacted would significantly alter RIE's leak detection and repair obligations under federal regulations. RIE also filed its proposed gas ISR plan budgetary and reconciliation framework, addressing issues raised in connection with its FY submission, with its FY 2025 ISR Plan. The RIPUC held hearings in March 2024, and on March 26, 2024, approved, the plan, including the proposed budgetary and reconciliation framework, with a total approved FY 2025 Gas ISR Plan of $\n180\n million of which $\n168\n million is for capital investment spend and $\n12\n million spend for paving costs as operations and maintenance (O&M), plus the potential additional $\n11\n million available if the above-mentioned regulations are implemented by the PHMSA. On March 28, 2024, the RIPUC approved RIE's compliance filing for rates effective April 1, 2024.\nFY 2026 Gas ISR Plan\nOn December 31, 2024, RIE filed its FY 2026 Gas ISR Plan with the RIPUC with a budget that includes $\n187\n million of capital investment spend and up to $\n15\n million of additional contingency plan spend in connection with the PHMSA's potential enactment of regulations during FY 2026 that, if enacted, would significantly alter RIE's leak detection and repair obligations under federal regulations. The Plan also includes proposed spending on curb-to-curb paving of $\n22\n million. A decision from the RIPUC on the Plan is expected by March 31, 2025. RIE cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nFY 2025 Electric ISR Plan\nOn December 21, 2023, RIE filed its FY 2025 Electric ISR Plan with the RIPUC with a budget that includes $\n141\n million of capital investment spend, $\n13\n million of vegetation management O&M spend and $\n1\n million of Other O&M spend. RIE also filed its proposed electric ISR plan budgetary and reconciliation framework addressing issues raised in connection with its FY 2024 submission, with its FY 2025 ISR Plan. The RIPUC held hearings in March 2024, and on March 26, 2024, approved the plan, including the proposed budgetary and reconciliation framework, with modifications to the proposed capital investment spend, resulting in a total approved FY 2025 Electric ISR Plan of $\n132\n million for capital investment spend, $\n13\n million for vegetation management O&M spend, and $\n1\n million for Other O&M spend. On March 28, 2024, the RIPUC approved RIE's compliance filing for rates effective April 1, 2024.\nFY 2026 Electric ISR Plan\nOn December 23, 2024, RIE filed its FY 2026 Electric ISR Plan with the RIPUC with a budget that includes $\n160\n million of capital investment spend, $\n14\n million of vegetation O&M spend and $\n1\n million of Other O&M spend. In addition, the FY 2026 Electric ISR Plan includes $\n88\n million of capital investment spend for Advanced Metering Functionality (AMF) which, together with the $\n160\n million of capital investment spend, results in total capital investment spend of $\n248\n million. A decision from the RIPUC is expected by March 31, 2025. RIE cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nKentucky Activities\n \n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nKentucky January 2025 Storm \nIn January 2025, LG&E and KU experienced snow, ice, sleet and freezing rain in their service territories, resulting in substantial damage to certain of LG&E's and KU's assets. On January 31, 2025, LG&E and KU submitted a filing with the KPSC requesting regulatory asset treatment of the extraordinary operations and maintenance expenses portion of the costs incurred related to the storm. These are estimated to be $\n2\n million for LG&E and $\n8\n million for KU. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter. \nKentucky September 2024 Storm\nIn September 2024, LG&E and KU experienced significant winds and rain activity in their service territories, resulting in substantial damage to certain of LG&E's and KU's assets. On October 15, 2024, LG&E and KU submitted a filing with the KPSC requesting regulatory asset treatment of the extraordinary operations and maintenance expenses portion of the costs incurred related to the storm. On December 4, 2024, the KPSC issued an order approving LG&E’s and KU’s request for regulatory asset accounting treatment, with recovery amounts and amortization thereof to be determined in subsequent base rate \n130\n \nTable of Contents\nproceedings. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter. As of December 31, 2024, LG&E and KU recorded regulatory assets related to the storm of $\n2\n million and $\n11\n million. \nKentucky May 2024 Storm\nIn May 2024, LG&E and KU experienced significant windstorm activity in their service territories, resulting in substantial damage to certain of LG&E's and KU's assets. On June 13, 2024, LG&E and KU submitted a filing with the KPSC requesting regulatory asset treatment of the extraordinary operations and maintenance expenses portion of the costs incurred related to the storm. On July 2, 2024, the KPSC issued an order provisionally approving the request for accounting purposes, noting that the decision on approval of recovery would be determined in the future. On November 21, 2024, the KPSC issued an order confirming the approval of LG&E’s and KU’s request for regulatory asset accounting treatment, with recovery amounts and amortization thereof to be determined in subsequent base rate proceedings. LG&E and KU cannot predict the outcome of this matter. As of December 31, 2024, LG&E and KU recorded regulatory assets related to the storm of $\n4\n million and $\n5\n million. \nKPSC Investigation Related to Winter Storm Elliott\nOn December 22, 2023, the KPSC initiated an investigation into the practices of LG&E and KU regarding the provision of electric service from December 23, 2022 through December 25, 2022, during a period of extreme temperatures during Winter Storm Elliott. The investigation was the result of LG&E's and KU's need to implement brief service interruptions to approximately 55,000 customers during this period. The purpose of the investigation was to supplement discovery and examination already completed through LG&E's and KU's CPCN proceedings, a legislative hearing completed in February 2023 and reports completed by the NERC and the FERC related to the issue. Additionally, the investigation was to evaluate LG&E's and KU's actions taken, or planned to be taken, since Winter Storm Elliott that affect their ability to provide service during periods of variable weather and power system stress. LG&E and KU believe actions taken during the period under question were necessary and appropriate. A hearing on the matter occurred on May 23, 2024. On January 7, 2025, the KPSC issued an Order finding that LG&E and KU did not willfully violate a regulation, statute or KPSC Order associated with the Winter Storm Elliot event. The case is now closed and removed from the KPSC’s docket. \nMill Creek Unit 1 and Unit 2 Retired Asset Recovery (RAR) \n(PPL and LG&E)\nIn November 2023, the KPSC issued an order approving, among other items, the requested retirement of Mill Creek Units 1 and 2.\nOn October 4, 2024, LG&E submitted an application related to the retirement of Mill Creek Unit 1, which occurred on December 31, 2024, requesting recovery of associated costs under the RAR rider. LG&E expects these costs to be approximately $\n125\n million and proposes to begin application of the RAR rider with bills issued in May 2025. On October 28, 2024, the KPSC issued an order to establish a procedural schedule regarding its investigation of the reasonableness of the proposed tariff. The KPSC intends to rule on the matter by February 28, 2025. LG&E cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.\nMill Creek Unit 2 is expected to be retired in 2027. LG&E anticipates the recovery of associated costs, including the remaining net book value, for Mill Creek Unit 2 through the RAR rider. The remaining net book value of Mill Creek Unit 2 was approximately $\n221\n million at December 31, 2024 and LG&E is continuing to depreciate using the current approved rates through its retirement date in 2027. LG&E expects to reclassify the net book value remaining at retirement, which is expected to total approximately $\n161\n million, to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a period of ten years in accordance with the RAR. \n131\n \nTable of Contents\nPennsylvania Activities\n \n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nPAPUC investigation into billing issues\nOn January 31, 2023, the PAPUC initiated an investigation focused on billing issues related to estimated, irregular bills and customer service concerns following customer complaints, which for many customers were driven by increased prices for electricity supply. Certain bills issued during the time period of December 20, 2022 through January 9, 2023 were estimated due to a technical issue that prevented PPL Electric from providing actual collected meter data to customer facing and other internal systems. Customers also reported difficulties accessing PPL Electric's website and contacting the customer service call center. The PAPUC’s Bureau of Investigation & Enforcement (I&E) has directed PPL Electric to respond to certain inquiries and document requests. PPL Electric submitted its responses to the information request and cooperated fully with the investigation. PPL Electric reached a Settlement Agreement with I&E on November 21, 2023. In the settlement, PPL Electric agreed to pay a civil penalty of $\n1\n million, \nmake certain remedial improvements to its billing systems and processes, and agreed to not seek recovery for extraordinary costs incurred in responding to or resulting from the billing event. On November 21, 2023, PPL Electric and I&E submitted a Joint Petition for Approval of Settlement to the PAPUC. On January 18, 2024, the PAPUC issued an Order requesting public comment prior to the PAPUC entering a Final Order on the petition. Comments were due on February 28, 2024, and comments were filed by the Office of Consumer Advocate, CAUSE-PA (low-income advocate), and individual customers. On March 19, 2024, PPL Electric filed reply comments. On April 25, 2024, the PAPUC announced at its public meeting that it would be issuing an order approving the Settlement Agreement with modifications. The modifications included converting the $\n1\n million civil penalty to a $\n1\n million donation to PPL Electric's hardship fund, Operation HELP, and requiring PPL Electric to make various progress reports on efforts to remediate the billing issue. PPL Electric and I&E had 20 business days from the issuance of the PAPUC order to accept or reject the proposed modifications to the Settlement Agreement. The time period to withdraw from the Settlement Agreement expired on June 14, 2024, without PPL Electric or I&E withdrawing from the Settlement Agreement, and the terms of the Settlement Agreement, as modified by the PAPUC's order, are now final. PPL Electric is in the process of complying with the terms of the Settlement Agreement, and made the required contribution to Operation HELP on June 24, 2024.\nPPL Electric incurred expenses, primarily related to billing write-offs, of $\n18\n million and $\n34\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 related to the billing issue. PPL Electric will not seek regulatory recovery of these costs.\nDSIC Petition\nOn April 26, 2024, PPL Electric filed a Petition with the PAPUC requesting that the PAPUC waive PPL Electric's DSIC cap of \n5\n% of billed revenues and increase the maximum allowable DSIC to \n9\n% for bills rendered on or after January 1, 2025. On November 21, 2024, the Administrative Law Judge in the proceeding issued a Recommended Decision recommending the denial of PPL Electric’s DSIC Cap Waiver Petition. PPL Electric filed exceptions to the Recommended Decision on December 11, 2024. Several of the other parties filed Reply Exceptions on December 23, 2024. The Administrative Law Judge's Recommended Decision and the Exceptions and Reply Exceptions are currently before the PAPUC for a final order. PPL Electric cannot predict the timing or outcome of that decision.\nAct 129 \n \nThe Pennsylvania Public Utility Code requires EDCs to meet, by specified dates, specified goals for reduction in customer electricity usage and peak demand. EDCs not meeting the requirements of Act 129 are subject to significant penalties. PPL Electric filed with the PAPUC its Act 129 Phase IV Energy Efficiency and Conservation Plan on November 30, 2020, for the \nfive-year\n period starting June 1, 2021 and ending on May 31, 2026. PPL Electric's Phase IV Act 129 Plan was approved by the PAPUC at its March 25, 2021, public meeting. \nThe Pennsylvania Public Utility Code also requires EDCs to act as a default service provider (DSP), which provides electricity generation supply service to customers pursuant to a PAPUC-approved default service procurement plan. A DSP is able to recover the costs associated with its default service procurement plan.\nIn March 2024, PPL Electric filed a Petition for Approval of a new default service program and procurement plan with the PAPUC for the period June 1, 2025 through May 31, 2029. In August 2024, PPL Electric submitted a Joint Petition for Settlement in the proceeding. In September 2024, the Administrative Law Judge issued an Interim Order approving the proposed settlement without modification. The PAPUC adopted the Interim Order on November 7, 2024, without modification which finalized the settlement.  \n132\n \nTable of Contents\nFederal Matters\nFERC Transmission Rate Filing \n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nIn 2018, LG&E and KU applied to the FERC requesting elimination of certain on-going waivers and credits to a sub-set of transmission customers relating to the 1998 merger of LG&E's and KU's parent entities and the 2006 withdrawal of LG&E and KU from the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO), a regional transmission operator and energy market. The application sought termination of LG&E's and KU's commitment to provide certain Kentucky municipalities mitigation for certain horizontal market power concerns arising out of the 1998 LG&E and KU merger and 2006 MISO withdrawal. The amounts at issue are generally waivers or credits granted to a limited number of Kentucky municipalities for either certain LG&E and KU or MISO transmission charges incurred for transmission service received. In 2019, the FERC granted LG&E's and KU's request to remove the ongoing credits, conditioned upon the implementation by LG&E and KU of a transition mechanism for certain existing power supply arrangements, which was subsequently filed, modified, and approved by the FERC in 2020 and 2021. In 2020, LG&E and KU and other parties filed appeals with the U.S. Court of Appeals - D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals) regarding the FERC's orders on the elimination of the mitigation and required transition mechanism. In August 2022, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order remanding the proceedings back to the FERC. On May 18, 2023, the FERC issued an order on remand reversing its 2019 decision and requiring LG&E and KU to refund credits previously withheld, including under such transition mechanism. LG&E and KU filed a petition for review of the FERC's May 18, 2023 order with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and provided refunds in accordance with the FERC order on December 1, 2023. The FERC issued an order on LG&E's and KU's compliance filing on November 16, 2023, and LG&E and KU filed a petition for review of this November 16, 2023 order on February 14, 2024. The FERC issued the substantive order on rehearing on March 21, 2024, reaffirming its prior decision. Oral argument before the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals occurred on January 21, 2025. LG&E and KU cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the proceedings or any other post decision process but do not expect the annual impact to have a material effect on their operations or financial condition. LG&E and KU currently receive recovery of certain waivers and credits primarily through base rates increases, provided, however, that increases associated with the FERC's May 18, 2023 order are expected to be subject to future rate proceedings. \nRecovery of Transmission Costs \n(PPL)\nUntil December 2022, RIE's transmission facilities were operated in combination with the transmission facilities of National Grid's New England affiliates, Massachusetts Electric Company (MECO) and New England Power (NEP), as a single integrated system with NEP designated as the combined operator. As of January 1, 2023, RIE operates its own transmission facilities. ISO-NE allocates RIE's costs among transmission customers in New England, in accordance with the ISO Open Access Transmission Tariff (ISO-NE OATT). According to the FERC orders, RIE is compensated for its actual monthly transmission costs, with its authorized maximum Return on Equity (ROE) of \n11.74\n% on its transmission assets. \nThe ROE for transmission rates under the ISO-NE OATT is the subject of four complaints that are pending before the FERC. On October 16, 2014, the FERC issued an order on the first complaint, Opinion No. 531-A, resetting the base ROE applicable to transmission assets under the ISO-NE OATT from \n11.14\n% to \n10.57\n% effective as of October 16, 2014 and establishing a maximum ROE of \n11.74\n%. On April 14, 2017, this order was vacated and remanded by the D. C. Circuit Court of Appeals (Court of Appeals). After the remand, the FERC issued an order on October 16, 2018 applicable to all four pending cases where it proposed a new base ROE methodology that, with subsequent input and support from the New England Transmission Owners (NETO), yielded a base ROE of \n10.41\n%. Subsequent to the FERC's October 2018 order in the New England Transmission Owners cases, the FERC further refined its ROE methodology in another proceeding and has applied that refined methodology to transmission owners’ ROEs in other jurisdictions, and the NETOs filed further information in the New England matters to distinguish their case. Those determinations in other jurisdictions have recently been vacated and remanded back to the FERC for further proceedings by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The proceeding and the final base rate ROE determination in the New England matters remain open, pending a final order from the FERC. PPL cannot predict the outcome of this matter, and an estimate of the impact cannot be determined.\n133\n \nTable of Contents\nOther\nPurchase of Receivables Program\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nIn accordance with a PAPUC-approved purchase of accounts receivable program, PPL Electric purchases certain accounts receivable from alternative electricity suppliers at a discount, which reflects a provision for uncollectible accounts. The alternative electricity suppliers have no continuing involvement or interest in the purchased accounts receivable. Accounts receivable that are acquired are initially recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, PPL Electric purchased $\n1.5\n billion, $\n1.5\n billion and $\n1.3\n billion of accounts receivable from alternative suppliers.\n(PPL)\nIn 2021 and 2022, the RIPUC approved various components of a Purchase of Receivables Program (POR) in Rhode Island for effect on April 1, 2022. Municipal aggregators and non-regulated power producers (collectively, Competitive Suppliers) are eligible to participate in accordance with RIE's approved electric tariffs for municipal aggregation and non-regulated power producers. Under the POR program, RIE will purchase the Competitive Suppliers' accounts receivables, including existing receivables, at discounted rates, regardless of whether RIE has collected the owed monies from customers. The program is intended to make RIE whole through the implementation of a discount rate or Standard Complete Bill Percentage (SCBP) paid by Competitive Suppliers. RIE calculates the SCBP for each customer class and files the calculations with the RIPUC for review and approval by February 15 of each year. At an Open Meeting on March 26, 2024, the RIPUC approved the SCBP for effect beginning on April 1, 2024, for a one-year period.\n \n8.

At December 31, 2024, \nno\n interest payments were deferred.\n138\n \nTable of Contents\n(All Registrants)\nPPL relies on dividends or loans from its subsidiaries to fund PPL's dividends to its common shareholders. The net assets of certain PPL subsidiaries are subject to legal restrictions. LG&E, KU, PPL Electric and RIE are subject to Section 305(a) of the Federal Power Act, which makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds \"properly included in capital account.\" The meaning of this limitation has never been clarified under the Federal Power Act. LG&E, KU, PPL Electric and RIE believe, however, that this statutory restriction, as applied to their circumstances, would not be construed or applied by the FERC to prohibit the payment from retained earnings of dividends that are not excessive and are for lawful and legitimate business purposes. In February 2012, LG&E and KU petitioned the FERC requesting authorization to pay dividends in the future based on retained earnings balances calculated without giving effect to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments for PPL's 2010 acquisition of LG&E and KU. In May 2012, the FERC approved the petitions with the further condition that each utility may not pay dividends if such payment would cause its adjusted equity ratio to fall below \n30\n% of total capitalization. Accordingly, at December 31, 2024, net assets of $\n1.5\n billion for LG&E and $\n2.0\n billion for KU were restricted for purposes of paying dividends to LKE, and net assets of $\n1.8\n billion for LG&E and $\n2.3\n billion for KU were available for payment of dividends to LKE. LG&E and KU believe they will not be required to change their current dividend practices as a result of the foregoing requirement. In addition, under Virginia law, KU is prohibited from making loans to affiliates without the prior approval of the VSCC. There are no comparable statutes under Kentucky law applicable to LG&E and KU, or under Pennsylvania law applicable to PPL Electric. However, orders from the KPSC require LG&E and KU to obtain prior consent or approval before lending amounts to PPL.\n \n9. Acquisitions, Development and Divestitures\n(PPL)\nAcquisitions\nAcquisition of Narragansett Electric\nOn May 25, 2022, PPL Rhode Island Holdings acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Narragansett Electric from National Grid U.S., a subsidiary of National Grid plc (the Acquisition). Narragansett Electric, whose service area covers substantially all of Rhode Island, is primarily engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity and distribution of natural gas. The Acquisition expands PPL's portfolio of regulated natural gas and electricity transmission and distribution assets, has improved PPL's credit metrics and is expected to enhance long term earnings growth. Following the closing of the Acquisition, Narragansett Electric provides services doing business under the name Rhode Island Energy (RIE).\nThe consideration for the Acquisition consisted of approximately $\n3.8\n billion in cash and approximately $\n1.5\n billion of long-term debt assumed through the transaction. \nThe fair value of the consideration paid for Narragansett Electric was as follows (in billions):\nAggregate enterprise consideration\n$\n5.3\n \nLess: fair value of assumed long-term debt outstanding\n1.5\n \nTotal cash consideration\n$\n3.8\n \nThe $\n3.8\n billion total cash consideration paid was funded with proceeds from PPL's 2021 sale of its U.K. utility business.\nIn connection with the Acquisition, National Grid USA Service Company, Inc., National Grid U.S. and Narragansett Electric entered into a transition services agreement (TSA), pursuant to which the National Grid entities agreed to provide certain transition services to Narragansett Electric to facilitate the transition of the operation of Narragansett Electric to PPL following the Acquisition, as agreed upon in the Narragansett share purchase agreement. The TSA was for an initial two-year term and was completed in the third quarter of 2024. TSA costs of $\n137\n million, $\n228\n million, and $\n123\n million were incurred for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\nCommitments to the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island\nAs a condition to the Acquisition, PPL made certain commitments to the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Attorney General of the State of Rhode Island. As a result:\n139\n \nTable of Contents\n•\nRIE provided a credit to all its electric and natural gas distribution customers in the total amount of $\n50\n million ($\n40\n million net of tax benefit). Based on the relative number of electric distribution customers and natural gas distribution customers as of November 1, 2022, RIE refunded, in the form of a bill credit, $\n33\n million to electric customers and $\n17\n million to natural gas customers of amounts collected from customers since the Acquisition date. Each electric customer received the same credit, and each natural gas customer received the same credit. A reduction of revenue and a regulatory liability of $\n50\n million for the amounts refunded were recorded during the quarter ended September 30, 2022. These credits were issued during the fourth quarter of 2022. The amounts refunded did not impact RIE's earnings sharing regulatory mechanism.\n•\nRIE forgave approximately $\n44\n million ($\n21\n million net of allowance for doubtful accounts) in arrearages for low-income and protected residential customers, which represents 100% of the arrearages over 90 days for those customers as of March 31, 2022. PPL deemed these accounts uncollectible and fully reserved for them as of September 30, 2022, resulting in an increase to \"Other operations and maintenance expense\" on the Statement of Income of $\n23\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n•\nRIE will not file a base rate case seeking an increase in base distribution rates for natural gas and/or electric service sooner than three years from the Acquisition date, and RIE will not submit a request for a change in base rates unless and until there is at least twelve months of operating experience under PPL's exclusive leadership and after the TSA with National Grid terminates.\n•\nRIE will forgo potential recovery of any and all transition costs, which includes (1) the installation of certain information technology systems; (2) modification and enhancements to physical facilities in Rhode Island; and (3) incurring costs related to severance payments, communications and branding changes, and other transition related costs. These costs, which are being expensed as incurred, were $\n307\n million, $\n262\n million, and $\n181\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n•\nRIE will not seek to recover any transaction costs related to the Acquisition, which were $\n28\n million through December 31, 2024, including an immaterial amount for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, and $\n18\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022. These amounts were recorded in \"Other operations and maintenance\" on the Statement of Income.\n•\nRIE will not seek to recover in rates any markup charged by National Grid U.S. and/or its affiliates under the TSA which were $\n10\n million, $\n7\n million, and $\n3\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.\n•\nIn June 2022, RIE expensed $\n20\n million of regulatory assets as of the Acquisition date for the Gas Business Enablement (GBE) project and for certain Cybersecurity/IT investments related to GBE. The expense was recorded to \"Other operations and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. RIE will not seek to recover these regulatory assets from customers in any future proceedings.\n•\nRIE will exclude all goodwill from the ratemaking capital structure.\n•\nRIE will hold harmless Rhode Island customers from any changes to Accumulated Deferred Income Taxes (ADIT) as a result of the Acquisition. RIE reserves the right to seek rate adjustments based on future changes to ADIT that are not related to the Acquisition.\n•\nRIE will not increase its revenue requirement to a level higher than what would exist in the absence of the Acquisition as a result of any restatement of pension and other post-retirement benefits plan assets and liabilities to fair value after the close of the Acquisition.\n•\nRhode Island Holdings contributed $\n2.5\n million to the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation's Renewable Energy Fund and will not use any of the $\n2.5\n million to meet its pre-existing renewable energy credit goals in Rhode Island or any other state. This contribution was made during the year ended December 31, 2022 and was recorded in \"Other Income (Expense)\" on the Statement of Income.\n•\nRIE will make available up to $\n2.5\n million for the Rhode Island Attorney General to utilize as needed in evaluating PPL's report on RIE's specific decarbonization goals to support Rhode Island's 2021 Act on Climate or to assess the future of the gas distribution business in Rhode Island. This amount was accrued during the year ended December 31, 2022 and was recorded in \"Other Income (Expense) - net\" on the Statement of Income.\n•\nVarious other operational and reporting commitments have been established.\nPurchase Price Allocation\n \nThe operations of Narragansett Electric are subject to the accounting for certain types of regulation as prescribed by GAAP. The carrying value of Narragansett Electric’s assets and liabilities subject to rate-setting and cost recovery provisions provide revenues derived from costs, including a return on investment of net assets and liabilities included in rate base. Therefore, the fair values of these assets and liabilities equal their carrying values. Accordingly, neither the assets acquired nor liabilities assumed reflect any adjustments related to these amounts. \nTotal goodwill resulting from the acquisition was $\n1,585\n million. PPL has elected to not reflect the effects of purchase accounting in the separate financial statements of RIE or PPL's Rhode Island Regulated segment. Accordingly, the Rhode \n140\n \nTable of Contents\nIsland Regulated segment includes $\n725\n million of acquired legacy goodwill. The remaining excess purchase price of $\n860\n million is included in PPL's Corporate and Other category for segment reporting purposes. The goodwill reflects the value paid for the expected continued growth of a rate-regulated business located in a defined service area with a constructive regulatory environment, the ability of PPL to leverage its assembled workforce to take advantage of those growth opportunities and the attractiveness of stable, growing cash flows. The tax goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes over a 15 year period, and as such, deferred taxes will be recorded as the tax deductions are taken.\nThe table below shows the allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed that were recorded in PPL’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the Acquisition date.\n The allocation was subject to change during the one-year measurement period as additional information was obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at closing. Adjustments to certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted in a decrease in goodwill of $\n1\n million since the purchase price allocation as of December 31, 2022.\nFinal Purchase Price Allocation\nAssets\nCurrent Assets\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n$\n154\n \nAccounts Receivable (a)\n195\n \nUnbilled Revenues\n54\n \nPrice Risk Management Assets\n99\n \nRegulatory Assets\n75\n \nOther Current Assets\n65\n \nTotal Current Assets\n642\n \nNoncurrent Assets\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\n3,992\n \nRegulatory Assets\n393\n \nGoodwill\n1,585\n \nOther Noncurrent Assets\n164\n \nTotal Noncurrent Assets\n6,134\n \nTotal Assets\n$\n6,776\n \nLiabilities\nCurrent Liabilities\nLong-Term Debt Due Within One Year\n$\n14\n \nAccounts Payable\n180\n \nTaxes Accrued\n44\n \nRegulatory Liabilities\n239\n \nOther Current Liabilities\n198\n \nTotal Current Liabilities\n675\n \nNoncurrent Liabilities\nLong-Term Debt\n1,496\n \nRegulatory Liabilities\n643\n \nOther Deferred Credits and Noncurrent Liabilities\n142\n \nNoncurrent Liabilities\n2,281\n \nTotal Purchase Price (Balance Sheet Net Assets)\n$\n3,820\n \n(a)\nAmounts represent fair value as of May 25, 2022.

In November 2023, the KPSC issued an order approving the request as well as the requested AFUDC accounting treatment for associated financing costs relating to the NGCC. The new NGCC facility will be jointly owned by LG&E (\n31\n%) and KU (\n69\n%). In February 2024, LG&E and KU entered into agreements to begin construction of Mill Creek Unit 5. Total project costs are estimated at approximately $\n1.0\n billion, including AFUDC. Commercial operation of the facility is anticipated to begin in mid-2027.\nSee Note 7 for additional information on the CPCN filing.\nDivestitures \n(PPL)\nSale of Safari Holdings\nOn September 29, 2022, PPL signed a definitive agreement to sell all of Safari Holdings membership interests to Aspen Power Services, LLC (Aspen Power). On November 1, 2022, PPL completed the sale (the Transaction).\nFinal closing adjustments were completed during the year ended December 31, 2023, resulting in an increase to the loss on sale of $\n6\n million ($\n5\n million net of tax), which was recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023. A loss on sale of $\n60\n million ($\n46\n million net of tax benefit) was recorded in \"Other operation and maintenance\" on the Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2022. \nIn connection with the closing of the Transaction, PPL provided certain guarantees and other assurances. Certain of these guarantees and other assurances have been terminated as of January 8, 2024. See Note 12 to the Financial Statements for additional information.\nDiscontinued Operations\nSummarized Results of Discontinued Operations\nOn June 14, 2021, PPL WPD Limited completed the sale of PPL's U.K. utility business to National Grid Holdings One plc (National Grid U.K.), a subsidiary of National Grid plc. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the operations of the U.K. utility business are included in \"Income from Discontinued Operations (net of income taxes)\" on the Statements of Income, with the only component being an income tax benefit of $\n42\n million. There were no discontinued operations activities for the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n142\n \nTable of Contents\n10. Retirement and Postemployment Benefits\n \n(All Registrants)\n \nDefined Benefits\nCertain employees of PPL's subsidiaries are eligible for pension benefits under non-contributory defined benefit pension plans with benefits based on length of service and final average pay, as defined by the plans. \nEffective January 1, 2012, PPL's primary defined benefit pension plan was closed to all newly hired salaried employees. Effective July 1, 2014, PPL's primary defined benefit pension plan was closed to all newly hired bargaining unit employees. Newly hired employees are eligible to participate in the PPL Retirement Savings Plan, a 401(k) savings plan with enhanced employer contributions.\nThe defined benefit pension plans of LKE and its subsidiaries were closed to new salaried and bargaining unit employees hired after December 31, 2005. Employees hired after December 31, 2005 receive additional company contributions above the standard matching contributions to their savings plans. The pension plans sponsored by LKE and LG&E were merged effective January 1, 2020 into the LG&E and KU Pension Plan. The merged plan is sponsored by LKE. LG&E and KU participate in this plan.\nThe RIE defined benefit plans provide most union employees, as well as non-union employees hired before January 1, 2011, with a retirement benefit. Supplemental non-qualified, non-contributory executive retirement programs provide additional defined pension benefits for certain executives. \nPPL and certain of its subsidiaries also provide supplemental retirement benefits to executives and other key management employees through unfunded nonqualified retirement plans. \n \nCertain employees of PPL's subsidiaries are eligible for certain health care and life insurance benefits upon retirement through contributory plans. Effective January 1, 2014, the PPL Postretirement Medical Plan was closed to all newly hired salaried employees. Effective July 1, 2014, the PPL Postretirement Medical Plan was closed to all newly hired bargaining unit employees. Effective January 1, 2024, newly hired salaried employees and certain bargaining unit employees of LKE will no longer be eligible for postretirement medical benefits under the LKE Postretirement Plan. Postretirement health benefits may be paid from 401(h) accounts established as part of the PPL Retirement Plan and the LG&E and KU Pension Plan within the PPL Services Corporation Master Trust, funded VEBA trusts and company funds. \n \nThe Rhode Island postretirement benefit plans provide health care and life insurance coverage to eligible retired employees. Eligibility is based on age and length of service requirements and, in most cases, retirees must contribute to the cost of their coverage. \n143\n \nTable of Contents\n(PPL)\n \nThe following table provides the components of net periodic defined benefit costs (credits) for PPL's pension and other postretirement benefit plans for the years ended December 31.\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet periodic defined benefit costs (credits):\n \n \n \n \n \n \nService cost\n$\n35\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n51\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n7\n \nInterest cost\n183\n \n188\n \n144\n \n29\n \n30\n \n20\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n299\n)\n(\n309\n)\n(\n276\n)\n(\n30\n)\n(\n30\n)\n(\n28\n)\nAmortization of:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrior service cost (credit)\n3\n \n6\n \n8\n \n1\n \n1\n \n1\n \nActuarial (gain) loss\n10\n \n2\n \n51\n \n(\n5\n)\n(\n5\n)\n(\n5\n)\nNet periodic defined benefit costs (credits) prior to settlements and termination benefits\n(\n68\n)\n(\n79\n)\n(\n22\n)\n1\n \n2\n \n(\n5\n)\nSettlements (a)\n—\n \n—\n \n23\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nNet periodic defined benefit costs (credits) \n$\n(\n68\n)\n$\n(\n79\n)\n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n5\n)\nOther Changes in Plan Assets and Benefit Obligations Recognized in OCI and Regulatory Assets/Liabilities - Gross:\nNet (loss)/gain allocated at acquisition\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n33\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n49\n)\nSettlement\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n23\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nNet (gain) loss\n134\n \n193\n \n242\n \n1\n \n(\n6\n)\n—\n \nPrior service cost (credit)\n(\n13\n)\n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAmortization of:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrior service (cost) credit\n(\n3\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nActuarial gain (loss)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n51\n)\n5\n \n5\n \n5\n \nTotal recognized in OCI and regulatory assets/liabilities\n108\n \n187\n \n193\n \n5\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n45\n)\nTotal recognized in net periodic defined benefit costs, OCI and regulatory assets/liabilities\n$\n40\n \n$\n108\n \n$\n194\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n50\n)\n \n(a)\nSettlement charges incurred as a result of the amount of lump sum payment distributions, primarily from the LKE qualified pension plan.

The investment strategy for the Master Trust is to achieve a risk-adjusted return on a mix of assets that, in combination with PPL's funding policy, will ensure that sufficient assets are available to provide long-term growth and liquidity for benefit payments, \n147\n \nTable of Contents\nwhile also managing the duration of the assets to complement the duration of the liabilities. The Master Trust benefits from a wide diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and external investment fund managers, and therefore has no significant concentration of risk.\n \nThe investment policy of the Master Trust outlines investment objectives and defines the responsibilities of the EBPB, external investment managers, investment advisor and trustee and custodian. The investment policy is reviewed annually by PPL's Board of Directors.\n \nThe EBPB created a risk management framework around the trust assets and pension liabilities. This framework considers the trust assets as being composed of three sub-portfolios: growth, immunizing and liquidity portfolios. The growth portfolio is comprised of investments that generate a return at a reasonable risk, including equity securities, certain debt securities and alternative investments. The immunizing portfolio consists of debt securities, generally with long durations, and derivative positions. The immunizing portfolio is designed to offset a portion of the change in the pension liabilities due to changes in interest rates. The liquidity portfolio consists primarily of cash and cash equivalents.\n \nTarget allocation ranges have been developed for each portfolio based on input from external consultants with a goal of limiting funded status volatility. The EBPB monitors the investments in each portfolio and seeks to obtain a target portfolio that emphasizes reduction of risk of loss from market volatility. In pursuing that goal, the EBPB establishes revised guidelines from time to time. EBPB investment guidelines as of the end of 2024 are presented below.\n \nThe asset allocation for the trust and the target allocation by portfolio at December 31 are as follows:\n \nPercentage of trust assets\n2024\n2024\n2023\nTarget Asset\nAllocation\nGrowth Portfolio\n55\n \n%\n54\n \n%\n55\n \n%\nEquity securities\n30\n \n%\n31\n \n%\n \nDebt securities (a)\n13\n \n%\n12\n \n%\n \nAlternative investments\n12\n \n%\n11\n \n%\n \nImmunizing Portfolio\n43\n \n%\n43\n \n%\n43\n \n%\nDebt securities (a)\n35\n \n%\n36\n \n%\n \nDerivatives (b)\n8\n \n%\n7\n \n%\n \nLiquidity Portfolio\n2\n \n%\n3\n \n%\n2\n \n%\nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n \n(a)\nIncludes commingled debt funds, which PPL treats as debt securities for asset allocation purposes.\n(b)\nIncludes posted collateral to support derivative instruments subject to counterparty risk.\n \n148\n \nTable of Contents\n(PPL)\n \nThe fair value of net assets in the Master Trust by asset class and level within the fair value hierarchy was:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nFair Value Measurements Using\nFair Value Measurements Using\n \nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nPPL Services Corporation Master Trust\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n212\n \n$\n212\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n226\n \n$\n226\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nEquity securities:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. Equity\n63\n \n63\n \n—\n \n—\n \n36\n \n36\n \n—\n \n—\n \nU.S. Equity fund measured at NAV (a)\n461\n \n— \n— \n— \n542\n \n— \n— \n— \nInternational equity fund at NAV (a)\n376\n \n— \n— \n— \n431\n \n— \n— \n— \nCommingled debt measured at NAV (a)\n461\n \n— \n— \n— \n528\n \n— \n— \n— \nDebt securities:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. Treasury and U.S. government sponsored\nagency\n150\n \n149\n \n1\n \n—\n \n159\n \n159\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCorporate\n867\n \n—\n \n848\n \n19\n \n915\n \n—\n \n906\n \n9\n \nOther\n13\n \n—\n \n13\n \n—\n \n14\n \n—\n \n13\n \n1\n \nAlternative investments:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReal estate measured at NAV (a)\n72\n \n— \n— \n— \n61\n \n— \n— \n— \nPrivate equity measured at NAV (a)\n114\n \n— \n— \n— \n105\n \n— \n— \n— \nPrivate credit partnerships measured at NAV (a)\n16\n \n— \n— \n— \n13\n \n— \n— \n— \nHedge funds measured at NAV (a)\n181\n \n— \n— \n— \n192\n \n— \n— \n— \nDerivatives\n(\n38\n)\n—\n \n(\n38\n)\n—\n \n93\n \n—\n \n93\n \n—\n \nPPL Services Corporation Master Trust assets, at\nfair value\n2,948\n \n$\n424\n \n$\n824\n \n$\n19\n \n3,315\n \n$\n421\n \n$\n1,012\n \n$\n10\n \nReceivables and payables, net (b)\n102\n \n \n \n(\n16\n)\n \n \n \n401(h) accounts restricted for other\npostretirement benefit obligations\n(\n114\n)\n \n \n \n(\n124\n)\n \n \n \nTotal PPL Services Corporation Master Trust\npension assets\n$\n2,936\n \n \n \n \n$\n3,175\n \n \n \n \n \n(a)\nIn accordance with accounting guidance, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (NAV), or its equivalent, have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

The fair value measurements of equity securities (excluding commingled funds), which are generally classified as Level 1, are based on quoted prices in active markets. These securities represent actively and passively managed investments that are managed against various equity indices.\n \nInvestments in commingled equity and debt funds are categorized as equity securities. Investments in commingled equity funds include funds that invest in U.S. and international equity securities. Investments in commingled debt funds include funds that invest in a diversified portfolio of emerging market debt obligations, as well as funds that invest in investment grade long-duration fixed-income securities.\nThe fair value measurements of debt securities are generally based on evaluations that reflect observable market information, such as actual trade information for identical securities or for similar securities, adjusted for observable differences. The fair value of debt securities is generally measured using a market approach, including the use of pricing models, which incorporate observable inputs. Common inputs include benchmark yields, relevant trade data, broker/dealer bid/ask prices, benchmark securities and credit valuation adjustments. When necessary, the fair value of debt securities is measured using the income approach, which incorporates similar observable inputs as well as payment data, future predicted cash flows, collateral performance and new issue data. For the Master Trust, these securities represent investments in securities issued by U.S. Treasury and U.S. government sponsored agencies; investments securitized by residential mortgages, auto loans, credit cards and other pooled loans; investments in investment grade and non-investment grade bonds issued by U.S. companies across several industries; investments in debt securities issued by foreign governments and corporations. \n \nInvestments in real estate represent an investment in a partnership whose purpose is to manage investments in U.S. real estate properties diversified geographically and across major property types (e.g., office, industrial, retail, etc.). The partnership has limitations on the amounts that may be redeemed based on available cash to fund redemptions. Additionally, the general partner may decline to accept redemptions when necessary to avoid adverse consequences for the partnership, including legal and tax implications, among others. The fair value of the investment is based upon a partnership unit value.\n \nInvestments in private equity represent interests in partnerships in multiple early-stage venture capital funds and private equity fund of funds that use a number of diverse investment strategies. The partnerships have limited lives of at least \n10\n years, after which liquidating distributions will be received. Prior to the end of each partnership's life, the investment cannot be redeemed with the partnership; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner's approval. Fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners' capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed.\nInvestments in private credit represent pools of actively managed loans that span capital structure and borrower type. Strategies carry different types and levels of risk. Returns from those strategies will vary in terms of yield, fees generated, loan loss rates and the pace of principal repayment. Investments have limited lives of approximately 2-8 years. The investment cannot be redeemed with the general partner; however, the interest may be sold to other parties, subject to the general partner’s approval. Fair value is based on an ownership interest in partners’ capital to which a proportionate share of net assets is attributed. \n \nAt December 31, 2024, the Master Trust had unfunded commitments of $\n59\n million that may be required during the lives of the real estate, private equity and private credit partnerships.\n \nInvestments in hedge funds represent investments in a fund of hedge funds. Hedge funds seek a return utilizing a number of diverse investment strategies. The strategies, when combined, aim to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to deliver positive returns under most market conditions. Major investment strategies for the fund of hedge funds include long/short equity, tactical trading, event driven, and relative value. Shares may be redeemed with \n45\n days prior written notice. The fund is subject to short term lockups and other restrictions. The fair value for the fund has been estimated using the net asset value per share.\n \nThe fair value measurements of derivative instruments utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar contracts or market-corroborated inputs. In certain instances, these instruments may be valued using models, including standard option valuation models and standard industry models. These securities primarily represent investments in treasury futures, total return swaps, interest rate swaps and swaptions (the option to enter into an interest rate swap), which are valued based on quoted prices, changes in the value of the underlying exposure or on the swap details, such as swap curves, notional amount, index and term of index, reset frequency, volatility and payer/receiver credit ratings.\n150\n \nTable of Contents\n \nPlan Assets - Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \nThe investment strategy with respect to other postretirement benefit obligations is to fund VEBA trusts and/or 401(h) accounts with voluntary contributions and to invest in a tax efficient manner. Excluding the 401(h) accounts included in the Master Trust, other postretirement benefit plans are invested in a mix of assets for long-term growth with an objective of earning returns that provide liquidity as required for benefit payments. These plans benefit from diversification of asset types, investment fund strategies and investment fund managers and, therefore, have no significant concentration of risk. Equity securities include investments in a large-cap commingled fund and a global equity exchange-traded fund. Ownership interests in commingled funds that invest entirely in debt securities are classified as equity securities, but treated as debt securities for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. Ownership interests in money market funds are treated as cash and cash equivalents for asset allocation and target allocation purposes. \nThe asset allocation for the PPL VEBA trusts and the target allocation, by asset class, at December 31 are detailed below.\nPercentage of plan assets\nTarget Asset\nAllocation\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\nAsset Class\n \n \n \nEquity securities\n45\n \n%\n46\n \n%\n45\n \n%\nDebt securities (a)\n49\n \n%\n48\n \n%\n49\n \n%\nCash and cash equivalents (b)\n6\n \n%\n6\n \n%\n6\n \n%\nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n(a)\nIncludes commingled debt funds and debt securities.\n(b)\nIncludes money market funds.\n \nThe fair value of assets in the other postretirement benefit plans by asset class and level within the fair value hierarchy was:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nFair Value Measurement Using\nFair Value Measurement Using\n \nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nMoney market funds\n$\n19\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nEquity securities:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLarge-cap equity fund measure at NAV (a)\n71\n \n— \n— \n— \n76\n \n— \n— \n— \nCommingled debt fund measured at NAV (a)\n78\n \n— \n— \n— \n84\n \n— \n— \n— \nGlobal equity exchange-traded fund\n70\n \n70\n \n— \n— \n72\n \n72\n \n— \n— \nLong-term bond exchange-traded fund\n74\n \n74\n \n— \n— \n74\n \n74\n \n— \n— \nTotal VEBA trust assets, at fair value\n312\n \n$\n163\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n326\n \n$\n166\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nReceivables and payables, net (b)\n(\n9\n)\n \n \n \n(\n12\n)\n \n \n \n401(h) account assets\n114\n \n \n \n \n124\n \n \n \n \nTotal other postretirement benefit plan assets\n$\n417\n \n \n \n \n$\n438\n \n \n \n \n \n(a)\nIn accordance with accounting guidance certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (NAV), or its equivalent, have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

The RIPUC-approved solicitations currently in service include: (i) a 15-year PPA with Orbit Energy Rhode Island, LLC for a \n3.2\n MW nameplate anaerobic digester biogas project located in Johnston, Rhode Island, placed in service in 2017, (ii) a 15-year PPA with Black Bear Development Holdings, LLC for a \n3.9\n MW nameplate run-of-river hydroelectric plant located in Orono, Maine, placed in service in 2013, (iii) a 15-year PPA with Copenhagen Wind Farm, LLC for an \n80\n MW nameplate land-based wind project located in Denmark, New York, placed in \n155\n \nTable of Contents\nservice in 2018, and (iv) a 15-year PPA with Rhode Island LFG Genco, LLC for a \n32.1\n MW nameplate combined cycle combustion turbine generating facility fueled by a landfill gas project located in Johnston, Rhode Island, placed in service in 2013\n. \nOn October 7, 2024, RIE issued an RFP soliciting \n20\n MW through \n150\n MW of nameplate capacity of renewable contracting capacity; this solicitation is driven by a terminated PPA and is required in order to fulfill the \n90\n MW under LTCS. \nIn addition to the LTCS, RIE has conditionally awarded \n200\n MW under the 2023 Rhode Island Offshore Wind RFP for newly developed offshore wind energy projects, under the Affordable Clean Energy Security Act (ACES), as amended in 2022. RIE is currently in the contract negotiation period. RIE must negotiate in good faith to achieve a commercially reasonable contract and may file such contract with the RIPUC for approval once negotiations are complete, which is tentatively scheduled for March 2025.\nAs approved by the RIPUC, RIE is allowed to pass through commodity-related/purchased power costs to customers and collect remuneration equal to 2.75% for long-term contracts approved prior to January 1, 2022, pursuant to LTCS as amended in 2022, and that have achieved commercial operation. For long-term contracts approved pursuant to LTCS or ACES, both as amended, on or after January 1, 2022, RIE is entitled to financial remuneration equal to 1.0% through December 31, 2026, for those projects that are commercially operating. For long-term contracts approved pursuant to LTCS or ACES on or after January 1, 2027, RIE is not entitled to any financial remuneration, unless otherwise granted by the RIPUC. Also, the 2022 amendments to LTCS and ACES added a provision, which provides that for any calendar year in which RIE’s actual return on equity exceeds the return on equity allowed by the RIPUC in the last general rate case, the RIPUC may adjust any or all remuneration to assure that such remuneration does not result in or contribute toward RIE earning above its allowed return for such calendar year.\nLegal Matters\n(All Registrants)\nPPL and its subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings, claims and litigation in the ordinary course of business. PPL and its subsidiaries cannot predict the outcome of such matters, or whether such matters may result in material liabilities, unless otherwise noted.\nNarragansett Electric Litigation\n \n(PPL) \nEnergy Efficiency Programs Investigation \nNarragansett Electric, while under the ownership of National Grid, performed an internal investigation into conduct associated with its energy efficiency programs. On June 27, 2022, the RIPUC opened a new docket (RIPUC Docket No. 22-05-EE) to investigate RIE’s actions and the actions of employees of National Grid USA and affiliates during the time RIE was a National Grid USA affiliate being provided services by National Grid USA Service Company, Inc. relating to the manipulation of the reporting of invoices affecting the calculation of past energy efficiency shareholder incentives and the resulting impact on customers. The Rhode Island Attorney General and National Grid USA intervened in the docket and the Rhode Island Division of Public Utilities and Carriers (the Division) is an automatic party in the docket. \nOn January 19, 2023, the Division filed a motion to dismiss RIPUC Docket No. 22-05-EE without prejudice. As grounds for its motion, the Division stated that sufficient evidence exists in the docket to warrant an independent summary investigation by the Division. If the Division finds sufficient grounds, the Division may proceed to a formal hearing regarding the matters under investigation. Upon the conclusion of its investigation, the Division will provide the RIPUC with a report outlining the Division’s findings and final decision. On January 30, 2023, the Rhode Island Attorney General filed an objection to the Division’s motion to dismiss; RIE and National Grid USA each filed responses with the RIPUC requesting that any additional action taken by the RIPUC or the Division be considered after National Grid USA completes its internal investigation report, which National Grid USA filed with the RIPUC on March 10, 2023. On February 24, 2023, the Division initiated the independent summary investigation that it had referenced in its motion to dismiss. The RIPUC held a hearing on March 28, 2023 to hear oral arguments regarding the Division’s motion to dismiss and subsequently denied the motion. On November 27, 2023, the Division filed testimony recommending the RIPUC disallow a portion of the performance incentive awarded from 2012 through 2021. On January 19, 2024, the Division and the Rhode Island Attorney General filed their respective briefs recommending that the RIPUC assess financial penalties on the company. The Division also recommended that the RIPUC consider further regulatory investigations and analysis within each of the energy efficiency dockets from 2012 through 2020, to confirm the accuracy of claimed savings and to document all conduct and actions that would trigger penalties. On April 2, 2024, the RIPUC issued an amended order that expressly expands the scope of the proceeding to address issues of accountability and the question of whether statutory penalties should be assessed against RIE relating to the manipulation of the \n156\n \nTable of Contents\nreporting of invoices affecting the recovery of past shareholder incentives and the resulting impact on RIE’s customers. This RIPUC proceeding remains open and, in parallel, the Division’s summary investigation remains ongoing. In the RIPUC proceeding, RIE and National Grid USA filed testimony on June 14, 2024, supporting their position that the appropriate amount to be refunded to the energy efficiency program is less than $1 million. The Division’s current position is that $\n11\n million is the appropriate amount to be refunded to the energy efficiency program. This testimony does not address potential statutory penalties and the Division’s testimony on potential statutory penalties is due February 28, 2025. The Division’s testimony on accountability and potential statutory penalties is currently due February 21, 2025, and RIE’s and National Grid’s reply testimony will occur at the evidentiary hearings scheduled for March 2025. At this time, it is not possible to predict the final outcome, or determine the total amount of any additional liabilities that may be incurred by RIE in connection with this matter or the Division’s summary investigation. RIE does not expect this matter will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nE.W. Brown Environmental Assessment\n \n(\nPPL and KU)\nKU is undertaking extensive remedial measures at the E.W. Brown plant including closure of the former ash pond, implementation of a groundwater remedial action plan and performance of a corrective action plan including aquatic study of adjacent surface waters and risk assessment. The aquatic study and risk assessment are being undertaken pursuant to a 2017 agreed Order with the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet (KEEC). KU conducted sampling of Herrington Lake in 2017 and 2018. In June 2019, KU submitted to the KEEC the required aquatic study and risk assessment, conducted by an independent third-party consultant, finding that discharges from the E.W. Brown plant have not had any significant impact on Herrington Lake and that the water in the lake is safe for recreational use and meets safe drinking water standards. On May 31, 2021, the KEEC approved the report and released a response to public comments. On August 6, 2021, KU submitted a \nSupplemental Remedial Alternatives Analysis\n report to the KEEC that outlines proposed additional fish, water, and sediment testing. On February 18, 2022, the KEEC provided approval to KU to proceed with the proposed sampling, which commenced in the spring of 2022. On November 17, 2022, KU submitted a\n Supplemental Performance Monitoring Report\n to the KEEC finding that there are no significant unaddressed risks to human health or the environment at the plant.\n \nKU revised the \nSupplemental Performance Monitoring Report\n on June 8, 2023, in response to KEEC comments from April 24, 2023. On September 1, 2023, the KEEC requested KU to propose additional monitoring or remedial measures. KU submitted a revised \nSupplemental Performance Monitoring and Corrective Action Completion\n on December 28, 2023. In August 2024, KU submitted a proposed environmental covenant to the KEEC specifying certain site restrictions. Discussions between KU and the KEEC are ongoing.\nWater/Waste\n \n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nELGs\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized ELGs for wastewater discharge permits for new and existing steam electricity generating facilities. These guidelines require deployment of additional control technologies providing physical, chemical and biological treatment and mandate operational changes including \"zero discharge\" requirements for certain wastewaters. The implementation date for individual generating stations was to be determined by the states on a case-by-case basis according to criteria provided by the EPA. In September 2017, the EPA issued a rule to postpone the compliance date for certain requirements. In October 2020, the EPA issued revisions to its best available technology standards for certain wastewaters and potential extensions to compliance dates (the Reconsideration Rule). On May 9, 2024, the EPA issued a final rule modifying the 2020 ELG revisions. The rule increases the stringency of previous control technology and zero discharge requirements, revises certain exemptions for generating units planned for retirement, and requires case-by-case limitations for legacy wastewaters based on the best professional judgment of the state regulators. Legal challenges to the final rule have been consolidated before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. The final rule is currently under evaluation by PPL, LG&E, and KU, but could potentially result in significant operational changes and additional controls for LG&E and KU plants. The ELGs are expected to be implemented by the states or applicable permitting authorities in the course of their normal permitting activities. Certain costs are included in the Registrants' capital plans and expected to be recovered from customers through rate recovery mechanisms, but additional costs and recovery will depend on further regulatory developments at the state level. \nCCRs\nIn 2015, the EPA issued a final rule governing management of CCRs which include fly ash, bottom ash and sulfur dioxide scrubber wastes (2015 CCR Rule). The 2015 CCR Rule imposed extensive new requirements for certain CCR impoundments and landfills, including public notifications, location restrictions, design and operating standards, groundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements, and closure and post-closure care requirements, and specifies restrictions relating to the beneficial use of CCRs. In January 2022, the EPA issued several proposed regulatory determinations, facility notifications, and public announcements which indicate increased scrutiny by the EPA to determine the adequacy of measures taken by facility \n157\n \nTable of Contents\nowners and operators to achieve closure of CCR surface impoundments and landfills. In particular, the agency indicated that it will focus on certain practices which it views as posing a threat of continuing groundwater contamination. On May 8, 2024, the EPA issued a final rule (2024 CCR Rule) establishing regulatory requirements for inactive surface impoundments at inactive electricity generation facilities (legacy impoundments). The 2024 CCR Rule also establishes identification, groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure, and post-closure care requirements for all CCR management units, as defined in the rule, at regulated CCR facilities regardless of how or when the CCR was placed. The rule also requires LG&E and KU to complete applicability determinations, implement site security measures, initiate weekly inspections and monthly monitoring of the impoundment, create a website, and complete hazard assessments and reports for its legacy impoundments. Additionally, the rule could potentially subject CCR management units that have previously completed remedial action and closure and certain beneficial use projects to additional federal regulatory requirements. Legal challenges to the rule have been filed in the D.C. Circuit Court, and oral argument is expected in the second half of 2025.\nIn connection with the 2015 CCR Rule, LG&E and KU recorded adjustments to existing AROs beginning in 2015. In connection with the 2024 CCR Rule, in the second quarter of 2024, LG&E and KU recognized ARO obligations related to preliminary risk assessments, facility evaluations, feasibility studies and sampling. See Note 18 for additional information. The results of those evaluations, as well as future guidance, regulatory determinations, rulemakings, implementation determinations and other developments could potentially require revisions to current LG&E and KU compliance plans including additional monitoring and remediation at surface impoundments and landfills, the cost of which could be material. PPL, LG&E and KU are unable to predict the outcome of the ongoing litigation, rulemaking, and regulatory determinations or potential impacts on current LG&E and KU compliance plans. PPL, LG&E and KU are currently finalizing or revising closure plans and schedules in accordance with applicable regulations and further material changes to AROs, current capital plans or operating costs may be required as estimates are refined based on closure developments, groundwater monitoring results, and regulatory or legal proceedings. Costs relating to this rule are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\nLG&E and KU received KPSC approval for a compliance plan associated with the 2015 CCR Rule providing for the closure of impoundments at the Mill Creek, Trimble County, E.W. Brown, and Ghent stations, and construction of process water management facilities at those plants. In addition to the foregoing measures required for compliance with the federal CCR Rule, KU also received KPSC approval for its plans to close impoundments at the retired Green River, Pineville and Tyrone plants to comply with applicable state law. LG&E and KU have completed planned closure measures at most of the subject impoundments and have commenced post closure groundwater monitoring as required at those facilities. LG&E and KU generally expect to complete all impoundment closures within five years of commencement, although a longer period may be required to complete closure of some facilities. Associated costs are expected to be subject to rate recovery.\nSuperfund and Other Remediation\n(All Registrants)\nThe Registrants are potentially responsible for investigating and remediating contamination under the federal Superfund program and similar state programs. Actions are under way at certain sites including former manufactured gas plants in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Kentucky previously owned or operated by, or currently owned by predecessors or affiliates of, PPL subsidiaries.\nDepending on the outcome of investigations at identified sites where investigations have not begun or been completed, or developments at sites for which information is incomplete, additional costs of remediation could be incurred. PPL, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU lack sufficient information about such additional sites to estimate any potential liability or range of reasonably possible losses, if any, related to these sites. Such costs, however, are not currently expected to be significant.\nThe EPA is evaluating the risks associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and naphthalene, chemical by-products of manufactured gas plant operations. As a result, individual states may establish stricter standards for water quality and soil cleanup, that could require several PPL subsidiaries to take more extensive assessment and remedial actions at former manufactured gas plants. The Registrants cannot reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, if any, related to these matters.\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nPPL Electric is a potentially responsible party for a share of clean-up costs at certain sites. Cleanup actions have been or are being undertaken at these sites as requested by governmental agencies, the costs of which have not been and are not expected to be significant to PPL Electric.\n158\n \nTable of Contents\nAt December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, PPL Electric had a recorded liability of $\n8\n million and $\n8\n million, representing its best estimate of the probable loss incurred to remediate these sites.\n(PPL)\n \nRIE is a potentially responsible party for a share of clean-up costs at certain sites including former manufactured gas plant facilities formerly owned by the Blackstone Valley Gas and Electric Company and the Rhode Island gas distribution assets of the New England Gas division of Southern Union Company and electric operations at certain RIE facilities. RIE is currently investigating and remediating, as necessary, those sites and certain other properties under agreements with governmental agencies, the costs of which have not been and are not expected to be significant to PPL.\nAt December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, RIE had a recorded liability of $\n98\n million and $\n99\n million, representing its best estimate of the remaining costs of environmental remediation activities. These undiscounted costs are expected to be incurred over approximately \n30\n years and to be subject to rate recovery. However, remediation costs for each site may be materially higher than estimated, depending on changing technologies and regulatory standards, selected end uses for each site, and actual environmental conditions encountered. RIE has recovered amounts from certain insurers and potentially responsible parties, and, where appropriate, may seek additional recovery from other insurers and potentially responsible parties, but it is uncertain whether, and to what extent, such efforts will be successful. \nThe RIPUC has approved two settlement agreements that provide for rate recovery of qualified remediation costs of certain contaminated sites located in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. Rate-recoverable contributions for electric operations of approximately $\n3\n million are added annually to RIE's Environmental Response Fund, established with RIPUC approval in March 2000 to address such costs, along with interest and any recoveries from insurance carriers and other third-parties. In addition, RIE recovers approximately $\n1\n million annually for gas operations under a distribution adjustment charge in which the qualified remediation costs are amortized over \n10\n years. See Note 7 for additional information on RIE's recorded environmental regulatory assets and liabilities. \nRegulatory Issues\nSee Note 7 for information on regulatory matters related to utility rate regulation.\nElectricity - Reliability Standards\nThe NERC is responsible for establishing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards (Reliability Standards) regarding the bulk electric system in North America. The FERC oversees this process and independently enforces the Reliability Standards.\nThe Reliability Standards have the force and effect of law and apply to certain users of the bulk electric system, including electric utility companies, generators and marketers. Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC may assess civil penalties for certain violations.\nPPL Electric, LG&E, KU and RIE monitor their compliance with the Reliability Standards and self-report or self-log potential violations of applicable reliability requirements whenever identified, and submit accompanying mitigation plans, as required. The resolution of a small number of potential violations is pending. Penalties incurred to date have not been significant. Any Regional Reliability Entity determination concerning the resolution of violations of the Reliability Standards remains subject to the approval of the NERC and the FERC.\nIn the course of implementing their programs to ensure compliance with the Reliability Standards by those PPL affiliates subject to the standards, certain other instances of potential non-compliance may be identified from time to time. The Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters, and an estimate or range of possible losses cannot be determined.\nGas - Security Directives\n \n(PPL and LG&E)\nIn May and July of 2021, the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) Transportation Security Administration released two security directives applicable to certain notified owners and operators of natural gas pipeline facilities (including local distribution companies) that the Transportation Security Administration has determined to be critical. The Transportation Security Administration has determined that LG&E is within the scope of the directive, while RIE has not been notified of this distinction. The first security directive required notified owners/operators to implement cybersecurity incident reporting to the DHS, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, and perform a gap assessment of current entity cybersecurity practices against \n159\n \nTable of Contents\ncertain voluntary Transportation Security Administration security guidelines and report relevant results and proposed mitigation to applicable DHS agencies. The second security directive, revised in July of 2024, requires refinement of the cybersecurity implementation plan and the cybersecurity assessment plan. LG&E does not believe the security directives have had or will have a significant impact on LG&E’s operations or financial condition. \nOther \nGuarantees and Other Assurances\n(All Registrants)\nIn the normal course of business, the Registrants enter into agreements that provide financial performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Examples of such agreements include guarantees, stand-by letters of credit issued by financial institutions and surety bonds issued by insurance companies. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis or to facilitate the commercial activities in which these subsidiaries engage.\n(PPL)\nPPL fully and unconditionally guarantees all of the debt obligations of PPL Capital Funding.\n(All Registrants)\nThe table below details guarantees provided as of December 31, 2024.\n \"Exposure\" represents the estimated maximum potential amount of future payments that could be required to be made under the guarantee. The Registrants believe the probability of expected payment/performance under each of these guarantees is remote, except for the guarantees and indemnifications related to the sale of Safari Holdings, which PPL believes are reasonably possible but not probable of occurring.\n \nFor reporting purposes, on a consolidated basis, the guarantees of PPL include the guarantees of its subsidiary Registrants.\nExposure at December 31, 2024\nExpiration\nDate\nPPL\n \n \n \nIndemnifications related to certain tax liabilities related to the sale of the U.K. utility business \n£\n50\n \n(a)\n2028\nPPL guarantee of Safari payment obligations under certain sale/leaseback financing transactions related to the sale of Safari Holdings\n$\n100\n \n(b)\n2028\nIndemnifications for losses suffered related to items not covered by Aspen Power's representation and warranty insurance associated with the sale of Safari Holdings\n140\n \n(c)\nVarious\nLG&E and KU\n \n \n \nLG&E and KU obligation of shortfall related to OVEC\n \n(d)\n \n(a)\nPPL WPD Limited entered into a Tax Deed dated June 9, 2021 in which it agreed to a tax indemnity regarding certain potential tax liabilities of the entities sold with respect to periods prior to the completion of the sale, subject to customary exclusions and limitations. Because National Grid Holdings One plc, the buyer, agreed to purchase indemnity insurance, the amount of the cap on the indemnity for these liabilities is £1, except with respect to certain surrenders of tax losses, for which the amount of the cap on the indemnity is £\n50\n million.\n(b)\nPPL guaranteed the payment obligations of Safari under certain sale/leaseback financing transactions executed by Safari. These guarantees will remain in place until Safari exercises its option to buy-out the projects under the sale/leaseback financings by the year 2028. Safari will indemnify PPL for any payments made by PPL or claims against PPL under the sale/leaseback transaction guarantees up to $\n25\n million. \n(c)\nAspen Power has obtained representation and warranty insurance, therefore, PPL generally has no liability for its representations and warranties under the agreement except for losses suffered related to items not covered. Expiration of these indemnifications range from 18 months to 6 years from the date of the closing of the transaction, and PPL’s aggregate liability for these claims will not exceed $\n140\n million subject to certain adjustments plus the support obligations provided by PPL under sale-leaseback financings and PPAs that will be replaced by Aspen Power. PPL's support obligations related to the PPAs were replaced by Aspen Power and terminated on January 8, 2024.\n(d)\nPursuant to the OVEC power purchase contract, LG&E and KU are obligated to pay for their share of OVEC's excess debt service, post-retirement and decommissioning costs, as well as any shortfall from amounts included within a demand charge designed and expected to cover these costs over the term of the contract. PPL's proportionate share of OVEC's outstanding debt was $\n81\n million at December 31, 2024, consisting of LG&E's share of $\n56\n million and KU's share of $\n25\n million. The maximum exposure and the expiration date of these potential obligations are not presently determinable. See \"Energy Purchase Commitments\" above for additional information on the OVEC power purchase contract.\nThe Registrants provide other miscellaneous guarantees through contracts entered into in the normal course of business. These guarantees are primarily in the form of indemnification or warranties related to services or equipment and vary in duration. The amounts of these guarantees often are not explicitly stated, and the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantees cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, no significant payments have been made with respect to these types of guarantees and the probability of payment/performance under these guarantees is remote.\n160\n \nTable of Contents\nPPL, on behalf of itself and certain of its subsidiaries, maintains insurance that covers liability assumed under contract for bodily injury and property damage. The coverage provides maximum aggregate coverage of $\n231\n million. This insurance may be applicable to obligations under certain of these contractual arrangements.\n13. Related Party Transactions \nWholesale Sales and Purchases\n \n(LG&E and KU)\n \nLG&E and KU jointly dispatch their generation units with the lowest cost generation used to serve their retail customers. When LG&E has excess generation capacity after serving its own retail customers and its generation cost is lower than that of KU, KU purchases electricity from LG&E and vice versa. These transactions are reflected in the Statements of Income as \"Electric revenue from affiliate\" and \"Energy purchases from affiliate\" and are recorded at a price equal to the seller's fuel cost plus any split savings. Savings realized from such intercompany transactions are shared equally between both companies. The volume of energy each company has to sell to the other is dependent on its retail customers' needs and its available generation.\nSupport Costs\n \n(PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)\nPPL Services and LKS provide the Registrants, their respective subsidiaries and each other with administrative, management and support services. For all services companies, the costs of directly assignable and attributable services are charged to the respective recipients as direct support costs. General costs that cannot be directly attributed to a specific entity are allocated and charged to the respective recipients as indirect support costs. PPL Services and LKS use a three-factor methodology that includes the applicable recipients' invested capital, operation and maintenance expenses and number of employees to allocate indirect costs. PPL Services may also use a ratio of overall direct and indirect costs or a weighted average cost ratio. \nPPL Services and LKS charged the following amounts for the years ended December 31, including amounts applied to accounts that are further distributed between capital and expense on the books of the recipients, based on methods that are believed to be reasonable.\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nPPL Electric from PPL Services\n$\n227\n \n$\n222\n \n$\n241\n \nLG&E from LKS\n105\n \n115\n \n153\n \nLG&E from PPL Services\n66\n \n42\n \n13\n \nKU from LKS\n130\n \n150\n \n171\n \nKU from PPL Services\n65\n \n48\n \n14\n \nIn addition to the charges for services noted above, LKS makes payments on behalf of LG&E and KU for fuel purchases and other costs for products or services provided by third parties. LG&E and KU also provide services to each other and to LKS. Billings between LG&E and KU relate to labor and overheads associated with union and hourly employees performing work for the other company, charges related to jointly-owned generating units and other miscellaneous charges. Tax settlements between PPL and LG&E and KU are reimbursed through LKS.\nIntercompany Borrowings\n(PPL Electric)\nCEP Reserves maintains a $\n800\n million revolving line of credit with a PPL Electric subsidiary. At December 31, 2024, CEP Reserves had $\n222\n million\n of borrowings outstanding. At December 31, 2023, CEP Reserves had \nno\n borrowings outstanding. The interest rates on borrowings are equal to one-month SOFR plus a spread. Interest income is reflected in \"Interest Income from Affiliate\" on the Income Statements.\n(LG&E and KU)\nLG&E participates in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby LKE and/or KU make available to LG&E funds up to the difference between LG&E's FERC borrowing limit and LG&E's commercial paper limit at an interest rate based on the lower of a market index of commercial paper issues and two additional rate options based on SOFR. At December 31, 2024, LG&E's money pool unused capacity was $\n682\n million. At December 31, 2024 LG&E had borrowings outstanding of $\n43\n million\n from KU and/or LKE. At December 31, 2023, LG&E's borrowings outstanding from KU and/or LKE were not significant.\n161\n \nTable of Contents\nKU participates in an intercompany money pool agreement whereby LKE and/or LG&E make available to KU funds up to the difference between KU's FERC borrowing limit and KU's commercial paper limit at an interest rate based on the lower of a market index of commercial paper issues and two additional rate options based on SOFR. At December 31, 2024, KU's money pool unused capacity was $\n437\n million. At December 31, 2024 KU had borrowings outstanding of $\n73\n million\n from LG&E and/or LKE. At December 31, 2023, KU's borrowings outstanding from LG&E and/or LKE were not significant.\nVEBA Funds Receivable \n(PPL Electric)\nIn 2018, PPL received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS permitting a transfer of excess funds from the PPL Bargaining Unit Retiree Health Plan VEBA to a new subaccount within the VEBA, to be used to pay medical claims of active bargaining unit employees. In October 2024, additional excess funds were removed from the PPL Bargaining Unit Retiree Health Plan VEBA and deposited into the existing subaccount within the VEBA to be used to pay medical claims of active bargaining unit employees. Based on PPL Electric's participation in PPL’s Other Postretirement Benefit plan, PPL Electric was allocated a portion of the excess funds from PPL Services. These funds have been recorded as an intercompany receivable on PPL Electric's balance sheets. The receivable balance decreases as PPL Electric pays incurred medical claims and is reimbursed by PPL Services. The intercompany receivable balance associated with these funds was $\n7\n million at December 31, 2024, of which $\n4\n million was reflected in \"Accounts receivable from affiliates\" and $\n3\n million was reflected in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on PPL Electric's balance sheets. There was \nno\n intercompany receivable balance associated with these funds at December 31, 2023, as the initial allocation from the 2018 private letter ruling was depleted.\nOther\n \n(PPL Electric, LG&E and KU)\nSee Note 1 for discussions regarding the intercompany tax sharing agreement (for PPL Electric, LG&E and KU) and intercompany allocations of stock-based compensation expense (for PPL Electric). For PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, see Note 10 for discussions regarding intercompany allocations associated with defined benefits.\n \n14.

Fair Value Measurements\n(All Registrants)\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). A market approach (generally, data from market transactions), an income approach (generally, present value techniques and option-pricing models), and/or a cost approach (generally, replacement cost) are used to measure the fair value of an asset or liability, as appropriate. These valuation approaches incorporate inputs such as observable, independent market data and/or unobservable data that management believes are predicated on the assumptions market participants would use to price an asset or liability. These inputs may incorporate, as applicable, certain risks such as nonperformance risk, which includes credit risk. \nThe fair value of a group of financial assets and liabilities is measured on a net basis.\n See Note 1 for information on the levels in the fair value hierarchy.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe assets and liabilities measured at fair value were:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nPPL\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAssets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n306\n \n$\n306\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n331\n \n$\n331\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (a)\n33\n \n33\n \n—\n \n—\n \n51\n \n51\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash (b)\n339\n \n339\n \n—\n \n—\n \n382\n \n382\n \n—\n \n—\n \nSpecial use funds (a):\nMoney market fund\n1\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCommingled debt fund measured at NAV (c)\n10\n \n— \n— \n— \n9\n \n— \n— \n— \nCommingled equity fund measured at NAV (c)\n8\n \n— \n— \n— \n8\n \n— \n— \n— \nTotal special use funds\n19\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n18\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n163\n \nTable of Contents\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nPrice risk management assets (d):\nGas contracts\n9\n \n—\n \n4\n \n5\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \nTotal assets\n$\n367\n \n$\n340\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n401\n \n$\n383\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \nLiabilities\n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrice risk management liabilities (d):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInterest rate swaps\n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \nGas contracts\n13\n \n—\n \n10\n \n3\n \n60\n \n—\n \n41\n \n19\n \nTotal price risk management liabilities\n$\n16\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n67\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n48\n \n$\n19\n \nPPL Electric\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAssets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n24\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n51\n \n$\n51\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nTotal assets\n$\n24\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n51\n \n$\n51\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nLG&E\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAssets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n8\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (a)\n16\n \n16\n \n—\n \n—\n \n26\n \n26\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash (b)\n24\n \n24\n \n—\n \n—\n \n44\n \n44\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal assets\n$\n24\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n44\n \n$\n44\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nLiabilities\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrice risk management liabilities:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInterest rate swaps\n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \nTotal price risk management liabilities\n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \nKU\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAssets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n13\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents (a)\n16\n \n16\n \n—\n \n—\n \n24\n \n24\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash (b) \n29\n \n29\n \n—\n \n—\n \n38\n \n38\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal assets\n$\n29\n \n$\n29\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n(a)\nCurrent portion is included in \"Other current assets\" and noncurrent portion is included in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on the Balance Sheets.\n(b)\nTotal Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash provides a reconciliation of these items reported within the Balance Sheets to the sum shown on the Statements of Cash Flows.\n(c)\nIn accordance with accounting guidance, certain investments that are measured at fair value using net asset value per share (NAV), or its equivalent, have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

In 2018, PPL received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS permitting a transfer of excess funds from the PPL Bargaining Unit Retiree Health Plan VEBA to a new subaccount within the VEBA to be used to pay medical claims of active bargaining unit employees. In 2024, additional excess funds were removed from the PPL Bargaining Unit Retiree Health Plan VEBA and deposited in the \n164\n \nTable of Contents\nexisting subaccount within the VEBA to be used to pay medical claims of active bargaining unit employees. The funds are invested primarily in commingled debt and equity funds measured at NAV and are classified as investments in equity securities. Changes in the fair value of the funds are recorded to the Statements of Income.\nPrice Risk Management Assets/Liabilities\nInterest Rate Swaps (\nPPL, LG&E and KU)\n \nTo manage interest rate risk, PPL, LG&E and KU use interest rate contracts such as forward-starting swaps, floating-to-fixed swaps and fixed-to-floating swaps. An income approach is used to measure the fair value of these contracts, utilizing readily observable inputs, such as forward interest rates (e.g., SOFR and government security rates), as well as inputs that may not be observable, such as credit valuation adjustments. In certain cases, market information cannot practicably be obtained to value credit risk and therefore internal models are relied upon. These models use projected probabilities of default and estimated recovery rates based on historical observances. When the credit valuation adjustment is significant to the overall valuation, the contracts are classified as Level 3.\nGas Contracts\n (PPL)\nTo manage gas commodity price risk associated with natural gas purchases, RIE utilizes over-the-counter (OTC) gas swaps contracts with pricing inputs obtained from the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), except in cases where the ICE publishes seasonal averages or where there were no transactions within the last seven days. RIE may utilize discounting based on quoted interest rate curves, including consideration of non-performance risk, and may include a liquidity reserve calculated based on bid/ask spread. Substantially all of these price curves are observable in the marketplace throughout at least 95% of the remaining contractual quantity, or they could be constructed from market observable curves with correlation coefficients of 95% or higher. These contracts are classified as Level 2.\nRIE also utilizes gas option and purchase and capacity transactions, which are valued based on internally developed models. Industry-standard valuation techniques, such as the Black-Scholes pricing model, are used for valuing such instruments. For valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is classified as Level 3. This includes derivative instruments valued using indicative price quotations whose contract tenure extends into unobservable periods. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility, and contract duration. Such instruments are classified as in Level 3 as the model inputs generally are not observable. RIE considers non-performance risk and liquidity risk in the valuation of derivative instruments classified as Level 2 and Level 3.\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the gas derivative instruments are implied volatility and gas forward curves. A relative change in commodity price at various locations underlying the open positions can result in significantly different fair value estimates.\nFinancial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value\n \n(All Registrants)\nThe carrying amounts of long-term debt on the Balance Sheets and their estimated fair values are set forth below.\n Long-term debt is classified as Level 2.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nRisk Management Objectives\n(All Registrants)\nPPL has a risk management policy approved by the Board of Directors to manage market risk associated with commodities, interest rates on debt issuances (including price, liquidity and volumetric risk) and credit risk (including non-performance risk and payment default risk). The Risk Management Committee, comprised of senior management and chaired by the Vice President-Financial Strategy and Chief Risk Officer, oversees the risk management function. Key risk control activities designed to ensure compliance with the risk policy and detailed programs include, but are not limited to, credit review and approval, validation of transactions, verification of risk and transaction limits, value-at-risk analyses (VaR, a statistical model that attempts to estimate the value of potential loss over a given holding period under normal market conditions at a given confidence level) and the coordination and reporting of the Enterprise Risk Management program.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk includes the potential loss that may be incurred as a result of price changes associated with a particular financial or commodity instrument as well as market liquidity and volumetric risks. Forward contracts, futures contracts, options, swaps and structured transactions are utilized as part of risk management strategies to minimize unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in commodity prices and interest rates. Many of these contracts meet the definition of a derivative. All derivatives are recognized on the Balance Sheets at their fair value, unless NPNS is elected.\nThe following summarizes the market risks that affect PPL and its subsidiaries.\nInterest Rate Risk\n•\nPPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with forecasted fixed-rate and existing floating-rate debt issuances. PPL and LG&E utilize over-the-counter interest rate swaps to limit exposure to market fluctuations on floating-rate debt. PPL, LG&E and KU utilize forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge changes in benchmark interest rates, when appropriate, in connection with future debt issuance.\n•\nPPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk associated with debt securities and derivatives held by defined benefit plans. This risk is significantly mitigated to the extent that the plans are sponsored at, or sponsored on behalf of, the regulated utilities due to the recovery methods in place.\nCommodity Price Risk\nPPL is exposed to commodity price risk through its subsidiaries as described below.\n•\nPPL Electric is required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation as a PLR. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its PAPUC-approved cost recovery mechanism and full-requirement supply agreements to serve its PLR customers which transfer the risk to energy suppliers.\n•\nLG&E's and KU's rates include certain mechanisms for fuel, fuel-related expenses and energy purchases. In addition, LG&E's rates include a mechanism for natural gas supply costs. These mechanisms generally provide for timely recovery of market price fluctuations associated with these costs.\n•\nRIE utilizes derivative instruments pursuant to its RIPUC-approved plan to manage commodity price risk associated with its natural gas purchases. RIE's commodity price risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in firm gas sales prices to its customers. RIE's costs associated with derivatives instruments are recoverable through its RIPUC- approved cost recovery mechanisms. RIE is also required to purchase electricity to fulfill its obligation to provide Last Resort Service (LRS). Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms and full requirements service agreements to serve LRS customers, which transfer the risk to energy suppliers. Additionally, RIE is required to contract through long-term agreements for clean energy supply under the Rhode Island Renewable Energy Growth program and Long-term Clean Energy Standard. Potential commodity price risk is mitigated through its RIPUC-approved cost recovery mechanisms, which true-up cost differences between contract prices and market prices.\n \nVolumetric Risk\nVolumetric risk is the risk related to the changes in volume of retail sales due to weather, economic conditions or other factors. PPL is exposed to volumetric risk through its subsidiaries as described below:\n166\n \nTable of Contents\n•\nPPL Electric, LG&E and KU are exposed to volumetric risk on retail sales, mainly due to weather and other economic conditions for which there is limited mitigation between rate cases. \n•\nRIE is exposed to volumetric risk, which is significantly mitigated by regulatory mechanisms. RIE's electric and gas distribution rates both have a revenue decoupling mechanism, which allows for annual adjustments to RIE's delivery rates.\nEquity Securities Price Risk\n•\nPPL and its subsidiaries are exposed to equity securities price risk associated with the fair value of the defined benefit plans' assets. This risk is significantly mitigated due to the recovery methods in place.\n•\nPPL is exposed to equity securities price risk from future stock sales and/or purchases.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the potential loss that may be incurred due to a counterparty's non-performance.\nPPL is exposed to credit risk from \"in-the-money\" transactions with counterparties, as well as additional credit risk through certain of its subsidiaries, as discussed below.\nIn the event a supplier of PPL, PPL Electric, LG&E or KU defaults on its contractual obligation, those Registrants would be required to seek replacement power or replacement fuel in the market. In general, subject to regulatory review or other processes, appropriate incremental costs incurred by these entities would be recoverable from customers through applicable rate mechanisms, thereby mitigating the financial risk for these entities.\nPPL and its subsidiaries have credit policies in place to manage credit risk, including the use of an established credit approval process, daily monitoring of counterparty positions and the use of master netting agreements or provisions. These agreements generally include credit mitigation provisions, such as margin, prepayment or collateral requirements. PPL and its subsidiaries may request additional credit assurance, in certain circumstances, in the event that the counterparties' credit ratings fall below investment grade, their tangible net worth falls below specified percentages or their exposures exceed an established credit limit.\nMaster Netting Arrangements\n \n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nNet derivative positions on the balance sheets are not offset against the right to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable) or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable) under master netting arrangements.\nPPL, LG&E and KU had \nno\n cash collateral posted or obligation to return cash collateral under master netting arrangements at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nSee \"Offsetting Derivative Instruments\" below for a summary of derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements.\nInterest Rate Risk\n(All Registrants)\nPPL and its subsidiaries issue debt to finance their operations, which exposes them to interest rate risk. A variety of financial derivative instruments are utilized to adjust the mix of fixed and floating interest rates in their debt portfolios, adjust the duration of the debt portfolios and lock in benchmark interest rates in anticipation of future financing, when appropriate. Risk limits under PPL's risk management program are designed to balance risk exposure to volatility in interest expense and changes in the fair value of the debt portfolio due to changes in benchmark interest rates. In addition, the interest rate risk of certain subsidiaries is potentially mitigated as a result of the existing regulatory framework or the timing of rate cases.\nCash Flow Hedges\n \n(PPL)\nInterest rate risks include exposure to adverse interest rate movements for outstanding variable rate debt and for future anticipated financings. Financial interest rate swap contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges may be entered into to hedge floating interest rate risk associated with both existing and anticipated debt issuances. PPL had no such contracts at December 31, 2024.\n167\n \nTable of Contents\nCash flow hedges are discontinued if it is no longer probable that the original forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period and any amounts previously recorded in AOCI are reclassified into earnings once it is determined that the hedged transaction is not probable of occurring.\nFor 2024, 2023 and 2022, PPL had \nno\n cash flow hedges reclassified into earnings associated with discontinued cash flow hedges. \nAt December 31, 2024, the amount of accumulated net unrecognized after-tax gains (losses) on qualifying derivatives expected to be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months is insignificant. Amounts are reclassified as the hedged interest expense is recorded. \nEconomic Activity\n \n(PPL and LG&E)\nLG&E enters into interest rate swap contracts that economically hedge interest payments. Because realized gains and losses from the swaps, including terminated swap contracts, are recoverable through regulated rates, any subsequent changes in fair value of these derivatives are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as interest expense. Realized gains and losses are recognized in \"Interest Expense\" on the Statements of Income at the time the underlying hedged interest expense is recorded. At December 31, 2024, LG&E held contracts with a notional amount of $\n64\n million that mature in 2033.\nCommodity Price Risk\n (PPL)\nEconomic Activity\nRIE enters into derivative contracts that economically hedge natural gas purchases. Realized gains and losses from the derivatives are recoverable through regulated rates, therefore subsequent changes in fair value are included in regulatory assets or liabilities until they are realized as purchased gas. Realized gains and losses are recognized in \"Energy Purchases\" on the Statements of Income upon settlement of the contracts. See Note 7 for amounts recorded in regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities at December 31, 2024. At December 31, 2024, RIE held contracts with notional volumes of \n49\n Bcf that range in maturity from 2025 through 2029.\nAccounting and Reporting\n(All Registrants)\nAll derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the Balance Sheet as an asset or liability unless the NPNS is elected. NPNS contracts include certain full-requirement purchase contracts and other physical purchase contracts.

Under the agreements, upon termination of the agreement as a result of a default or other termination event, the non-defaulting party typically would have a right to set off amounts owed under the agreement against any other obligations arising between the two parties (whether under the agreement or not), whether matured or contingent and irrespective of the currency, place of payment or place of booking of the obligation.\nPPL, LG&E and KU have elected not to offset derivative assets and liabilities and not to offset net derivative positions against the right to reclaim cash collateral pledged (an asset) or the obligation to return cash collateral received (a liability) under derivatives agreements. \nThe table below summarizes the derivative positions presented in the balance sheets where a right of setoff exists under these arrangements and related cash collateral received or pledged.\n \nAssets\nLiabilities\n \n \nEligible for Offset\n \n \nEligible for Offset\n \n \nGross\nDerivative\nInstruments\nCash\nCollateral\nReceived\nNet\nGross\nDerivative\nInstruments\nCash\nCollateral\nPledged\nNet\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDerivatives\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPPL\n$\n9\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n11\n \nLG&E\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDerivatives\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPPL\n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n67\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n67\n \nLG&E\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n7\n \nCredit Risk-Related Contingent Features\nCertain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features which, when in a net liability position, would permit the counterparties to require the transfer of additional collateral upon a decrease in the credit ratings of PPL, LG&E and KU or certain of their subsidiaries. Most of these features would require the transfer of additional collateral or permit the counterparty to terminate the contract if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade. Some of these features also would allow the counterparty to require additional collateral upon each downgrade in credit rating at levels that remain above investment grade. In either case, if the applicable credit rating were to fall below investment grade, and assuming no assignment to an investment grade affiliate were allowed, most of these credit contingent features require either immediate payment of the net liability as a termination payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions.\nAdditionally, certain derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features that require adequate assurance of performance be provided if the other party has reasonable concerns regarding the performance of PPL's, LG&E's and KU's obligations under the contracts. A counterparty demanding adequate assurance could require a transfer of additional collateral or other security, including letters of credit, cash and guarantees from a creditworthy entity. This would typically involve negotiations among the parties. However, amounts disclosed below would represent assumed immediate payment or immediate and ongoing full collateralization for derivative instruments in net liability positions with \"adequate assurance\" features.\n171\n \nTable of Contents\n(PPL)\nAt December 31, 2024, derivative contracts in a net liability position that contain credit risk-related contingent features was $\n3\n million. The aggregate fair value of additional collateral requirements in the event of a credit downgrade below investment grade was $\n4\n million.\n17.

Asset Retirement Obligations\n(PPL and PPL Electric)\nPPL Electric has identified legal retirement obligations for the retirement of certain transmission assets that could not be reasonably estimated due to indeterminable settlement dates. These assets are located on rights-of-way that allow the grantor to require PPL Electric to relocate or remove the assets. Since this option is at the discretion of the grantor of the right-of-way, PPL Electric is unable to determine when these events may occur.\n(PPL, LG&E and KU)\nPPL's, LG&E's and KU's ARO liabilities are primarily related to CCR closure costs. See Note 12 for information on the CCR rule. LG&E and RIE also have AROs related to natural gas mains and wells. LG&E's and KU's transmission and distribution lines largely operate under perpetual property easement agreements, which do not generally require restoration upon removal of the property. Therefore, no material AROs are recorded for transmission and distribution assets. For LG&E, KU, and RIE , all ARO accretion and depreciation expenses are reclassified as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability. ARO regulatory assets associated with certain CCR projects are amortized to expense in accordance with regulatory approvals. For other AROs, deferred accretion and depreciation expense is recovered through cost of removal.\n174\n \nTable of Contents\nThe changes in the carrying amounts of AROs were as follows:\nPPL\nLG&E\nKU\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nARO at beginning of period\n$\n158\n \n$\n177\n \n$\n85\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n66\n \n$\n82\n \nAccretion\n8\n \n9\n \n4\n \n4\n \n4\n \n5\n \nObligations incurred\n9\n \n2\n \n3\n \n1\n \n6\n \n1\n \nChanges in estimated timing or cost\n4\n \n15\n \n3\n \n11\n \n1\n \n6\n \nObligations settled\n(\n24\n)\n(\n39\n)\n(\n11\n)\n(\n11\n)\n(\n13\n)\n(\n28\n)\nOther\n2\n \n(\n6\n)\n—\n \n(\n6\n)\n—\n \nARO at end of period\n$\n157\n \n$\n158\n \n$\n84\n \n$\n85\n \n$\n64\n \n$\n66\n \n \n19.

New Accounting Guidance Pending Adoption\n(All Registrants)\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance which requires public business entities to provide additional income tax disclosures including a disaggregated rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. \nFor public business entities, this guidance will be applied on a prospective basis. Retrospective application is permitted. This guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made available for issuance.\nThe Registrants are currently assessing the impact of adopting this guidance.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance which requires public business entities to provide in the notes to financial statements specified information about certain costs and expenses.

The aforementioned principal officers have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures are also effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officers and principal financial officers, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n(b)\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting.\nPPL Corporation, PPL Electric Utilities Corporation, Louisville Gas and Electric Company, and Kentucky Utilities Company\nThe Registrants' principal executive officers and principal financial officers have concluded that there were no changes in the Registrants' internal control over financial reporting during the Registrants' fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Registrants' internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nPPL Corporation\nPPL's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f). PPL's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to PPL's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm.\nPPL Electric Utilities Corporation, Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Kentucky Utilities Company\nManagement of PPL's non-accelerated filer companies, PPL Electric, LG&E and KU, are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f). Each of the aforementioned companies' internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and Board of Directors of these companies regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\n177\n \nTable of Contents\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of the companies listed above, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on our evaluation under the framework in \"Internal Control - Integrated Framework\" (2013), management of these companies concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. This annual report does not include an attestation report of Deloitte & Touche LLP, the companies' independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting for these non-accelerated filer companies. The effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the aforementioned companies was not subject to attestation by the companies' registered public accounting firm pursuant to rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission that permit these companies to provide only management's report in this annual report.\n178\n \nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nTo the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of PPL Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PPL Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 13, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nMorristown, New Jersey\nFebruary 13, 2025\n179\n \nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.
