The performance of our business and our securities may be adversely affected by these factors and by other factors common to other businesses and investments, or to the general economy. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any intent or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Readers should carefully review the disclosures and the risk factors described in this and other documents we file from time to time with the SEC, including our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.\n2\nTable of Contents\nPART I\nItem 1. \nBusiness\nGENERAL\nFair Isaac Corporation (NYSE: FICO) (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” which may also be referred to in this report as “we,” “us,” “our,” and “FICO”) is a global analytics software leader. We were founded in 1956 on the premise that data, used intelligently, can improve business decisions. Today, FICO’s software and the widely used FICO\n®\n Score operationalize analytics, enabling thousands of businesses in more than 80 countries to uncover new opportunities, make timely decisions that matter, and execute them at scale. Most leading banks and credit card issuers rely on our solutions, as do insurers, retailers, telecommunications providers, automotive lenders, consumer reporting agencies, public agencies, and organizations in other industries. We also serve consumers through online services that enable people to access and understand their FICO Scores — the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the United States (“U.S.”) — empowering them to increase financial literacy and manage their financial health. More information about us can be found on our website, www.fico.com. We make our Annual Reports on Forms 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q, and Current Reports on Forms 8-K, as well as amendments to those reports, available free of charge through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). References to our website address in this report do not constitute an incorporation by reference. Information on our website is not part of this report.\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\nOur business consists of two operating segments: Scores and Software.\n \nOur Scores segment includes our business-to-business (“B2B”) scoring solutions and services which give our clients access to predictive credit and other scores that can be easily integrated into their transaction streams and decision-making processes. This segment also includes our business-to-consumer (“B2C”) scoring solutions, including our myFICO.com subscription offerings.\nOur Software segment includes pre-configured analytic and decision management solutions designed for a specific type of business need or process — such as account origination, customer management, customer engagement, fraud detection, and marketing — as well as associated professional services. This segment also includes FICO\n®\n Platform, a modular software offering designed to support advanced analytic and decision use cases, as well as stand-alone analytic and decisioning software that can be configured by our customers to address a wide variety of business use cases. Our offerings are available to our customers as software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) or as on-premises software.\nScores\nOur B2B scoring solutions include the FICO\n®\n Score, which is the standard measure of consumer credit risk in the U.S. It is used in most U.S. credit decisions, by nearly all major banks, credit card issuers, mortgage lenders, and auto loan originators. Our B2B scoring solutions are primarily distributed through major consumer reporting agencies worldwide. Our B2C scores are sold directly to consumers through our myFICO.com website and other direct-to-consumer channels.\nThe FICO\n®\n Score is a three-digit number ranging from 300-850. Our proprietary analytic algorithms are applied to credit data collected and maintained by the three U.S. national consumer reporting agencies — Experian, TransUnion and Equifax — to produce standard scores that are used across the credit lifecycle, including in origination, account management and consumer marketing. Users of our scores generally pay the consumer reporting agencies a fee for each individual score generated by our algorithms, and the consumer reporting agencies pay an associated fee to us. Except for product development using de-personalized data, FICO does not collect or store the consumer credit data used in the calculation of our scores, and in most cases, we do not sell our scores directly to lenders or other end-users.\nSince the introduction of the FICO\n®\n Score in the U.S. in 1989, we have regularly updated the score to take advantage of newly available data and enhanced analytics. FICO\n®\n Score 9 introduced the utilization of reported rental payment history, while also de-emphasizing medical debt and disregarding paid collections. Our most recent and most predictive scores, FICO\n®\n Score 10 and 10 T, were introduced in 2020. To increase its predictive power, FICO Score 10 T builds on FICO Score 10 but also incorporates trended credit data. Trended data considers a longer historical view, giving lenders even more insight into how individuals are managing their credit. Updated versions of our FICO Scores are generally designed to provide greater predictive accuracy than the scores they replace, and to be compatible with prior versions of the FICO Score.\n3\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the FICO\n®\n Score, we offer several other broad-based scores, including specific FICO\n®\n Industry Scores. For example, in 2021 we introduced Bankcard and Auto Industry versions of FICO\n®\n Score 10. We also develop various custom scores for our financial services clients.\nThe FICO\n®\n Resilience Index offering is designed to complement FICO\n®\n Score models by identifying those consumers who are more resilient to economic stress relative to other consumers within the same FICO Score bands. The FICO Resilience Index is designed to enable lenders to continue to lend and better manage risk by providing a more precise assessment of loan default risk during periods of economic stress.\nFICO has invested significant resources in the development of scores that can help expand credit access and lower borrowing costs for consumers that have limited credit history or who have sparse or inactive credit files. These scores use alternative data sources to enhance conventional consumer reporting agency data and generate scores for otherwise un-scorable consumers and in many cases improve the credit scores of scorable consumers.\n•\nFICO\n®\n Score XD uses public records and property data, and a consumer’s history with mobile phone, landline phone and cable payments, to generate scores on the same 300-850 scale as standard FICO\n®\n Scores. FICO Score XD is available to lenders through our distribution partners, LexisNexis Risk Solutions and Equifax. \n•\nThe UltraFICO\n®\n Score uses consumer-permissioned data such as checking, savings, or money market account data, to generate scores on the same 300-850 scale as standard FICO\n®\n Scores. Incorporating consumer-permissioned data helps empower consumers to establish or improve their creditworthiness by using data that reflects sound financial activity, but that is not part of a conventional credit report.\nBoth scores maintain the same score to risk relationship as standard FICO\n®\n Scores, enhancing their compatibility with existing credit underwriting systems and models.\nOutside the U.S., we offer FICO\n®\n Scores for consumer loans, and in some cases for small and medium business loans. These scores are typically sold to end-users through consumer reporting agencies in those countries, as they are in the U.S. FICO Scores have been made available in over 40 countries and we have also developed client-specific versions of the FICO Score in over ten countries.\nWe also provide FICO\n®\n Scores to consumers in the U.S. through our B2C scoring solutions. These Scores are distributed directly by us through our myFICO.com subscription offering and indirectly through our licensed distribution partners, including Experian and certain lenders through the FICO\n®\n Score Open Access Program. Through myFICO.com and other direct-to-consumer channels, consumers can purchase their FICO Scores, including credit reports associated with the scores, explanations of the factors affecting their scores, and customized educational information on how to manage their scores. Consumers can use products to simulate how taking specific actions could affect their FICO Score. Consumers can also subscribe to credit monitoring, which delivers alerts via email and text when changes to a user’s FICO Scores or other credit report content are detected. In addition, consumers can purchase identity theft monitoring products that alert them to potential risks of identity fraud.\nSoftware\nOur software harnesses the power of analytics and digital decisioning technology to help businesses automate, improve, and connect decisions across their enterprise. Most of our solutions address customer engagement, including acquisition and pricing, onboarding, servicing and management, and fraud protection. We also help businesses improve non-customer facing decisions such as supply chain optimization, scheduling management and policy adherence. \nFICO provides software solutions to business customers in more than 80 countries around the world. Our software can be deployed in the cloud utilizing third-party cloud services, or on-premises using our customers’ IT infrastructure. We typically sell our software as multi-year subscriptions, with payments based on usage metrics such as the number of accounts, transactions or decisioning use cases deployed, often subject to contracted minimum payments. \nA significant and growing number of our software solutions run natively on FICO\n®\n Platform, a modular software offering designed to support advanced analytics and decisioning use cases. While not all our software runs on FICO Platform today, we are continuing to invest significant development resources to enable substantially all of our software to run on FICO Platform in the future.\n4\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Areas of Expertise\n \nWe specialize in solutions that empower businesses to operationalize analytics to uncover new opportunities, make timely decisions that matter, and execute them at scale. With more than 65 years of analytics and software experience, we have found that bringing human and digital intelligence together allows our customers to target and acquire customers more efficiently, increase customer value, reduce fraud and credit losses, lower operating expenses, and enter new markets more profitably.\nOur principal areas of research and development expertise are focused on the following four analytic domains.\n•\nPredictive Modeling\nPredictive modeling identifies and mathematically represents underlying relationships in historical data to make predictions or classifications about future events. Predictive models typically analyze current and historical data about individuals to produce easily understood metrics such as scores. These scores rank-order individuals or specific transactions against a particular variable such as the likelihood of making credit payments on time, the likelihood of a transaction being fraudulent or the probability of responding to a particular offer for services. Our predictive models are frequently used in mission-critical transactional systems and drive decisions and actions in near real time.\nSeveral analytic methodologies underlie our products in this area. These include proprietary applications of both linear and nonlinear optimization algorithms, advanced neural systems, machine learning and artificial intelligence (“AI”). We also apply various statistical techniques for analysis and pattern detection within large datasets and can derive insights and predictive features from various forms of data, including unstructured data.\n•\nDecision Analysis and Optimization\nDecision analysis refers to the broad quantitative field that deals with modeling, analyzing, and optimizing decisions made by individuals, groups, and organizations. Whereas predictive models analyze multiple aspects of individual behavior to forecast future behavior, decision analysis analyzes multiple aspects of a given decision to identify the most effective action to take to reach a desired result. This is often referred to as prescriptive analytics. Our integrated approach to decision analysis incorporates a decision model that mathematically maps the entire decision structure; proprietary optimization technology that identifies the most effective strategies, given both the performance objective and constraints; testing and simulation required for active, continuous learning; and the robust extrapolation of an optimized strategy to a wider set of scenarios than historically encountered. Our optimization capabilities also include native support for Python modeling, as well as our own proprietary mathematical modeling and programming language, an easy-to-use authoring environment, a configurable business simulation and scenario management interface and a set of pre-built optimization algorithms.\n•\nTransaction Profiling\nTransaction profiling is a patent-protected technique used to extract meaningful information and reduce the complexity of transaction data used in modeling. Many of our products operate using transactional data, such as credit card purchase transactions, consumer interactions, or other types of data that change over time. In its raw form, this data is very difficult to use in predictive models for several reasons. First, an isolated transaction contains very little information about the behavior of the individual who generated the transaction. Second, transaction patterns change rapidly over time. Third, this type of data can often be highly complex. To overcome these issues, we have developed a set of techniques that transform raw transactional data into a mathematical representation that reveals latent information, and which make the data more usable by predictive models. This profiling technology accumulates data across multiple transactions of many types to create and update profiles of transaction patterns. These profiles enable our neural network models to efficiently and effectively make accurate assessments of, for example, fraud risk and credit risk within real-time transaction streams.\n•\nCustomer Data Integration\nDecisions made about customers or prospects can benefit from data stored in multiple sources, both inside and outside the enterprise. In the areas of analytics and digital decisioning, more data is generally better. We have developed proprietary data ingestion and management tools that are able to assemble and integrate disparate data sources into a unified view of the customer, household, or other subject through the application of persistent keying technology. This data can include structured or unstructured data. In addition, our technology can integrate multiple data sources in real-time and make them available for rapid analysis and decisions such as credit approval, fraud detection and “next best offer” workflows.\n5\nTable of Contents\nWe believe our analytic tools and solutions are among the best commercially available, and that we are uniquely positioned to integrate advanced analytic, software and data technologies into mission-critical business solutions that offer superior returns on investment.\nFICO\n®\n Platform\nFICO\n® \nPlatform is an analytic and decisioning environment that empowers businesses to configure solutions that orchestrate and operationalize high velocity decisions that matter, at scale. Users of FICO Platform can bring together data from multiple sources, apply advanced analytics to derive insights, and translate those insights into actions and workflows that can be executed in real-time. Based on a modular cloud architecture, FICO Platform can be configured by our customers to solve a vast array of business challenges. FICO Platform delivers increasing value to our customers over time as they add additional analytic capabilities, configure their own solutions or utilize pre-configured solutions to address a diverse set of use cases and integrate disparate analytic and decisioning silos onto a centralized, scalable platform. This drives additional subscription software revenue for FICO over time as customers purchase more FICO Platform capabilities and pay for more usage of those capabilities.\nOur goal is to move substantially all of FICO’s current software products onto FICO\n®\n Platform. Many capabilities of FICO’s current software products are now part of FICO Platform, addressing use cases such as origination, fraud detection, customer management, and next best action, among others. We believe this strategy of moving our software products to FICO Platform will result in revenue growth through follow-on “land and expand” sales to existing FICO Platform customers and more sales to medium-sized businesses typically served through value-added resellers and systems integrators. \nOur annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) from FICO\n®\n Platform based products was $263.6 million as of September 30, 2025, representing 35% of our total software ARR. For information about ARR, refer to Part II, Item 7, \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Annual Recurring Revenue\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  \nOur Offerings\nWe sell our software primarily as analytic and decisioning software or pre-configured solutions. Our software offerings are sold both individually and as integrated bundles of multiple products.\nAnalytic and Decisioning Software\nFICO analytic and decisioning software offerings use proprietary and open source microservices and capabilities to enable both business users and data scientists to develop and execute advanced analytics and decision modeling.

End users of our products include three-quarters of each of the largest 100 financial institutions in the U.S. and the largest 100 banks in the world. Our clients also include more than 600 insurers, including eight of the top ten U.S. property and casualty insurers; more than 300 retailers and general merchandisers; and more than 200 government or public agencies. Seven of the top ten companies on the 2025 Fortune 500 list use one or more of our solutions. In addition, our consumer solutions are marketed to more than 200 million U.S. consumers whose credit relationships are reported to the three major U.S. consumer reporting agencies.\nThe majority of our scores are marketed and sold through consumer reporting agencies. During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, revenues generated from our agreements with Experian, TransUnion and Equifax collectively accounted for 51%, 45% and 41% of our total revenues, respectively. We also sell our scores and credit monitoring directly to consumers through our myFICO.com on-line subscription offerings. Outside of the U.S., we sell our scores through consumer reporting agencies, other third-party distributors, and in some cases directly to large end-users.\nWe market our software products and services primarily through our own direct sales organization that is organized around vertical and geographic markets. Sales teams are based in our headquarters and in field offices strategically located around the world. We also market our products through indirect channels, including alliance partners and other resellers. As more capabilities are made available on FICO\n®\n Platform, we expect our sales through indirect channels to grow. We are investing significant resources to develop our indirect channel relationships. \nOur largest market segment is financial services, representing 92% of our total revenue during fiscal 2025. Our largest geographic market is the Americas, representing 87% of our total revenue during fiscal 2025. \nCOMPETITION\nThe market for our solutions is intensely competitive and is constantly changing. Our competitors vary both in size and in the scope of the products and services they offer. We encounter competition from several sources, including: \n•\nin-house analytic and systems developers; \n•\ndevelopers and providers of neural networks, machine learning, and AI systems;\n•\nfraud solutions providers;\n•\nscoring model builders; \n•\nproviders of credit reports and credit scores, including consumer reporting agencies;\n•\nsoftware companies supplying predictive analytic modeling, rules, or analytic development tools; \n•\nentity resolution and social network analysis solutions providers; \n•\nproviders of customer engagement and risk management solutions; \n•\nproviders of account workflow management software;\n•\nbusiness process management and decision rules management providers; \n•\nenterprise resource planning and customer relationship management solutions providers;\n•\nbusiness intelligence solutions providers;\n•\nproviders of automated application processing services; and\n•\nthird-party professional services and consulting organizations.\nWe believe we offer customers a unique mix of products, expertise and capabilities that allows us to compete effectively in our target markets. However, many of our competitors are larger than FICO, have more development, sales and marketing resources than FICO, and some have larger shares of our target geographic or product markets.\n \nWe believe the principal competitive factors affecting our markets include technical performance; access to unique proprietary analytical models and data; product attributes like adaptability, scalability, interoperability, functionality, and ease-of-use; on-premises and SaaS product availability; product price; customer service and support; the effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts; existing market penetration; and reputation. Although we believe our products and services compete favorably with respect to these factors, we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and future competitors.\n8\nTable of Contents\nScores \nIn our Scores segment, we compete with both outside suppliers and in-house analytics. Primary competitors among outside suppliers of scoring models are the three major consumer reporting agencies in the U.S. and Canada, which are also our partners in offering our scoring solutions, and VantageScore (a joint venture entity established by the three major U.S. consumer reporting agencies), which is selling a credit scoring product competitive with our products. Additional competitors include consumer reporting agencies outside the U.S. like CRIF Ratings, which operates in the European Union, and other data providers like LexisNexis and ChoicePoint, some of which also are our partners.\nFor our offerings that deliver credit scores, credit reports and consumer credit education solutions directly to consumers, we compete with other direct to consumer credit and identity services such as Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, Experian and TransUnion, some of which are also our partners. \nSoftware\nThe competition in our Software segment varies by application. In the fraud solutions market for banking, we compete primarily with Nice Actimize, Experian, Pegasystems, BAE Systems Applied Intelligence, SAS, ACI Worldwide, IBM, Feedzai and Featurespace. In the customer origination market, we compete with Experian, Equifax, Moody’s, Meridian Link, and CGI, among others. In the customer management market, we compete with Experian and SAS, among others. In the marketing services market, we compete with Pegasystems, Equifax, Experian, SAS, Adobe and Salesforce, among others. In the decision platform market, we compete with Pegasystems, IBM and SAS, among others.\nPRODUCT PROTECTION AND TRADEMARKS\nWe rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements and procedures to protect our proprietary rights.\nWe retain the title to and protect the suite of models and software used to develop scoring models as a trade secret. We also restrict access to our source code and limit access to and distribution of our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. We have generally relied upon the laws protecting trade secrets and upon contractual nondisclosure safeguards and restrictions on transferability to protect our software and proprietary interests in our product and service methodology and know-how. Our confidentiality procedures include invention assignment and proprietary information agreements with our employees and independent contractors, and nondisclosure agreements with our distributors, strategic partners, and customers. We also claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation.\nWe have patents on many of our technologies and have patent applications pending on other technologies. The patents we hold may not be upheld as valid and may not prevent the development of competitive products. In addition, patents may never be issued on our pending patent applications or on any future applications that we may submit.  As of September 30, 2025, we held 204 U.S. and 26 foreign patents, with 79 applications pending.\nDespite our precautions, it may be possible for competitors or users to copy or reproduce aspects of our software or to obtain information that we regard as trade secrets. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. Patents and other protections for our intellectual property are important, but we believe our success and growth will depend principally on such factors as the knowledge, ability, experience and creative skills of our personnel, new products, frequent product enhancements and name recognition. \nWe have developed technologies for research projects conducted under agreements with various U.S. government agencies or their subcontractors. Although we have acquired commercial rights to these technologies, the U.S. government typically retains ownership of intellectual property rights and licenses in the technologies that we develop under these contracts. In some cases, the U.S. government can terminate our rights to these technologies if we fail to commercialize them on a timely basis. In addition, under U.S. government contracts, the government may make the results of our research public, which could limit our competitive advantage with respect to future products based on funded research. \nWe have used, registered and/or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks for our technologies, products and services. As of September 30, 2025, we had 23 trademarks registered in the U.S. and select foreign countries.\n9\nTable of Contents\nGOVERNMENTAL REGULATION\nWe are subject to a number of U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that involve matters central to our business. Laws and governmental regulation affect how our business is conducted and, in some cases, subject us to the possibility of government supervision or enforcement and future lawsuits arising from our products and services. Laws and governmental regulations also influence our current and prospective customers’ activities, as well as their expectations and needs in relation to our products and services. Laws and regulations that may affect our business and our current and prospective customers’ activities include, but are not limited to, those summarized below.\nMany U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have passed, or are currently contemplating, a variety of consumer protection, data privacy, and cyber and data security laws and regulations that may relate to our business or the business of our customers or affect the demand for our products and services. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and the European Union (“E.U.”) imposes, among other things, strict obligations and restrictions on the collection and use of U.K. and E.U. personal data, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches in certain circumstances, a requirement for implementation of certain approved safeguards (such as the use of approved “standard contractual clauses” and the performance of appropriate data transfer impact assessments) for transfers of personal data to other countries that have not been determined by the E.U. or the U.K. to provide adequate data privacy protections, and possible substantial fines for any violations. Our implementation of processes to meet such requirements for affected data flows, which may involve interpretive issues, and may have an adverse impact on cross-border transfers of personal data, may subject us or our customers to additional scrutiny from E.U. and U.K. regulators or may increase our costs of compliance associated with maintaining appropriate certifications, performing any necessary assessments, engaging in contract negotiations with third parties and implementing approved standard contractual clauses, and/or (if appropriate) localizing certain data processing activities. Numerous other countries have introduced and, in some cases, enacted, similar data privacy and cyber and data security laws.\nThe California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) gives California residents certain privacy rights in the collection and disclosure of their personal information and requires businesses to make certain disclosures and take certain other acts in furtherance of those rights. Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) revised and significantly expanded the scope of the CCPA. The CPRA also created a new agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency, authorized to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA. Numerous other U.S. states have passed similar privacy laws, and other states are considering such legislation.\nThe Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (\"GLBA\") regulates, among other things, the receipt, use, disclosure, and security of non-public personal information of consumers held by “financial institutions” and applies indirectly to companies that provide services to financial institutions. As a provider of services to financial institutions, portions of our business are subject to obligations to comply with certain GLBA provisions, including limitations on the use or disclosure of the underlying data and rules relating to the technological, physical and administrative safeguarding of non-public personal information.\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“HIPAA”) and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates.” We function as a business associate for certain of our customers that are HIPAA-covered entities and service providers and, in that context, we are regulated as a business associate for the purposes of HIPAA.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (“UDAAP”) with respect to the offering of consumer financial products and services and provides the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) with authority to enforce those provisions as well as certain enumerated federal consumer financial laws. In certain circumstances, the CFPB also has examination and supervision powers with respect to service providers who provide a material service to a covered financial institution offering consumer financial products and services. Further, the CFPB has authority to issue rules designating non-depository “larger participants” in certain markets for consumer financial services and products for purposes of the CFPB’s supervisory authority under the Dodd-Frank Act, which the CFPB has done for several markets including the consumer reporting market. Such designated “larger participants” are subject to reporting and on-site compliance examinations by the CFPB, which may result in increased compliance costs and potentially greater enforcement risks based on these supervisory activities. In addition, the laws and regulations issued by U.S. and foreign regulators of some of our largest financial institution customers may require them to flow down certain contractual obligations, exercise greater oversight, and perform more rigorous audits of their key service providers such as us.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”) prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Under the FTC Act, the FTC’s jurisdiction includes the ability to bring enforcement actions based on the security measures we employ to safeguard the personal data of consumers. Allegations that we failed to safeguard or handle such data in a reasonable manner may subject us to regulatory scrutiny or enforcement action.\nThe U.S. Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”) applies to consumer reporting agencies, as well as data furnishers, and users of consumer reports such as banks and other companies, many of which are our customers. The FCRA provisions govern the accuracy, fairness and privacy of information in the files of consumer reporting agencies that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes. The FCRA limits the type of information that may be reported by consumer reporting agencies, limits the distribution and use of consumer reports, establishes consumer rights to access and dispute their own credit files, includes provisions designed to prevent identity theft and assist fraud victims, requires consumer reporting agencies to make a free annual credit report available to consumers and imposes many other requirements on consumer reporting agencies, data furnishers and users of consumer report information. These requirements can affect the manner and extent to which our customers use our products and services.\nA number of states have enacted requirements similar to the FCRA. Some of these state laws impose additional, or more stringent, requirements than the FCRA, especially in connection with investigations and responses to reported inaccuracies in consumer reports. The FCRA preempts some of these state laws, but the scope of preemption continues to be defined by the courts. Various consumer credit laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we conduct business also affect the products and services we offer to our customers.\nThe Credit Repair Organizations Act (the “CROA”) regulates companies that claim to be able to assist consumers in improving their credit standing. There have been efforts to apply the CROA to credit monitoring services offered by consumer reporting agencies and others, which may impact certain of our products and services.\nSpecial requirements may apply to us when providing services directly or indirectly to U.S. federal, state and local government agencies. The applicable requirements depend upon the monetary value of the awarded contract, the particular government agency awarding or funding the contract, the scope of services to be delivered, and the level of access that the agency will need to provide to us to enable us to perform the contract. For example, we may need to abide by the Privacy Act of 1974, the Internal Revenue Service’s Publication 4812, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation and associated supplemental contract clauses. Each of these laws, regulations and contract clauses imposes certain requirements, including measures for the protection of personal information or information that is otherwise categorized as sensitive by the government. Government agencies frequently modify or supplement these requirements, and consequences for violations of applicable requirements may include penalties, civil liability and for severe infractions, criminal liability.\nThere has been an increased focus on laws and regulations related to our business and the business of our customers relating to policy concerns regarding the operation of consumer reporting agencies, the use and accuracy of credit and alternative data, the costs of consumer reports and credit scores, the use of credit scores and fair lending, and the use, transparency, and fairness of algorithms, AI, and machine learning in business processes.\nThe European Commission has finalized the EU AI Act, which establishes requirements for the provision and use of products that leverage AI systems, including in credit scoring. The EU AI Act entered into force on August 1, 2024 and its provisions take effect between six and 36 months after that date, with most of those provisions becoming effective in 2026. Other countries, as well as the executive branch of the U.S. government and a number of U.S. states, are considering or have implemented laws, regulations, or standards applicable to AI technologies.\nAdditional laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad that may affect our business and our current and prospective customers’ activities include, but are not limited to, those in the following significant regulatory areas:\n•\nLaws and regulations that limit the use of credit scoring models (e.g., state “mortgage trigger” or “inquiries” laws, state insurance restrictions on the use of credit-based insurance scores, and the E.U. Consumer Credit Directive).\n•\nFair lending laws (e.g., the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, and the Fair Housing Act) and laws and regulations that may impose requirements relating to algorithmic fairness or accountability.\n•\nLaws and regulations related to data and cybersecurity, such as the Cybersecurity Act of 2015; the U.S. Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Cybersecurity Framework; the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act; cyber incident notice requirements for banks and their service providers under rules and regulations issued by federal banking regulators; cybersecurity incident disclosure requirements for public companies under regulations issued by the SEC; and identity theft, file freezing, and similar state privacy laws.\n•\nLaws and regulations related to extension of credit to consumers through the Electronic Fund Transfers Act and Regulation E, as well as non‑governmental VISA and MasterCard electronic payment standards.\n11\nTable of Contents\n•\nLaws and regulations applicable to secondary market participants (e.g., The Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”)) that could have an impact on our scoring products and revenues, including 12 CFR Part 1254 (Validation and Approval of Credit Score Models) issued by the Federal Housing Finance Agency in accordance with Section 310 of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 115-174), and any regulations, standards or criteria established pursuant to such laws or regulations, including the ongoing validation and approval of the use of the FICO\n®\n Score by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Housing Finance Agency.\n•\nLaws and regulations applicable to our customer communication clients and their use of our products and services (e.g., the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the CAN-SPAM Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and regulations promulgated thereunder, and similar state laws and similar laws in other countries).\n•\nLaws and regulations applicable to our insurance clients and their use of our insurance products and services.\n•\nThe application or extension of consumer protection laws, including implementing regulations (e.g., the Consumer Financial Protection Act, the Truth In Lending Act and Regulation Z, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and Regulation F, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, and the Military Lending Act, and similar state consumer protection laws).\n•\nLaws and regulations governing the use of the Internet and social media, telemarketing, advertising, endorsements and testimonials.\n•\nAnti-money laundering laws and regulations (e.g., the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act).\n•\nLaws and regulations restricting transactions with sanctioned parties and regarding export controls as they apply to FICO products delivered in non-U.S. countries or to foreign nationals (e.g., Office of Foreign Asset Control sanctions and Export Administration Regulations).\n•\nFinancial regulatory standards (e.g., Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements to maintain and verify internal process controls, including controls for material event awareness and notification).\n•\nLaws and regulations that apply to outsourcing of services by our clients, and that set forth requirements for managing third parties (e.g., vendors, contractors, suppliers and distributors).\n•\nLaws and regulations relating to the environmental, social and governance, or sustainability, practices of companies, including enhanced climate-related disclosure requirements from regulators, such as California’s climate disclosure rules and the E.U.’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.\nWe are also subject to federal and state laws that are generally applicable to any U.S. business with national or international operations, such as antitrust and unfair competition laws, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, state unfair or deceptive practices acts and various employment laws.\nHUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur People\nAs of September 30, 2025, we employed 3,811 persons across 28 countries. Of these, our largest representation included 1,335 (35%) based in the U.S., 1,506 (40%) based in India and 271 (7%) based in the U.K. Other than to the extent mandated by applicable law in certain foreign jurisdictions, none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and no work stoppages were experienced during fiscal 2025.\nOur Board of Directors (our “Board”) and executive leadership team believe that our people are vital to our success. The Leadership Development and Compensation Committee (the “LDCC”) of our Board oversees all human capital management policies, programs, and strategies, including but not limited to those regarding talent recruitment, development, retention, succession planning, health and safety, organizational culture, employee engagement, diversity, and compensation and benefit programs.\n \nThe LDCC also periodically reviews and reports to the Board with respect to succession planning for our Chief Executive Officer and other senior management positions. In addition, our Chief Human Resources Officer reports to our Board periodically on people-focused programs.\n12\nTable of Contents\nEmployee Engagement\nFor the past decade, we have conducted quarterly workforce surveys to measure employee engagement and gain feedback and insights from our people about ways to improve the employee experience and the effectiveness of our business operations. Detailed findings from these surveys are promptly communicated to all employees, individual managers, the executive team and our Board and the findings are leveraged to drive positive organizational change. We involve designated human resources business partners and learning consultants who work with senior leaders to explore findings, identify high value actions and amplify messaging to help our people understand how survey participation can connect to positive change. \nExamples of organizational changes that have been driven by the insights from these surveys include investments in expanded workforce capacity, broadened and more frequent company-wide communications, increased employee stock ownership by significantly expanding the recipients of equity-based awards and encouraging all employees to take advantage of our Employee Stock Purchase Plan, expanded benefit programs including paid parental leave, well-being, family building, childcare reimbursement and company-funded transportation programs, enhanced incentive plan funding, and expanded investments in professional development targeting leadership and technical skills, as well as initiatives to promote a culture where all employees feel welcome at work.\nOur engagement scores have steadily strengthened and we have enjoyed strong workforce retention over the past year. Each of 22 engagement driver scores from our most recent surveys are at or above our external benchmark scores. \nOrganizational Culture\nFICO is committed to building and reinforcing a culture where all employees feel welcome and where individual perspectives are valued. FICO believes that a highly talented workforce that includes people with a wide range of backgrounds, experiences and perspectives drives innovation while helping us relate to our global customer base. Our goal is to achieve this innovation and connection to our customer base through a culture that attracts the broadest talent audience possible, while always striving to select the most qualified individuals. We also believe that promoting a culture where each individual is truly valued allows our people to reach their full potential. \nOur FICO Cares organization encourages our people to connect with and contribute to their community. We encourage employees to participate in volunteer activities by providing work schedule flexibility and paid Community Volunteer Leave. We also encourage and match employee cash donations and volunteer time to qualified charitable organizations through our Corporate Matching Gift Program.\nAcross our global workforce, as of September 30, 2025, the percentage of males and females was 67% and 33%, respectively. Looking at our U.S. workforce, as of September 30, 2025, 46% were racially/ethnically diverse employees who are members of a protected class.\nAdditional information on our talent programs is available on the Corporate Responsibility page of our website at \nwww.fico.com/en/corporate-responsibility\n. Information contained on our website is not deemed part of or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTalent Recruitment\nWe leverage organizational culture as a competitive advantage in our efforts to attract people from the broadest possible talent pool. We deploy selection practices designed to ensure strong alignment between candidate qualifications and knowledge and skills needed for success in each role, and we invest in hiring manager training focused on effective selection strategies. Further, in the U.S., we detail our targeted base pay ranges on all public job postings and prohibit our recruiters from inquiring about a candidate’s current level of compensation. Our focus on the professional development of our people drives the internal posting of virtually all job opportunities. And, consistent with our remarkably low undesired attrition rate, FICO has significantly strengthened its position as an employer of choice, resulting in attractive external candidate pools.\nProfessional Development\nTo support professional development, we offer a structured onboarding program with training specific to a variety of identified career paths to help new employees become rapidly engaged and productive. We have invested in building the FICO Integrated Learning Organization (“ILO”), which is led by our Chief Learning Officer. The ILO develops customized learning content for colleagues, clients and partners around the world. We deliver high quality, targeted new hire onboarding, technology and product skill training, compliance and management and leadership education through this “FICO Learning” platform. This allows our employees to obtain the knowledge and skills to effectively perform in their current roles, while also preparing them for new opportunities. We also offer financial support for degreed or certificated programs through a tuition reimbursement program.\n13\nTable of Contents\nWe have defined specific career paths for all major functions in our organization so that our people understand how they can progress in their career by expanding their knowledge and skills. In doing so, our job titling system reflects both individual contributor (or technical) career tracks and people management career tracks to reinforce our philosophy that people can grow professionally in either track.  \nTo further consistent administration, we conduct annual company-wide performance reviews supported by the use of performance rubrics for each major function. These rubrics set forth clear behavioral expectations for each function through a set of objective descriptors organized across our three levels of performance (Improvement Needed, Achieved Expectations, and Outstanding). In addition to rubrics, outcome-based goals are established for each individual based upon his/her specific role and priorities. Evaluation across both behavioral and outcome-based dimensions yields an overall performance assessment.\nWe define a “promotion” as an increase in pay band linked to the proven ability to be successful in the next level of responsibility. Our structured promotion process takes place twice annually with promotions to all job levels including senior job levels occurring with our year-end cycle (October/November) and promotions to lower and middle job levels taking place with our mid-year cycle (April/May). This process supports an integrated approach yielding improved consistency in promotion decisions, including that all groups are representatively recognized. Approximately 25% of our people are recognized via promotion each year.\nSuccession Planning\nOur Board spends considerable time each year reviewing CEO and key leadership succession and development plans. These discussions include an annual dedicated review of CEO succession, as well as discussions at multiple meetings, including in executive session as needed, regarding broader key leader succession, organizational health and scenario planning in the event of unexpected leadership changes. The Board also has regular and direct exposure to senior leadership and high potential officers through formal and informal avenues throughout the year. Beyond the C-suite, we actively assess talent across the organization to optimize deployment of resources, encourage professional development, drive accountability, and identify and take actions to mitigate undesired attrition risk. At the mid-point of each fiscal year, talent assessments are performed by people managers for each team member. These assessments include a mid-year performance rating and a leadership strength rating, the combination of which yields a Talent Management Score ranging from one to nine with recommended follow-up actions associated with each score. In addition, managers identify any significant attrition risks and underlying drivers and develop related mitigation plans. Finally, for each senior leader role, managers identify potential successor candidates along with targeted development needs to encourage readiness.\nFor vice president-level roles, the executive team plays a central role through a process we refer to as “Session C.” This process involves a detailed evaluation of each vice president incumbent using several tools including a personal biography written by the incumbent identifying key accomplishments, career growth aspirations, and champions that can articulate their contributions. In addition, managers complete a Leader Profile for each vice president incumbent highlighting key strengths, development progress over the past year, go-forward development plans, attrition risks and drivers, and succession insights. All of these materials are centrally reviewed and discussed by the executive team during a multi-day meeting. After discussing incumbent vice presidents, the executive team evaluates any proposed candidates for promotion to vice president using a combination of promotion recommendation forms prepared by the sponsoring manager, a 360-degree performance evaluation involving self-evaluation, manager evaluation, direct report evaluation, and insights gathered from key stakeholders.  Candidates for vice president-level promotion are placed “on-deck” for a one- to three-year period for observation prior to any promotion decision being finalized. This approach drives high quality, consistent decisions while ensuring our highest potential candidates are properly developed and ready when promoted.\nCompensation and Benefit Programs\nWe regularly participate in market-based compensation surveys, seek the advice of outside experts, and leverage new hire, peer equity, and unplanned attrition trend data to ensure that our base pay and incentive structures are competitive. We create a strong sense of shared purpose by having our CEO and each member of our executive leadership team participate in the same annual cash incentive bonus design as all non-sales employees across our organization.\nBeyond our structured promotion cycles, all compensation actions are determined in November following the conclusion of the year-end performance review process in October. This includes promotion and market-based base pay adjustments, annual bonus awards, and long-term incentive awards. This rewards-planning cycle ensures strong linkage between performance and rewards, and it allows for centralized review and refinement of reward recommendations leading to high quality and representative decisions.\n14\nTable of Contents\nOver the course of the past decade, we’ve steadily and significantly expanded participation in our annual performance-based equity program from 7% to just over 33% of our workforce. In addition, we offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan for eligible employees, which is designed to promote even broader equity participation.\nWe offer competitive health and welfare benefit plans with significant company subsidies to offset premiums, retirement plans with a competitive company match to encourage participation and flexible paid-time-off programs including vacation, sick time and disability time. We have paid Maternity and Parental Leave benefits totaling up to 12 weeks, and we have adopted a Well-Being Program designed to provide broad-based physical and mental health education and personal health coaching, as well as quarterly cash Wellness Awards designed to help employees fund wellness-related purchases which they find most valuable. In addition, we have a global Family Building Benefit program, which provides infertility, cryopreservation, surrogacy and adoption support services. In India, we have a Childcare Reimbursement program to assist parents of young children.\nPromoting a Healthy and Safe Work Environment\nWe are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace. We continuously strive to meet or exceed compliance with all laws, regulations and accepted practices pertaining to workplace safety. All employees and contractors are required to comply with established safety policies, standards, and procedures.\nWe foster a healthy work/life balance for our people including both remote and hybrid work location policies that provide significant flexibility surrounding work location and work schedules.\n15\nTable of Contents\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nOur executive officers as of September 30, 2025 were as follows:\nName\nPositions Held\nAge\nWilliam J.

    "item1a": "Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\n \nManagement Oversight and Governance\nThe Company’s \nChief Information Security Officer\n (“CISO”), who reports to the President, Software, is responsible for the design and implementation of our security program and strategy based on the mandate provided by the Board and senior management.\n \nThe CISO has extensive experience in the management of cybersecurity risk management programs, having served in various leadership roles in information technology and information security for over 20 years, including serving as the Chief Security Officer of two other large public technology companies.\n We believe the Company’s business leaders have the appropriate expertise, background and depth of experience to manage risks arising from cybersecurity threats.\n31\nTable of Contents\nThe CISO, in coordination with other members of senior management, works collaboratively across the Company to implement a program designed to protect the Company’s information systems from cybersecurity threats and to promptly respond to cybersecurity incidents in accordance with the Company’s incident response and recovery plans. To facilitate the success of the Company’s cybersecurity program, cross-functional teams throughout the Company are tasked with addressing cybersecurity threats and responding to cybersecurity incidents. Through ongoing communications with these teams, the CISO and senior management are informed promptly about, and monitor the prevention, detection, investigation, mitigation and remediation of, cybersecurity threats. These teams are expected to operate pursuant to documented plans and playbooks that include processes for escalation of incidents to leadership and to the Audit Committee and the Board, as appropriate, based on the severity level of an incident. In addition, the Company periodically consults with outside advisors and experts to assist with assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity risks, including to anticipate future threats and trends, and their impact on the Company’s risk management environment.\nSpecifically, management implements the Company’s cybersecurity and risk management strategy across several areas: \n•\nIdentification and Reporting\n. The Company has implemented a robust, cross-functional approach to identifying, assessing and managing cybersecurity threats and risks. The Company’s program includes controls and procedures designed to properly identify, classify, and escalate cybersecurity risks to provide management with visibility and prioritization of risk mitigation efforts and to publicly report material cybersecurity incidents if and when appropriate.\n•\nThreat Intelligence\n. The Company maintains a Threat Intelligence team focused on profiling, intelligence collection, and threat analysis supporting the Company’s ongoing efforts to identify, assess and manage cybersecurity threats. The team’s input supports both near-term response to cybersecurity events, and long-term strategic planning and development of the Company’s cybersecurity risk management framework.\n•\nTechnical Safeguards\n. The Company implements technical safeguards that are designed to protect both the Company’s service offerings and other information systems it controls from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention and detection systems, anti-malware functionality, vulnerability management, encryption processes and access controls, all of which are periodically evaluated and improved through risk and control assessments and in response to cybersecurity threat intelligence as well as outside audits and certifications.\n•\nIncident Response and Recovery Planning\n. The Company has established and maintains robust incident response, business continuity and disaster recovery plans designed to address the Company’s response to a cybersecurity incident, including any required public disclosure and reporting of material incidents in a timely manner. These plans and procedures serve to guide and document a rigorous incident response program that reflects the roles of an array of stakeholders, including personnel providing technical, operational, engineering, legal and other perspectives across the Company. The Company conducts regular tabletop exercises involving multiple operational teams, including senior management, to test these plans and to familiarize personnel with their roles in a response scenario.\n•\nThird-Party Risk Management\n. The Company maintains a robust, risk-based approach to identifying and overseeing cybersecurity threats presented by certain third parties, including vendors, service providers and other external users of the Company’s systems, as well as the systems of third parties that could adversely impact our business in the event of a significant cybersecurity incident affecting those third-party systems.\n•\nEducation and Awareness\n. The Company regularly provides employee training on security-related duties and responsibilities, including knowledge about how to recognize security incidents and how to proceed if an actual or suspected incident should occur. This training is mandatory for employees across the Company, and is intended to provide the Company’s employees with effective tools to address cybersecurity threats, and to communicate the Company’s evolving information security policies, standards, processes and practices.\nBoard Oversight and Governance\nOur management is responsible for identifying the various risks facing the Company, formulating risk management policies and procedures, and managing the Company’s risk exposures. Our Board responsibility is to monitor the Company’s risk management processes by informing itself concerning our material risks and evaluating whether management has reasonable controls in place to address the material risks. The Audit Committee of the Board is responsible for discussing with management the Company’s major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including the Company’s risk assessment and risk management policies. \nAccordingly, our internal risk management team regularly reports to the Audit Committee on our major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, including our risk assessment and risk management policies. The Audit Committee, in turn, reports on the matters discussed at the committee level to the full \nBoard\n.\n \n32\nTable of Contents\nAs part of its oversight of the Company’s risk management noted above, the Audit Committee oversees, reviews and discusses with management the Company’s risks from cybersecurity threats and management’s role in assessing and managing such risks. The Audit Committee receives regular presentations, reports and updates from the CISO and other members of management on developments regarding the Company’s cybersecurity program, broader cybersecurity trends, evolving industry standards, the threat environment and other topics.\nThe Company’s processes also allow for the Board and the Audit Committee to be informed of key cybersecurity risks outside the regular reporting schedule. While regular meetings of the Audit Committee are scheduled on a quarterly cadence, the Audit Committee is authorized to meet with management at any time it deems appropriate to discuss matters relevant to the Audit Committee. The Company’s policy is for the Board and the Audit Committee to receive prompt and timely information regarding any cybersecurity risk (including any incident) that meets pre-established reporting thresholds, as well as ongoing updates regarding any such risk.",
    "item1b": "Item 1B.\n \nUnresolved Staff Comments\nNot applicable.",
    "item1c": "Item 1C. \nCybersecurity\nCybersecurity Risk Management and Strategy\nWe recognize the importance of assessing, identifying, and managing material risks associated with cybersecurity threats, as such term is defined in Item 106(a) of Regulation S-K. These risks include, among other things: operational risks, intellectual property theft, fraud, extortion, harm to employees or customers and violation of data privacy or security laws.\nIdentifying and assessing cybersecurity risk is integrated into our overall risk management systems and processes.\n Cybersecurity risks related to our business, technical operations, privacy and compliance issues are identified and managed through a multi-faceted approach including third-party assessments, internal IT Audit, IT security, governance, risk and compliance reviews. To defend, detect and respond to cybersecurity incidents, we, among other things: conduct proactive privacy and cybersecurity reviews of systems and applications, audit applicable data policies, perform penetration testing using external third-party tools and techniques to test security controls, conduct employee training, monitor emerging laws and regulations related to data protection and information security (including our consumer products) and implement appropriate changes.\nWe employ an experienced team of cybersecurity professionals with a variety of backgrounds. We seek to address material cybersecurity risks through a company-wide approach that assesses, ranks and prioritizes cybersecurity threats, vulnerabilities and issues as they are identified to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information systems and the information that we collect and store. The Company’s cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices are informed by recognized frameworks established by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the International Organization for Standardization and an array of other applicable standards-setting bodies, which are integrated into a broader risk management framework and related processes. We also hold various security-related industry certifications and attestations that have been validated by external auditors, including: SOC 1, SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, CSA STAR Level 2, PCI-DSS and others.\nLeveraging threat intelligence and other signals, the Company undergoes periodic testing, audits and reviews of its policies, standards, processes and practices to identify, assess and address cybersecurity risks and events. The Company also undergoes routine internal and external penetration testing. The results of such tests and assessments are evaluated by management and periodically reported to the Audit Committee. \n \nThe Company further adjusts its cybersecurity policies, standards, processes and practices based on these results. The Company also makes available to clients attestations of its various certifications, audits, and penetration tests.\nWe have not identified any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company, including its business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition.\n However, we face ongoing and increasing cybersecurity risks, including from bad actors that are becoming more sophisticated and effective over time, as well as a result of potential defects or disruptions in our or our customers’ services. Additional information on the cybersecurity risks \nthat could materially affect us\n is discussed in Part I,"
