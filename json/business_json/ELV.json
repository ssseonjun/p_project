    "item1": "Item 1 “Business” and Note 20, “Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Trends\nWe continue to participate in the Individual state- or federally-facilitated marketplaces (“the Public Exchange”) in nearly all of our Anthem Blue Cross and Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield service areas. We anticipate growth in our Public Exchange memberships as former Medicaid members, no longer eligible for Medicaid coverage, continue to seek alternative coverage options. Additionally, we are entering select service areas in Florida, Maryland, and Texas in 2025, using our Simply Healthcare and Wellpoint brands, and we are actively evaluating expansion opportunities in additional marketplaces beyond 2025. Changes to our business environment are likely to continue as elected officials at the national and state levels continue to enact significant modifications to existing laws and regulations, including changes to available subsidies, taxes and fees.\nCarelonRx markets and offers pharmacy services to our affiliated health plan customers throughout the country, as well as to customers outside of the health plans we own. Our comprehensive pharmacy services portfolio includes all core pharmacy services, such as home delivery and specialty pharmacies, claims adjudication, formulary management, pharmacy networks, rebate administration, a prescription drug database and member services, as well as infusion services and injectable therapies. \nCarelonRx delegates certain core pharmacy services to CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C., which is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation (“CVS”), pursuant to an agreement (the “CVS Agreement”) with the current contractual term extending through December 31, 2027. We can elect to have CVS continue to provide services to us for a three-year extension period on the same terms and conditions as in the current CVS Agreement in the event of a termination or non-renewal by either party.\nPricing Trends: \n \nWe strive to price our health benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical cost trends. We frequently make adjustments to respond to legislative and regulatory changes as well as pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and new market entrants. Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. Product pricing remains competitive.\nIf the approvals of any annual premium rate changes by contracted government agencies are delayed, we are required to defer the recognition of any premium rate increases to the period in which the premium rates become final. The impact of this deferral can be significant in the period in which the increased premium rates are first recognized depending on the magnitude of the premium rate increase, the number of members to which it applies and the length of the delay between the \n -45-\neffective date of the rate increase and the final contract date. Premium rate decreases are recognized in the period the change in premium rate becomes effective and the change in the rate is known, which may be prior to the period in which the contract amendment affecting the rate is finalized.\nMedical Cost Trends:\n \nOur medical cost trends are primarily driven by changes in the utilization of services across all provider types and the unit cost of these services. We work to mitigate these trends through various medical management programs such as care and condition management, program integrity and specialty pharmacy management and utilization management, as well as benefit design changes. There are many drivers of medical cost trends that can cause variance from our estimates, such as changes in the level and mix of services utilized, regulatory changes, aging of the population, health status and other demographic characteristics of our members, epidemics, pandemics, advances in medical technology, new high-cost prescription drugs, new indications of existing prescription drugs, provider contracting inflation, labor costs and healthcare provider or member fraud.\nFor additional discussion regarding business trends, see Part I, Item 1 “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023, decoupled Medicaid eligibility redeterminations from the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency initially declared in January 2020. As a result, states were permitted to begin removing ineligible beneficiaries from their Medicaid programs starting April 1, 2023, and the majority of our Medicaid markets began doing so as of June 30, 2023. Although most states have completed this process, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has provided that states have until December 31, 2025 to complete these eligibility redeterminations. Since redeterminations have resumed, we have continued to experience a decline in our Medicaid membership. We expect growth over time in our commercial plans, including through the Public Exchanges in states where we offer commercial plans, as members who have lost Medicaid coverage seek alternative coverage elsewhere. \nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains a variety of provisions that have impacted, and continue to impact our business including by extending the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021's enhanced Premium Tax Credits (“PTC”) through 2025; imposing a new corporate alternative minimum tax; providing a one percent excise tax on repurchases of stock; allowing CMS to negotiate prices on a limited set of prescription drugs in Medicare effective in 2026; instituting caps on insulin cost sharing in Medicare; redesigning the Medicare Part D benefit; requiring drug manufacturers to pay rebates if prices increase beyond inflation; and delaying the implementation of the Trump Administration Medicare drug rebate rule until at least 2032. The extension of the enhanced PTC has allowed for growth in Individual Public Exchange enrollment and has supported continuity of coverage since Medicaid eligibility redeterminations resumed in 2023. If Congress does not act to extend the enhanced PTC, they will expire at the end of 2025, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 (the “2021 Appropriations Act”) has impacted our business, including by imposing additional disclosure and reporting requirements related to broker compensation, mental health parity, pharmacy benefits and drug costs, as well as procedures and coverage requirements related to surprise medical bills, provider directory maintenance and continuity of care for certain patients. The requirements applicable to us under the 2021 Appropriations Act had varying effective dates, beginning in December 2021. \n The health plan price transparency regulations issued by the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor, and Treasury (“the Tri-Agencies”) pursuant to the 2021 Appropriations Act required us to begin disclosing certain pricing information regarding negotiated rates and historical payment information with providers in 2022. Additionally, as directed by law, we make available to members personalized out-of-pocket cost information and underlying negotiated rates.\nIn September 2024, the Tri-Agencies issued final regulations related to mental health parity that will require health plans to make administrative and operational changes to comply with these final regulations. While some provisions became effective on January 1, 2025, additional guidance from the Tri-Agencies will be necessary to assess the full impact of these regulations on our operations and financial results. Litigation has been filed challenging the final regulation and is pending court action.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended (collectively, the “ACA”), continues to impact our business and results of operations, including pricing, minimum \n -46-\nmedical loss ratios, and the geographies in which our products are available. We also expect further and ongoing regulatory guidance on a number of issues related to Medicare, including evolving methodology for ratings and quality bonus payments. CMS also frequently proposes changes to its program that audits data submitted under the risk adjustment programs in ways that could increase financial recoveries from plans.\nFor additional discussion regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see Part I, Item 1 “Business-\nRegulation\n” and Part I,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A “Risk Factors.”\nOther Significant Items\nBusiness and Operational Matters\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, based on a strategic review of our operations, assets and investments, management implemented the “2023-2024 Business Efficiency Program” to refine the focus of our investments, and optimize our physical footprint. The 2023-2024 Business Efficiency Program included the write-off of certain information technology assets and contract exit costs, a reduction in staff including the relocation of certain job functions, and the impairment of assets associated with the closure or partial closure of data centers and offices. The 2023-2024 Business Efficiency Program was finalized as of December 31, 2024. For additional information, see Note 4, “Business Optimization Initiatives,” and Note 18, “Leases,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPursuant to CMS’ Medicare Advantage Star Ratings system, CMS annually awards between 1.0 and 5.0 Stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance in several categories. Plans must have a Star Rating of 4.0 or higher to qualify for bonus payments. Our 2024 Star Ratings, which are used for payment year 2025, reflect that 53% of our Medicare Advantage members were enrolled in plans rated at least 4.0 Stars or higher. This is an increase, based on subsequent recalculations by CMS, over the original 2024 Star Ratings from October 2023, which reflected that 34% of our Medicare Advantage members were enrolled in plans rated at least 4.0 Stars or higher. \nCMS released our 2025 Star Ratings in October 2024, which will be used to determine our Medicare Advantage bonus payments in 2026. Our 2025 Star Ratings reflect that 38% of our Medicare Advantage members were enrolled in plans rated at least 4.0 Stars or higher. We expect this change will result in a reduction to our 2026 operating revenue of approximately $183 million, net of offsets from contracting provisions. Further, we expect to mitigate the financial impact to our 2026 operating gain and net income per share resulting from this change through various strategies such as contract diversification, operating expense efficiencies, capital deployment alternatives and network enhancements.\nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\nInvestments in Joint Ventures and Completed Acquisitions\nOn December 31, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Centers Plan for Healthy Living LLC and Centers for Specialty Care Group IPA, LLC (“Centers”). Centers is a managed long-term care plan that serves New York state Medicaid and dual-eligible Medicaid/Medicare members, enabling adults with long-term care needs and disabilities to live safely and independently in their own home. This acquisition aligns with our strategic plan to grow the Health Benefits segment and leverage industry-leading expertise while serving Medicaid and dual-eligible populations.\nOn December 10, 2024, we completed our acquisition of RSV QOZB LTSS, Inc. and certain affiliated entities (d/b/a CareBridge), a value-based healthcare company that manages home and community-based services for Medicaid and dual-eligible Medicaid/Medicare members receiving long-term services and support. This acquisition aligns with Carelon Services’ care at home strategy, and our vision to be an innovative, valuable, and inclusive healthcare partner by providing care management programs that improve the lives of the people we serve. \n -47-\nOn August 6, 2024, as discussed in Note 5 “Investments,” we made an equity investment of $2,580 that resulted in our minority interest ownership of approximately 35% of Augusta Topco Holdings, L.P. (“Mosaic Health”), a joint venture with Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (“CD&R”) that is designed to accelerate innovation in care delivery across multiple regions in the United States by bringing together certain care delivery and enablement assets of Carelon Management Services, LLC (“CMSI Assets”), a Carelon Health business, and two CD&R portfolio businesses, apree health and Millennium Physician Group. Our additional contribution of the CMSI Assets to Mosaic Health was completed on January 1, 2025, for which we received an additional $300 of equity (approximately 5% ownership) in Mosaic Health. The CMSI Assets are included under the captions “Assets held for sale” and “Liabilities held for sale” in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024.\nOn March 11, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Paragon”). Paragon, which operates as part of CarelonRx, provides infusion services and injectable therapies through its omnichannel model of ambulatory infusion centers, home infusion pharmacies, and other specialty pharmacy services. This acquisition aligns with our vision to be an innovative, valuable and inclusive healthcare partner by providing care management programs that improve the lives of the people we serve.\nOn February 15, 2023, we completed our acquisition of BioPlus Parent, LLC and its subsidiaries (“BioPlus”) from CarepathRx Aggregator, LLC. Prior to the acquisition, BioPlus was one of the largest independent specialty pharmacy organizations in the United States. BioPlus, which operates as part of CarelonRx, seeks to connect payors and providers of specialty pharmaceuticals to meet the medication therapy needs of patients with complex medical conditions. This acquisition aligns with our vision to be an innovative, valuable and inclusive healthcare partner by providing care management programs that improve the lives of the people we serve.\nDivestiture\nOn April 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our life and disability businesses to StanCorp Financial Group, Inc. (“The Standard”), a provider of financial protection products and services for employers and individuals, which resulted in a gain on sale of business of $201 in the year ended December 31, 2024. Upon closing, we and The Standard entered into a product distribution partnership. The related net assets held for sale for the life and disability businesses divested as of December 31, 2023, and the results of operations for such businesses for the year ended December 31, 2024 were not material.\nFor additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLitigation Matters\nWe are a defendant in multiple lawsuits that were initially filed in 2012 against the BCBSA and Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees (the “Blue plans”) across the country. Cases filed in 28 states were consolidated into a single, multi-district proceeding captioned \nIn re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation \n(“BCBSA Litigation”), that is pending before the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (the “Court”). Generally, the lawsuits in the BCBSA Litigation challenge elements of the licensing agreements between the BCBSA and the independently owned and operated Blue plans. The cases were brought by two putative nationwide classes of plaintiffs, health plan subscribers and providers.\nThe BCBSA and Blue plans approved a settlement agreement and release with the subscriber plaintiffs (the “Subscriber Settlement Agreement”), and the ultimate amount paid by the Company under the Subscriber Settlement Agreement was $604, which was primarily accrued in 2020. The Subscriber Settlement Agreement and the defendants’ payment and non-monetary obligations under the Subscriber Settlement Agreement became effective in June 2024 with the request for the second Blue plan bid provision effective in September 2024. The funds held in escrow will be distributed in accordance with the Subscriber Settlement Agreement.\nThe BCBSA and the Blue plans have approved a settlement agreement and release (the “Provider Settlement Agreement”) with the provider plaintiffs, and in October 2024, the provider plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval with the Court. The Court granted preliminary approval of the Provider Settlement Agreement on December 4, 2024. If approved by the Court, the Provider Settlement Agreement will require the defendants to make a monetary settlement payment, our portion of which is estimated to be $666, and will contain certain non-monetary terms including (i) expansion of certain opportunities to contract with providers in contiguous service areas, (ii) certain prompt pay commitments, and (iii) \n -48-\nvarious technological enhancements to the BlueCard program. We recognized our estimated payment obligation under the Provider Settlement Agreement of $666 in September 2024.\nFor additional information regarding the BCBSA Litigation, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies – \nLitigation and Regulatory Proceedings – Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation\n,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSelected Operating Performance\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, total medical membership decreased by 1.1 million, or 2.3%. The decrease in medical membership was driven primarily by attrition in Medicaid membership, including as a result of eligibility redeterminations and certain market exits, and decreases in our Employer Group risk-based and Medicare Supplement businesses. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Employer Group fee-based, Individual and FEP\n®\n businesses.\nOperating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $175,204, an increase of $4,995, or 2.9%, from the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in operating revenue was primarily driven by premium rate increases in all of our lines of business in recognition of medical cost trends, growth in CarelonRx product revenue and recent acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by declines in premiums driven by Medicaid membership attrition. \nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $5,971, a decrease of $20, or 0.3%, from the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in net income was primarily due to a net decrease in our operating gain in our reportable segments and higher income tax expense, partially offset by increased net investment income, gain on the sale of our life and disability businesses and lower amortization of other intangible assets.\nOur fully-diluted shareholders’ EPS for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $25.68, an increase of $0.46, or 1.8%, from the year ended December 31, 2023. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2024 were 232.9, a decrease of 4.5, or 1.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. The increase in EPS resulted from fewer diluted shares outstanding. \nOperating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2024, was $5,808, or approximately 1.0 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2023 was $8,061, or approximately 1.3 times net income. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to the impact of the membership decline in our Medicaid business and working capital changes. \nMembership and Other Metrics \nOur medical membership includes the following customer types: Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard\n®\n, Medicare, Medicaid and our FEP\n®\n. We refer to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA as our BCBS-branded, or Anthem BCBS, business. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to members in our non-BCBS-branded plans, which include Wellpoint, MMM and Simply Healthcare plans. In addition to the above medical membership, we also serve customers who purchase one or more of our other products or services that are often ancillary to our health business.\n•\nIndividual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the Public Exchanges. Individual business is sold on a risk-based basis. We offer on-exchange products through Public Exchanges and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain Public Exchange Individual products. Unsubsidized Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network and the efficiency of administration. Customer turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Employer Group risk-based. Individual business accounted for 2.8%, 2.2% and 1.7% of our medical members at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n•\nEmployer Group risk-based consists of employer customers who purchase products on a full-risk basis, which are products for which we charge a premium and indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Employer Group risk-based accounts include Local Group customers and National Accounts. Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as \n -49-\nwell as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes Student Health members. National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an Elevance Health service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. Employer Group risk-based accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants who work with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the Public Exchanges. Employer Group risk-based accounted for 8.1%, 8.0% and 8.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n•\nEmployer Group fee-based customers represent employer groups, Local Group, and National Accounts, who purchase fee-based products and elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ healthcare costs. Some fee-based customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk. Employer Group fee-based accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. Employer Group fee-based accounted for 45.0%, 43.2% and 42.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n•\nBlueCard\n®\n host customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by Elevance Health who receive healthcare services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard\n®\n membership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard\n®\n program. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Elevance Health subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-Elevance Health controlled BCBSA licensee (the “home plan”). We perform certain functions, including claims pricing and administration, for BlueCard\n®\n members, for which we receive service fees from the BlueCard\n®\n members’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard\n®\n claims received per month. BlueCard\n®\n host membership accounted for 14.5%, 14.3% and 13.8% of our medical members at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n•\nMedicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, including Special Needs Plans (“SNPs”), also known as Medicare Advantage SNPs; dual-eligible programs through Medicare-Medicaid Plans (“MMPs”); Medicare Supplement plans; and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans (“Medicare Part D”). Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. In addition, our Medicare Advantage SNPs provide tailored benefits to special needs individuals who are institutionalized or have severe or disabling chronic conditions and to dual-eligible customers, who are low-income seniors and persons under age 65 with disabilities. Medicare Advantage SNPs are coordinated care plans specifically designed to provide targeted care, covering all the healthcare services considered medically necessary for members and often providing professional care coordination services, with personal guidance and programs that help members maintain their health. Medicare Advantage membership also includes Medicare Advantage members in our Group Retiree Solutions business who are retired members of commercial accounts or retired members of groups who are not affiliated with our commercial accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product through us. Medicare Supplement plans typically pay the difference between healthcare costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. MMP, which was established as a result of the passage of the ACA, is focused on serving members who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare program business accounted for 6.5%, 6.3% and 6.1% of our medical members at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n•\nMedicaid membership represents eligible members who receive health benefits through publicly funded healthcare programs, including Medicaid, ACA-related Medicaid expansion programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, programs for seniors and people with disabilities, Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and specialty programs such as those focused on long-term services and support, HIV/AIDS, foster care, behavioral health and/or substance abuse disorders, and intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities, among others. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 19.5%, 22.4% and 24.3% of our medical members at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n -50-\n•\nFEP\n®\n members consist of United States government employees and their dependents who receive health benefits within our geographic markets. FEP\n®\n business accounted for 3.6%, 3.5% and 3.4% of our medical members at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe following table presents our medical membership by customer type as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Also included below is other membership by product and other metrics. The membership data and other metrics presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period. The CarelonRx Quarterly Adjusted Scripts metric represents adjusted script volume based on the number of days a prescription covers. On an adjusted basis, one 90-day script counts the same as three 30-day scripts. The Carelon Services Consumers Served metric represents the number of consumers receiving one or more healthcare related services from Carelon Services who are members of our affiliated health plans as well as those who are members of non-affiliated health plans. \n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nChange\n% Change\nChange\n% Change\nMedical Membership \n(in thousands)\nIndividual\n1,287 \n1,025 \n789 \n262 \n25.6 \n%\n236 \n29.9 \n%\nEmployer Group Risk-Based\n3,713 \n3,756 \n3,988 \n(43)\n(1.1)\n%\n(232)\n(5.8)\n%\nCommercial Risk-Based\n5,000 \n4,781 \n4,777 \n219 \n4.6 \n%\n4 \n0.1 \n%\nBlueCard\n®1\n6,630 \n6,706 \n6,555 \n(76)\n(1.1)\n%\n151 \n2.3 \n%\nEmployer Group Fee-Based\n20,569 \n20,227 \n20,174 \n342 \n1.7 \n%\n53 \n0.3 \n%\nCommercial Fee-Based\n27,199 \n26,933 \n26,729 \n266 \n1.0 \n%\n204 \n0.8 \n%\nMedicare Advantage\n2,066 \n2,047 \n1,977 \n19 \n0.9 \n%\n70 \n3.5 \n%\nMedicare Supplement\n891 \n923 \n947 \n(32)\n(3.5)\n%\n(24)\n(2.5)\n%\nTotal Medicare\n2,957 \n2,970 \n2,924 \n(13)\n(0.4)\n%\n46 \n1.6 \n%\nMedicaid\n8,917 \n10,503 \n11,571 \n(1,586)\n(15.1)\n%\n(1,068)\n(9.2)\n%\nFederal Employee Program\n®\n1,661 \n1,642 \n1,623 \n19 \n1.2 \n%\n19 \n1.2 \n%\nTotal Medical Membership\n45,734 \n46,829 \n47,624 \n(1,095)\n(2.3)\n%\n(795)\n(1.7)\n%\nOther Membership \n(in thousands)\n2\nDental Members\n7,282 \n6,820 \n6,692 \n462 \n6.8 \n%\n128 \n1.9 \n%\nDental Administration Members\n1,887 \n1,729 \n1,586 \n158 \n9.1 \n%\n143 \n9.0 \n%\nVision Members\n10,419 \n9,944 \n9,813 \n475 \n4.8 \n%\n131 \n1.3 \n%\nMedicare Part D Standalone Members\n256 \n260 \n271 \n(4)\n(1.5)\n%\n(11)\n(4.1)\n%\nOther Metrics\n (in millions)\nCarelonRx Quarterly Adjusted Scripts\n82.9 \n78.0 \n82.0 \n4.9 \n6.3 \n%\n(4.0)\n(4.9)\n%\nCarelon Services Consumers Served\n101.1 \n103.3 \n105.0 \n(2.2)\n(2.1)\n%\n(1.7)\n(1.6)\n%\n1       BlueCard\n®\n membership at December 31, 2023 and 2022 has been restated lower by 132 and higher by 93, respectively, to align to our current reporting, which is the BCBSA reporting methodology.\n2      We are no longer presenting our Life and Disability membership following the sale of that business on April 1, 2024.\nDecember 31, 2024 Compared to December 31, 2023\nMedical Membership \nTotal medical membership declined during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. This was driven primarily by attrition in Medicaid membership, including as a result of eligibility redeterminations and certain market exits, decreases in our Employer Group risk-based and Medicare Supplement businesses. These decreases were partially offset by increases in our Employer Group fee-based, Individual and FEP\n®\n businesses.\n -51-\nOther Membership\nOur other membership has the potential to be impacted by changes in our medical membership, as our medical members often purchase our other products that are ancillary to our health business.

These increases were partially offset by declines in premiums driven by Medicaid membership attrition.\nNet investment income increased primarily due to higher income from fixed maturity securities and alternative investments.\nNet losses on financial instruments decreased due to increased gains on fixed maturity securities, partially offset by losses on strategic investments and equity securities.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, we experienced a gain on sale of business due to the sale of our life and disability business. \nBenefit expense increased primarily due to increases in medical cost trends in our Health Business segment due to Medicaid membership eligibility redeterminations. These increases were partially offset by declines driven by Medicaid membership attrition.\nOur benefit expense ratio increased, primarily driven by higher Medicaid membership cost trends due to Medicaid rates being inadequate to cover medical cost trends that were well in excess of historical averages, primarily due to the Medicaid membership redeterminations. \nCost of products sold reflects the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed by CarelonRx for our unaffiliated pharmacy customers. Cost of products sold increased as a result of higher script utilization.\nOperating expense decreased primarily due to disciplined cost management, enhanced efficiency and lower business optimization charges, partially offset by the accrual for the Provider Settlement Agreement associated with the BCBSA Litigation.\nOur operating expense ratio decreased primarily due to disciplined cost management, enhanced efficiency, lower business optimization charges and the favorable impact of operating revenue growth, partially offset by the accrual for the Provider Settlement Agreement associated with the BCBSA Litigation. \nOther expense decreased primarily due to decreased amortization of intangible assets during the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, we had increased amortization of other intangible assets as the amortization period of certain assets was shortened to align with the dates our new branding took place.\nOur effective income tax rate increased from 22.3% to 24.5%, primarily due to the impact of geographic changes in the mix of our 2024 earnings.\nOur shareholders’ net income as a percentage of total revenues slightly decreased in 2024 as compared to 2023 as a result of all the factors discussed above.\n -53-\nReportable Segments Results of Operations\nThe following table presents a summary of our reportable segment financial information for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022: \nYears Ended December 31\nChange\n \n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\nOperating Revenue\nHealth Benefits\n$\n150,275\n$\n148,571\n$\n138,484\n$\n1,704 \n1.1 \n%\n$\n10,087 \n7.3 \n%\nCarelonRx\n35,961\n33,835\n28,526\n2,126 \n6.3 \n%\n5,309 \n18.6 \n%\nCarelon Services\n17,961\n14,147\n12,860\n3,814 \n27.0 \n%\n1,287 \n10.0 \n%\nCorporate & Other\n309\n479\n399\n(170)\n(35.5)\n%\n80 \n20.1 \n%\nEliminations \n(29,302)\n(26,823)\n(24,609)\n(2,479)\n9.2 \n%\n(2,214)\n9.0 \n%\nTotal operating revenue\n$\n175,204\n$\n170,209\n$\n155,660\n$\n4,995 \n2.9 \n%\n$\n14,549 \n9.3 \n%\nOperating Gain (Loss)\nHealth Benefits\n$\n6,243\n$\n6,888\n$\n6,022\n$\n(645)\n(9.4)\n%\n$\n866 \n14.4 \n%\nCarelonRx\n2,172\n1,975\n1,868\n197 \n10.0 \n%\n107 \n5.7 \n%\nCarelon Services\n717\n680\n535\n37 \n5.4 \n%\n145 \n27.1 \n%\nCorporate & Other\n(1,270)\n(1,044)\n(142)\n(226)\n21.6 \n%\n(902)\n635.2 \n%\nOperating Margin\nHealth Benefits\n4.2 \n%\n4.6 \n%\n4.3 \n%\n(40) bp\n30 bp\nCarelonRx\n6.0 \n%\n5.8 \n%\n6.5 \n%\n20 bp\n(70) bp\nCarelon Services\n4.0 \n%\n4.8 \n%\n4.2 \n%\n(80) bp\n60 bp\nThe following table summarizes Health Benefits operating revenues by Commercial, Medicare, Medicaid and FEP\n®\n lines of business for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nYears Ended December 31\nChange\n \n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\nHealth Benefits Operating Revenue\nCommercial\n$\n46,816 \n$\n43,266 \n$\n41,674 \n$\n3,550 \n8.2 \n%\n$\n1,592 \n3.8 \n%\nMedicare\n36,795 \n35,067 \n31,604 \n1,728 \n4.9 \n%\n3,463 \n11.0 \n%\nMedicaid\n51,937 \n56,601 \n52,886 \n(4,664)\n(8.2)\n%\n3,715 \n7.0 \n%\nFederal Employee Program\n®\n14,727 \n13,637 \n12,320 \n1,090 \n8.0 \n%\n1,317 \n10.7 \n%\nTotal Health Benefits operating revenues\n$\n150,275 \n$\n148,571 \n$\n138,484 \n$\n1,704 \n1.1 \n%\n$\n10,087 \n7.3 \n%\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nHealth Benefits\nOperating revenue increased primarily as a result of higher premium yields driven by premium rate increases in all of our lines of business in recognition of medical cost trends, partially offset by membership attrition in our Medicaid business. \nThe decrease in operating gain was primarily a result of Medicaid rates being inadequate to cover medical cost trends that were well in excess of historical averages due to Medicaid membership eligibility redeterminations, partially offset by improved premium yields in our other Health Benefits businesses. \n -54-\nCarelonRx\nOperating revenue increased primarily as a result of higher prescription volume associated with growth in external pharmacy members and the recent acquisition of Paragon, partially offset by the impact of Medicaid membership attrition.\nThe increase in operating gain was primarily a result of the growth in product revenue, partially offset by expenses associated with the launch of additional services by CarelonRx.\nCarelon Services\nOperating revenue increased primarily due to the continued expansion of our medical benefit management, behavioral health and post-acute care services, as well as acquisitions completed in 2024.\nThe increase in operating gain was primarily driven by improved performance in Carelon Services businesses, partially offset by increased medical cost trends in our post-acute business and the impact of Medicaid membership attrition.\nCorporate & Other\nThe increase in operating loss was primarily due to the accrual recorded for the Provider Settlement Agreement associated with the BCBSA Litigation, partially offset by disciplined cost management and lower business optimization charges.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, goodwill and other intangible assets and investments, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Estimates can require a significant amount of judgment, and a different set of assumptions could result in material changes to our reported results.\nMedical Claims Payable\nThe most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2024, this liability was $15,746 and represented 20.9% of our total liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported; as well as (2) claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 97.5%, or $15,347, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2024; and (3) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 2.5%, or $399 of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2024. The level of claims payable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period-end to the next, from approximately 2% to 6% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.\nLiabilities for claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in the aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Our reserving practice for claim liabilities is to consistently recognize the appropriate amount of reserve within a level of confidence required by Actuarial Standards of Practice. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not yet reported or processed claims by following a detailed actuarial process that uses both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim \n -55-\npayments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period-end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims. \nFor the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare trend levels (“trend factors”). \nOur reserve methodology, which relies upon historical information, must be adjusted to account for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. Adjustments are carried out by our actuaries, drawing on expert knowledge and taking into account their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Factors such as changes in levels of utilization, unit costs, business mix, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursements, processing system modifications, claim inventory levels, claim processing and submission patterns, and operational changes resulting from business combinations are considered when developing our reserve estimates. We also compare prior period liabilities to revised claim liabilities based on subsequent claim development. In these comparisons, methods and assumptions remain constant as reserves are recalculated; rather, the availability of additional paid claims information drives changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense.\nOn a regular basis, we review cost trends and utilization assumptions set upon initial establishment of claim liabilities. We utilize subsequent paid claims activity to monitor and continuously adjust the claims liability and benefit expense. If actual results are determined to be materially different than assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization, future periods of our income statement and overall financial position could be impacted. Adjustments made to prior year estimates may result in either an additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period the adjustment is made. The variability of healthcare costs necessitates that claim liabilities be adjusted each period and are sometimes significant compared to the net income recorded in that period. An actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued triggers the immediate recognition of prior period development. Once sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable, the determination is made.\nWhile numerous factors contribute to our medical claims payable liability estimation, the two assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2024, were the completion and trend factors. These vital assumptions can be affected by variables such as utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing and submission patterns, and operational changes resulting from business combinations.\nThere is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2024, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower estimated variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.\nThe difference in completion factor assumptions results in variability of 2%, or approximately $295, in the December 31, 2024 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.\nThe other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2024 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2024, there was a 380 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 4%, or approximately $560, in the incurred but \n -56-\nnot paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2024.\nSee Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year”, or as we establish liabilities for premium refunds based upon the minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”), the relative health risk of members, and other contractual or regulatory requirements. Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material. \nThe ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 88.5% for 2024, 88.0% for 2023 and 87.3% for 2022. This ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby 2024 claims were processed at a similar speed to 2023 and 2022.\nWe calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2024, this metric was 12.3%, largely driven by favorable completion factor development from 2023 as well as favorable trend factor development at the end of 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, this metric was 11.4% and was largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2022 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, this metric was 7.0% and was largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2021.\nWe calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims. For the year ended December 31, 2024, this metric was 1.4%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $1,731. This metric was 1.4% for 2023 and 0.9% for 2022. \nThe following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for each of 2023 and 2022 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year):\n \nYears Ended December 31\n \n2023\n2022\nTotal net incurred medical claims, as reported\n$\n120,227 \n$\n112,545 \nRetrospective basis, as described above\n120,067 \n111,843 \nVariance\n$\n160 \n$\n702 \nVariance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported\n0.1 \n%\n0.6 \n%\nGiven that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2024 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2025.\n -57-\nThe 2023 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported, of 0.1% was less than the 2022 percentage of 0.6%. This was primarily driven by the fact that the change in prior year redundancy reported for 2023 as compared to 2022 was less than the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2022 as compared to 2021. \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nOur total goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2024 were $40,371, and represented 34.5% of our total assets and 97.5% of our total equity at December 31, 2024.\nWe follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.\nWe complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, which is an indication that our goodwill may be impaired. These qualitative impairment tests include assessing events and factors that could affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors and entity specific events. If we determine that a reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired after utilizing these qualitative impairment analysis procedures, we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nOur quantitative impairment test utilizes the projected income and market valuation approaches for goodwill and the projected income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the projected income and market valuation approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The projected income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; and book value of invested capital (debt and equity) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.\nWe did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2024 annual impairment tests, as it was determined that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months.\n If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.\nFor additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” and Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \nInvestments\nCurrent and long-term marketable investment securities were $27,428 at December 31, 2024 and represented 23.5% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2024. We classify fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” and report those securities at fair value. Most fixed maturity securities are available to support current \n -58-\noperations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.\nOur impairment review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors. Such factors considered include the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. \nIf a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we write down the fixed maturity security’s cost basis to fair value and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, we recognize the credit component of the impairment as an allowance for credit loss in our consolidated balance sheets and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. The non-credit component of the impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit-related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. \nThe credit component of an impairment is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of purchase. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.\nWe have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. We believe that we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. We have established an allowance for credit loss and recorded credit loss expense as a reflection of our expected impairment losses. Given the inherent uncertainty of changes in market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods. \nIn addition to marketable investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $9,749, or 8.3% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2024. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, notes receivables and mortgage loans. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.\nThrough our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $26,236 at December 31, 2024. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A” as of December 31, 2024. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions of $835 that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of 14 securities with a fair value of $8, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2024. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any material exposure to any single guarantor, neither indirectly through the guarantees, nor directly through investment in the guarantor. Further, the weighted-average credit rating of the fixed maturity securities without a guarantee, for which such information is available, was “A” as of December 31, 2024.\n -59-\nFair values of fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.\nWe obtain quoted market prices for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in these valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes procedures such as a review of month-to-month price fluctuations and price comparisons to secondary pricing services. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nIn certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2024 totaled $872 and represented approximately 2.6% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities and equity securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.\nFor additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 5, “Investments,” and Note 7, “Fair Value,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2024 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\n” and \n“Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted”\n sections of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIntroduction\nOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, product revenue, service fees, investment income, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from business divestitures, proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, operating expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.\nWe manage our cash, investments and capital structure so that we are able to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.\n -60-\nA substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near-term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.\nThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility. Interest rates on fixed debt income securities have increased since the beginning of 2022, which may increase our borrowing costs if we elect to issue debt. During recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide stability and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. \nA summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n \nYears Ended December 31\n$ Change\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nSources of Cash:\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n5,808 \n$\n8,061 \n$\n8,399 \n$\n(2,253)\n$\n(338)\nProceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions of investments, net of purchases\n586 \n— \n— \n586 \n— \nIssuances of short- and long-term debt, net of repayments\n6,200 \n626 \n862 \n5,574 \n(236)\nIssuances of common stock under employee stock plans\n221 \n152 \n182 \n69 \n(30)\nOther sources of cash, net\n— \n— \n762 \n— \n(762)\nTotal sources of cash\n12,815 \n8,839 \n10,205 \n3,976 \n(1,366)\nUses of Cash:\nPurchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions\n— \n(2,700)\n(2,338)\n2,700 \n(362)\nRepurchase and retirement of common stock\n(2,900)\n(2,676)\n(2,316)\n(224)\n(360)\nPurchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired\n(4,809)\n(1,552)\n(649)\n(3,257)\n(903)\nPurchases of property and equipment\n(1,256)\n(1,296)\n(1,152)\n40 \n(144)\nCash dividends\n(1,508)\n(1,395)\n(1,229)\n(113)\n(166)\nOther uses of cash, net\n(508)\n(80)\n— \n(428)\n(80)\nTotal uses of cash\n(10,981)\n(9,699)\n(7,684)\n(1,282)\n(2,015)\nEffect of foreign exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents\n(6)\n(1)\n(14)\n(5)\n13 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,828 \n$\n(861)\n$\n2,507 \n$\n2,689 \n$\n(3,368)\nLiquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nThe decline in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the impact of the membership decline in our Medicaid business and working capital changes. \nOther significant changes in sources and uses of cash year-over-year included (a) additional sources of cash from issuances of short- and long-term debt, net of repayments, proceeds from sales, maturities, calls and redemptions of investments, net of purchases, and issuances of common stock under employee stock plans and (b) increased uses of cash from purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired, the repurchase and retirement of common stock, the purchase of property and equipment, cash dividends, and other uses of cash, net.\n -61-\nFinancial Condition\nWe maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities of $35,716 at December 31, 2024. Since December 31, 2023, total cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities decreased by $1,529, primarily due to cash used for common stock repurchases, purchases of subsidiaries net of cash acquired, purchases of property and equipment and cash dividends paid to shareholders. This decrease was partially offset by cash generated from operations, issuances of short-and-long term debt, net of repayment, proceeds from sales, maturities, calls, and redemptions, and issuances of common stock.\nMany of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, or other regulatory requirements, could impact our subsidiaries’ future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $2,357 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments. \nPeriodically, we access capital markets and issue debt (“Notes”) for long-term borrowing purposes, for example, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. Certain of these Notes may have a call feature that allows us to redeem the Notes at any time at our option and/or a put feature that allows a Note holder to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating. For more information on our debt, including redemptions and issuances, see Note 13, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from the amounts presented on our audited consolidated balance sheets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total equity. Total debt is the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, less current portion. We believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 43.0% and 38.9% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur senior debt is rated “A” by S&P Global Ratings, “BBB+” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.\nCapital Resources\nWe have a shelf registration statement on file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansions.\nWe have a senior revolving credit facility (the “5-Year Facility”) with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. The 5-Year Facility provides credit of up to $4,000 and matures in April 2027. Our ability to borrow under the 5-Year Facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt-to-capital ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the credit agreement for the 5-Year Facility. As of December 31, 2024, our debt-to-capital ratio, as defined and calculated under the 5-Year Facility, was 43.0%. We do not believe the restrictions contained in our 5-Year Facility covenants materially affect our financial or operating \n -62-\nflexibility. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants under the 5-Year Facility. There were no amounts outstanding under the 5-Year Facility at December 31, 2024.\nWe have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $4,000, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. Should commercial paper issuance become unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our 5-Year Facility, which provides for credit in the amount of $4,000, to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. At December 31, 2024, we had $0 outstanding under our commercial paper program. Beginning June 30, 2023, we have reclassified our commercial paper balances from long-term debt to short-term debt as our intent is to not replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year. \nWhile there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our 5-Year Facility, if market conditions allow, would be willing to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations.\nWe are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (collectively the “FHLBs”). As a member, we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2024, we had $365 of outstanding short-term borrowings from the FHLBs.\nAs discussed in “\nFinancial Condition\n” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we currently estimate that approximately $2,700 of dividends will be paid to us by our subsidiaries during 2025. During 2024, we received $6,322 of dividends from our subsidiaries.\nIn addition to regulations regarding the timing and amount of dividends, our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for health and other insurance companies and health maintenance organizations largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) Risk-Based Capital (RBC) for Health Organizations Model Act (the “RBC Model Act”). These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries’ respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2024 were in excess of all applicable mandatory RBC requirements. In addition to exceeding these RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note 22, “Statutory Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFuture Sources and Uses of Liquidity\nShort-Term Liquidity Requirements\nAs previously described, our cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. We believe cash on hand, operating cash receipts, investments and amounts available under our commercial paper program, our 5-Year Facility and borrowings available from the FHLBs will be adequate to fund our expected cash disbursements over the next twelve months.\n -63-\nLong-Term Liquidity Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2024, our long-term cash disbursements required under various contractual obligations and commitments were:\n•\nDebt and interest expense:  \nFuture debt and estimated interest payments are $52,073, with $2,855 due within the next twelve months. For additional information, see Note 13, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nOperating leases:  \nWe lease office space and certain computer equipment, for which the future estimated payments were $886, with $184 due within the next twelve months. For additional information, see Note 18, “Leases,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nOther liabilities:  \nThese liabilities primarily consist of future policy reserves, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. Amounts due within twelve months were $35, with $1,956 due in future periods. Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from these numbers, as we had no funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, at December 31, 2024, as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. In addition, gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities have not been included. For further information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nPurchase obligations:  \nThese obligations include estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service vendors. Amounts due within the next twelve months for these purchase obligations were $995, while longer term payments were $3,891. For further information, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nInvestment commitments:  \nThese include unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments and low-income housing tax credits. Estimated amounts due were $1,444, including $409 due within the next twelve months. \nIn addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments. \nWe regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nOn January 22, 2025, our Audit Committee declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $1.71 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 25, 2025 to the shareholders of record as of March 10, 2025.\nUnder our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2024, we had Board authorization of $9,300 to repurchase our common stock. No duration has been placed on our common stock repurchase program, and we reserve the right to discontinue the program at any time. We intend to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions.\nWe believe that funds from future operating cash flows, cash and investments and funds available under our credit facilities and/or from public or private financing sources will be sufficient for future operations and commitments, and for capital acquisitions and other strategic transactions.\nOther than disclosed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not have any off-balance sheet derivative instruments, guarantee transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements or any indemnification agreements that will require funding in future periods. We have not transferred assets to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do not hold any variable interest in an unconsolidated entity where such entity provides us with financing, liquidity, market risk or \n -64-\ncredit risk support. See Note 2, “Subsidiary Transactions,” of the Notes to Condensed Financial Statements (Parent Company Only) included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional detail on the Elevance Health, Inc. parent guarantees of certain subsidiaries.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.\n \n(In Millions, Except As Otherwise Stated Herein)\nAs a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2024. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.\nInvestments\nOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.\nThe primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which have exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.\nInvestments in fixed maturity securities include corporate securities, which account for 53% of our total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2024 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase, prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”\nMarket risk for fixed maturity securities is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $1,424 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $1,527 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and the duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.\nOur equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization exchange-traded funds, domestic equities, foreign equities and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market, driven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.\nOur other invested assets, reported within our long-term investments, are primarily subject to private market exposures, including private equity and private credit investments. These investments are also subject to credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk, as public market valuations will form a basis for valuations for these investments. Given their \n -65-\nilliquid nature, we focus on appropriate sizing of these investments relative to our liquidity needs and risk tolerance. Our risk tolerance is formed by the level of illiquidity and short-term price movements from market valuation risk we are willing to accept relative to the higher long-term expected returns over the life of these investments.\nAs of December 31, 2024, 4% of our marketable investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $119. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $119.\nFor additional information regarding our investments, see Note 5, “Investments,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - \nInvestments\n” within Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLong-Term Debt\nOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2024 consisted of senior unsecured notes and subordinated surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $30,867 and $28,460, respectively. This debt is subject to interest rate risk, as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly. \nFor additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 7, “Fair Value,” and Note 13, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDerivatives \nWe have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.\nChanges in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded a net liability of $142, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swaps’ fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $383 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $383 increase in fair value.\nFor additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 6, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n -66-\nITEM 8.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n -68-\nValuation of Incurred but Not Paid Claims\nDescription of the Matter\nMedical claims payable was $15,746 million at December 31, 2024, a significant portion of which related to the Company’s estimate for claims that are incurred but not paid. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s liability for incurred but not paid claims is determined using actuarial methods that include a number of factors and assumptions, including completion factors, which represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred, and trend factors, which represent an estimate of claims expense based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare cost levels. There is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management’s best estimate of completion and trend factors, which are used to calculate actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claims.\nAuditing management’s estimate of incurred but not paid claims was complex and required the involvement of our actuarial specialists due to the highly judgmental nature of the completion and trend factor assumptions used in the valuation process. The significant judgment was primarily due to the sensitivity of management’s best estimate of completion and trend factor assumptions, which have a significant impact on the valuation of incurred but not paid claims.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s actuarial process for estimating the liability for incurred but not paid claims. These audit procedures included among others, testing management review controls over completion and trend factor assumptions and the review and approval processes that management has in place for estimating the liability for incurred but not paid claims.\nTo test the Company’s liability for incurred but not paid claims, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims and membership data recorded in the source claims processing and disbursement systems to the data used by management in developing completion and trend factor assumptions and agreeing a sample of incurred and paid claims to source documentation. With the support of actuarial specialists, we evaluated the methodologies applied by the Company in determining the actuarially determined liability and management's actuarial assumptions, including trend and completion factor assumptions, used in their analysis based on historical claim experience and independently calculated a range of reasonable reserve estimates for comparison to management’s best estimate of the liability for incurred but not paid claims. Additionally, we performed a review of the prior period liabilities for incurred but not paid claims to subsequent claims development.\n                                    /s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe

throughout these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements refer to Elevance Health, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. References to the “states” include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, unless the context otherwise requires.\nElevance Health is a health company with the purpose of improving the health of humanity. We are one of the largest health insurers in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving approximately \n45.7\n million medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2024. We offer a broad spectrum of network-based managed care risk-based plans to Individual, Employer Group, Medicaid and Medicare markets. In addition, we provide a broad array of managed care services to fee-based customers, including claims processing, stop loss insurance, provider network access, medical management, care management, wellness programs, actuarial services and other administrative services. We provide services to the federal government in connection with our Federal Health Products & Services business, which administers the Federal Employee Program\n®\n (“FEP\n®\n”). We provide an array of specialty services both to customers of our subsidiary health plans and to unaffiliated health plans, including pharmacy services, stop loss insurance, dental, vision and supplemental health insurance benefits, as well as integrated health services.\nWe are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (“BCBSA”), an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (“BCBS”) licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding \n30\n counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (in the New York City metropolitan area and upstate New York), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas, we do business as Anthem Blue Cross and Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. We also conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees as well as other strategic partners. In addition, we serve members in numerous states as Wellpoint, Carelon, MMM and/or Simply Healthcare. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all \n50\n states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico through our subsidiaries.\n We have organized our brand portfolio into the following core go-to-market brands:\n•\nAnthem Blue Cross/Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield — represents our Anthem-branded and affiliated Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensed plans;\n•\nWellpoint — unites select non-BCBSA licensed Medicare, Medicaid and commercial plans under the Wellpoint name; and\n•\nCarelon — this brand brings together our healthcare related services and capabilities, including our CarelonRx and Carelon Services businesses, under a single brand name.\n We report our results of operations in the following \nfour\n reportable segments: Health Benefits, CarelonRx, Carelon Services and Corporate & Other (our businesses that do not individually meet the quantitative thresholds for an operating segment, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to our other reportable segments). For additional discussion, see Note 20, “Segment Information.”\n2. \nBasis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation:\n The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Elevance Health and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Our consolidated financial \n -75-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nstatements include the accounts of Elevance Health, Inc. and subsidiaries that we control, including variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. We are considered the primary beneficiary if we have the power to direct the variable interest entity's most significant economic activities, and we have the right to receive benefits or obligations to absorb losses that could be significant to the entity. We evaluate the following criteria: (1) the structure and purpose of the entity; (2) the risks and rewards created by and shared through the entity; and (3) our ability to direct its activities, receive its benefits and absorb its losses relative to the other parties involved with the entity.\nCertain of our subsidiaries operate outside of the United States and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar (“USD”). We translate the assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries to USD using the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. We translate the revenues and expenses of those subsidiaries to USD using the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is included in “Foreign currency translation adjustments” in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nReclassifications:\n Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nUse of Estimates:\n The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our most significant estimate relates to estimates and judgments for medical claims payable. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\n Cash and cash equivalents includes available cash and all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. We control a number of bank accounts that are used exclusively to hold customer funds for the administration of customer benefits, and we have cash and cash equivalents on deposit to meet certain regulatory requirements. These amounts totaled $\n409\n and $\n294\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in the cash and cash equivalents line on our consolidated balance sheets.\nInvestments: \nWe classify fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.\nIf a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we write down the fixed maturity security’s cost basis to fair value and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, we recognize the credit component of the impairment as an allowance for credit loss in our consolidated balance sheets and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. The non-credit component of the impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit-related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nThe credit component of an impairment is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of purchase. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.\nFor asset-backed securities included in fixed maturity securities, we recognize income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment in the securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the purchase date of the securities. Such adjustments are reported within net investment income.\n -76-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities are recognized in our results of operations within net gains and losses on financial instruments. Certain marketable equity securities are held to satisfy contractual obligations and are reported under the caption “Other invested assets” in our consolidated balance sheets.\nMortgage loans on real estate are classified as held for investment and are reported at their amortized cost basis net of loss allowance under the caption “Other invested assets” in our consolidated balance sheets. Amortized cost is the amount at which the loan is originated, adjusted for accrued interest, amortization of premium, discount and net deferred fees or costs, collection of cash and write-offs.\nWe have corporate-owned life insurance policies on certain participants in our deferred compensation plans and other members of management. The cash surrender value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is reported under the caption “Other invested assets” in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe have investments in limited partnerships (“LPs”) and companies in which our ownership interest may enable us to influence the operating or financial decisions of the investee company, including unconsolidated variable interest entities. These investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are reported within “Other invested assets” in our consolidated balance sheets. Our proportionate share of equity in net income for these LPs and unconsolidated investee companies is reported within “Net investment income” in our consolidated statements of income. The carrying value of these investments are written down, or impaired, to fair value when a decline in value is considered to be other-than temporary. In applying the equity method (including assessment for other-than temporary impairment), we use financial information provided by the LPs and investee companies, generally on a one-to three-month lag. We consolidate investee companies in certain other instances where it is deemed to exercise control, or is considered the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity.\nInvestment income is recorded when earned. All securities sold resulting in investment realized gains and losses are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses are determined on the basis of the cost or amortized cost of the specific securities sold.\nWe participate in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in our investment portfolio are transferred to independent brokers or dealers in exchange for cash and securities collateral. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance related to accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities, we recognize the collateral as an asset, which is reported in Other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets, and we record a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to the borrower, which is reported in Other current liabilities. The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on our consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains or losses on securities lending collateral are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. The market value of loaned securities and that of the collateral pledged can fluctuate in non-synchronized fashions. To the extent the loaned securities’ value appreciates faster or depreciates slower than the value of the collateral pledged, we are exposed to the risk of the shortfall. As a primary mitigating mechanism, the loaned securities and collateral pledged are marked to market on a daily basis and the shortfall, if any, is collected accordingly. Secondarily, the collateral level is set at \n102\n% of the value of the loaned securities, which provides a cushion before any shortfall arises. The investment of the cash collateral is subject to market risk, which is managed by limiting the investments to higher quality and shorter duration instruments.\nReceivables:\n Receivables are reported net of amounts for expected credit losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical collection trends, future forecasts and our judgment regarding the ability to collect specific accounts.\nPremium receivables include the uncollected amounts from insured groups, individuals and government programs. Premium receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n183\n and $\n212\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nSelf-funded receivables include administrative fees, claims and other amounts due from fee-based customers. Self-funded receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n115\n and $\n87\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther receivables include pharmacy rebates, provider advances, claims recoveries, reinsurance receivables, proceeds due from brokers on investment trades that have not yet settled, accrued investment income and other miscellaneous amounts due \n -77-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nto us. These receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n1,385\n and $\n941\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIncome Taxes:\n We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return basis of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws and are reported net on our consolidated balance sheets. The deferred tax benefits of the deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred income tax expense or benefit generally represents the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding the impact from amounts initially recorded for business combinations, if any, and amounts recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income. Current income tax expense represents the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported.\nThe Internal Revenue Code subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. We have elected to account for GILTI tax in the year the tax is incurred.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes a provision that imposes a new corporate alternative minimum tax (the “Corporate AMT”) that became effective for us beginning January 1, 2023. We have elected to account for the effects of the Corporate AMT on deferred tax assets and carryforwards and tax credits in the period they arise. We have also elected to disregard Corporate AMT when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance for non-Corporate AMT deferred tax assets. We do not believe the Corporate AMT will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows or related disclosures. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposes an excise tax on the fair market value of net stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. These are included as a charge to retained earnings as a component of the repurchase and retirement of common stock.\nWe account for income tax contingencies in accordance with FASB guidance that contains a model to address uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold, which all income tax positions must achieve before being recognized in the financial statements.\nProperty and Equipment:\n Property and equipment is recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from \nfifteen\n to \nthirty years\n for buildings and improvements, \nthree\n to \nfive years\n for computer equipment and software, and \nseven years\n for furniture and other equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the term of the related lease. Certain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized and amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from \nthree\n to \nten years\n.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\n FASB guidance requires business combinations to be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired, including other intangible assets. Other intangible assets represent the values assigned to customer relationships, provider and hospital networks, Blue Cross and Blue Shield and other trademarks, licenses and other agreements, such as non-compete agreements. Goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reportable segments based on the relative fair value of the components of the businesses acquired.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test. Other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are tested for impairment separately. We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, including goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur.\nFASB guidance allows for qualitative assessments of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount for purposes of a goodwill impairment analysis and whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired for purposes of an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis. Estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. Qualitative analysis involves assessing situations and developments that could affect key \n -78-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\ndrivers used to evaluate whether the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets is impaired. Our procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors, and entity specific events.\nQuantitative analysis must be performed if qualitative analyses are not conclusive. Entities also have the option to bypass the assessment of qualitative factors and proceed directly to performing quantitative analyses. Fair value for purposes of a quantitative goodwill impairment test is calculated using a blend of the projected income and market valuation approaches. The projected income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital and reflects volatility associated with the cost of equity capital. Market valuations include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry and are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”); and book value of invested capital.\nA goodwill impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s estimated fair value. This determination consists of a one-step test comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. This goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount over its estimated fair value, which is recorded in the results of operations.\nFair value for purposes of a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets is estimated using a projected income approach. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than the carrying value, which is recorded in the results of operations. If significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.\nDerivative Financial Instruments:\n We primarily invest in the following types of derivative financial instruments: interest rate swaps, futures, forward contracts, put and call options, collars, swaptions, embedded derivatives and warrants. Derivatives embedded within non-derivative instruments, such as options embedded in convertible fixed maturity securities, are bifurcated from the host instrument when the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host instrument. Our use of derivatives is limited by statutes and regulations promulgated by the various regulatory bodies to which we are subject, and by our own derivative policy. Our derivative use is generally limited to hedging purposes, on an economic basis, and we generally do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nWe have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through active portfolio management, including rebalancing our existing portfolios of assets and liabilities, as well as changing the characteristics of investments to be purchased or sold in the future. In addition, derivative financial instruments are used to modify the interest rate exposure of certain liabilities or forecasted transactions. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge, on an economic basis, interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.\nAll investments in derivatives are recorded as assets or liabilities at fair value, except certain put and call options on large blocks of equity securities. Put and call options on large blocks of equity securities are initially recorded at fair value; however, they are not subsequently marked to market. If certain correlation, hedge effectiveness and risk reduction criteria are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair value or cash flow. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the nature of any hedge designation thereon. Amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, if any, are reported in results of operations immediately. If the derivative is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in results of operations in the period of change. Cash flows associated with the settlement of non-designated derivatives are shown on a net basis in investing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flow.\nFrom time to time, we may also purchase derivatives to hedge, on an economic basis, our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations associated with the operations of certain of our subsidiaries. We generally use futures or forward \n -79-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\ncontracts for these transactions. We generally do not designate these contracts as hedges and, accordingly, the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in results of operations immediately.\nAs part of our international operations, we conduct transactions in foreign currencies, which exposes us to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To manage this exposure, we utilize forward contracts to hedge expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the applicable accounting standards.\nCredit exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to derivative instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized fair value of the asset related to instruments recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. We attempt to mitigate the risk of non-performance by selecting counterparties with high credit ratings and monitoring their creditworthiness and by diversifying derivatives among multiple counterparties. At December 31, 2024, we believe there were no material concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty.\nWe generally enter into master netting agreements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Certain of our derivative agreements also contain credit support provisions that require us or the counterparty to post collateral if there are declines in the derivative fair value or our credit rating. The derivative assets and derivative liabilities are reported at their fair values net of collateral and netting by the counterparty.\nRetirement Benefits:\n We recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the consolidated balance sheets based on fiscal-year-end measurements of plan assets and benefit obligations. Prepaid pension benefits represent prepaid costs related to defined benefit pension plans and are reported with other noncurrent assets. Prepaid postretirement benefits represent prepaid costs related to retiree medical, life, vision and dental benefits and are reported with other noncurrent assets.\nWe determine the expected return on plan assets using the calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the workforce as a component of net periodic benefit cost.\nThe discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. We use the annual spot rate approach for setting our discount rate. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot rates from a full yield curve of published rates are used to discount each plan’s cash flows to determine the plan’s obligations.\nThe assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of other postretirement benefits are based on an initial assumed healthcare cost trend rate declining to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate over a select number of years.\nMedical Claims Payable:\n Liabilities for medical claims payable include estimated provisions for incurred but not paid claims on an undiscounted basis, as well as estimated provisions for expenses related to the processing of claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported; (2) claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems; and (3) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid.\nLiabilities for claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in the aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Our reserving practice for claim liabilities is to consistently recognize the appropriate amount of reserve within a level of confidence required by Actuarial Standards of Practice. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not yet reported or processed claims by following a detailed actuarial process that uses both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period-end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims.\n -80-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nFor the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare trend levels (“trend factors”). \nOn a regular basis, we review cost trends and utilization assumptions set upon initial establishment of claim liabilities. We utilize subsequent paid claims activity to monitor and continuously adjust the claims liability and benefit expense. If actual results are determined to be materially different than assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization, future periods of our income statement and overall financial position could be impacted.\nPremium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims plus administrative expenses will exceed future premiums on existing medical insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. For purposes of evaluating premium deficiencies, contracts are deemed to be either short or long duration and are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. Once established, reserves for premium deficiencies are released commensurate with actual claims experience over the remaining life of the contract. No reserves for premium deficiencies were established at December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nBenefit expense includes incurred medical claims as well as quality improvement expenses for our risk-based members. Quality improvement activities are those designed to improve member health outcomes, prevent hospital readmissions and improve patient safety. They also include expenses for wellness and health promotion provided to our members.\n \nOther Policyholder Liabilities:\n Other policyholder liabilities include rate stabilization reserves associated with retrospectively rated insurance contracts and certain case-specific reserves. Rate stabilization reserves represent accumulated premiums that exceed what customers owe us based on actual claim experience. The timing of payment of these retrospectively rated refunds is based on the contractual terms with our customers and can vary from period to period based on the specific contractual requirements.\nOther policyholder liabilities also include liabilities for premium refunds based upon the minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”). We are required to meet certain minimum MLR thresholds prescribed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended (collectively, the “ACA”). If we do not meet or exceed the minimum MLR thresholds specified by the ACA, we are required to pay rebates to certain customers. Minimum MLR rebates are calculated by subsidiary, state and applicable line of business in accordance with regulations issued by the US Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). Such calculations are made using estimated calendar year medical loss expense and premiums, as defined by HHS.\nWe follow HHS guidelines for determining the types of expenses that may be included in our minimum MLR rebate calculations, which differ from benefit expense and premiums as reported in our consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. Certain amounts reported as expense in our consolidated GAAP financial statements may be reported as a reduction of premiums in accordance with HHS regulations. In addition, profit amounts included in our payments to third-party administrative service providers are recorded as benefit expense in our consolidated GAAP financial statements, while HHS does not allow for the inclusion of these expenses within the medical loss expense for purposes of calculating minimum MLR.\nAlso included are our risk-adjustment payables for certain risk-adjustment programs. The risk-adjustment programs reallocate funds from insurers with lower risk populations to insurers with higher risk populations based on the relative risk scores of participants. We estimate our payable based on the risk of our customers compared to the risk of other customers in the same state and market, considering data obtained from industry studies and HHS. Payables are recorded as adjustments to premium revenue based on our year-to-date experience when the amounts are reasonably estimable and collection is reasonably assured. Final revenue adjustments are determined by HHS in the year following the policy year.\nReserves for Future Policy Benefits:\n Future policy benefits include liabilities for insurance policies for which some of the premiums received in earlier years are intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years. Future policy benefits are continually monitored and reviewed, and when reserves are adjusted, differences are reflected in benefit expense.\n -81-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nWe believe that our liabilities for future policy benefits, along with future premiums received, are adequate to satisfy our ultimate benefit liability; however, these estimates are inherently subject to a number of variable circumstances. Consequently, the actual results could differ materially from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition:\n Premiums for risk-based contracts are recognized as revenue over the period insurance coverage is provided, and, if applicable, net of amounts recognized for MLR rebates, risk adjustment, reinsurance and risk corridor under contractual premium stabilization arrangements, the ACA or other regulatory requirements. Premiums may also include performance incentives and penalties, which are recognized based on contractual terms. We estimate amounts receivable and payable under these contractual terms, and to the extent that such estimated amounts vary from the final amounts paid, the adjustments are included in earnings in the period of final settlement. Premium payments from contracted government agencies are based on eligibility lists produced by the government agencies. Premium payments related to the unexpired contractual coverage periods are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as Unearned income. Premiums include revenue adjustments for retrospectively rated contracts where revenue is based on the estimated loss experience of the contract. Premium rates for certain lines of business are subject to approval by the Department of Insurance of each respective state. Additionally, delays in annual premium rate changes from contracted government agencies require that we defer the recognition of any increases to the period in which the premium rates become final. The value of the impact can be significant in the period in which it is recognized depending on the magnitude of the premium rate increase, the membership to which it applies and the length of the delay between the effective date of the rate increase and the final contract date. Premium rate decreases are recognized in the period the change in premium rate becomes effective and the change in the rate is known, which may be prior to the period when the contract amendment affecting the rate is finalized.\nService fees include revenue from certain group contracts that provide for the group to be at risk for all, or with supplemental insurance arrangements, a portion, of their claims experience. We charge these fee-based groups an administrative fee, which is based on the number of members in a group and the group’s claim experience. In addition, service fees include amounts received for the administration of Medicare, certain other government programs, and administrative services arrangements of our Carelon subsidiaries. Generally, each fee-based arrangement includes services which constitute a single suite of services provided and for which consideration is based upon an agreed-upon rate, regardless of the amount of services provided in a given period. As with premiums, each fee-based arrangement may include terms with retroactive rate or membership adjustments, performance incentives and penalties, each of which is a form of variable consideration within the transaction price. As such, each fee-based arrangement contains a single performance obligation that constitutes a series, and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. All benefit payments under these programs are excluded from benefit expense.\nThe determination of whether services are distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately or combined as one unit of accounting may require significant judgment. The estimation of variable consideration to be recognized requires significant judgment in the determination of the level of achievement of performance incentives, service level achievements subject to performance penalties, and the completion level of tasks subject to implementation fees.\n Product revenue represents services performed by CarelonRx for unaffiliated pharmacy customers and includes ingredient costs (net of any rebates or discounts), including co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, and service fees. Unaffiliated pharmacy customers include our fee-based groups that have contracted with CarelonRx for pharmacy services and third-party health plans. Product revenues and costs of goods sold for our affiliated health plans are eliminated in consolidation, excluding co-payments and subsidies made by or on behalf of affiliated customers. Product revenue for pharmacy services is recognized using the gross method at the negotiated contract price when CarelonRx has concluded that it is the principal, and it controls the services before prescription drugs are transferred to the customer. CarelonRx determined it is the principal due to its contractual rights to design and develop a listing of prescription drugs offered to the customer (formulary management); its control over establishing the pharmacy network available to the customer to have its prescription fulfilled (network management); and its discretion over establishing the pricing for prescription drugs. Overall, control over these activities indicate CarelonRx is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide pharmacy services. CarelonRx recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services provided.\nFor our non-risk-based contracts, we had no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Revenue recognized in 2024 and 2023 from performance obligations related to prior years, such as due to changes in transaction price, was not material. For contracts that \n -82-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nhave an original expected duration of greater than one year, revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to unfulfilled contractual performance obligations and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations is not material.\nCost of Products Sold:\n \nCarelonRx’s cost of products sold includes the cost of prescription drugs dispensed to unaffiliated pharmacy customers (net of rebates or discounts). Cost of products sold includes per-claim administrative fees for prescription fulfillment by its vendor and certain CarelonRx direct costs related to sales and administration of customer contracts.\nShare-Based Compensation:\n Our current compensation philosophy provides for share-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock awards and an employee stock purchase plan. Stock options are granted for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price at least equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant. Restricted stock awards are issued at the fair value of the stock on the grant date. The employee stock purchase plan allows for a purchase price per share which is \n90\n% of the fair value of a share of common stock on the lower of the first or last trading day of the plan quarter. The employee stock purchase plan discount is recognized as compensation expense based on GAAP guidance. All other share-based payments to employees are recognized as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income based on their fair values. Additionally, excess tax benefits, which result from actual tax benefits realized when awards vest or options are exercised exceeding deferred tax benefits previously recognized based on grant date fair value, are recognized as tax benefits in the consolidated statements of income.\nAdvertising and Marketing Costs\n:\n We use print, broadcast and other advertising to promote our products and to develop our corporate image. We market our products through direct marketing activities and an extensive network of independent agents, brokers and retail partnerships for Individual and Medicare customers, and for certain Employer Group risk-based customers with a smaller employee base. Products for our Employer Group risk-based customers with a larger employee base are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer who work with industry specialists from our in-house sales force. In the Individual and Group markets, we offer products through state or federally facilitated marketplaces, or Public Exchanges, and off-exchange products. The cost of advertising and marketing for product promotion is expensed as incurred, while advertising and marketing costs associated with our corporate image are expensed when first aired. Total advertising and marketing expense was $\n540\n, $\n599\n and $\n511\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLeases:\n \nWe lease office space and certain computer and related equipment under noncancelable operating leases. We determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at its inception. We recognize lease liabilities based on the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid by using the lease term, any amounts probable of being owed under any residual value guarantees and the discount rate determined at lease commencement. As our leases do not generally provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental secured borrowing rate commensurate with the underlying lease terms to determine the present value of our lease payments. Our lease liabilities may include amounts for options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We recognize operating right-of-use (“ROU”) assets at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted for prepaid or accrued rent, the remaining balance of any lease incentives and unamortized initial direct costs.\nThe operating lease liabilities are reported in Other current liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities and the related ROU assets are reported in Other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense for our operating leases is calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is reported in operating expense on our consolidated statements of income. For our office space leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components (such as common area maintenance) as a single lease component. We also do not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset for our office space leases whose lease terms, at commencement, are twelve months or less and that do not include a purchase option or option to extend that we are reasonably certain to exercise.\nWe assess our ROU assets for impairment when there are indicators of impairment and compare the carrying amount of the ROU asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the ROU asset, an impairment calculation is performed. An impairment loss is recorded for the difference of the ROU asset’s carrying value that exceeds its estimated discounted cash flows.\n During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $\n17\n, $\n23\n and $\n34\n, respectively, for impairment and abandonment of ROU assets. See Note 18, “Leases,” for additional information about the ROU asset impairment and abandonment charges.\n -83-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nShareholders\n’\n Earnings per Share:\n Earnings per share amounts, on a basic and diluted basis, have been calculated based upon the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period.\nBasic shareholders’ earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted shareholders’ earnings per share may include the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock and convertible debentures, using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance: \nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n (“ASU 2023-07”). The amendments in ASU 2023-07 are intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 is effective for our fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within our fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments are to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements, and upon transition, the significant segment expense categories and amounts disclosed in the prior periods should be based on the significant segment expense categories identified and disclosed in the period of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 did not have an impact on our results of operations or our consolidated cash flows.\nIn November 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-11, \nFinancial Services—Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date and Early Application \n(“ASU 2020-11”). The amendments in ASU 2020-11 changed the effective date and early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-12,\n Financial Services—Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts\n, which was issued in November 2018. The amendments in ASU 2020-11 extended the original effective date by one year to our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. This standard requires us to review cash flow assumptions for our long-duration insurance contracts at least annually and recognize the effect of changes in future cash flow assumptions in net income. This standard also requires us to update discount rate assumptions quarterly and recognize the effect of changes in these assumptions in other comprehensive income. The rate used to discount our reserves for future policy benefits will be based on an estimate of the yield for an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument with a duration profile matching that of our liabilities. In addition, this standard changes the amortization method for deferred acquisition costs. We adopted these amendments on January 1, 2023, using the modified retrospective transition method for changes to the liability for future policy benefits and deferred acquisition costs as of the transition date, January 1, 2021. While the adoption did not have an overall material impact, our prior period financial statements presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been restated to reflect the impacts of our adoption as required by the new standard. An adjustment of $(\n131\n) was made to shareholders’ net income for the year ended December 31, 2022, which include an adjustment to benefit expense of $\n155\n. In addition, the following balance sheet adjustments were made for the year ended December 31, 2022:  $(\n17\n) to total assets; $\n47\n to total liabilities; $\n13\n to accumulated other comprehensive loss; and $(\n64\n) to shareholders’ equity and total equity.\nRecent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted:\n In November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03,\n Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses \n(“ASU 2024-03”). This standard requires additional expense breakdowns in the footnotes for items such as inventory purchases, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. Public companies must also provide a qualitative description of remaining expense amounts not separately disclosed, as well as the definition and total amount of selling expenses. ASU 2024-03 is effective for our fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within our fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2027. The amendments are to be applied either prospectively to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date of the update, or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently evaluating the effects the adoption of ASU 2024-03 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740) \n(“ASU 2023-09”). The amendments in ASU 2023-09 are intended to improve income tax disclosures, primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. ASU 2023-09 is effective for our fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2024. The amendments are to be applied on a prospective basis, although retrospective adoption is permitted. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-09 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n -84-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nIn August 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-05, \nBusiness Combinations—Joint Venture Formations (Subtopic 805-60): Recognition and Initial Measurement \n(“ASU 2023-05”). ASU 2023-05 clarifies existing guidance to reduce diversity in practice and is requiring a joint venture to recognize and initially measure its assets and liabilities using a new basis of accounting, at fair value, upon formation. These amendments are effective prospectively for all joint venture formations with a formation date on or after January 1, 2025. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2023-05 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nThere were no other new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2024 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or financial statement disclosures.\n3. \nBusiness Acquisitions and Divestitures\nCompleted Acquisitions\nOn December 31, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Centers Plan for Healthy Living LLC and Centers for Specialty Care Group IPA, LLC (“Centers”). Centers is a managed long-term care plan that serves New York state Medicaid and dual-eligible Medicaid/Medicare members, enabling adults with long-term care needs and disabilities to live safely and independently in their own home. This acquisition aligns with our strategic plan to grow the Health Benefits segment and leverage industry-leading expertise while serving Medicaid and dual-eligible populations. As of December 31, 2024, the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible net assets acquired based on management's initial estimates of their fair values, of which $\n152\n has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, $\n426\n to indefinite-lived intangible assets and $\n450\n to goodwill. The majority of the goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2024, the initial accounting for the acquisition has not been finalized. The proforma effects of this acquisition for prior periods were not material to our consolidated results of operations.\nOn December 10, 2024, we completed our acquisition of RSV QOZB LTSS, Inc. and certain affiliated entities (“CareBridge”), a value-based healthcare company that manages home and community-based services for Medicaid and dual-eligible members receiving long-term services and support. This acquisition aligns with Carelon Services’ care at home strategy, and our vision to be an innovative, valuable and inclusive healthcare partner by providing care management programs that improve the lives of the people we serve. As of December 31, 2024, the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible net assets acquired based on management's initial estimates of their fair values, of which $\n995\n has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and $\n1,631\n to goodwill. The majority of the goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2024, the initial accounting for the acquisition has not been finalized. The proforma effects of this acquisition for prior periods were not material to our consolidated results of operations.\nOn March 11, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Paragon Healthcare, Inc. (“Paragon”). Paragon, which operates as part of CarelonRx, provides infusion services and injectable therapies through its omnichannel model of ambulatory infusion centers, home infusion pharmacies, and other specialty pharmacy services. This acquisition aligns with our vision to be an innovative, valuable and inclusive healthcare partner by providing care management programs that improve the lives of the people we serve. As of December 31, 2024, the purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible net assets acquired based on management's initial estimates of their fair values, of which $\n411\n has been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and $\n747\n to goodwill. The majority of the goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2024, the initial accounting for the acquisition has not been finalized.

The purchase prices for all business combinations were preliminarily allocated to the tangible and intangible net assets acquired based on management's initial estimates of their fair values. Tangible net assets acquired were $(\n236\n), and intangible assets were $\n5,364\n, of which $\n1,872\n was allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, $\n426\n to indefinite-lived intangible assets, and $\n3,066\n to goodwill. Of these amounts, $\n2,641\n was allocated to our Carelon Services reportable segment, $\n1,594\n was allocated to our CarelonRx reportable segment and $\n1,129\n to our Health Benefits reportable segment. The majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes. As of December 31, 2024, the initial accounting for the acquisitions had not been finalized. Any subsequent adjustments made to the assets acquired or liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result from a purchase price adjustment, or will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill and/or intangible assets acquired. The proforma effects of these acquisitions for prior periods were not material to our consolidated results of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, in total, we completed business combinations for total cash consideration of approximately $\n1,655\n. These acquisitions included BioPlus Parent, LLC and its subsidiaries (“BioPlus”), which were acquired in February 2023. The purchase prices for all business combinations were preliminarily allocated to the tangible and intangible net assets acquired based on management's initial estimates of their fair values, of which $\n820\n was allocated to finite-lived intangible assets and $\n923\n to goodwill. Of these amounts, $\n1,723\n was allocated to our CarelonRx reportable segment and $\n20\n to our Carelon Services reportable segment.

Unaudited pro-forma revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2022, were immaterial. \nDivestitures \nOn April 1, 2024, we completed the sale of our life and disability businesses to StanCorp Financial Group, Inc. (“The Standard”), a provider of financial protection products and services for employers and individuals, which resulted in a gain on sale of business of $\n201\n in the year ended December 31, 2024. Upon closing, we and The Standard entered into a product distribution partnership. The related net assets held for sale for the life and disability businesses divested as of December 31, 2023 and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 were not material.\n4.    \nBusiness Optimization Initiatives\n2023-2024 Business Efficiency Program\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, based on a strategic review of our operations, assets and investments, management implemented the “2023-2024 Business Efficiency Program” to enhance operating efficiency, refine the focus of our investments and optimize our physical footprint. The 2023-2024 Business Efficiency Program included the write-off of certain information technology assets and contract exit costs, a reduction in staff including the relocation of certain job functions, and the impairment of assets associated with the closure or partial closure of data centers and offices. The 2023-2024 Business Efficiency Program was finalized as of December 31, 2024. Cash outlays associated with this program, which primarily relate to the personnel-related costs, are expected to be paid through 2025.\nIn 2024, we incurred $\n268\n of costs towards the 2023-2024 Business Efficiency Program. This included primarily $\n72\n of pre-tax charges for information technology asset write-offs, $\n165\n of pre-tax personnel-related charges for the reduction and/or relocation of staff, which includes severance and related costs primarily determined under our existing severance plans, and $\n31\n of pre-tax charges from asset impairments related to the closure or partial closure of offices, including operating lease-related ROU assets and other property and equipment. \nIn 2023, we incurred $\n752\n of expense, which included $\n468\n of pre-tax charges for information technology assets and contract write-offs related to projects that have been de-prioritized and stopped, $\n230\n of pre-tax personnel-related charges for the reduction and/or relocation of workforce, which includes severance and related costs primarily determined under our existing severance plans, and $\n54\n of pre-tax charges from asset impairments related to the closure or partial closure of data centers and offices, including operating lease-related ROU assets and other property and equipment. \nThese charges in both years were recognized in operating expense in the Corporate & Other segment; see Note 20, “Segment Information.”\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, there were $\n165\n in charges related to employee termination costs under the 2023-2024 Business Efficiency Program, and payments were $\n132\n. During the year ended December 31, 2023, there were $\n230\n in charges related to employee termination costs under the 2023-2024 Business Efficiency Program, and payments were $\n39\n.\n -87-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n5. \nInvestments\nA summary of current and long-term fixed maturity securities, available-for-sale, at December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nCost or\nAmortized\nCost\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nAllowance For Credit Losses\nEstimated\nFair Value\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nFixed maturity securities:\nUnited States Government securities\n$\n1,907\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n85\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n1,824\n \nGovernment sponsored securities\n156\n \n—\n \n(\n5\n)\n—\n \n151\n \nForeign government securities\n19\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n17\n \nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions, tax-exempt\n3,142\n \n33\n \n(\n123\n)\n—\n \n3,052\n \nCorporate securities\n14,095\n \n192\n \n(\n367\n)\n(\n4\n)\n13,916\n \nResidential mortgage-backed securities\n3,274\n \n13\n \n(\n236\n)\n—\n \n3,051\n \nCommercial mortgage-backed securities\n1,801\n \n8\n \n(\n60\n)\n(\n1\n)\n1,748\n \n Other asset-backed securities\n2,534\n \n36\n \n(\n92\n)\n(\n1\n)\n2,477\n \nTotal fixed maturity securities\n$\n26,928\n \n$\n284\n \n$\n(\n970\n)\n$\n(\n6\n)\n$\n26,236\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nFixed maturity securities:\nUnited States Government securities\n$\n1,873\n \n$\n25\n \n$\n(\n54\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n1,844\n \nGovernment sponsored securities\n112\n \n1\n \n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n110\n \nForeign government securities\n5\n \n1\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n4\n \nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions, tax-exempt\n3,985\n \n69\n \n(\n152\n)\n—\n \n3,902\n \nCorporate securities\n14,838\n \n322\n \n(\n580\n)\n(\n2\n)\n14,578\n \nResidential mortgage-backed securities\n4,071\n \n40\n \n(\n279\n)\n—\n \n3,832\n \nCommercial mortgage-backed securities\n2,174\n \n13\n \n(\n138\n)\n(\n2\n)\n2,047\n \nOther asset-backed securities\n4,278\n \n25\n \n(\n130\n)\n—\n \n4,173\n \nTotal fixed maturity securities\n$\n31,336\n \n$\n496\n \n$\n(\n1,338\n)\n$\n(\n4\n)\n$\n30,490\n \nOther asset-backed securities primarily consist of collateralized loan obligations and other debt securities.\n -88-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nFor fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the following table summarizes the aggregate fair values and gross unrealized losses by length of time those securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position.\n \nLess than 12 Months\n12 Months or Greater\n \nNumber of\nSecurities\nEstimated\nFair Value\nGross\nUnrealized\nLoss\nNumber of\nSecurities\nEstimated\nFair Value\nGross\nUnrealized\nLoss\n(Securities are whole amounts)\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDecember 31, 2024\nFixed maturity securities:\nUnited States Government securities\n40\n$\n1,240\n \n$\n(\n52\n)\n25\n$\n330\n \n$\n(\n33\n)\nGovernment sponsored securities\n10\n89\n \n(\n2\n)\n36\n42\n \n(\n3\n)\nForeign government securities\n2\n15\n \n(\n1\n)\n2\n2\n \n(\n1\n)\nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions, tax-exempt\n527\n1,092\n \n(\n22\n)\n661\n943\n \n(\n101\n)\nCorporate securities\n1,415\n4,717\n \n(\n92\n)\n1,317\n2,645\n \n(\n275\n)\nResidential mortgage-backed securities\n306\n1,097\n \n(\n25\n)\n1,312\n1,291\n \n(\n211\n)\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities\n136\n670\n \n(\n15\n)\n297\n661\n \n(\n45\n)\nOther asset-backed securities\n123\n293\n \n(\n9\n)\n236\n735\n \n(\n83\n)\nTotal fixed maturity securities\n2,559\n$\n9,213\n \n$\n(\n218\n)\n3,886\n$\n6,649\n \n$\n(\n752\n)\nDecember 31, 2023\nFixed maturity securities:\nUnited States Government securities\n35\n \n$\n552\n \n$\n(\n9\n)\n44\n \n$\n370\n \n$\n(\n45\n)\nGovernment sponsored securities\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n40\n \n52\n \n(\n3\n)\nForeign government securities\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n4\n \n(\n2\n)\nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions, tax-exempt\n203\n \n354\n \n(\n2\n)\n1,034\n \n1,811\n \n(\n150\n)\nCorporate securities\n389\n \n608\n \n(\n15\n)\n2,624\n \n6,871\n \n(\n565\n)\nResidential mortgage-backed securities\n183\n \n438\n \n(\n5\n)\n1,620\n \n2,075\n \n(\n274\n)\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities\n112\n \n353\n \n(\n6\n)\n534\n \n1,317\n \n(\n132\n)\nOther asset-backed securities\n110\n \n394\n \n(\n18\n)\n761\n \n2,342\n \n(\n112\n)\nTotal fixed maturity securities\n1,032\n \n$\n2,699\n \n$\n(\n55\n)\n6,659\n \n$\n14,842\n \n$\n(\n1,283\n)\nUnrealized losses on our securities shown in the table above have not been recognized into income because, as of December 31, 2024, we do not intend to sell these investments, and it is likely that we will not be required to sell these investments prior to their anticipated recovery.

Dividend income recognized from the financing arrangement during the year ended December 31, 2024 was not material.\nInvestment Income\nThe major categories of net investment income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFixed maturity securities\n$\n1,539\n \n$\n1,387\n \n$\n971\n \nEquity securities\n40\n \n18\n \n48\n \nCash equivalents\n235\n \n305\n \n77\n \nOther invested assets\n274\n \n157\n \n432\n \nInvestment income\n2,088\n \n1,867\n \n1,528\n \nInvestment expenses\n(\n37\n)\n(\n42\n)\n(\n43\n)\nNet investment income\n$\n2,051\n \n$\n1,825\n \n$\n1,485\n \nInvestment (Losses) Gains\nNet investment (losses) gains for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet gains (losses):\nFixed maturity securities:\nGross realized gains from sales\n$\n158\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n52\n \nGross realized losses from sales\n(\n479\n)\n(\n488\n)\n(\n469\n)\nImpairment losses recognized in income\n(\n17\n)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n31\n)\nNet realized losses on fixed maturity securities\n(\n338\n)\n(\n456\n)\n(\n448\n)\nEquity securities:\nUnrealized losses recognized on equity securities still held\n(\n6\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n78\n)\nNet realized (losses) gains recognized on equity securities sold\n(\n9\n)\n6\n \n(\n102\n)\nNet (losses) gains on equity securities\n(\n15\n)\n5\n \n(\n180\n)\nOther investments:\nGross gains\n49\n \n103\n \n96\n \nGross losses\n(\n25\n)\n(\n63\n)\n(\n64\n)\nImpairment losses recognized in income\n(\n126\n)\n(\n291\n)\n(\n34\n)\nNet losses on other investments\n(\n102\n)\n(\n251\n)\n(\n2\n)\nNet losses on investments\n$\n(\n455\n)\n$\n(\n702\n)\n$\n(\n630\n)\nA primary objective in the management of our fixed maturity and equity portfolios is to maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs. In achieving this goal, assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities as well as tax considerations. Sales will generally produce realized gains and losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may sell securities at a loss for a number of reasons, including, but not limited \n -91-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nto: (i) changes in the investment environment; (ii) expectations that the fair value could deteriorate further; (iii) desire to reduce exposure to an issuer or an industry; (iv) changes in credit quality; or (v) changes in expected cash flow.\nTotal proceeds from sales, maturities, calls or redemptions of fixed maturity securities were $\n16,334\n, $\n12,289\n and $\n22,048\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nA significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when a credit loss has occurred. We follow a consistent and systematic process for recognizing impairments on securities that sustain credit declines in value. We have established a committee responsible for the impairment review process. The decision to impair a security incorporates both quantitative criteria and qualitative information. The impairment review process considers a number of factors including, but not limited to: (i) the extent to which the fair value is less than book value, (ii) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) our intent and ability to retain impaired investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, (iv) our intent to sell or the likelihood that we will need to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, (v) whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments, (vi) the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors) and (vii) general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors. When a decision has been made to sell an impaired security or it is more likely than not that the impaired security will be required to be disposed of prior to recovery of its cost basis, the security is written down to fair value at the reporting date. For all other impaired securities, if the impairment is deemed to be credit related, an allowance is created.\nInvestment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and credit. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of investment securities, it is possible that changes in these risk factors in the near term could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or shareholders’ equity.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no individual investments that exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were \nnine\n and \neleven\n, respectively, fixed maturity investments that did not produce income during the years then ended.\nWe had unfunded loan commitments to certain equity investees of $\n1,442\n and $\n1,321\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We do not believe such obligations will materially affect its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had committed approximately $\n423\n and $\n497\n, respectively, to future investments in rated notes.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, securities with carrying values of approximately $\n1,035\n and $\n876\n, respectively, were deposited by our insurance subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities.\nAccrued Investment Income\nAccrued investment income totaled $\n287\n and $\n301\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We recognize accrued investment income under the caption “Other receivables” on our consolidated balance sheets.\nSecurities Lending Programs\nThe fair value of the cash and securities received as collateral for securities loaned at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n2,305\n and $\n2,380\n, respectively. The collateral received was \n102\n% of the market value of the loaned securities at each of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nWe recognize the collateral as an asset under the caption “Other current assets” in our consolidated balance sheets, and we recognize a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to the borrower under the caption “Other current liabilities.” The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on our consolidated balance sheets.\n -92-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the remaining contractual maturities of our securities lending transactions included overnight and continuous transactions of cash for $\n2,115\n and $\n2,255\n, respectively, United States Government securities for $\n176\n and $\n99\n, respectively, and residential mortgage-backed securities for $\n14\n and $\n26\n, respectively.\n6. \nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe primarily invest in the following types of derivative financial instruments: interest rate swaps, futures, forward contracts, put and call options, collars, swaptions, embedded derivatives and warrants. We also enter into master netting agreements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions.

These options, if exercised, will result in our purchase of the units held by the majority owners as early as 2028 but no later than 2030 at a price based on certain multiples of revenue and earnings of Mosaic Health businesses, subject to various adjustments and qualifications. We have calculated the fair value of the net put option, which is a Level III measurement (see Note 7, “Fair Value”), using a Monte Carlo simulation, which relies on assumptions including cash flow projections, risk-free rates, volatility and details specific to the options. Significant changes in assumptions could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurements. The net put option’s fair value liability of $\n1,330\n, which is a non-cash item measured at the date of our initial investment, is included under the caption “Other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024. We have elected to not mark the net put option to market, as it is an option on large blocks of equity securities, and the carrying value of the net put option will remain on the consolidated balance sheets until it is exercised or expires.\nAs discussed in Note 5, “Investments,” in January 2023, we made an equity investment that resulted in our minority interest ownership of Liberty Dental. As part of the Liberty Dental transaction, we entered into a shareholders’ agreement with the majority owners that provides for certain rights and obligations of each party, including certain put and call options. These options could result in our purchase of the units held by the majority owners in 2026 and 2027. We have calculated the fair value of the net put option, which is a Level III measurement (see Note 7, “Fair Value”), using a Monte Carlo simulation, which relies on assumptions, including cash flow projections, risk-free rates, volatility and details specific to the put and call options. Significant changes in assumptions could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurements. The net put option’s fair value liability of $\n85\n determined as of December 31, 2023 is included under the caption “Other noncurrent liabilities” in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. We have elected to not mark the net put option to market, and the carrying value of the net put option will remain on the consolidated balance sheets until it is exercised or expires.\n -96-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n7. \nFair Value\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Level inputs, as defined by FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures, are as follows:\nLevel Input:\n \nInput Definition:\nLevel I\n \nInputs are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurement date.\nLevel II\n \nInputs other than quoted prices included in Level I that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market data at the measurement date.\nLevel III\n \nUnobservable inputs that reflect management’s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\nThe following methods, assumptions and inputs were used to determine the fair value of each class of the following assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets:\nCash equivalents:\n Cash equivalents primarily consist of highly rated money market funds with maturities of three months or less and are purchased daily at par value with specified yield rates. Due to the short-term nature of the funds, we designate all cash equivalents as Level I.\nFixed maturity securities, available-for-sale:\n Fair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value to facilitate fair value measurements and disclosures. Level II securities primarily include corporate securities, securities from states, municipalities and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, United States Government securities, foreign government securities, and certain other asset-backed securities. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. We also have certain fixed maturity securities, primarily collateralized loan obligation securities, rated note securities and corporate debt securities, that are designated Level III securities. For these securities, the valuation methodologies may incorporate broker quotes, net asset value of underlying loans or discounted cash flow analyses using assumptions for inputs such as expected cash flows, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds that are not observable in the markets.\nEquity securities:\n Fair values of equity securities are generally designated as Level I and are based on quoted market prices. For certain equity securities, quoted market prices for the identical security are not always available, and the fair value is estimated by reference to similar securities for which quoted prices are available. These securities are designated Level II. We also have certain equity securities, including private equity securities, for which the fair value is estimated based on each security’s current condition and future cash flow projections. Such securities are designated Level III. The fair values of these private equity securities are generally based on either broker quotes or discounted cash flow projections using assumptions for inputs such as the weighted-average cost of capital, long-term revenue growth rates and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and/or revenue multiples that are not observable in the markets.\nSecurities lending collateral:\n Fair values of securities lending collateral are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value, to facilitate fair value measurements and disclosures.\nDerivatives:\n Fair values are generally based on the quoted market prices by the financial institution that is the counterparty to the derivative transaction. We independently verify prices provided by the counterparties using valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs for similar derivative transactions. These derivatives are designated as Level II securities. Fair values of certain derivatives where market observable inputs are not available are estimated using \n -97-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nassumptions such as cash flow projections, risk-free rates, volatility and details specific to the derivative contract. These derivatives are designated as Level III securities.\nIn addition, the following methods and assumptions were used to determine the fair value of each class of pension benefit plan assets and other benefit plan assets not defined above (see Note 11, “Retirement Benefits,” for fair values of benefit plan assets):\nMutual funds:\n Fair values are based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value (“NAV”) of shares held.\nPartnership investments:\n Fair values are estimated based on the plan’s ownership share of the partnerships’ net assets, as reported in their periodic capital statements, and are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. The partnerships primarily consist of a real estate investment fund which acquires investments in real estate entities, and an energy fund which invests in public and private oil and gas companies principally through privately issued securities.\nCollective investment trusts (“CITs”): \nFair values are based on the NAV of the units held by the plan at year end and are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. The CITs are passive index funds that seek investment results that generally correspond to the performance of the Bloomberg U.S. Intermediate Treasury Index.\nCommingled fund:\n Fair value is based on NAV per fund share and is valued using NAV as a practical expedient. The fund primarily invests in publicly traded equity securities of issuers within the fund’s benchmark.

As disclosed in Note 3, “Business Acquisitions and Divestitures,” we completed our acquisitions of Centers, CareBridge and Paragon in 2024 and BioPlus in 2023. The net assets acquired in these acquisitions and resulting goodwill and other intangible assets were recorded at fair value primarily using Level III inputs. The majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their carrying values as of the respective date of acquisition, as their carrying values approximated their fair values due to \n -100-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\ntheir short-term nature. The fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions of Centers, CareBridge, Paragon and BioPlus were estimated based on the income approach. The income approach estimates fair value based on the present value of the cash flows that the assets could be expected to generate in the future. We developed internal estimates for the expected cash flows and discount rate in the present value calculation.\nAlso, we entered into agreements which included certain put and call options associated with our minority interest ownership of Mosaic Health in 2024 and Liberty Dental in 2023. The resulting net put option liabilities were recorded at their fair values measured at the dates of acquisition using Level III inputs with an election not to mark the derivative to market, which is further discussed and disclosed in Note 6, “Derivatives”. The net put option carrying value for Mosaic Health was $\n1,330\n at December 31, 2024. The net put option fair value for Liberty Dental was $\n543\n and $\n85\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther than the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions of CareBridge, Centers, Paragon and BioPlus and the net put options on Mosaic Health and Liberty Dental described above, there were no material assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nOur valuation policy is determined by members of our treasury and accounting departments. Whenever possible, our policy is to obtain quoted market prices in active markets to estimate fair values for recognition and disclosure purposes. Where quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, broker quotes, unobservable inputs or other valuation techniques. These techniques are significantly affected by our assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. The use of assumptions for unobservable inputs for the determination of fair value involves a level of judgment and uncertainty. Changes in assumptions that reasonably could have been different at the reporting date may result in a higher or lower determination of fair value. Changes in fair value measurements, if significant, may affect performance of cash flows.\nPotential taxes and other transaction costs are not considered in estimating fair values. Our valuation policy is generally to obtain quoted prices for each security from third-party pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. This analysis is performed by our internal treasury personnel who are familiar with our investment portfolios, the pricing services engaged and the valuation techniques and inputs used. Our analysis includes procedures such as a review of month-to-month price fluctuations and price comparisons to secondary pricing services. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nIn addition to the preceding disclosures on assets recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, FASB guidance also requires the disclosure of fair values for certain other financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, whether or not such values are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.\nNon-financial instruments such as property and equipment, other current assets, deferred income taxes, intangible assets and certain financial instruments, such as limited partnerships, joint ventures, other non-controlled corporations, corporate-owned life insurance policies, and policy liabilities, are excluded from the fair value disclosures. Therefore, the fair value amounts cannot be aggregated to determine our underlying economic value.\nThe carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, premium receivables, self-funded receivables, other receivables, unearned income, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and certain other current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. These assets and liabilities are not listed in the table below.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument that is recorded at its carrying value on the consolidated balance sheets:\nOther invested assets\n: Other invested assets primarily include our mortgage loans and notes receivables. Mortgage loans are carried at amortized cost net of loss allowance. The fair value of mortgage loans is measured using discounted cash flows benchmarked against the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield plus a market rate spread. The notes receivables are measured at their amortized cost. The fair value of notes receivables is the present value of discounted future cash flows.\n -101-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nShort-term borrowings\n: The fair value of our short-term borrowings is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt, or if no quoted market prices were available, on the current market interest rates estimated to be available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities.\nLong-term debt—senior unsecured notes and surplus notes\n: The fair values of our notes are based on quoted market prices in active markets for the same or similar debt, or, if no quoted market prices are available, on the current market observable rates estimated to be available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities.\nOptions: \nThe options consist of put, call and purchase price true-up options associated with our equity investment in the Mosaic Health joint venture and the put and call options associated with our equity investment in Liberty Dental. The fair value of the net put option associated with Mosaic Health is based on a Monte Carlo simulation, which relies on assumptions including cash flow projections, risk-free rates, volatility and details specific to the options. The fair value of the net put option associated with Liberty Dental is based on the discounted present value of estimated future option exercise prices.\nA summary of the estimated fair values by level of each class of financial instrument that is recorded at its carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\n \nCarrying\nValue\nEstimated Fair Value\n \nLevel I\nLevel II\nLevel III\nTotal\nDecember 31, 2024\nAssets:\nOther invested assets\n$\n642\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n610\n \n$\n610\n \nLiabilities:\nDebt:\nShort-term borrowings\n365\n \n—\n \n365\n \n—\n \n365\n \nNotes\n30,867\n \n—\n \n28,460\n \n—\n \n28,460\n \nOptions\n1,415\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,873\n \n1,873\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets:\nOther invested assets\n$\n302\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n278\n \n$\n278\n \nLiabilities:\nDebt:\nShort-term borrowings\n225\n \n—\n \n225\n \n—\n \n225\n \nNotes\n24,895\n \n—\n \n23,569\n \n—\n \n23,569\n \nOptions\n85\n \n—\n \n—\n \n85\n \n85\n \n -102-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n8. \nIncome Taxes\nThe components of deferred income taxes at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n2024\n2023\nDeferred income tax assets:\nAccrued expenses\n$\n826\n \n$\n595\n \nBad debt reserves\n434\n \n415\n \nInsurance reserves\n192\n \n178\n \nLease liabilities\n170\n \n172\n \nRetirement liabilities\n126\n \n132\n \nDeferred compensation\n45\n \n44\n \nFederal and state carryforwards\n428\n \n368\n \nForeign (including Puerto Rico) carryforwards\n90\n \n87\n \nOther\n100\n \n166\n \nSubtotal\n2,411\n \n2,157\n \nLess: valuation allowance\n(\n294\n)\n(\n271\n)\nTotal deferred income tax assets\n2,117\n \n1,886\n \nDeferred income tax liabilities:\nU.S. federal and state intangible assets\n2,584\n \n2,043\n \nForeign (including Puerto Rico) intangible assets\n194\n \n330\n \nCapitalized software\n513\n \n485\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n38\n \n81\n \nInvestment basis\n11\n \n11\n \nRetirement assets\n330\n \n319\n \nLease right-of-use assets\n114\n \n110\n \nPrepaid expenses\n275\n \n249\n \nTotal deferred income tax liabilities\n4,059\n \n3,628\n \nNet deferred income tax liabilities\n$\n1,942\n \n$\n1,742\n \n We recognized $\n206\n and $\n228\n of deferred tax asset under the caption “Other noncurrent assets” at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

As a result of these examinations and discussions with taxing agencies, we have recorded amounts for uncertain tax positions. It is anticipated that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to possible settlements of audits and changes in temporary items. However, the ultimate resolution of these items is dependent on the completion of negotiations with various taxing authorities. While it is difficult to determine when other tax settlements will actually occur, it is reasonably possible that one could occur in the next twelve months and our unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced within a range of approximately $\n137\n to $\n475\n.\nWe are a member of the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”). The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations. As of December 31, 2024, the IRS examination of our 2024, 2023 and 2022 tax years continues to be in process.\nIn certain states, we pay premium taxes in lieu of state income taxes. Premium taxes are reported in operating expense.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $\n54\n, of which $\n33\n will expire beginning 2032 through 2044 and $\n21\n have an indefinite carryforward period. State and local net operating loss carryforwards of $\n256\n, of which $\n194\n will expire beginning 2025 through 2044, and $\n62\n have an indefinite carryforward period. Foreign net operating loss carryforward of $\n90\n will expire beginning 2033.\nIncome taxes receivable totaled $\n138\n and $\n543\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Capitalized costs related to the internal development of software of $\n6,363\n and $\n5,870\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are reported with computer software.\nImpairment of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n72\n, $\n446\n, and $\n7\n, respectively, which is included in Operating expenses and primarily related to our activities disclosed in Note 4, “Business Optimization Initiatives.”\n \n10. \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nA summary of the change in the carrying amount of goodwill for our segments (see Note 20, “Segment Information”) for 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nHealth Benefits\nCarelonRx\nCarelon Services\nTotal\nBalance as of January 1, 2023\n$\n22,088\n \n$\n59\n \n$\n2,236\n \n$\n24,383\n \nAcquisitions and adjustments\n16\n \n898\n \n20\n \n934\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n22,104\n \n957\n \n2,256\n \n25,317\n \nAcquisitions and adjustments\n460\n \n958\n \n1,542\n \n2,960\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n22,564\n \n$\n1,915\n \n$\n3,798\n \n$\n28,277\n \nAccumulated impairment as of December 31, 2024\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n106\n)\n$\n(\n106\n)\nAs required by FASB guidance, we completed annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during 2024, 2023 and 2022. We perform these annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter. FASB guidance also requires interim impairment testing to be performed when potential impairment indicators exist. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the estimated fair value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Qualitative testing procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors and entity specific events. For quantitative testing, the fair values are estimated using the projected income and market valuation approaches, incorporating Level III internal estimates for inputs, including, but not limited to, revenue projections, income projections, cash flows and discount rates.\n \nIn 2024, we incurred goodwill impairment losses of $\n106\n in our Carelon Services reporting segment specific to the fair valuation of the CMSI assets included in assets and liabilities held for sale as discussed in Note 5, “Investments.” Otherwise, the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values. \nWe did not incur any impairment losses in 2023 or 2022, as the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values.\n -106-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe components of other intangible assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nCarrying\nAmount\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nCarrying\nAmount\nIntangible assets with finite lives:\nCustomer relationships\n$\n7,866\n \n$\n(\n4,233\n)\n$\n3,633\n \n$\n6,263\n \n$\n(\n3,817\n)\n$\n2,446\n \nProvider and hospital relationships\n377\n \n(\n165\n)\n212\n \n326\n \n(\n164\n)\n162\n \nOther\n423\n \n(\n67\n)\n356\n \n242\n \n(\n44\n)\n198\n \nTotal\n8,666\n \n(\n4,465\n)\n4,201\n \n6,831\n \n(\n4,025\n)\n2,806\n \nIntangible assets with indefinite lives:\nBlue Cross and Blue Shield and other trademarks\n5,991\n \n— \n5,991\n \n5,991\n \n— \n5,991\n \nState Medicaid licenses\n1,902\n \n— \n1,902\n \n1,476\n \n— \n1,476\n \nTotal\n7,893\n \n— \n7,893\n \n7,467\n \n— \n7,467\n \nOther intangible assets\n$\n16,559\n \n$\n(\n4,465\n)\n$\n12,094\n \n$\n14,298\n \n$\n(\n4,025\n)\n$\n10,273\n \nIn 2024, additions to the gross carrying amount of customer relationships primarily relate to the acquisitions of Centers, CareBridge and Paragon. \nIntangible assets with finite lives, along with the related accumulated amortization, are removed from the table above at the end of the fiscal year in which they become fully amortized.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years is as follows: 2025, $\n671\n; 2026, $\n474\n; 2027, $\n428\n; 2028, $\n377\n; and 2029, $\n317\n.\n11. \nRetirement Benefits\nWe sponsor various non-contributory employee defined benefit plans through certain subsidiaries. Future benefit accruals for these plans are frozen, but participants continue to earn interest on existing account balances. We also have a post-retirement health and welfare plan that primarily provides healthcare benefits to certain eligible employees. The majority of the pension and post-retirement plans are over funded. We fund our qualified pension plans at least sufficient to meet minimum amounts required by law. Pension and post-retirement healthcare plan expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third-party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors.\nThe reconciliation of the benefit obligations for the plans is as follows:\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year\n$\n1,393\n \n$\n1,415\n \n$\n255\n \n$\n277\n \nInterest cost\n63\n \n68\n \n12\n \n14\n \nPlan participant contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n16\n \n16\n \nActuarial (gain) loss\n(\n61\n)\n40\n \n(\n10\n)\n(\n12\n)\nSettlements\n(\n27\n)\n(\n27\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n105\n)\n(\n103\n)\n(\n35\n)\n(\n40\n)\nBenefit obligation at end of year\n$\n1,263\n \n$\n1,393\n \n$\n238\n \n$\n255\n \n -107-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows:\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n$\n1,807\n \n$\n1,734\n \n$\n313\n \n$\n299\n \nActual return on plan assets\n83\n \n199\n \n29\n \n42\n \nEmployer contributions\n6\n \n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPlan participant contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n16\n \n16\n \nSettlements\n(\n27\n)\n(\n27\n)\n4\n \n—\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n105\n)\n(\n103\n)\n(\n37\n)\n(\n44\n)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n$\n1,764\n \n$\n1,807\n \n$\n325\n \n$\n313\n \n \nThe amounts included in the consolidated balance sheets are as follows:\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNoncurrent assets\n$\n539\n \n$\n459\n \n$\n87\n \n$\n58\n \nCurrent liabilities\n(\n4\n)\n(\n7\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nNoncurrent liabilities\n(\n34\n)\n(\n38\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nNet amount at end of year\n$\n501\n \n$\n414\n \n$\n87\n \n$\n58\n \nOur estimated future payments for pension benefits and other benefits are as follows: \nPension\nBenefits\nOther\nBenefits\n2025\n$\n128\n \n$\n26\n \n2026\n112\n \n26\n \n2027\n109\n \n25\n \n2028\n106\n \n24\n \n2029\n103\n \n24\n \n2030 - 2034\n472\n \n99\n \n -108-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe components of net periodic benefit credit included in the consolidated statements of income are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPension Benefits\nInterest cost\n$\n63\n \n$\n68\n \n$\n52\n \nExpected return on assets\n(\n117\n)\n(\n127\n)\n(\n101\n)\nRecognized actuarial loss\n14\n \n9\n \n16\n \nSettlement loss\n6\n \n7\n \n28\n \nNet periodic benefit credit\n$\n(\n34\n)\n$\n(\n43\n)\n$\n(\n5\n)\nOther Benefits\nInterest Cost\n$\n12\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n7\n \nExpected return on assets\n(\n22\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n26\n)\nAmortization of prior service credit\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n4\n)\nRecognized actuarial gain\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nNet periodic benefit credit\n$\n(\n12\n)\n$\n(\n9\n)\n$\n(\n23\n)\nThe net amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs are as follows:\n \nPension Benefits\nOther Benefits\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNet actuarial gain (loss)\n$\n(\n580\n)\n$\n(\n625\n)\n$\n55\n \n$\n38\n \nPrior service credit\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \nNet amount before tax at end of year\n$\n(\n580\n)\n$\n(\n625\n)\n$\n55\n \n$\n40\n \nThe pre-tax amounts recognized in other comprehensive loss are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPension Benefits\nNet actuarial gain (loss)  \n$\n25\n \n$\n31\n \n$\n(\n91\n)\nRecognized actuarial loss\n14\n \n9\n \n16\n \nSettlement loss\n6\n \n7\n \n28\n \nTotal pre-tax other comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n45\n \n$\n47\n \n$\n(\n47\n)\nOther Benefits\nNet actuarial gain (loss) \n$\n17\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n(\n32\n)\nRecognized actuarial gain\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nPrior service credit\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n5\n)\nTotal pre-tax other comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n15\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n(\n37\n)\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans was $\n1,262\n and $\n1,391\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nAs of December 31, 2024, certain pension plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.

Liabilities at any period-end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or run out, becomes known. This information is compared to the originally\n \nestablished year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred medical claims related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The prior year redundancy of $\n1,731\n shown above for the year ended December 31, 2024, represents an estimate based on paid claim activity from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a “short tail,” which means that they are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority of the $\n1,731\n redundancy relates to claims incurred in calendar year 2023.\nThe following table provides a summary of the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid liability estimates for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, which are the completion and trend factors. These vital assumptions can be affected by variables such as utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing and submission patterns, and operational changes resulting from business combinations.\n \nFavorable Developments\nby Changes in Key Assumptions\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nAssumed trend factors\n$\n(\n688\n)\n$\n(\n895\n)\n$\n(\n859\n)\nAssumed completion factors\n(\n1,043\n)\n(\n676\n)\n(\n10\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n1,731\n)\n$\n(\n1,571\n)\n$\n(\n869\n)\nThe favorable development recognized in 2024 resulted primarily from completion factors developing more favorably than originally expected as well as a smaller but significant contribution from trend factors in late 2023.\n -114-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe favorable development recognized in 2023 resulted primarily from trend factors in late 2022 developing more favorably than originally expected.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $\n365\n and $\n225\n, respectively, were outstanding under our short-term FHLB borrowings. Outstanding short-term FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2024 had fixed interest rates of \n4.43\n%.\nWe have a senior revolving credit facility (the “\n5\n-Year Facility”) with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. The \n5\n-Year Facility provides credit of up to $\n4,000\n and matures in April 2027. Our ability to borrow under the \n5\n-Year Facility is subject to compliance with certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt-to-capital ratio of not more than \n60\n%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the credit agreement for the \n5\n-Year Facility. As of December 31, 2024, our debt-to-capital ratio, as defined and calculated under the \n5\n-Year Facility, was \n43.0\n%. We do not believe the restrictions contained in our \n5\n-Year Facility covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants under the \n5\n-Year Facility. There were \nno\n amounts outstanding under the \n5\n-Year Facility at any time during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nWe have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $\n4,000\n, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes.

To the extent a plaintiff or plaintiffs in the following cases have specified in their complaint or in other court filings the amount of damages being sought, we have noted those alleged damages in the descriptions below.\nWhere available information indicates that it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings, however, it is difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or reasonably possible. In addition, even where loss is possible or probable or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously identified loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the amount of the possible or probable loss or range of losses in excess of the amount, if any, accrued, for various reasons, including but not limited to some or all of the following: (i) there are novel or unsettled legal issues presented, (ii) the proceedings are in early stages, (iii) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or decertified or the ultimate size and scope of the class, (iv) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (v) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (vi) in many cases, the plaintiffs have not specified damages in their complaint or in court filings. \nWith respect to the cases described below, we contest liability and/or the amount of damages in each matter, and we believe we have meritorious defenses. We do not believe the outcome of any known pending or threatened legal actions or proceedings will, in the aggregate, have a material impact on our financial position. However, unanticipated outcomes do sometimes occur, which could result in liabilities in excess of our accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nIn addition to the lawsuits described below, we are also involved in other pending and threatened litigation of the character incidental to our business and are from time to time involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings (“government actions”). These government actions include routine and special inquiries by and disclosures to state insurance departments, state attorneys general, U.S. Regulatory Agencies, the U.S. \n -119-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nAttorney General and subcommittees of the U.S. Congress. Such government actions could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties, other sanctions and additional rules, regulations or other restrictions on our business operations. Any liability that may result from any one of these government actions individually, or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation\nWe are a defendant in multiple lawsuits that were initially filed in 2012 against the BCBSA and Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees (the “Blue plans”) across the country. Cases filed in twenty-eight states were consolidated into a single, multi-district proceeding captioned \nIn re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation\n that is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (the “Court”). Generally, the suits allege that the BCBSA and the Blue plans have conspired to horizontally allocate geographic markets through license agreements, best efforts rules that limit the percentage of non-Blue revenue of each plan, restrictions on acquisitions, rules governing the BlueCard\n® \nand National Accounts programs and other arrangements in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and related state laws. The cases were brought by two putative nationwide classes of plaintiffs, health plan subscribers and providers.\nThe BCBSA and Blue plans approved a settlement agreement and release with the subscriber plaintiffs (the “Subscriber Settlement Agreement”), which agreement required the Court’s approval to become effective. The Subscriber Settlement Agreement requires the defendants to make a monetary settlement payment and contains certain terms imposing non-monetary obligations including (i) eliminating the “national best efforts” rule in the BCBSA license agreements (which rule limits the percentage of non-Blue revenue permitted for each Blue plan) and (ii) allowing for some large national employers with self-funded benefit plans to request a bid for insurance coverage from a second Blue plan in addition to the local Blue plan. \nIn November 2020, the Court issued an order preliminarily approving the Subscriber Settlement Agreement, following which members of the subscriber class were provided notice of the Subscriber Settlement Agreement and an opportunity to opt out of the class. A small number of subscribers submitted valid opt-outs by the opt-out deadline.\nIn August 2022, the Court issued a final order approving the Subscriber Settlement Agreement (the “Final Approval Order”). The Court amended its Final Approval Order in September 2022, further clarifying the injunctive relief that may be available to subscribers who submitted valid opt-outs\n.\n The ultimate amount paid by us under the Subscriber Settlement Agreement was $\n604\n.\nFour\n notices of appeal of the Final Approval Order were heard by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (the “Eleventh Circuit”) in September 2023, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the Court’s Final Approval Order approving the Subscriber Settlement Agreement in October 2023. Petitions for rehearing were filed by certain appellants in November 2023 and December 2023 and were denied in January 2024. As a result, the Eleventh Circuit issued a mandate terminating the jurisdiction of the Eleventh Circuit in February 2024. In March 2024, Home Depot, one of the appellants, filed a petition for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court (the “Supreme Court”). On the respondents' request, the Supreme Court granted an extension to respond until May 2024. In April 2024, David Behenna, another appellant, filed a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court, and the defendants and the subscriber plaintiffs filed briefs in opposition in May 2024. In June 2024, the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari, exhausting all appellate rights. The Subscriber Settlement Agreement and the defendants' payment and non-monetary obligations under the Subscriber Settlement Agreement became effective in June 2024, with the request for second Blue plan bid provisions effective in September \n2024. T\nhe funds held in escrow will be distributed in accordance with the Subscriber Settlement Agreement. \nA number of follow-on cases involving entities that opted out of the Subscriber Settlement Agreement have been filed. Those actions are: \nAlaska Air Group, Inc., et al. v. Anthem, Inc., et al.,\n No. 2:21-cv-01209-AMM (N.D. Ala.) \n(“Alaska Air”)\n; \nJetBlue Airways Corp., et al. v. Anthem, Inc., et al.\n, No. 2:22-cv-00558-GMB (N.D. Ala.) \n(“Jet Blue”)\n; \nMetropolitan Transportation Authority v. Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama et al.\n, No. 2:22-cv-00265-RDP (N.D. Ala.) (dismissed without prejudice in June 2023); \nBed Bath & Beyond Inc. v. Anthem, Inc.\n, No. 2:22-cv-01256-SGC (N.D. Ala.);\n Hoover, et al. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, et al.\n, No. 2:22-cv-00261-RDP (N.D. Ala.); and \nVHS Liquidating Trust v. Blue Cross of California, et al.\n, No. RG21106600 (Cal. Super.) \n(“VHS”)\n. In February 2023, the Court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss based on a statute of limitations defense in \nAlaska Air \nand \nJet Blue\n. In September 2023, the California court presiding over the \nVHS \ncase, upheld its prior order granting in part defendants’ motion to strike based on the statute of \n -120-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nlimitations.\n \nWe intend to continue to vigorously defend these follow-on cases, which we believe are without merit; however, their ultimate outcome cannot be presently determined.\nIn October 2020, after the Court lifted the stay as to the provider litigation, provider plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification, which defendants opposed. In March 2021, the Court issued an order terminating the pending motion for class certification until the Court determined the standard of review applicable to the providers’ claims. In response to that order, the parties filed renewed standard of review motions, and in June 2021, the parties filed summary judgment motions not critically dependent on class certification. In February 2022, the Court issued orders (i) granting certain defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment against the provider plaintiffs who had previously released claims against such defendants, and (ii) granting the provider plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment, determining that \nOhio v. American Express Co\n. does not affect the standard of review in this case. In August 2022, the Court issued orders (i) granting in part the defendants’ motion regarding the antitrust standard of review, holding that for the period of time after the elimination of the “national best efforts” rule, the rule of reason applies to the provider plaintiffs’ market allocation conspiracy claims, and (ii) denying the provider plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment on the standard of review, reaffirming its prior holding that the provider groups’ boycott claims are subject to the rule of reason. In December 2023, the Court denied defendants’ motion for summary judgment on providers’ damage claims as time-barred and speculative and provider plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment on the defendants’ single entity defense due to the existence of genuine issues of material fact. In January 2024, the Court issued orders (i) denying defendants’ motion for summary judgment on (a) all claims by certain hospital providers and (b) any claims based on the Blue system's rules other than exclusive serviced areas or BlueCard and (ii) denying provider plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment on defendants’ common law trademark claims. \nIn the third quarter of 2024, the BCBSA, along with the individually named Blue plans approved a settlement agreement and release (the “Provider Settlement Agreement”) with the provider plaintiffs, and in October 2024 the provider plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval with the Court. The Court granted preliminary approval of the provider settlement on December 4, 2024. If finally approved by the Court, the Provider Settlement Agreement will require the defendants to make a monetary settlement payment, our portion of which is estimated to be $\n666\n, and will contain certain non-monetary terms including (i) expansion of certain opportunities to contract with providers in contiguous service areas, (ii) certain prompt pay commitments, and (iii) various technological enhancements to the BlueCard program. We recognized our estimated payment obligation under the Provider Settlement Agreement of $\n666\n in September 2024. We recognized this estimated payment obligation as operating expense in the Corporate & Other segment (see Note 20, “Segment Information”).\nExpress Scripts, Inc. Pharmacy Benefit Management Litigation\nIn March 2016, we filed a lawsuit against Express Scripts, Inc. (“Express Scripts”), our vendor at the time for pharmacy benefit management services, captioned \nAnthem, Inc. v. Express Scripts, Inc.\n, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “District Court”). The lawsuit sought to recover over $\n14,800\n in damages for pharmacy pricing that is higher than competitive benchmark pricing under the agreement between the parties (the “ESI Agreement”), over $\n158\n in damages related to operational breaches, as well as various declarations under the ESI Agreement, including that Express Scripts: (i) breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith and to agree in writing to new pricing terms (the “Pricing Claim”); (ii) was required to provide competitive benchmark pricing to us through the term of the ESI Agreement; (iii) has breached the ESI Agreement; and (iv) is required under the ESI Agreement to provide post-termination services, at competitive benchmark pricing, for one year following any termination. \nExpress Scripts disputed our contractual claims and it sought declaratory judgments: (i) regarding the timing of the periodic pricing review under the ESI Agreement, and (ii) that it has no obligation to ensure that we receive any specific level of pricing, that we have no contractual right to any change in pricing under the ESI Agreement and that its sole obligation is to negotiate proposed pricing terms in good faith. In the alternative, Express Scripts claimed that we have been unjustly enriched by its payment of $\n4,675\n at the time we entered into the ESI Agreement. In March 2017, the District Court granted our motion to dismiss Express Scripts’ counterclaims for (i) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (ii) unjust enrichment with prejudice. After such ruling, Express Scripts’ only remaining claims were for breach of contract and declaratory relief. In August 2021, Express Scripts filed a motion for summary judgment, which we opposed. In March 2022, the District Court granted in part and denied in part Express Scripts’ motion for summary judgment. The District Court dismissed our declaratory judgment claim, our breach of contract claim for failure to prove damages and most of our operational breach claims. As a result of the summary judgment decision, only two claims remained. Express Scripts filed a second motion for summary judgment in June 2022, challenging our remaining operational breach claims, which the \n -121-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nDistrict Court denied in March 2023. In November 2023, the District Court issued a final judgment ending the lawsuit in the District Court after the parties settled and stipulated to dismiss the only remaining claim that had not been disposed of by the court order or stipulation. In December 2023, we filed a notice of appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the “Second Circuit”), regarding the Pricing Claim. Mediation ordered by the Second Circuit occurred in March 2024 and was unsuccessful. Oral argument before the Second Circuit was held in October 2024. In November 2024, the Court affirmed the trial court's decision dismissing the case. A motion for rehearing was submitted which was denied. The matter is now closed.\nMedicare Risk Adjustment Litigation\nIn March 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a civil lawsuit against Elevance Health, Inc. in the District Court in a case captioned \nUnited States v. Anthem, Inc\n. The DOJ’s suit alleges, among other things, that we falsely certified the accuracy of the diagnosis data we submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) for risk-adjustment purposes under Medicare Part C and knowingly failed to delete inaccurate diagnosis codes. The DOJ further alleges that, as a result of these purported acts, we caused CMS to calculate the risk-adjustment payments based on inaccurate diagnosis information, which enabled us to obtain unspecified amounts of payments in Medicare funds in violation of the False Claims Act. The DOJ filed an amended complaint in July 2020, alleging the same causes of action but revising some of its factual allegations. In September 2020, we filed a motion to transfer the lawsuit to the Southern District of Ohio, a motion to dismiss part of the lawsuit, and a motion to strike certain allegations in the amended complaint, all of which the District Court denied in October 2022. In November 2022, we filed an answer. In March 2023, discovery commenced, and an initial case management conference was held in April 2023. Fact discovery is ongoing. In December 2024, the District Court issued a scheduling order setting the deadlines for the completion of fact discovery in August 2025 and April 2026 for the completion of expert discovery. We intend to continue to vigorously defend this suit, which we believe is without merit; however, the ultimate outcome cannot be presently determined.\nOther Contingencies\nFrom time to time, we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, many of which involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business. We, like Health Maintenance Organizations (“HMOs”) and health insurers generally, exclude certain healthcare and other services from coverage under our HMO, Preferred Provider Organizations and other plans. We are, in the ordinary course of business, subject to the claims of our enrollees arising out of decisions to restrict or deny reimbursement for uncovered services. The loss of even one such claim, if it results in a significant punitive damage award, could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, the risk of potential liability under punitive damage theories may increase significantly the difficulty of obtaining reasonable reimbursement of coverage claims. \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nIn September 2024, we extended our agreement with a vendor for information technology infrastructure and related management and support services through June 2029. Our remaining commitment under this agreement is approximately $\n2,065\n. We have the ability to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, subject to early termination fees.\nCarelonRx markets and offers pharmacy services to our affiliated health plan customers throughout the country, as well as to customers outside of the health plans we own. The comprehensive pharmacy services portfolio includes all core pharmacy services, such as home delivery and specialty pharmacies, claims adjudication, formulary management, pharmacy networks, rebate administration, a prescription drug database and member services. CarelonRx delegates certain core pharmacy services to CVS, pursuant to the CVS Agreement, with the current contractual term extending through December 31, 2027. We can elect to have CVS continue to provide services to us for a \nthree-year\n extension period on the same terms and conditions as in the current CVS Agreement in the event of a termination or non-renewal by either party.\nWe have financial guarantees related to standby letters of credit and surety bonds related to certain contractual commitments which totaled $\n912\n as of December 31, 2024. We do not believe such obligations will materially affect its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\n -122-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe Company has unfunded loan commitments to certain equity investees of $\n501\n at December 31, 2024. The Company does not believe such obligations will materially affect its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. \nVulnerability from Concentrations\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investment securities, premium receivables and instruments held through hedging activities. All investment securities are managed by professional investment managers within policies authorized by our Board of Directors. Such policies limit the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and prescribe certain investee company criteria. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to premium receivables are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base in the states in which we conduct business. As of December 31, 2024, there were no significant concentrations of financial instruments in a single investee, industry or geographic location.\n15. \nCapital Stock\nStock Incentive Plan\ns\nOur Board of Directors has adopted the 2017 Elevance Health Incentive Compensation Plan (the “2017 Incentive Plan”) which has been approved by our shareholders. The term of the 2017 Incentive Plan is such that no awards may be granted on or after May 18, 2027. The 2017 Incentive Plan gives authority to the Compensation and Talent Committee of the Board of Directors to make incentive awards to our non-employee directors, employees and consultants, consisting of stock options, stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, cash-based awards, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and performance units. The 2017 Incentive Plan limits the number of available shares for issuance to \n37.5\n shares, subject to adjustment as set forth in the 2017 Incentive Plan.\nStock options are granted for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price at least equal to the fair value of the shares at the grant date. Stock options vest over \nthree years\n in equal annual installments and generally have a term of \nten years\n from the grant date.\nCertain option grants contain provisions whereby the employee continues to vest in the award subsequent to termination due to retirement. Our attribution method for newly granted awards considers all vesting and other provisions, including retirement eligibility, in determining the requisite service period over which the fair value of the awards will be recognized.\nAwards of restricted stock or restricted stock units are issued at the fair value of the stock on the grant date and may also include one or more performance measures that must be met for the award to vest. For restricted stock or restricted stock units without performance measures, the restrictions lapse in three equal annual installments. Restricted stock or restricted stock units with performance measures vest in \nthree-year\n installments. Performance units issued in 2024 will vest in 2027, based on certain revenue and earnings targets over the \nthree-year\n period of 2024 to 2026. Performance units issued in 2023 will vest in 2026, based on certain revenue and earnings targets over the \nthree-year\n period of 2023 to 2025. Performance units issued in 2022 will vest in 2025, based on certain revenue and earnings targets over the \nthree-year\n period of 2022 to 2024.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized share-based compensation expense of $\n191\n, $\n289\n and $\n264\n, respectively, as well as related tax benefits of $\n47\n, $\n73\n and $\n66\n, respectively. \nA summary of stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:\nNumber of\nShares\nWeighted-Average\nOption Price \nper Share\nWeighted-Average\nRemaining\nContractual Life\n(Years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024\n3.0\n \n$\n327.14\n \nGranted\n0.5\n \n499.52\n \nExercised\n(\n0.5\n)\n286.33\n \nForfeited or expired\n(\n0.1\n)\n459.14\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n2.9\n \n361.36\n \n5.58\n$\n166\n \nExercisable at December 31, 2024\n1.9\n \n300.24\n \n4.41\n$\n166\n \n -123-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 amounted to $\n123\n, $\n69\n and $\n120\n, respectively. We recognized tax benefits of $\n21\n, $\n18\n and $\n31\n during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, from option exercises and disqualifying dispositions. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we received cash of $\n154\n, $\n87\n and $\n120\n, respectively, from exercises of stock options.\nThe total fair value of restricted stock awards that vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n298\n, $\n285\n and $\n261\n, respectively.\nA summary of the status of nonvested restricted stock activity, including restricted stock units and performance units, for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:\nRestricted\nStock Shares\nand Units\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nper Share\nNonvested at January 1, 2024\n1.1\n \n$\n423.94\n \nGranted\n0.6\n \n501.78\n \nVested\n(\n0.6\n)\n358.21\n \nForfeited\n(\n0.1\n)\n479.40\n \nNonvested at December 31, 2024\n1.0\n \n478.70\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we granted approximately \n0.2\n restricted stock units that are contingent upon us achieving certain revenue and earnings targets over the \nthree-year\n period of 2024 to 2026. These grants have been included in the activity shown above, but will be subject to adjustment at the end of 2026, based on results in the three-year period.\n As of December 31, 2024, the total remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options and restricted stock, including restricted stock units and performance units, amounted to $\n37\n and $\n203\n, respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods of \n9\n months and \n13\n months, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were approximately \n10.2\n shares of common stock available for future grants under the 2017 Incentive Plan.\n \nFair Value\nWe use a binomial lattice valuation model to estimate the fair value of all stock options granted. Expected volatility assumptions used in the binomial lattice model are based on an analysis of implied volatility of publicly traded options on our stock and historical volatility of our stock price. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury strip rates at the time of the grant. The expected term of the options was derived from the outputs of the binomial lattice model, which incorporates post-vesting forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The dividend yield was based on our estimate of future dividend yields. Similar groups of employees that have dissimilar exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. We utilize the multiple-grant approach for recognizing compensation expense associated with each separately vesting portion of the share-based award.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.28\n \n%\n3.95\n \n%\n1.97\n \n%\nVolatility factor\n28.00\n \n%\n29.00\n \n%\n29.00\n \n%\nDividend yield (annual)\n1.31\n \n%\n1.30\n \n%\n1.10\n \n%\nWeighted-average expected life (years)\n4.40\n4.40\n5.10\n -124-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe following weighted-average fair values per share were determined for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOptions granted during the year\n$\n134.61\n \n$\n126.90\n \n$\n116.92\n \nRestricted stock awards granted during the year\n501.78\n \n467.79\n \n453.70\n \nThe binomial lattice option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because our stock option grants have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in our opinion, existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our stock option grants.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have registered \n14.0\n shares of common stock for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”), which is intended to provide a means to encourage and assist employees in acquiring a stock ownership interest in Elevance Health. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Plan, an eligible employee is permitted to purchase no more than $\n25,000\n (actual dollars) worth of stock in any calendar year, based on the fair value of the stock at the end of each plan quarter. Employees become participants by electing payroll deductions from \n1\n% to \n15\n% of gross compensation. Once purchased, the stock is accumulated in the employee’s investment account. The Stock Purchase Plan allows participants to purchase shares of our common stock at a discounted price per share of \n90\n% of the fair value of a share of common stock on the lower of the first or last trading day of the plan quarter purchase period. The Stock Purchase Plan discount was recognized as compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2024, based on GAAP guidance. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we issued \n0.2\n, \n0.1\n and \n0.1\n shares, respectively, under the Stock Purchase Plan, and we received cash of $\n65\n, $\n65\n and $\n62\n, respectively, for such shares. As of December 31, 2024, \n4.0\n shares were available for issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan.\nUse of Capital and Stock Repurchase Program\nWe regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. \nA summary of the cash dividend activity for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nDeclaration Date\nRecord Date\nPayment Date\nCash Dividend \nper Share\nTotal\nYear ended December 31, 2024\nJanuary 23, 2024\nMarch 8, 2024\nMarch 22, 2024\n$\n1.63\n \n$\n379\n \nApril 16, 2024\nJune 10, 2024\nJune 25, 2024\n1.63\n \n378\n \nJuly 16, 2024\nSeptember 10, 2024\nSeptember 25, 2024\n1.63\n \n378\n \nOctober 15, 2024\nDecember 5, 2024\nDecember 20, 2024\n1.63\n \n373\n \nYear ended December 31, 2023\nJanuary 24, 2023\nMarch 10, 2023\nMarch 24, 2023\n$\n1.48\n \n$\n351\n \nApril 18, 2023\nJune 9, 2023\nJune 23, 2023\n1.48\n \n350\n \nJuly 18, 2023\nSeptember 8, 2023\nSeptember 22, 2023\n1.48\n \n348\n \nOctober 17, 2023\nDecember 6, 2023\nDecember 21, 2023\n1.48\n \n346\n \nOn January 22, 2025, our Audit Committee declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $\n1.71\n per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 25, 2025 to the shareholders of record as of March 10, 2025.\n -125-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nUnder our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. On October 15, 2024, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized an $\n8,000\n increase to the common stock repurchase program. No duration has been placed on our common stock repurchase program, and we reserve the right to discontinue the program at any time. We intend to utilize this authorization over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are affected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary, as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares under the program when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. The excess cost of the repurchased shares over par value is charged on a pro rata basis to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.\nA summary of common stock repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31\n \n2024\n2023\nShares repurchased\n6.7\n \n5.8\n \nAverage price per share\n$\n435.32\n \n$\n463.53\n \nAggregate cost\n$\n2,900\n \n$\n2,676\n \nAuthorization remaining at end of year\n$\n9,300\n \n$\n4,200\n \nWe expect to utilize the remaining authorized amount over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions.\nFor additional information regarding the use of capital for debt security repurchases, see Note 13, “Debt.”\n -126-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n16. \nAccumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nA reconciliation of the components of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet unrealized investment gains:\nBeginning of year balance\n$\n(\n632\n)\n$\n(\n1,755\n)\n$\n494\n \nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications, net of tax benefit (expense)  of $\n44\n, $(\n218\n), and $\n926\n, respectively\n(\n153\n)\n760\n \n(\n2,614\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax expense of $(\n82\n), $(\n113\n), and $(\n94\n), respectively\n256\n \n357\n \n354\n \nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n103\n \n1,117\n \n(\n2,260\n)\nOther comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax benefit (expense) of $\n1\n, $\n1\n, and $(\n3\n), respectively\n6\n \n6\n \n11\n \nEnd of year balance\n(\n523\n)\n(\n632\n)\n(\n1,755\n)\nNon-credit components of impairments on investments:\nBeginning of year balance\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax expense of $(\n1\n), $\n0\n, and $\n0\n, respectively\n1\n \n—\n \n(\n3\n)\nEnd of year balance\n(\n2\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nNet cash flow hedges:\nBeginning of year balance\n(\n211\n)\n(\n229\n)\n(\n239\n)\nOther comprehensive income, net of tax benefit (expense) of $(\n4\n), $\n6\n, and $(\n6\n), respectively\n4\n \n18\n \n10\n \nEnd of year balance\n(\n207\n)\n(\n211\n)\n(\n229\n)\nPension and other benefits:\nBeginning of year balance\n(\n459\n)\n(\n499\n)\n(\n429\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax expense of $\n0\n, $(\n39\n), and $(\n23\n), respectively\n60\n \n40\n \n(\n70\n)\nEnd of year balance\n(\n399\n)\n(\n459\n)\n(\n499\n)\nFuture policy benefits:\nBeginning of year balance\n10\n \n13\n \n(\n19\n)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income, net of tax benefit (expense) of $\n1\n, $\n1\n, and $(\n10\n), respectively\n(\n2\n)\n(\n3\n)\n32\n \nEnd of year balance\n8\n \n10\n \n13\n \nForeign currency translation adjustments:\nBeginning of year balance\n(\n18\n)\n(\n17\n)\n(\n4\n)\nOther comprehensive loss, net of tax benefit of $\n0\n, $\n1\n, and $\n6\n(\n6\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n13\n)\nEnd of year balance\n(\n24\n)\n(\n18\n)\n(\n17\n)\nTotal:\nTotal beginning of year accumulated other comprehensive loss\n(\n1,313\n)\n(\n2,490\n)\n(\n197\n)\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax benefit (expense) of $(\n42\n), $(\n362\n), and $\n799\n, respectively\n160\n \n1,171\n \n(\n2,304\n)\nTotal other comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests, net of tax benefit (expense) of $\n1\n, $\n1\n, and $(\n3\n), respectively\n6\n \n6\n \n11\n \nTotal end of year accumulated other comprehensive loss\n$\n(\n1,147\n)\n$\n(\n1,313\n)\n$\n(\n2,490\n)\n -127-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n17. \nReinsurance\nWe reinsure certain risks with other companies and assume risk from other companies.

Contingent restricted stock units are excluded from the denominator for diluted shareholders’ earnings per share and are included only if and when the contingency is met. The 2024 contingent restricted stock units are being measured over the \nthree-year\n period of 2024 through 2026, the 2023 contingent restricted stock units are being measured over the \nthree-year\n period of 2023 through 2025 and the 2022 contingent restricted stock units are being measured over the \nthree year\n period of 2022 through 2024. Contingent restricted stock units generally vest in March of the year following each measurement period.\n20. \nSegment Information\nWe report our results of operations in the following \nfour\n reportable segments: Health Benefits, CarelonRx, Carelon Services and Corporate & Other. An immaterial amount of our total consolidated revenues is derived from activities outside of the U.S. and Puerto Rico.\nOur Health Benefits segment offers a comprehensive suite of health plans and services to our Individual, Employer Group risk-based, Employer Group fee-based, BlueCard®, Medicare, Medicaid and FEP\n®\n members. The Health Benefits segment offers health products on a full-risk basis; provides a broad array of administrative managed care services to our fee-based customers; and provides a variety of specialty and other insurance products and services such as stop loss, dental, vision and supplemental health insurance benefits.\nOur CarelonRx segment includes our pharmacy services business. CarelonRx markets and offers pharmacy services to our affiliated health plan customers, as well as to external customers outside of the health plans we own. CarelonRx offers a comprehensive pharmacy services portfolio, which includes all core pharmacy services, such as home delivery and specialty pharmacies, claims adjudication, formulary management, pharmacy networks, rebate administration, a prescription drug database and member services, as well as infusion services and injectable therapies.\nOur Carelon Services segment integrates physical, behavioral, pharmacy, and social services with the aim of delivering whole health affordably by offering a broad array of healthcare related services and capabilities to internal and external customers through our Carelon Health and Carelon Insights businesses. Carelon promotes affordability by managing complex areas of the healthcare system, leveraging data and insights to ensure members receive safe, appropriate, high-quality care and providers are reimbursed accurately and timely. Our approach to cost management relies on capabilities including provider enablement, value-based networks, member engagement, and utilization management. Our care delivery services primarily target serving chronic and complex populations by providing personalized care in the home and virtually. As a part of Carelon Health, we completed our acquisition of CareBridge at the end of 2024, which provides virtual care to complex Medicaid and Medicare patients and supports plans in managing home and community-based services.\nOur Corporate & Other segment includes our businesses \nthat do not individually meet the quantitative threshold for an operating segment, as well as corporate expenses not allocated to our other reportable segments.\n We define operating revenues to include premiums, product revenue and service fees. Operating revenues are derived from premiums and fees received, primarily from the sale and administration of health benefits and pharmacy products and services. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and operating expense.\nAffiliated operating revenues represent revenues or costs for services provided to our subsidiaries by CarelonRx and Carelon Services, in addition to certain administrative and other services provided by our international businesses, which are recorded at cost or management’s estimate of fair market value. These affiliated operating revenues are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. For segment reporting, we present all capitation risk arrangements on a gross basis; therefore, eliminations also include adjustments for capitated risk arrangements that are recognized on a net basis under GAAP. \nThrough our participation in various federal government programs, we generated approximately \n31\n%, \n29\n% and \n28\n% of our total consolidated revenues from agencies of the U.S. government for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The majority of these revenues are contained in our Health Benefits segment. \n -130-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” except that all capitation risk arrangements are reported on a gross basis with an adjustment included in eliminations for capitated risk arrangements that are presented on a net basis under GAAP. \nOur chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) is our Chief Executive Officer. The CODM assesses the performance of our reportable segments based on operating gain or loss as defined above. The CODM evaluates net investment income, net gains (losses) on financial instruments, interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, income taxes and assets, liabilities and equity on a consolidated basis, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of segment operating management.\nThe CODM uses operating gain or loss, developed during the annual budget process, and updated during the periodic forecasting process, as a basis to assess performance and allocate operating and capital resources to each segment. \nFinancial data by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 is as follows:\n -131-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nCarelon\nHealth \nBenefits\nCarelonRx\nCarelon \nServices\nTotal\nCorporate \n& Other\nEliminations\nTotal\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nPremiums\n$\n142,668\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,630\n \n$\n2,630\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n1,132\n)\n$\n144,166\n \nProduct revenue\n—\n \n22,630\n \n—\n \n22,630\n \n—\n \n—\n \n22,630\n \nService fees\n7,607\n \n5\n \n790\n \n795\n \n6\n \n—\n \n8,408\n \nOperating revenue -

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, in the normal course of business, we assumed premiums of $\n490\n, $\n481\n and $\n501\n, respectively, from APC Passe, LLC, which is included in our total assumed premiums (see Note 17, “Reinsurance”).\nIn January 2023, we made an equity investment that resulted in our minority interest ownership of Liberty Dental. During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, in the normal course of business, Liberty Dental provided administrative services to our Medicare Advantage members under a capitated arrangement amounting to $\n519\n and $\n426\n, respectively, reported in benefit expense.\n22. \nStatutory Information\nThe majority of our insurance and HMO subsidiaries report their accounts in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by state insurance regulatory authorities, commonly referred to as statutory accounting, which vary in certain respects from GAAP. However, certain of our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including Blue Cross of California, Blue Cross of California Partnership Plan, Inc., Carelon Behavioral Health of California, Inc. and Carelon Health of California, Inc. are regulated by the California Department of Managed Health Care (“DMHC”) and report their accounts in conformity with GAAP (these entities are collectively referred to as the “DMHC regulated entities”). Typical differences of GAAP reporting as compared to statutory reporting are the recognition of all assets including those that are non-admitted for statutory purposes and recognition of all deferred tax assets without regard to statutory limits. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) developed a codified version of the statutory accounting principles, designed to foster more consistency among the states for accounting guidelines and reporting. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in a variety of publications of the NAIC as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules.\nOur statutory basis insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. RBC is a method developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company or HMO to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The formula for determining the amount of RBC specifies various factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity. Below minimum RBC requirements are classified within certain levels, each of \n -133-\nElevance Health, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nwhich requires specified corrective action. Additionally, the DMHC regulated entities are subject to capital and solvency requirements as prescribed by the DMHC. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, all of our regulated subsidiaries exceeded the minimum applicable mandatory RBC requirements and/or capital and solvency requirements of their applicable governmental regulator.\nThe statutory RBC necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of our statutory basis insurance and HMO subsidiaries was approximately $\n8,100\n and $\n7,800\n as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The tangible net equity required for the DMHC regulated entities was approximately $\n970\n and $\n950\n as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Statutory-basis capital and surplus of our insurance and HMO subsidiaries and capital and surplus of our other regulated subsidiaries, excluding the DMHC regulated entities, was $\n18,668\n and $\n19,808\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. GAAP equity of the DMHC regulated entities was $\n3,817\n and $\n3,975\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur ability to pay dividends and credit obligations is significantly dependent on receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries. The payment of dividends to us by our insurance and HMO subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance departments of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective state insurance departments or the DMHC. During 2024, our insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid aggregate cash dividends of $\n6,322\n to the parent company, including cash dividends which required prior approval from regulatory authorities. We currently estimate that approximately $\n2,700\n of dividends will be paid to the parent company in 2025.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nThere have been no changes in or disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting or financial disclosures.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation as of December 31, 2024, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us (including our consolidated subsidiaries) required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act. In addition, based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n \nManagement, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of Elevance Health, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (“Internal Control”), as such term is defined in the Exchange Act. The Company’s Internal Control is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s Internal Control includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n -134-\nBecause of inherent limitations in any Internal Control, no matter how well designed, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, even effective Internal Control can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Control as of December 31, 2024. Management’s assessment was based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nThe Company completed its acquisitions of Paragon Healthcare, Inc., Centers Plan for Healthy Living LLC, Centers for Specialty Care Group IPA, LLC, and RSV QOZB LTSS, Inc. and certain of its affiliated entities in 2024. As permitted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, management's assessment as of December 31, 2024 did not include the Internal Control of these acquired entities, which are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024. Such operations of Paragon Healthcare, Inc., Centers Plan for Health Living LLC, Centers for Specialty Care Group IPA, LLC, and RSV QOZB LTSS, Inc. and certain of its affiliated entities constituted 5% of the Company's total assets and 11% of the Company's net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and 1% of the Company's total revenues and 0% of the Company's net income, respectively, for the year then ended. \nBased on management’s assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s Internal Control was effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nErnst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2024, and has also issued an audit report dated February 20, 2025, on the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Control as of December 31, 2024, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n/\nS\n/    G\nAIL\n K.

In our opinion, Elevance Health, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Paragon Healthcare, Inc., Centers Plan for Healthy Living LLC, Centers for Specialty Care Group IPA, LLC, and RSV QOZB LTSS, Inc. and certain affiliated entities, which are included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 5% and 11% of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and 1% and 0% of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Paragon Healthcare, Inc., Centers Plan for Healthy Living LLC, Centers for Specialty Care Group IPA, LLC, and RSV QOZB LTSS, Inc. and certain affiliated entities.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Elevance Health, Inc. as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c) and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/    Ernst & Young LLP\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nFebruary 20, 2025\n -136-\nITEM 9B.
