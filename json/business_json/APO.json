    "item1": "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Asset Management Business—\nThe performance of the funds we manage, and our performance, may be adversely affected by the financial performance of portfolio companies of the funds we manage and the industries in which the funds we manage invest” \nfor discussion regarding certain industry-specific risks that could affect the fair value of certain of the portfolio company investments of the funds we manage.\nIn certain funds we manage, generally in our equity strategy, the Company does not earn performance fees until the investors have achieved cumulative investment returns on invested capital (including management fees and expenses) in excess of an 8% hurdle rate. Additionally, certain of the credit funds we manage have various performance fee rates and hurdle rates. Certain of the credit funds we manage allocate performance fees to the general partner in a similar manner as the equity funds. In certain funds we manage, as long as the investors achieve their priority returns, there is a catch-up formula whereby the Company earns a priority return for a portion of the return until the Company’s performance fees equate to its performance fee rate for that \n70\nTable of Contents\nfund; thereafter, the Company participates in returns from the fund at the performance fee rate. Performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, are subject to reversal to the extent that the performance fees distributed exceed the amount due to the general partner based on a fund’s cumulative investment returns. The Company recognizes potential repayment of previously received performance fees as a general partner obligation representing all amounts previously distributed to the general partner that would need to be repaid to the Apollo funds if these funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying fund’s investments as of the reporting date. The actual general partner obligation, however, would not become payable or realized until the end of a fund’s life or as otherwise set forth in the respective limited partnership agreement of the fund.\nThe table below presents an analysis of Apollo’s (i) performance fees receivable on an unconsolidated basis, (ii) unrealized performance fees and (iii) realized performance fees, inclusive of realized incentive fees:\nAs of December 31,\nPerformance Fees for the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nPerformance Fees for the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nPerformance Fees for the Year Ended December 31, 2022\n \n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nPerformance Fees Receivable on an Unconsolidated Basis\nUnrealized\nRealized\nTotal\nUnrealized\nRealized\nTotal\nUnrealized\nRealized\nTotal\nAccord and Accord+ Funds\n$\n93 \n$\n59 \n$\n34 \n$\n20 \n$\n54 \n$\n59 \n$\n— \n$\n59 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n— \nAIOF I and II\n57 \n18 \n39 \n— \n39 \n8 \n5 \n13 \n(5)\n27 \n22 \nANRP I, II and III\n1\n48 \n47 \n36 \n25 \n61 \n(12)\n2 \n(10)\n(66)\n3 \n(63)\nAthora\n84 \n100 \n(15)\n— \n(15)\n(18)\n— \n(18)\n40 \n— \n40 \nCredit Strategies\n113 \n87 \n1 \n112 \n113 \n4 \n83 \n87 \n(4)\n4 \n— \nEPF Funds\n1\n21 \n15 \n— \n19 \n19 \n(121)\n34 \n(87)\n(79)\n48 \n(31)\nFCI Funds\n109 \n86 \n23 \n— \n23 \n10 \n— \n10 \n(1)\n— \n(1)\nFreedom Parent Holdings\n40 \n63 \n(53)\n117 \n64 \n63 \n— \n63 \n— \n— \n— \nFund X\n199 \n1 \n198 \n— \n198 \n1 \n— \n1 \n— \n— \n— \nFund IX\n1,597 \n1,714 \n(117)\n419 \n302 \n453 \n288 \n741 \n494 \n200 \n694 \nFund VIII\n2\n23 \n111 \n(158)\n4 \n(154)\n(259)\n118 \n(141)\n(357)\n22 \n(335)\nFund VII\n— \n27 \n(26)\n27 \n1 \n(13)\n18 \n5 \n(38)\n44 \n6 \nFund VI\n31 \n22 \n— \n9 \n9 \n(3)\n8 \n5 \n(1)\n3 \n2 \nFund IV and Fund V\n1\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n30 \n(30)\n— \n— \n— \n— \nHVF I\n60 \n45 \n15 \n9 \n24 \n1 \n41 \n42 \n(62)\n116 \n54 \nHVF II\n168 \n— \n168 \n— \n168 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nMidCap Financial\n43 \n38 \n5 \n38 \n43 \n(143)\n57 \n(86)\n36 \n19 \n55 \nRedding Ridge Holdings\n164 \n118 \n45 \n35 \n80 \n27 \n34 \n61 \n(8)\n23 \n15 \nOther\n1,3\n617 \n521 \n69 \n294 \n363 \n31 \n230 \n261 \n49 \n158 \n207 \nTotal\n$\n3,467 \n$\n3,072 \n$\n264 \n$\n1,128 \n$\n1,392 \n$\n118 \n$\n888 \n$\n1,006 \n$\n(2)\n$\n667 \n$\n665 \nTotal, net of profit sharing payable\n4\n/expense\n$\n1,684 \n$\n1,507 \n$\n118 \n$\n516 \n$\n634 \n$\n(54)\n$\n335 \n$\n281 \n$\n(17)\n$\n130 \n$\n113 \n1\n As of December 31, 2024, certain funds had $213 million in general partner obligations to return previously distributed performance fees. The fair value gain on investments and income at the fund level needed to reverse the general partner obligations was $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2024. \n2 \nAs of December 31, 2024, the remaining investments and escrow cash of Fund VIII was valued at 86% of the fund’s unreturned capital, which was below the required escrow ratio of 115%. As a result, the fund is required to place in escrow current and future performance fee distributions to the general partner until the specified return ratio of 115% is met (at the time of a future distribution) or upon liquidation. As of December 31, 2024, Fund VIII had $138 million of gross performance fees or $80 million net of profit sharing, in escrow. With respect to Fund VIII, realized performance fees currently distributed to the general partner are limited to potential tax distributions and interest on escrow balances per the fund’s partnership agreement. Performance fees receivable as of December 31, 2024 and realized performance fees for the year ended\n \nDecember 31, 2024 include interest earned on escrow balances that is not subject to contingent repayment. \n3 \nOther includes certain SIAs. \n4 \nThere was a corresponding profit sharing payable of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2024, including profit sharing payable related to amounts in escrow and contingent consideration obligations of $67 million.\nThe general partners of cert\nain of the funds we manage accrue performance fees, categorized as performance allocations, when the fair value of investments exceeds the cost basis of the individual investors’ investments in the fund, including any allocable share of expenses incurred in connection with such investments, which we refer to as “high water marks.” These high water marks are applied on an individual investor basis. Certain of the funds we manage have investors with various high water marks, the achievement of which is subject to market conditions and investment performance.\nPerformance fees from certain funds we manage are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner in the event of future losses to the extent that the cumulative performance fees distributed from inception to date exceeds the amount computed as due to the general partner at the final distribution. These general partner obligations, if applicable, are included in due to related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n71\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our performance fees since inception through December 31, 2024:\nPerformance Fees Since Inception\n1\n(In millions)\nUndistributed by Fund and Recognized\nDistributed by Fund and Recognized\n2\nTotal Undistributed and Distributed by Fund and Recognized\n3\nGeneral Partner Obligation\n3\nMaximum Performance Fees Subject to Potential Reversal\n4\nAccord and Accord+ Funds\n93 \n47 \n140 \n— \n93 \nAIOF I and II\n57 \n63 \n120 \n— \n80 \nANRP I, II and III\n48 \n186 \n234 \n12 \n94 \nAthora\n84 \n— \n84 \n— \n84 \nCredit Strategies\n113 \n373 \n486 \n— \n106 \nEPF Funds\n21 \n527 \n548 \n110 \n35 \nFCI Funds\n109 \n24 \n133 \n— \n109 \nFreedom Parent Holdings\n40 \n87 \n127 \n— \n10 \nFund X\n199 \n— \n199 \n— \n199 \nFund IX\n1,597 \n1,297 \n2,894 \n— \n2,320 \nFund VIII\n23 \n1,783 \n1,806 \n70 \n1,162 \nFund VII\n— \n3,271 \n3,271 \n— \n— \nFund VI\n31 \n1,664 \n1,695 \n— \n— \nFund IV and Fund V\n— \n2,023 \n2,023 \n1 \n— \nHVF I\n60 \n252 \n312 \n— \n183 \nHVF II\n168 \n— \n168 \n— \n168 \nMidCap Financial\n43 \n166 \n209 \n— \n43 \nRedding Ridge Holdings\n164 \n— \n164 \n— \n129 \nOther\n5\n617 \n2,638 \n3,255 \n20 \n700 \nTotal\n$\n3,467 \n$\n14,401 \n$\n17,868 \n$\n213 \n$\n5,515 \n1\n Certain funds are denominated in euros and historical figures are translated into U.S. dollars at an exchange rate of €1.00 to $1.04 as of December 31, 2024.

Amounts exclude certain performance fees from business development companies and Redding Ridge Holdings LP (“Redding Ridge Holdings”), an affiliate of Redding Ridge.\n3\n Amounts were computed based on the fair value of fund investments on December 31, 2024. Performance fees have been allocated to and recognized by the general partner. Based on the amount allocated, a portion is subject to potential reversal or, to the extent applicable, has been reduced by the general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees at December 31, 2024. The actual determination and any required payment of any such general partner obligation would not take place until the final disposition of the fund’s investments based on contractual termination of the fund.\n4\n Represents the amount of performance fees that would be reversed if remaining fund investments became worthless on December 31, 2024. Amounts subject to potential reversal of performance fees include amounts undistributed by a fund (\ni.e.\n, the performance fees receivable), as well as a portion of the amounts that have been distributed by a fund, net of taxes and not subject to a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees, except for those funds that are gross of taxes as defined in the respective funds’ governing documents.\n5\n Other includes certain SIAs.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe most significant expense in our asset management business is compensation and benefits expense. This consists of fixed salary, discretionary and non-discretionary bonuses, profit sharing expense associated with the performance fees earned and compensation expense associated with the vesting of non-cash equity-based awards.\nOur compensation arrangements with certain employees contain a significant performance-based incentive component. Therefore, as our net revenues increase, our compensation costs rise. Our compensation costs also reflect the increased investment in people as we expand geographically and create new funds.\nIn addition, certain professionals and selected other individuals have a profit sharing interest in the performance fees earned in order to better align their interests with our own and with those of the investors in the funds we manage. Profit sharing expense is part of our compensation and benefits expense and is generally based upon a fixed percentage of performance fees. Certain of \n72\nTable of Contents\nour performance-based incentive arrangements provide for compensation based on realized performance fees which includes fees earned by the general partners of the funds we manage under the applicable fund limited partnership agreements based upon transactions that have closed or other rights to incentive income cash that have become fixed in the applicable calendar year period. Profit sharing expense can reverse during periods when there is a decline in performance fees that were previously recognized. Profit sharing amounts are normally distributed to employees after the corresponding investment gains have been realized and generally before preferred returns are achieved for the investors. Therefore, changes in our unrealized performance fees have the same effect on our profit sharing expense. Profit sharing expense increases when unrealized performance fees increase. Realizations only impact profit sharing expense to the extent that the effects on investments have not been recognized previously. If losses on other investments within a fund are subsequently realized, the profit sharing amounts previously distributed are normally subject to a general partner obligation to return performance fees previously distributed back to the funds. This general partner obligation due to the funds would be realized only when the fund is liquidated, which generally occurs at the end of the fund’s term. However, indemnification obligations also exist for realized gains with respect to certain funds, which, although our Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners would remain personally liable, may indemnify our Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners for 17.5% to 100% of the previously distributed profits regardless of the fund’s future performance. See note 18 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s indemnification liability.\nThe Company grants equity awards to certain employees, including RSUs and restricted shares of common stock, that generally vest and become exercisable in quarterly installments or annual installments depending on the award terms. In some instances, vesting of an RSU is also subject to the Company’s receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods, sufficient to cover the associated equity-based compensation expense. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of equity-based compensation.\nOther expenses\nThe balance of our other expenses includes interest, placement fees, and general, administrative and other operating expenses. Interest expense consists primarily of interest related to the senior and subordinated notes as discussed in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Placement fees are incurred in connection with our capital raising activities. In cases where the limited partners of the funds are determined to be the customer in an arrangement, placement fees may be capitalized as a cost to acquire a customer contract, and amortized over the life of the customer contract. General, administrative and other expenses includes occupancy expense, depreciation and amortization, professional fees and costs related to travel, information technology and administration. Occupancy expense represents charges related to office leases and associated expenses, such as utilities and maintenance fees. Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets is normally calculated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, ranging from two to sixteen years, taking into consideration any residual value. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the expected term of the lease. Intangible assets are amortized based on the future cash flows over the expected useful lives of the assets.\nOther Income (Loss)\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities\nNet gains (losses) from investment activities include both realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses in our investment portfolio between the opening reporting date and the closing reporting date. Net unrealized gains (losses) are a result of changes in the fair value of unrealized investments and reversal of unrealized gains (losses) due to dispositions of investments during the reporting period. Significant judgment and estimation goes into the assumptions that drive these models and the actual values realized with respect to investments could be materially different from values obtained based on the use of those models. The valuation methodologies applied impact the reported value of investment company holdings and their underlying portfolios in our consolidated financial statements.\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”)\nChanges in the fair value of the consolidated VIEs’ assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income and expenses subsequent to consolidation are presented within net gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities and are attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of operations.\n73\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Losses), Net\nOther income (losses), net includes gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement liability and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses.\nFinancial Measures under U.S. GAAP - Retirement Services\nThe following discussion of financial measures under U.S. GAAP is based on the Company’s retirement services business, which is operated by Athene, as of December 31, 2024.\nRevenues\nPremiums\nPremiums for long-duration contracts, including products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. Insurance revenues are reported net of reinsurance ceded.\nProduct charges\nRevenues for universal life-type policies and investment contracts, including surrender and market value adjustments, costs of insurance, policy administration, GMDB, GLWB and no-lapse guarantee charges, are earned when assessed against policyholder account balances during the period.\nNet investment income\nNet investment income is a significant component of Athene’s total revenues. Athene recognizes investment income as it accrues or is legally due, net of investment management and custody fees. Investment income on fixed maturity securities includes coupon interest, as well as the amortization of any premium and the accretion of any discount. Investment income on equity securities represents dividend income and preferred coupon interest.\nInvestment related gains (losses)\nInvestment related gains (losses) primarily consist of (i) realized gains and losses on sales of investments, (ii) unrealized gains or losses relating to identified risks within AFS securities in fair value hedging relationships, (iii) gains and losses on trading securities, (iv) gains and losses on equity securities, (v) changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and derivatives not designated as a hedge, (vi) changes in the fair value of mortgage loan assets and (vii) changes in the provision for credit losses.\nExpenses\nInterest sensitive contract benefits\nUniversal life-type policies and investment contracts include traditional deferred annuities; indexed annuities consisting of fixed indexed, index-linked variable annuities in the accumulation phase, and assumed indexed universal life without significant mortality risk; funding agreements; immediate annuities without significant mortality risk (which include pension group annuities without life contingencies); universal life insurance; and other investment contracts inclusive of assumed endowments without significant mortality risk. Liabilities for traditional deferred annuities, indexed annuities, funding agreements and universal life insurance are carried at the account balances without reduction for potential surrender or withdrawal charges, except for a block of universal life business ceded to Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “Global Atlantic”), which is carried at fair value. Fixed indexed annuity, index-linked variable annuity and indexed universal life insurance contracts contain an embedded derivative. Benefit reserves for these contracts are reported as the sum of the fair value of the embedded derivative and the host (or guaranteed) component of the contracts. The fair value of the embedded derivatives represents the present value of cash flows attributable to the indexed strategies. The host contract is established at contract inception as the initial account value less the initial fair value of the embedded derivative and accreted over the policy’s life. Liabilities for immediate annuities without significant mortality risk are calculated as the present value of future liability cash flows and policy maintenance expenses discounted at contractual interest rates. Certain contracts are offered with additional contract features that meet the definition of a market risk benefit. See “—Market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) \n74\nTable of Contents\nlosses” below for further information.\nChanges in interest sensitive contract liabilities, excluding deposits and withdrawals, are recorded in interest sensitive contract benefits or product charges on the consolidated statements of operations. \nFuture policy and other policy benefits\nAthene issues or reinsures contracts classified as long-duration, which include term and whole life, accident and health, disability, and deferred and immediate annuities with life contingencies (which include pension group annuities with life contingencies).\nLiabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established as the estimated present value of benefits Athene expects to pay to or on behalf of the policyholder and related expenses less the present value of the net premiums to be collected, referred to as the net premium ratio. Liabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods which require the use of assumptions related to discount rate, expenses, longevity, mortality, morbidity, persistency and other policyholder behavior. The liability for nonparticipating long-duration contracts is discounted using an upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yield aligned to the characteristics of the liability, including the duration and currency of the underlying cash flows.\nChanges in the value of the liability for nonparticipating long-duration contracts due to changes in the discount rate are recognized as a component of OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the liability for remeasurement gains or losses and all other changes in the liability are recorded in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations.\nFuture policy benefits include liabilities for no-lapse guarantees on universal life insurance and fixed indexed universal life insurance. Each reporting period, expected excess benefits and assessments are updated with actual excess benefits and assessments. Athene also periodically revises the key assumptions used in the calculation of the liabilities that result in revisions to the expected excess benefits and assessments. The effects of changes in assumptions are recorded as unlocking in the period in which the changes are made. Changes in the liabilities associated with no-lapse guarantees are recorded in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations.\nMarket risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses\nMarket risk benefits represent contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contract holder from, and expose the insurance entity to, other-than-nominal capital market risk. Athene’s deferred annuity contracts contain GLWB and GMDB riders that meet the criteria for, and are classified as, market risk benefits.\nMarket risk benefits are measured at fair value at the contract level and may be recorded as a liability or an asset, which are included in market risk benefits or other assets, respectively, on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Fees and assessments collectible from the policyholder at contract inception are allocated to the extent they are attributable to the market risk benefit. If the fees are sufficient to cover the projected benefits, a non-option based valuation model is used. If the fees are insufficient to cover the projected benefits, an option-based valuation model is used to compute the market risk benefit liability at contract inception, with an equal and offsetting adjustment recognized in interest sensitive contract liabilities.\nChanges in fair value of market risk benefits are recorded in market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses on the consolidated statements of operations, excluding portions attributed to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, which are recorded in OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Ceded market risk benefits are measured at fair value and recorded within reinsurance recoverable on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements, and value of business acquired\nCosts related directly to the successful acquisition of new, or the renewal of existing, insurance or investment contracts are deferred. These costs consist of commissions and policy issuance costs, as well as sales inducements credited to policyholder account balances, and are included in deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n75\nTable of Contents\nDeferred costs related to universal life-type policies and investment contracts with significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are grouped into cohorts based on issue year and contract type and amortized on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts. The cohorts and assumptions used for the amortization of deferred costs are consistent with those used in estimating the related liabilities for these contracts. Deferred costs related to investment contracts without significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are amortized using the effective interest method. The effective interest method amortizes the deferred costs by discounting the future liability cash flows at a break-even rate. The break-even rate is solved for such that the present value of future liability cash flows is equal to the net liability at the inception of the contract. VOBA associated with acquired contracts can be either positive or negative and is amortized in relation to respective policyholder liabilities. Significant assumptions that impact VOBA amortization are consistent with those that impact the measurement of policyholder liabilities.\nAmortization of DAC, DSI and VOBA is included in amortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of operations.\nPolicy and other operating expenses\nPolicy and other operating expenses include normal operating expenses, policy acquisition expenses, interest expense, dividends to policyholders, integration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses and stock compensation expenses.\nOther Financial Measures under U.S. GAAP \nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating income tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We recognize the income tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation, based on the technical merits of the positions. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Company’s income tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether or not we have uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition or de-recognition.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences, using currently enacted tax rates, of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nFor entities that are consolidated, but not 100% owned, a portion of the income or loss and corresponding equity is allocated to owners other than Apollo. The aggregate of the income or loss and corresponding equity that is not owned by the Company is included in non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Non-controlling interests primarily include limited partner interests in certain consolidated funds and VIEs.\nThe authoritative guidance for non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements requires reporting entities to present non-controlling interest as equity and provides guidance on the accounting for transactions between an entity and non-controlling interests. According to the guidance, (1) non-controlling interests are presented as a separate component of stockholders’ equity on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition, (2) net income (loss) includes the net income (loss) attributable to the non-controlling interest holders on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, and (3) profits and losses are allocated to non-controlling interests in proportion to their ownership interests regardless of their basis.\n76\nTable of Contents\nManaging Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures \nWe believe that the presentation of Segment Income supplements a reader’s understanding of the economic operating performance of each of our segments.\nSegment Income and Adjusted Net Income\nSegment Income is the key performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of the Asset Management, Retirement Services, and Principal Investing segments. See note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of Segment Income and management’s consideration of Segment Income.\nWe believe that Segment Income is helpful for an understanding of our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance. This measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed above in “—Overview of Results of Operations” that have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. \nAdjusted Net Income (“ANI”) represents Segment Income less HoldCo interest and other financing costs and estimated income taxes. For purposes of calculating the Adjusted Net Income tax rate, Segment Income is reduced by HoldCo interest and financing costs. Income taxes on FRE and PII represents the total current corporate, local, and non-U.S. taxes as well as the current payable under Apollo’s tax receivable agreement. Income taxes on FRE and PII excludes the impacts of deferred taxes and the remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement, which arise from changes in estimated future tax rates. Certain assumptions and methodologies that impact the implied FRE and PII income tax provision are similar to those used under U.S. GAAP. Specifically, certain deductions considered in the income tax provision under U.S. GAAP relating to transaction related charges, equity-based compensation, and tax deductible interest expense are taken into account for the implied tax provision. Income Taxes on SRE represent the total current and deferred tax expense or benefit on income before taxes adjusted to eliminate the impact of the tax expense or benefit associated with the non-operating adjustments. Management believes the methodologies used to compute income taxes on FRE, SRE, and PII are meaningful to each segment and increases comparability of income taxes between periods.\nFee Related Earnings, Spread Related Earnings and Principal Investing Income\nFee Related Earnings, or “FRE”, is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment.\nSpread Related Earnings, or “SRE”, is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Retirement Services segment, excluding certain market volatility, which consists of investment gains (losses), net of offsets and non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives, and certain expenses related to integration, restructuring, equity-based compensation, and other expenses.\nNon-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives includes the change in fair values of derivatives and embedded derivatives, non-operating change in funding agreements, change in fair value of market risk benefits, and non-operating change in liability for future policy benefits.\nPrincipal Investing Income, or “PII”, is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Principal Investing segment. \nSee note 21 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the components of FRE, SRE, and PII.\nWe use Segment Income, ANI, FRE, SRE and PII as measures of operating performance, not as measures of liquidity. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The use of these measures without consideration of their related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described above.\nNet Invested Assets\nIn managing its business, Athene analyzes net invested assets, which does not correspond to total Athene investments, including investments in related parties, as disclosed in the consolidated statements of financial condition and notes thereto. Net invested \n77\nTable of Contents\nassets represent the investments that directly back Athene’s net reserve liabilities as well as surplus assets. Net invested assets is used in the computation of net investment earned rate, which is used to analyze the profitability of Athene’s investment portfolio. Net invested assets include (a) total investments on the consolidated statements of financial condition with AFS securities, trading securities and mortgage loans at cost or amortized cost, excluding derivatives, (b) cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, (c) investments in related parties, (d) accrued investment income, (e) VIE and VOE assets, liabilities and non-controlling interest adjustments, (f) net investment payables and receivables, (g) policy loans ceded (which offset the direct policy loans in total investments) and (h) an adjustment for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets exclude the derivative collateral offsetting the related cash positions. Athene includes the underlying investments supporting its assumed funds withheld and modco agreements and excludes the underlying investments related to ceded reinsurance transactions in its net invested assets calculation in order to match the assets with the income received. Athene believes the adjustments for reinsurance provide a view of the assets for which it has economic exposure. Net invested assets include Athene’s proportionate share of ACRA investments, based on its economic ownership, but do not include the proportionate share of investments associated with the non-controlling interests. Net invested assets are averaged over the number of quarters in the relevant period to compute a net investment earned rate for such period. While Athene believes net invested assets is a meaningful financial metric and enhances the understanding of the underlying drivers of its investment portfolio, it should not be used as a substitute for Athene’s total investments, including related parties, presented under U.S. GAAP.\nResults of Operations\nBelow is a discussion of our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

The increase in investment income in 2024 was driven by an increase in performance allocations of $304 million, partially offset by a decrease in principal investment income of $31 million.\nSignificant drivers for performance allocations in 2024 were performance allocations primarily earned from Fund IX, Fund X, HVF II, Credit Strategies, Redding Ridge Holdings and Freedom Parent Holdings of $302 million, $198 million, $168 million, $113 million, $80 million and $64 million, respectively, partially offset by performance allocation losses from Fund VIII of $154 million.\nSee below for details on the respective performance allocations in 2024.\nThe performance allocations earned from Fund IX in 2024 were primarily driven by the appreciation and realization of the fund’s investments in the (i) manufacturing and industrial and (ii) leisure sectors, and the fund’s distressed investments. \nThe performance allocations earned from Fund X in 2024 were primarily driven by the appreciation and realization of the fund’s investments in the (i) consumer and retail and (ii) manufacturing and industrial sectors, and the fund’s distressed investments. Moreover, the fund achieved its annualized hurdle rate in 2024.\nThe performance allocations earned from HVF II in 2024 were primarily driven by the appreciation and realization of the fund’s investments in private portfolio companies in the (i) consumer services, (ii) consumer and retail and (iii) manufacturing and industrial sectors. Moreover, the fund achieved its annualized hurdle rate in 2024. \nThe performance allocations earned from Credit Strategies in 2024 were driven by the net income generated by the fund’s investments.\nThe performance allocations earned from Redding Ridge Holdings in 2024 were primarily driven by existing and new CLO issuances, CLO contract acquisitions, new consulting contracts and the accumulation of warehouse assets.\nThe performance allocations earned from Freedom Parent Holdings in 2024 were primarily driven by the appreciation of its investment in Wheels, a U.S. corporate fleet lessor platform.\nThe performance allocation losses from Fund VIII in 2024 were primarily driven by the depreciation of the fund’s investments in the (i) media, telecom and technology, (ii) consumer services and (iii) leisure sectors.\nAdvisory and transaction fees increased by $199 million to $822 million in 2024 from $623 million in 2023. Advisory and transaction fees earned during 2024 were primarily attributable to advisory and transaction fees earned from companies in the (i) media, telecom and technology, (ii) financial services, (iii) manufacturing and industrial, (iv) business services and (v) natural resources sectors.\n80\nTable of Contents\nManagement fees increased by $127 million to $1.9 billion in 2024 from $1.8 billion in 2023. The increase in management fees in 2024 was primarily attributable to management fees earned from Atlas, ADS and S3 Equity and Hybrid Solutions, L.P. of $58 million, $52 million and $20 million, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from Fund X of $21 million. The increase in management fees earned from Atlas, ADS and S3 Equity and Hybrid Solutions, L.P. was driven by an increase in the management fee basis, an increase in subscriptions and higher fee-generating AUM due to additional closes in 2024, respectively. The decrease in management fees earned from Fund X of $21 million was primarily related to the catch-up management fees earned in 2023.\nExpenses\nExpenses were $4.0 billion in 2024, an increase of $265 million from $3.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to increases in general, administrative and other and interest expense, partially offset by a decrease in total compensation and benefits expenses. General, administrative and other expenses were $1.2 billion in 2024, an increase of $298 million from $872 million in 2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by $72 million related to equity interests issued by a subsidiary as part of a restructuring of such entity, as well as $18 million of fund merger-related costs. Additionally, increases in professional fees, higher travel and entertainment expenses and placement fees also contributed to the higher general, administrative and other expenses in 2024.\nInterest expense was $226 million in 2024, an increase of $81 million from $145 million in 2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily driven by higher interest rates from debt issuances offset, in part, by debt repayments in 2024.\nTotal compensation and benefits were $2.6 billion in 2024, a decrease of $114 million from $2.7 billion in 2023, primarily due to a decrease in equity-based compensation of $267 million, partially offset by increases in salary, bonus and benefits and profit sharing expense of $113 million and $40 million, respectively. The decrease in equity-based compensation of $267 million was primarily due to special fully vested RSUs that were granted to certain senior leaders in 2023. Equity-based compensation expense, in any given period, is generally comprised of: (i) performance grants which are tied to the Company’s receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods and are typically recognized on an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period to the extent the performance revenue metrics are met or deemed probable, and (ii) the impact of the 2021 one-time grants awarded to the then Co-Presidents of AAM, all of which vest on a cliff basis subject to continued employment over five years, and a portion of which also vest on the Company’s achievement of FRE and SRE per share metrics. \nThe increase in salary, bonus and benefits of $113 million was primarily driven by the growth in revenues and increased headcount in 2024. Additionally, there was an increase in profit sharing expense of $40 million resulting from the corresponding higher investment income during 2024. In any period, the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance allocations in the period.\nOther Income (Loss)\nOther income (loss) was $303 million in 2024, an increase of $30 million from $273 million in 2023. This increase was driven by increases in net gains (losses) from investment activities and other income (loss), net of $51 million and $19 million, respectively, offset, in part, by a decrease in net gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities of $40 million. See note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for further information on our consolidated variable interest entities.\nThe increase in net gains (losses) \nfrom investment activities\n of \n$51 million was primarily driven by the appreciation in the Company’s investment in Global Business Travel Group, Inc. The increase in other income (loss) of $19 million was primarily attributable to derivative gains and gains from changes in the tax receivable agreement liability, partially offset by an increase in earnout expense associated with a previous acquisition and losses associated with the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.\n81\nTable of Contents\nRetirement Services\nRevenues\nRetirement Services revenues were $21.9 billion in 2024, a decrease of $7.2 billion from $29.1 billion in 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in premiums and a decrease in other revenues, partially offset by an increase in net investment income, an increase in investment related gains (losses) and an increase in revenues of consolidated VIEs.\nPremiums were $1.3 billion in 2024, a decrease of $11.4 billion from $12.7 billion in 2023, primarily \ndriven by a $9.5 billion decrease in pension group annuity premiums compared to \n2023 and a decrease in premiums attributable to the execution of a whole life block reinsurance transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023\n.\nOther revenues were $19 million in 2024, a decrease of $572 million\n from \n$591 million\n in \n2023, primarily due to the $555 million gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023.\nNet investment income was $15.7 billion in 2024, an increase of $3.6 billion from $12.1 billion in 2023, primarily driven by significant growth in Athene’s investment portfolio attributable to strong net flows in 2024 and higher rates on new deployment in comparison to Athene’s existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment.\nInvestment related gains (losses) were $2.0 billion in 2024, an increase of $617 million from $1.4 billion in 2023, primarily due to favorable net foreign exchange impacts, a favorable change in the fair value of FIA hedging derivatives and the fair value of Athene’s strategic modco reinsurance agreement with Catalina, involving the cession of certain inforce funding agreements, and a favorable change in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by an unfavorable change in fair value of reinsurance assets. The favorable net foreign exchange impacts were primarily related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in 2024 compared to 2023. The change in fair value of FIA hedging derivatives increased \n$356 million\n, primarily driven by the favorable performance of the equity indices upon which Athene’s call options are based, with the 2024 impact amplified by the strong growth in Athene’s FIA block of business over the previous twelve months. The largest percentage of Athene’s call options are based on the S&P 500 Index, which increased 23.3% in 2024, compared to an increase of 24.2% in 2023.\n \nThe favorable change in the provision for credit losses of $154 million was primarily driven by intent-to-sell impairments in 2023 related to the timing of the recapture of certain business by VIAC and impacts from the Silicon Valley Bank failure. The change in fair value of reinsurance assets decreased $932 million, primarily driven by an increase in U.S. Treasury rates in 2024 compared to a decrease in 2023. \nRevenues of consolidated VIEs were $1.8 billion in 2024, an increase of $381 million from $1.4 billion in 2023, primarily driven by gains within AAA related to favorable returns on the underlying assets.\nExpenses\nRetirement Services expenses were $15.0 billion in 2024, a decrease of $8.6 billion from $23.6 billion in 2023. The decrease was driven by a decrease in future policy and other policy benefits and a decrease in market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses, partially offset by an increase in interest sensitive contract benefits, an increase in policy and other operating expenses and an increase in \nDAC, DSI and VOBA amortization\n. Athene’s annual unlocking of assumptions resulted in an increase in total expenses of $31 million compared to a decrease of $22 million in 2023. The 2024 unlocking was driven by an increase of $62 million in market risk benefits, an increase of $21 million related to DAC, DSI and VOBA and an increase of $8 million in interest sensitive contract benefits, partially offset by a decrease of $60 million in future policy and other policy benefits, compared to a decrease of $94 million in interest sensitive contract benefits and a decrease of $45 million in future policy and other policy benefits, partially offset by an increase of $81 million in market risk benefits and an increase of $36 million related to DAC, DSI and VOBA in 2023.\nFuture policy and other policy benefits were $3.1 billion in 2024, a decrease of $11.4 billion from $14.4 billion in 2023, \nprimarily driven by a $9.5 billion\n \ndecrease\n in pension group annuity obligation\ns compared to \n2023, a decrease in life reserves due to the execution of a $2.2 billion whole life block reinsurance transaction in the fourth quarter of 2023 and a favorable change in unlocking\n, partially offset by a \n$207 million\n increase in accrued interest. \nUnlocking in 2024 was $60 million favorable consisting of $104 million of favorable future policy benefit reserve unlocking, partially offset by $44 million of unfavorable negative VOBA and deferred profit liability unlocking. The favorable unlocking primarily related to favorable projected mortality lowering future benefit payments, partially offset by an increase in the lump sum payment utilization assumption. Unlocking in 2023 was $45 million favorable consisting of $297 million of favorable future policy benefit reserve \n82\nTable of Contents\nunlocking, partially offset by $252 million of unfavorable negative VOBA and deferred profit liability unlocking. The favorable unlocking primarily related to higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments.\nMarket risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses were $(102) million in 2024, a decrease of $506 million from $404 million in 2023. The gains in 2024 compared to losses in 2023 were \nprimarily driven by a favorable change in the fair value of market risk benefits and a \nfavorable\n change in unlocking, partially offset by a $44 million increase in accrued interest. The change in fair value of market risk benefits was $567 million favorable compar\ned to 2023 due to an increase in t\nhe risk-free discount rate across the curve, which is used in the fair value measurement of the liability for market risk benefits. This impact was partially offset by an unfavorable change in the fair value of market risk benefits of \n$25 million related to less favorable equity market performance compared to 2023. The market risk benefits unlocking in 2024 was $62 million unfavorable primarily due to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and enhanced income utilization assumptions, while 2023 unlocking was $81 million unfavorable primarily due to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and income rider restart assumptions.\nInterest sensitive contract benefits were $8.9 billion \nin 2024, an increase of $2.7 billion from $6.2 billion in 2023, primarily driven by significant growth in Athene’s deferred annuity and funding agreement blocks of business, higher rates on new deferred annuity and funding agreement issuances in comparison to its existing blocks of business and an unfavorable change in unlocking, partially offset by a decrease in the change in fair value of FIA embedded derivatives. The decrease in the change in fair value of FIA embedded derivatives of $1.3 billion was primarily due to the favorable change in discount rates used in Athene’s embedded derivative calculations as 2024 experienced an increase in discount rates compared to a decrease in 2023. This was partially offset by the favorable performance of the equity indices to which Athene’s FIA policies are linked, with the 2024 impact amplified by the strong growth in Athene’s FIA block of business over the previous twelve months. The largest percentage of Athene’s FIA policies are linked to the S&P 500 Index, which increased 23.3% in 2024, compared to an increase of 24.2% in 2023. The fair value of FIA embedded derivatives unlocking in 2024 was $67 million unfavorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, while 2023 unlocking was $20 million favorable primarily due to changes to projected interest crediting, partially offset by an increase in lapse and risk margin assumptions. The negative VOBA unlocking related to Athene’s interest sensitive contract liabilities in 2024 was $59 million favorable mainly due to updated economics and an increase in lapse assumptions, while 2023\n \nunlocking was $74 million favorable mainly due to an increase in lapse assumptions. \nPolicy and other operating expenses were $2.1 billion in 2024, an increase of $299 million from $1.8 billion in 2023, primarily driven by $152 million of expense related to guaranty association assessments levied against Athene in connection with the Bankers Life Insurance Company and Colorado Bankers Life Insurance Company insolvencies and an increase in interest expense. Additionally, policy and other operating expenses increased due to an increase in policy acquisition expenses related to significant volume growth in 2024.\nDAC, DSI and VOBA amortization was $941 million in \n2024, an increase of \n$253 million from $688 million in \n2023\n, primarily due to strong growth in Athene’s retail channel in \n2024\n, partially offset by a favorable change in unlocking. Unlocking in \n2024\n was \n$21 million unfavorable \nmainly related to changes\n to projected interest crediting and an increase in lapse assumptions,\n while unlocking in \n2023\n was $36 million unfavorable mainly related to an increase in lapse assumptions and changes to projected interest crediting.\nIncome Tax (Provision) Benefit\nThe Company’s income tax (provision) benefit totaled $(1,062) million and $923 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The change to the provision was primarily related to the increase in pretax income subject to income tax and a one-time deferred tax benefit resulting from the enactment of the Bermuda CIT in the fourth quarter of 2023. The (provision) benefit for income taxes includes federal, state, local and foreign income taxes resulting in an effective income tax rate of 14.3% and (16.5)% for 2024 and 2023, respectively. The most significant reconciling items between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the effective income tax rate were due to the following: (i) foreign, state and local income taxes, including NYC UBT, (ii) income attributable to non-controlling interests, (iii) equity-based compensation net of the limiting provisions for executive compensation under IRC Section 162(m), and (iv) a change in the estimated deferred tax benefit recorded for the Bermuda CIT. The Company does not expect a material increase to its consolidated effective tax rate or earnings and results of operations as a result of the utilization of the deferred tax assets, though the Company can provide no assurance that the impacts will not be material in future years.

This increase was primarily attributable to growth in fee related revenues, including management fees, capital solutions fees and other, net and fee-related performance fees. \nThe increase in management fees was primarily attributable to management fees earned from Athene and ADS of $237 million and $45 million, respectively, driven by increases in fee-generating AUM and increased subscriptions in 2024, respectively, partially offset by a decrease in management fees earned from Fund X of $21 million, primarily related to the catch-up management fees earned in 2023. Equity management fees included Fund X catch-up management fees of $45 million in 2023.\nCapital solutions fees in 2024 were primarily attributable to fees earned from companies in the (i) media, telecom and technology, (ii) financial services, (iii) manufacturing and industrial and (iv) business services sectors. \nThe increase in fee-related performance fees in 2024 was primarily attributable to fees earned from ADS of $54 million, reflecting the growing contribution from Apollo’s wealth-focused products. \nThe growth in revenues was offset, in part, by increases in non-compensation expenses and fee-related compensation expense. The increase in non-compensation expenses in 2024 was primarily driven by increases in travel and entertainment expenses, placement fees, depreciation and amortization expenses and higher professional fees. In addition, non-compensation expenses in 2024 included fund merger-related costs of $15 million. The increase in fee-related compensation was driven by corresponding growth in fee related revenues and increased headcount in 2024. \n84\nTable of Contents\nAsset Management Operating Metrics\nWe monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative asset management industry and directly impact the performance of our Asset Management segment.

The Company, through ISG, also provides sub-allocation services with respect to a portion of the assets in the Athene Accounts. Apollo, through its asset management business, managed or advised $331.5 billion and $278.3 billion of AUM on behalf of Athene as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nApollo, through ISGI, provides investment advisory services with respect to certain assets in certain portfolio companies of Apollo funds and sub-advises the Athora Accounts and broadly refers to “Athora Sub-Advised” assets as those assets in the Athora Accounts which the Company explicitly sub-advises as well as those assets in the Athora Accounts which are invested directly in funds and investment vehicles Apollo manages. The Company refers to the portion of the Athora AUM that is not Athora Sub-Advised AUM as “Athora Non-Sub Advised” AUM. See note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for more details regarding the fee arrangements with respect to the assets in the Athora Accounts.

The net increase was primarily driven by subscriptions across the platform and the growth of our retirement services client assets, partially offset by outflows attributable to Atlas and distributions. More specifically, the net increase was due to:\n•\nNet flows of $93.1 billion primarily attributable to:\n•\na $90.4 billion increase related to the funds we manage in our credit strategy primarily consisting of (i) $43.1 billion of subscriptions mostly related to the direct origination, asset-backed finance, multi-credit and opportunistic credit funds we manage; (ii) $34.7 billion related to the growth of our retirement services clients; and (iii) $22.9 billion of leverage, partially offset by $(7.0) billion of outflows resulting from the previously announced conclusion of the Atlas SP-Credit Suisse investment management agreement; and\n•\na $2.6 billion increase related to the funds we manage in our equity strategy.\n•\nRealizations of $(23.2) billion primarily attributable to:\n•\n$(14.1) billion related to the funds we manage in our credit strategy, largely driven by distributions from the asset-backed finance, direct origination and opportunistic credit funds we manage, and the anticipated run-off related to the Atlas SP-Credit Suisse investment management agreement; and\n•\n$(9.0) billion related to the funds we manage in our equity strategy primarily consisting of distributions across the traditional private equity funds.\n•\nMarket activity of $30.4 billion primarily attributable to:\n•\n$24.6 billion related to the funds we manage in our credit strategy primarily consisting of $14.7 billion related to our retirement services clients, $3.2 billion related to ISGI, $2.4 billion related to the opportunistic credit funds, and $2.1 billion related to the direct origination funds; and \n•\n$5.8 billion related to the funds we manage in our equity strategy related to the traditional private equity funds and hybrid value funds we manage.\n88\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables summarize changes in Fee-Generating AUM for Apollo’s investing strategies within the Asset Management segment:\nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCredit\nEquity\nTotal\nCredit\nEquity\nTotal\nChange in Fee-Generating AUM\n1\n:\nBeginning of Period\n$\n422,036 \n$\n70,916 \n$\n492,952 \n$\n346,598 \n$\n65,489 \n$\n412,087 \nInflows\n118,318 \n10,574 \n128,892 \n112,272 \n12,106 \n124,378 \nOutflows\n2\n(60,556)\n(6,617)\n(67,173)\n(48,990)\n(5,104)\n(54,094)\nNet Flows\n57,762 \n3,957 \n61,719 \n63,282 \n7,002 \n70,284 \nRealizations\n(5,575)\n(2,130)\n(7,705)\n(3,700)\n(1,514)\n(5,214)\nMarket Activity\n3\n21,620 \n80 \n21,700 \n15,856 \n(61)\n15,795 \nEnd of Period\n$\n495,843 \n$\n72,823 \n$\n568,666 \n$\n422,036 \n$\n70,916 \n$\n492,952 \n1\n At the individual strategy level, inflows include new subscriptions, commitments, capital raised, other increases in available capital, purchases, acquisitions and portfolio company appreciation.

The net increase was primarily driven by the growth of our retirement services client assets, market activity primarily in our credit strategy, and subscriptions across the platform, partially offset by outflows attributable to Atlas. More specifically, the net increase was due to:\n•\nNet flows of $61.7 billion primarily attributable to a $57.8 billion increase related to the funds we manage in our credit strategy primarily consisting of (i) a $34.7 billion increase related to the growth of our retirement services client assets; (ii) $18.3 billion of other net fee-generating movements; and (iii) $15.1 billion of subscriptions primarily related to the direct origination and multi-credit funds we manage, partially offset by $(7.0) billion of outflows resulting from the previously announced conclusion of the Atlas SP-Credit Suisse investment management agreement.\n•\nMarket activity of $21.7 billion primarily attributable to the funds we manage in our credit strategy consisting of $14.8 billion related to our retirement services clients and $2.1 billion related to ISGI.\n•\nRealizations of $(7.7) billion across the credit and equity strategies. \nOrigination, Gross Capital Deployment and Uncalled Commitments\nOrigination represents (i) capital that has been invested in new equity, debt or debt-like investments by Apollo's equity and credit strategies (whether purchased by funds and accounts managed by Apollo, or syndicated to third parties) where Apollo or one of Apollo's origination platforms has sourced, negotiated, or significantly affected the commercial terms of the investment; (ii) new capital pools formed by debt issuances, including CLOs; and (iii) net purchases of certain assets by the funds and accounts we manage that we consider to be private, illiquid, and hard to access assets and which the funds and accounts otherwise may not be able to meaningfully access. Origination generally excludes any issuance of debt or debt-like investments by the portfolio companies of the funds we manage.\nGross capital deployment represents the gross capital that has been invested by the funds and accounts we manage during the relevant period, but excludes certain investment activities primarily related to hedging and cash management functions at the Company. Gross capital deployment is not reduced or netted down by sales or refinancings, and takes into account leverage used by the funds and accounts we manage in gaining exposure to the various investments that they have made.\nUncalled commitments, by contrast, represent unfunded capital commitments that certain of the funds we manage have received from fund investors to fund future or current fund investments and expenses.\n89\nTable of Contents\nOrigination is indicative of our ability to originate assets for the funds we manage, through our origination platforms and our corporate solutions capabilities. Gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments are indicative of the pace and magnitude of fund capital that is deployed or will be deployed. Origination, gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments could result in future revenues that include management fees, capital solutions fees and performance fees to the extent they are fee-generating. They can also give rise to future costs that are related to the hiring of additional resources to manage and account for the additional origination activities and the capital that is deployed or will be deployed. Management uses origination, gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments as key operating metrics since we believe the results are measures of investment activities of the funds we manage.\nThe following presents origination, gross capital deployment and uncalled commitments (in billions):\n \n \n \nNote: Totals may not add due to rounding\n90\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Apollo had $61 billion and $58 billion of dry powder, respectively, which represents the amount of capital available for investment or reinvestment subject to the provisions of the applicable limited partnership agreements or other governing agreements of the funds, partnerships and accounts we manage.

The increase in SRE was primarily driven by higher net investment earnings and strategic capital management fees, partially offset by higher cost of funds and interest and other financing costs. \nNet investment earnings increased $2.1 billion, primarily driven by $25.3 billion of growth in Athene’s average net invested assets, higher rates on new deployment compared to Athene’s existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment and an increase in alternative net investment income, partially offset by an increase in income attributable to the ACRA non-controlling interests following the sale of a 50% interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increases in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60% effective December 31, 2023 and 63% effective October 1, 2024. The increase in alternative net investment income compared to 2023 was primarily driven by more favorable performance within retirement services and strategic origination platforms, as well as credit, partially offset by less favorable performance within equity. The increase in income from retirement services platforms was primarily related to underperformance from FWD Group Holdings Limited (“FWD”) and a decrease in the share price of Challenger Limited (“Challenger”) in 2023, partially offset by increased expenses and lower growth impacting the valuation of Athora in 2024. The increase in income from strategic origination platforms was mainly attributable to unfavorable performance from Aqua Finance in 2023 related to macroeconomic headwinds for consumer loan origination, favorable performance from Foundation Home Loans driven by increased origination volumes in 2024 and strong growth within other strategic origination platforms related to the funding of investments in 2024, partially offset by outsized performance from MidCap Financial in 2023.\n91\nTable of Contents\nStrategic capital management fees increased $33 million due to additional fees received from ADIP II as a result of the sale of a 50% interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increases in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60% effective December 31, 2023 and 63% effective October 1, 2024, as well as new business ceded to ACRA 2 in 2024.\nCost of funds increased $2.1 billion, primarily driven by growth in and higher rates on new deferred annuity issuances, growth in and higher rates on new institutional business, including the additional costs of swapping to or issuing funding agreements as floating rate to mitigate SRE sensitivity to floating rate assets, an increase in business mix to institutional business at higher crediting rates and the $114 million operating gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in costs attributable to the ACRA non-controlling interests following the sale of a 50% interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increases in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60% effective December 31, 2023 and 63% effective October 1, 2024, as well as a favorable change in unlocking and a favorable impact to pension group annuity balances related to a refinement in methodology. Unlocking, net of the non-controlling interests, was favorable $16 million primarily related to favorable projected mortality lowering future benefit payments, updated economics and favorable changes in lapse and enhanced income utilization assumptions. These impacts were largely offset by an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims, an increase in the lump sum payment utilization assumption and changes to projected interest crediting. Unlocking, net of the non-controlling interests, in 2023 was unfavorable $24 million primarily related to an increase in the income rider utilization assumption increasing projected claims. This impact was partially offset by favorable changes in lapse and income rider restart assumptions, as well as higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments.\nInterest and other financing costs increased $29 million related to higher interest expense resulting from Athene’s debt issuances in the fourth quarter of 2023 and the first and fourth quarters of 2024, partially offset by lower interest expense resulting from a decrease in the average outstanding balance of short-term repurchase agreements in 2024 compared to 2023.\nNet Investment Spread\nYears ended December 31,\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n2023\n2022\nChange\nFixed income and other net investment earned rate\n4.86 \n%\n4.45 \n%\n41bps\n4.45 \n%\n3.22 \n%\n123bps\nAlternative net investment earned rate\n8.03 \n%\n7.22 \n%\n81bps\n7.22 \n%\n10.42 \n%\nNM\nNet investment earned rate\n5.03 \n%\n4.61 \n%\n42bps\n4.61 \n%\n3.66 \n%\n95bps\nStrategic capital management fees\n0.04 \n%\n0.03 \n%\n1bp\n0.03 \n%\n0.03 \n%\n0bps\nCost of funds\n(3.29)\n%\n(2.71)\n%\n58bps\n(2.71)\n%\n(1.98)\n%\n73bps\nNet investment spread\n1.78 \n%\n1.93 \n%\n(15)bps\n1.93 \n%\n1.71 \n%\n22bps\nNet investment spread was 1.78% in 2024, a decrease of 15 basis points compared to 1.93% in 2023, primarily driven by higher cost of funds, partially offset by a higher net investment earned rate.\nCost of funds was 3.29% in 2024, an increase of 58 basis points compared to 2.71% in 2023, primarily driven by higher rates on new deferred annuity issuances, higher rates on new institutional business, including the additional costs of swapping to or issuing funding agreements as floating rate to mitigate SRE sensitivity to floating rate assets, an increase in business mix to institutional business at higher crediting rates and the $114 million operating gain on the settlement of the VIAC recapture agreement in 2023. These impacts were partially offset by an increase in costs attributable to the ACRA non-controlling interests following the sale of a 50% interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increases in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60% effective December 31, 2023 and 63% effective October 1, 2024, as well as a favorable change in unlocking and a favorable impact to pension group annuity balances related to a refinement in methodology.\nNet investment earned rate was 5.03% in 2024, an increase of 42 basis points compared to 4.61% in 2023, primarily due to higher returns in both Athene’s fixed income and alternative investment portfolios, partially offset by an increase in income attributable to the ACRA non-controlling interests following the sale of a 50% interest in ACRA 2 to ADIP II effective July 1, 2023 and the subsequent increases in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 60% effective December 31, 2023 and 63% effective October 1, 2024\n. \nFixed income and other net investment earned rate was 4.86% in 2024, an increase from 4.45% in 2023, primarily driven by higher rates on new deployment compared to Athene’s existing portfolio related to the higher interest rate environment. \nA\nlternative net investment earned rate was 8.03% in 2024, an increase from 7.22% in 2023, primarily driven by more favorable performance within retirement services and strategic origination platforms, as well as credit, partially offset by less favorable performance within equity. The higher returns on retirement services platforms was primarily related to \n92\nTable of Contents\nunderperformance from FWD and a decrease in the share price of Challenger in 2023, partially offset by increased expenses and lower growth impacting the valuation of Athora in 2024. The higher returns from strategic origination platforms was mainly attributable to unfavorable performance from Aqua Finance in 2023 related to macroeconomic headwinds for consumer loan origination and favorable performance from Foundation Home Loans driven by increased origination volumes in 2024, partially offset by outsized performance from MidCap Financial in 2023.\nInvestment Portfolio\nAthene had total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, of $314.6 billion and $259.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Athene’s investment strategy seeks to achieve sustainable risk-adjusted returns through the disciplined management of its investment portfolio against its long-duration liabilities, coupled with the diversification of risk. The investment strategies focus primarily on a buy and hold asset allocation strategy that may be adjusted periodically in response to changing market conditions and the nature of Athene’s liability profile. Athene takes advantage of its generally persistent liability profile by identifying investment opportunities with an emphasis on earning incremental yield by taking measured liquidity and complexity risk rather than assuming incremental credit risk. Athene has selected a diverse array of primarily high-grade fixed income assets including corporate bonds, structured securities and commercial and residential real estate loans, among others. Athene also maintains holdings in floating rate and less rate-sensitive instruments, including CLOs, non-agency RMBS and various types of structured products. In addition to its fixed income portfolio, Athene opportunistically allocates approximately 5% of its portfolio to alternative investments where it primarily focuses on fixed income-like, cash flow-based investments.\n93\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents the carrying values of Athene’s total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nCarrying Value\nPercentage of Total\nCarrying Value\nPercentage of Total\nAFS securities, at fair value\nU.S. government and agencies\n$\n7,151 \n2.3 \n%\n$\n5,399 \n2.1 \n%\nU.S. state, municipal and political subdivisions\n921 \n0.3 \n%\n1,046 \n0.4 \n%\nForeign governments\n1,568 \n0.5 \n%\n1,899 \n0.7 \n%\nCorporate\n83,585 \n26.6 \n%\n78,246 \n30.2 \n%\nCLO\n29,182 \n9.3 \n%\n20,207 \n7.8 \n%\nABS\n24,201 \n7.7 \n%\n13,383 \n5.2 \n%\nCMBS\n10,741 \n3.4 \n%\n6,591 \n2.5 \n%\nRMBS\n8,015 \n2.5 \n%\n7,567 \n2.9 \n%\nTotal AFS securities, at fair value\n165,364 \n52.6 \n%\n134,338 \n51.8 \n%\nTrading securities, at fair value\n1,583 \n0.5 \n%\n1,706 \n0.7 \n%\nEquity securities\n1,290 \n0.4 \n%\n1,293 \n0.5 \n%\nMortgage loans, at fair value\n63,239 \n20.1 \n%\n44,115 \n17.0 \n%\nInvestment funds\n107 \n— \n%\n109 \n0.1 \n%\nPolicy loans\n318 \n0.1 \n%\n334 \n0.1 \n%\nFunds withheld at interest\n18,866 \n6.0 \n%\n24,359 \n9.4 \n%\nDerivative assets\n8,154 \n2.6 \n%\n5,298 \n2.1 \n%\nShort-term investments\n447 \n0.2 \n%\n341 \n0.1 \n%\nOther investments\n2,915 \n0.9 \n%\n1,206 \n0.5 \n%\nTotal investments\n262,283 \n83.4 \n%\n213,099 \n82.3 \n%\nInvestments in related parties\nAFS securities, at fair value\nCorporate\n2,137 \n0.7 \n%\n1,352 \n0.5 \n%\nCLO\n6,035 \n1.9 \n%\n4,268 \n1.7 \n%\nABS\n10,631 \n3.4 \n%\n8,389 \n3.2 \n%\nTotal AFS securities, at fair value\n18,803 \n6.0 \n%\n14,009 \n5.4 \n%\nTrading securities, at fair value\n573 \n0.2 \n%\n838 \n0.3 \n%\nEquity securities, at fair value\n234 \n0.1 \n%\n318 \n0.1 \n%\nMortgage loans, at fair value\n1,297 \n0.4 \n%\n1,281 \n0.5 \n%\nInvestment funds\n1,853 \n0.6 \n%\n1,632 \n0.6 \n%\nFunds withheld at interest\n5,050 \n1.6 \n%\n6,474 \n2.5 \n%\nShort-term investments\n743 \n0.2 \n%\n947 \n0.4 \n%\nOther investments, at fair value\n331 \n0.1 \n%\n343 \n0.1 \n%\nTotal related party investments\n28,884 \n9.2 \n%\n25,842 \n9.9 \n%\nTotal investments, including related parties\n291,167 \n92.6 \n%\n238,941 \n92.2 \n%\nInvestments of consolidated VIEs\nTrading securities, at fair value\n2,301 \n0.7 \n%\n2,136 \n0.8 \n%\nMortgage loans, at fair value\n2,579 \n0.8 \n%\n2,173 \n0.8 \n%\nInvestment funds, at fair value\n17,660 \n5.6 \n%\n15,820 \n6.2 \n%\nOther investments\n884 \n0.3 \n%\n103 \n— \n%\nTotal investments of consolidated VIEs\n23,424 \n7.4 \n%\n20,232 \n7.8 \n%\nTotal investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs\n$\n314,591 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n259,173 \n100.0 \n%\nThe \n$55.4 billion increase\n in Athene’s total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n \ncompared to December 31, 2023 was primarily driven by significant growth from gross organic inflows of $71.0 billion in excess of gross liability outflows of $33.5 billion, reinvestment of earnings and an increase in derivative assets primarily related to the impact of favorable equity market performance in 2024 on Athene’s call options as well as market impacts on Athene’s derivative swaps and forward contracts. Additionally, total investments, including related parties and consolidated VIEs, \n94\nTable of Contents\nincreased due to the issuance of debt in 2024, the consolidation of new VIEs and an increase in VIE investment funds attributable to favorable performance of the underlying assets within AAA and net contributions from third-party investors into AAA, partially offset by Athene’s distribution of certain investments to AGM as a dividend. These impacts were partially offset by unrealized losses on AFS securities in 2024 of $1.1 billion due to an increase in U.S. Treasury rates, partially offset by credit spread tightening. \nAthene’s investment portfolio consists largely of high quality fixed maturity securities, loans and short-term investments, as well as additional opportunistic holdings in investment funds and other instruments, including equity holdings. Fixed maturity securities and loans include publicly issued corporate bonds, government and other sovereign bonds, privately placed corporate bonds and loans, mortgage loans, CMBS, RMBS, CLOs and ABS. A significant majority of Athene’s AFS portfolio, 97.1% and 96.5% as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, was invested in assets considered investment grade with an NAIC designation of 1 or 2.\nAthene\n invests a portion of its investment portfolio in mortgage loans, which are generally comprised of high quality commercial first lien and mezzanine real estate loans. \nAthene\n has acquired mortgage loans through acquisitions and reinsurance arrangements, as well as through an active program to invest in new mortgage loans. It invests in CMLs on income producing properties including hotels, apartments, retail and office buildings, and other commercial and industrial properties. Athene’s RML portfolio primarily consists of first lien RMLs collateralized by properties located in the U.S. \nFunds withheld at interest represent a receivable for amounts contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with modco and funds withheld reinsurance agreements in which Athene acts as the reinsurer. Generally, assets equal to statutory reserves are withheld and legally owned by the ceding company.\nWhile the substantial majority of \nAthene’s\n investment portfolio has been allocated to corporate bonds and structured credit products, a key component of Athene’s investment strategy is the opportunistic acquisition of investment funds with attractive risk and return profiles. \nAthene’s\n investment fund portfolio consists of funds or similar equity structures that employ various strategies including equity and credit funds. Athene has a strong preference for alternative investments that have some or all of the following characteristics, among others: (1) investments with credit- or debt-like characteristics (for example, a stipulated maturity and par value), or alternatively, investments with reduced volatility when compared to pure equity; or (2) investments that Athene believes have less downside risk.\nAthene \nholds derivatives for economic hedging purposes to reduce its exposure to the cash flow variability of assets and liabilities, equity market risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk. Athene’s primary use of derivative instruments relates to providing the income needed to fund the annual index credits on its FIA products. Athene primarily uses fixed indexed options to economically hedge indexed annuity products that guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on a percentage of the gain in a specific market index. Athene also uses derivative instruments, such as forward contracts and swaps, to hedge foreign currency exposure resulting from foreign denominated assets and liabilities and to help manage its net floating rate position.\n95\nTable of Contents\nNet Invested Assets\nThe following summarizes \nAthene’s \nnet invested assets:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nNet Invested Asset Value\n1\nPercentage of Total\nNet Invested Asset Value\n1\nPercentage of Total\nCorporate\n$\n86,051 \n34.6 \n%\n$\n82,883 \n38.1 \n%\nCLO\n27,698 \n11.2 \n%\n20,538 \n9.4 \n%\nCredit\n113,749 \n45.8 \n%\n103,421 \n47.5 \n%\nCML\n28,055 \n11.3 \n%\n25,977 \n11.9 \n%\nRML\n27,848 \n11.2 \n%\n18,021 \n8.3 \n%\nRMBS\n7,635 \n3.1 \n%\n7,795 \n3.6 \n%\nCMBS\n8,243 \n3.3 \n%\n5,580 \n2.6 \n%\nReal estate\n71,781 \n28.9 \n%\n57,373 \n26.4 \n%\nABS\n28,670 \n11.5 \n%\n22,202 \n10.2 \n%\nAlternative investments\n12,000 \n4.8 \n%\n11,659 \n5.4 \n%\nState, municipal, political subdivisions and foreign government\n3,237 \n1.3 \n%\n3,384 \n1.5 \n%\nEquity securities\n2,201 \n0.9 \n%\n1,727 \n0.8 \n%\nShort-term investments\n1,015 \n0.4 \n%\n1,048 \n0.5 \n%\nU.S. government and agencies\n5,531 \n2.2 \n%\n4,052 \n1.9 \n%\nOther investments\n52,654 \n21.1 \n%\n44,072 \n20.3 \n%\nCash and cash equivalents\n6,794 \n2.7 \n%\n10,467 \n4.8 \n%\nOther\n3,665 \n1.5 \n%\n2,094 \n1.0 \n%\nNet invested assets\n$\n248,643 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n217,427 \n100.0 \n%\n1\n See “Managing Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures” for the definition of net invested assets.\nAthene’s \nnet invested assets were $248.6 billion and $217.4 billion as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The increase in net invested assets was primarily driven by growth from net organic inflows of $49.1 billion in excess of net liability outflows of $27.2 billion, reinvestment of earnings, the issuance of debt in 2024 and an increase in short term repurchase agreements outstanding as of December 31, 2024, partially offset by an incremental 3% increase in the ADIP II ownership of ACRA 2 to 63% effective October 1, 2024 and the distribution of certain investments to AGM as a dividend.\nIn managing its business, Athene utilizes net invested assets as presented in the above table. Net invested assets do not correspond to Athene’s total investments, including related parties, on the consolidated statements of financial condition, as discussed previously in “Managing Business Performance - Key Segment and Non-U.S. GAAP Performance Measures”. Net invested assets represent \nAthene’s\n investments that directly back its net reserve liabilities and surplus assets. Athene believes this view of its portfolio provides a view of the assets for which it has economic exposure. Athene adjusts the presentation for assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions to include or exclude the underlying investments based upon the contractual transfer of economic exposure to such underlying investments. Athene also adjusts for VIEs to show the net investment in the funds, which are included in the alternative investments line above as well as adjusting for the allowance for credit losses. Net invested assets include Athene’s proportionate share of ACRA investments, based on its economic ownership, but exclude the proportionate share of investments associated with the non-controlling interests.\nNet invested assets is utilized by management to evaluate \nAthene’s\n investment portfolio. Net invested assets is used in the computation of net investment earned rate, which allows Athene to analyze the profitability of its investment portfolio. Net invested assets is also used in Athene’s risk management processes for asset purchases, product design and underwriting, stress scenarios, liquidity and ALM.\n96\nTable of Contents\nPrincipal Investing\nThe following table presents Principal Investing Income, the performance measure of our Principal Investing segment.\nYears ended December 31,\nTotal Change\nPercentage Change\nYears ended December 31,\nTotal Change\nPercentage Change\n(In millions, except percentages)\n2024\n2023\n2023\n2022\nPrincipal Investing:\nRealized performance fees\n$\n921 \n$\n742 \n$\n179 \n24.1%\n$\n742 \n$\n595 \n$\n147 \n24.7%\nRealized investment income (loss)\n74 \n(2)\n76 \nNM\n(2)\n330 \n(332)\nNM\nPrincipal investing compensation\n(664)\n(601)\n63 \n10.5\n(601)\n(585)\n16 \n2.7\nOther operating expenses\n(60)\n(56)\n4 \n7.1\n(56)\n(56)\n— \n—\nPrincipal Investing Income (PII)\n$\n271\n \n$\n83\n \n$\n188\n \n226.5%\n$\n83\n \n$\n284\n \n$\n(201)\n(70.8)%\nAs described in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—General”, earnings from our Principal Investing segment are inherently more volatile in nature than earnings from our Asset Management segment due to the intrinsic cyclical nature of performance fees, one of the key drivers of PII performance.\nA discussion of our Principal Investing segment analysis for the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2022 is included in the Company’s 2023 Annual Report.\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023\nIn this section, references to 2024 refer to the year ended December 31, 2024 and references to 2023 refer to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nPII was $271 million in 2024, an increase of $188 million, as compared to $83 million in 2023. This increase was primarily attributable to increases in realized performance fees and realized investment income of $179 million and $76 million, respectively, partially offset by an increase in principal investing compensation expense of $63 million.\nThe increase in realized performance fees of $179 million in 2024 was primarily driven by an increase in realized performance fees generated from Fund IX, Freedom Parent Holdings and ANRP III, partially offset by a decrease in realized performance fees earned from Fund VIII.\nRealized investment income in 2024 primarily benefited from realized gains earned on the transfer of certain of Apollo’s general partner investments to Athene. Realized investment income in 2023 was negatively impacted by $42 million of losses related to the liquidations of Apollo Strategic Growth Capital II and Acropolis Infrastructure Acquisition Corp., special purpose acquisition companies sponsored by Apollo.\nPrincipal investing compensation of $664 million in 2024 increased $63 million, as compared to $601 million in 2023. The increase in 2024 was primarily due to an increase in profit sharing expense associated with the corresponding increase in realized performance fees, partially offset by a decrease in profit sharing expense attributable to the Company’s incentive pool, a compensation program through which certain employees are allocated discretionary compensation based on realized performance fees in a given year, and is included within principal investing compensation. In any period, the blended profit sharing percentage is impacted by the respective profit sharing ratios of the funds generating performance allocations in the period. The incentive pool is separate from the fund related profit sharing expense and may result in greater variability in compensation and have a variable impact on the blended profit sharing percentage during a particular period.\n97\nTable of Contents\nThe Historical Investment Performance of Our Funds\nBelow we present information relating to the historical performance of the funds we manage, including certain legacy Apollo funds that do not have a meaningful amount of unrealized investments, and in respect of which the general partner interest has not been contributed to us.\nWhen considering the data presented below, you should note that the historical results of funds we manage are not indicative of the future results that you should expect from such funds, from any future funds we may raise or from your investment in our common stock.\nAn investment in our common stock is not an investment in any of the Apollo managed funds, and the assets and revenues of the funds we manage are not directly available to us. The historical and potential future returns of the funds we manage are not directly linked to returns on our common stock. Therefore, you should not conclude that continued positive performance of the funds we manage will necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our common stock. However, poor performance of the funds that we manage would cause a decline in our revenue from such funds, and would therefore have a negative effect on our performance and in all likelihood the value of our common stock.\nMoreover, the historical returns of funds we manage should not be considered indicative of the future results you should expect from such funds or from any future funds we may raise. There can be no assurance that any Apollo fund will continue to achieve the same results in the future.\nFinally, our private equity IRRs have historically varied greatly from fund to fund. For example, Fund VI generated a 12% gross IRR and a 9% net IRR since its inception through December 31, 2024, while Fund V generated a 61% gross IRR and a 44% net IRR since its inception through its liquidation in 2023. Accordingly, the IRR going forward for any current or future fund may vary considerably from the historical IRR generated by any particular fund, or for our private equity funds as a whole. Future returns will also be affected by the applicable risks, including risks of the industries and businesses in which a particular fund invests. See “",

Based on management’s experience, we believe that the Company’s current liquidity position, together with the cash generated from revenues will be sufficient to meet the Company’s anticipated expenses and other working capital needs for at least the next 12 months. For the longer-term liquidity needs of the asset management business, we expect to continue to fund the asset management business’ operations through management fees and performance fees received. The principal sources of liquidity for the retirement services business, in the ordinary course of business, are operating cash flows and holdings of cash, cash equivalents and other readily marketable assets.\nAGM is a holding company whose primary source of cash flow is distributions from its subsidiaries, which are expected to be sufficient to fund cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations. AGM’s primary liquidity needs include the cash-flow requirements relating to its corporate activities, including its day-to-day operations, common stock and preferred stock dividend payments and strategic transactions, such as acquisitions.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had $15.4 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, as well as $5.1 billion of available funds from the AGM credit facility, AHL credit facility, and AHL liquidity facility. \n103\nTable of Contents\nPrimary Uses of Cash \nOver the next 12 months, we expect the Company’s primary liquidity needs will be to:\n•\nsupport the future growth of Apollo’s businesses through strategic corporate investments;\n•\npay the Company’s operating expenses, including, compensation, general, administrative, and other expenses;\n•\nmake payments to policyholders for surrenders, withdrawals and payout benefits;\n•\nmake interest and principal payments on funding agreements;\n•\nmake payments to satisfy pension group annuity obligations and policy acquisition costs;\n•\nmake interest payments on the Company’s debt;\n•\npay taxes and tax related payments; \n•\npay cash dividends;\n•\nrepurchase common stock; and\n•\nmake payments under the tax receivable agreement.\nOver the long term, we believe we will be able to (i) grow Apollo’s Assets Under Management and generate positive investment performance in the funds we manage, which we expect will allow us to grow the Company’s management fees and performance fees and (ii) grow the investment portfolio of retirement services, in each case in amounts sufficient to cover our long-term liquidity requirements, which may include:\n•\nsupporting the future growth of our businesses;\n•\ncreating new or enhancing existing products and investment platforms;\n•\nmaking payments to policyholders;\n•\npursuing new strategic corporate investment opportunities;\n•\npaying interest and principal on the Company’s financing arrangements;\n•\nrepurchasing common stock;\n•\nmaking payments under the tax receivable agreement; and\n•\npaying cash dividends.\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe section below discusses in more detail the Company’s primary sources and uses of cash and the primary drivers of cash flows within the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows:\nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating Activities\n$\n3,253 \n$\n6,322 \n$\n3,789 \nInvesting Activities\n(61,801)\n(42,407)\n(23,444)\nFinancing Activities\n57,972 \n42,638 \n28,710 \nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n(3)\n10 \n(15)\nNet Increase (Decrease) in Cash and Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Cash Held at Consolidated Variable Interest Entities\n$\n(579)\n$\n6,563 \n$\n9,040 \n104\nTable of Contents\nThe assets of our consolidated funds and VIEs, on a gross basis, could have a substantial effect on the accompanying statement of cash flows.

Cash provided by financing activities of our consolidated funds and VIEs primarily includes proceeds from the issuance of debt and contributions from non-controlling interests, partially offset by repayment of debt and distributions to non-controlling interests.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects cash received from the strong organic inflows from retail, flow reinsurance and funding agreements, net of outflows, a favorable change in cash collateral posted for derivative transactions related to the favorable equity market performance in 2023, net capital contributions from non-controlling interests, issuances of the 2053 Subordinated Notes, 2033 Senior Notes and Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, and the issuance of debt by our subsidiary, partially offset by the redemption of the AAM Preferred Stock, the payment of stock dividends, the repayment of short-term repurchase obligations and distribution to redeemable non-controlling interest. Cash provided by financing activities of our consolidated funds and VIEs primarily includes proceeds from the issuance of debt, offset by payments for borrowings under repurchase agreements.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects the strong organic inflows from retail and funding agreements, net of outflows, net capital contributions from non-controlling interests, and the issuance of debt and preferred stock by our subsidiary, partially offset by the payment of stock dividends. Cash provided by financing activities of our consolidated funds and VIEs primarily includes proceeds from the issuance of debt, including repurchase agreements. \nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nFor a summary and a description of the nature of the Company’s commitments, contingencies and contractual obligations, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and “—Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies.” The Company’s commitments are primarily fulfilled through cash flows from operations and financing activities.\nConsolidated Funds and VIEs\nThe Company manages its liquidity needs by evaluating unconsolidated cash flows; however, the Company’s financial statements reflect the financial position of Apollo as well as Apollo’s consolidated funds and VIEs (including previously consolidated SPACs). The primary sources and uses of cash at Apollo’s consolidated funds and VIEs include: (a) raising capital \n106\nTable of Contents\nfrom their investors, which have been reflected historically as non-controlling interests of the consolidated subsidiaries in our financial statements, (b) using capital to make investments, (c) generating cash flows from operations through distributions, interest and the realization of investments, (d) distributing cash flow to investors, and (e) issuing debt to finance investments (CLOs).\nDividends and Distributions\nFor information regarding the quarterly dividends that were made to common stockholders and distribution equivalents on participating securities, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements. Although the Company currently expects to pay dividends, we may not pay dividends if, among other things, we do not have the cash necessary to pay the dividends. To the extent we do not have cash on hand sufficient to pay dividends, we may have to borrow funds to pay dividends, or we may determine not to pay dividends. The declaration, payment and determination of the amount of our dividends are at the sole discretion of the AGM board of directors.\nBecause AGM is a holding company, the primary source of funds for AGM’s dividends is distributions from its operating subsidiaries, AAM and AHL, which are expected to be adequate to fund AGM’s dividends and other cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations. The ability of these operating subsidiaries to make distributions to AGM will depend on satisfying applicable law with respect to such distributions, including surplus and minimum solvency requirements among others, as well as making prior distributions on AHL outstanding preferred stock. Moreover, the ability of AAM and AHL to receive distributions from their own respective subsidiaries will continue to depend on applicable law with respect to such distributions. \nOn February 4, 2025, AGM declared a cash dividend of $0.4625 per share of its common stock, which will be paid on February 28, 2025 to holders of record at the close of business on February 18, 2025. \nOn February 4, 2025, the Company also declared and set aside a cash dividend of $0.8438 per share of its Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, which will be paid on April 30, 2025 to holders of record at the close of business on April 15, 2025.\nRepurchase of Securities\nShare Repurchase Program\nFor information regarding the Company’s share repurchase program, see note 16 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRepurchase of Other Securities\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our other outstanding debt or equity securities through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities, purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any such repurchases will be dependent upon several factors, including our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, general market conditions and applicable regulatory, legal and accounting factors. Whether or not we repurchase any of our other securities and the size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at our discretion.\nMandatory Convertible Preferred Stock \nOn August 11, 2023, the Company issued 28,750,000 shares, or $1.4 billion aggregate liquidation preference, of its 6.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. There were 28,749,765 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2024. See note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nAsset Management Liquidity\nOur asset management business requires limited capital resources to support the working capital or operating needs of the business. For the asset management business’ longer-term liquidity needs, we expect to continue to fund the asset management business’ operations through management fees and performance fees received. Liquidity needs are also met (to a limited extent) through proceeds from borrowings and equity issuances as described in notes 14 and 16 to the consolidated financial statements, respectively. From time to time, if the Company determines that market conditions are favorable after taking into account our liquidity requirements, we may seek to raise proceeds through the issuance of additional debt or equity instruments. \n107\nTable of Contents\nAGM has a registration statement on Form S-3 to provide it with access to the capital markets, subject to market conditions and other factors. \nAt December 31, 2024, the asset management business had $2.7 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, as well as $1.25 billion of available funds from the AGM credit facility.\nFuture Debt Obligations\nThe asset management business had long-term debt of $4.3 billion at December 31, 2024, which includes notes with maturities in 2026, 2029, 2030, 2033, 2048, 2050, 2053 and 2054. See note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the asset management business’ debt arrangements.\nFuture Cash Flows\nOur ability to execute our business strategy, particularly our ability to increase our AUM, depends on our ability to establish new funds and to raise additional investor capital within such funds. Our liquidity will depend on a number of factors, such as our ability to project our financial performance, which is highly dependent on the funds we manage and our ability to manage our projected costs, fund performance, access to credit facilities, compliance with existing credit agreements, as well as industry and market trends. Also during economic downturns the funds we manage might experience cash flow issues or liquidate entirely. In these situations we might be asked to reduce or eliminate the management fee and performance fees we charge, which could adversely impact our cash flow in the future.\nAn increase in the fair value of the investments of the funds we manage, by contrast, could favorably impact our liquidity through higher management fees where the management fees are calculated based on the net asset value, gross assets or adjusted assets. Additionally, higher performance fees not yet realized would generally result when investments appreciate over their cost basis which would not have an impact on the asset management business’ cash flow until realized.\nConsideration of Financing Arrangements \nAs noted above, in limited circumstances, the asset management business may issue debt or equity to supplement its liquidity. The decision to enter into a particular financing arrangement is made after careful consideration of various factors, including the asset management business’ cash flows from operations, future cash needs, current sources of liquidity, demand for the asset management business’ debt or equity, and prevailing interest rates.\nRevolver Facility\nUnder the AGM credit facility, AGM and AMH, as parent borrower and subsidiary borrower, respectively, may borrow in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.25 billion and may incur incremental facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250 million plus additional amounts so long as AGM and AMH are in compliance with a net leverage ratio not to exceed 4.00 to 1.00. Borrowings under the AGM credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including without limitation, permitted acquisitions. The AGM credit facility has a final maturity date of November 21, 2029.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nThe tax receivable agreement provides for the payment to the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes that AGM and its subsidiaries realize subject to the agreement. For more information regarding the tax receivable agreement, see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAthora\nAthora is a strategic liabilities platform that acquires and reinsures traditional closed life insurance policies and provides capital and reinsurance solutions to insurers in Europe. In 2017, an AAM subsidiary made a €125 million commitment to Athora, which was fully drawn as of April 2020. An AAM subsidiary committed an incremental €58 million in 2020 to purchase new equity interests. Additionally, in 2021, an AAM subsidiary acquired approximately €21.9 million of new equity interests in Athora.\n108\nTable of Contents\nIn December 2021, an AAM subsidiary committed an additional €250 million to purchase new equity interests to support Athora’s ongoing growth initiatives, of which €180 million was drawn as of December 31, 2024.\nAn AAM subsidiary and Athene are minority investors in Athora with a long-term strategic relationship. Through its share ownership, the AAM subsidiary has approximately 19.9% of the total voting power in Athora, and Athene holds shares in Athora representing 10% of the total voting power in Athora. In addition, Athora shares held by funds and other accounts managed by Apollo represent, in the aggregate, approximately 15.1% of the total voting power in Athora.\nFund Escrow\nAs of December 31, 2024, the remaining investments and escrow cash of Fund VIII was valued at 86% of the fund’s unreturned capital, which was below the required escrow ratio of 115%. As a result, the fund is required to place in escrow current and future performance fee distributions to the general partner until the specified return ratio of 115% is met (at the time of a future distribution) or upon liquidation. Realized performance fees currently distributed to the general partner are limited to potential tax distributions and interest on escrow balances per the fund’s partnership agreement.\nClawback\nPerformance fees from certain of the funds we manage are subject to contingent repayment by the general partner in the event of future losses to the extent that the cumulative performance fees distributed from inception to date exceeds the amount computed as due to the general partner at the final distribution. See “—Overview of Results of Operations—Performance Fees” for the maximum performance fees subject to potential reversal by each fund.\nIndemnification Liability\nThe asset management business recorded an indemnification liability in the event that the Former Managing Partners, Contributing Partners and certain investment professionals are required to pay amounts in connection with a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance fees. See note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the asset management business’ indemnification liability. \nRetirement Services Liquidity\nThere are two forms of liquidity relevant to our retirement services business: funding liquidity and balance sheet liquidity. Funding liquidity relates to the ability to fund operations. Balance sheet liquidity relates to the ability to sell assets held in Athene’s investment portfolio without incurring significant costs from fees, bid-offer spreads, or market impact. Athene manages its liquidity position by matching projected cash demands with adequate sources of cash and other liquid assets. The principal sources of liquidity for our retirement services business, in the ordinary course of business, are operating cash flows and holdings of cash, cash equivalents and other readily marketable assets.\nAthene’s investment portfolio is structured to ensure a strong liquidity position over time to permit timely payment of policy and contract benefits without requiring asset sales at inopportune times or at depressed prices. In general, liquid assets include cash and cash equivalents, highly rated bonds, short-term investments, unaffiliated preferred stock and public common stock, all of which generally have liquid markets with a large number of buyers, but exclude pledged assets, mainly associated with funding agreement and repurchase agreement liabilities. Assets included in modified coinsurance and funds withheld portfolios, including assets held in reinsurance trusts, are available to fund the benefits for the associated obligations but are restricted from other uses. Although the investment portfolio of our retirement services business does contain assets that are generally considered less liquid for liquidity monitoring purposes (primarily mortgage loans, policy loans, real estate, investment funds and affiliated common stock), there is some ability to raise cash from these assets if needed.\nAthene has access to additional liquidity through its AHL credit facility and AHL liquidity facility. The AHL credit facility has a borrowing capacity of $1.25 billion, subject to being increased up to $1.75 billion in total on the terms described in the AHL credit facility. The AHL credit facility has a commitment termination date of June 30, 2028, subject to up to two one-year extensions, and was undrawn as of December 31, 2024. Athene entered into a new AHL liquidity facility on June 28, 2024, which replaced its previous agreement dated as of June 30, 2023. The AHL liquidity facility has a borrowing capacity of $2.6 billion, subject to being increased up to $3.1 billion in total on the terms described in the AHL liquidity facility. The AHL liquidity facility has a commitment termination date of June 27, 2025, subject to additional 364-day extensions, and was undrawn as of December 31, 2024. Athene also has access to $2.0 billion of committed repurchase facilities. Athene has a \n109\nTable of Contents\nregistration statement on Form S-3 to provide it with access to the capital markets, subject to market conditions and other factors. Athene is also the counterparty to repurchase agreements with several different financial institutions, pursuant to which it may obtain short-term liquidity, to the extent available. In addition, through Athene’s membership in the FHLB, it is eligible to borrow under variable rate short-term federal funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity.\nAthene proactively manages its liquidity position to meet cash needs while minimizing adverse impacts on investment returns. Athene analyzes its cash-flow liquidity over the upcoming 12 months by modeling potential demands on liquidity under a variety of scenarios, taking into account the provisions of its policies and contracts in force, its cash flow position, and the volume of cash and readily marketable securities in its portfolio.\nLiquidity risk is monitored, managed and mitigated through a number of stress tests and analyses to assess Athene’s ability to meet its cash flow requirements, as well as the ability of its reinsurance and insurance subsidiaries to meet their collateral obligations, under various stress scenarios. Athene further seeks to mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining access to alternative, external sources of liquidity.\nInsurance Subsidiaries’ Operating Liquidity\nThe primary cash flow sources for Athene’s insurance subsidiaries include retirement services product inflows (premiums and deposits), investment income, principal repayments on its investments, net transfers from separate accounts and financial product inflows. Uses of cash include investment purchases, payments to policyholders for surrenders, withdrawals and payout benefits, interest and principal payments on funding agreements and outstanding debt, payments to satisfy pension group annuity obligations, policy acquisition and general operating costs and payment of cash dividends.\nAthene’s policyholder obligations are generally long-term in nature. However, policyholders may elect to withdraw some, or all, of their account value in amounts that exceed Athene’s estimates and assumptions over the life of an annuity contract. Athene includes provisions within its annuity policies, such as surrender charges and MVAs, which are intended to protect it from early withdrawals. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 82% and 79%, respectively, of Athene’s deferred annuity liabilities were subject to penalty upon surrender. In addition, as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately 66% and 64%, respectively, of policies contained MVAs that may also have the effect of limiting early withdrawals if interest rates increase but may encourage early withdrawals by effectively subsidizing a portion of surrender charges when interest rates decrease. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 33% of Athene’s net reserve liabilities were generally non-surrenderable, including buy-out pension group annuities other than those that can be withdrawn as lump sums, funding agreements and payout annuities, while 54% were subject to penalty upon surrender.\nMembership in Federal Home Loan Bank\nThrough its membership in the FHLB, Athene is eligible to borrow under variable rate short-term federal funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity. The borrowings must be secured by eligible collateral such as mortgage loans, eligible CMBS or RMBS, government or agency securities and guaranteed loans. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Athene had no outstanding borrowings under these arrangements.\nAthene has issued funding agreements to the FHLB. These funding agreements were issued in an investment spread strategy, consistent with other investment spread operations. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Athene had funding agreements outstanding with the FHLB in the aggregate principal amount of $15.6 billion and $6.5 billion, respectively.\nThe maximum FHLB indebtedness by a member is determined by the amount of collateral pledged and cannot exceed a specified percentage of the member’s total statutory assets dependent on the internal credit rating assigned to the member by the FHLB. As of December 31, 2024, Athene’s total maximum borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities was limited to $49.5 billion. However, Athene’s ability to borrow under the facilities is constrained by the availability of assets that qualify as eligible collateral under the facilities and certain other limitations. Considering these limitations, as of December 31, 2024, Athene had the ability to draw up to an estimated $18.9 billion, inclusive of borrowings then outstanding. This estimate is based on Athene’s internal analysis and assumptions and may not accurately measure collateral which is ultimately acceptable to the FHLB.\n110\nTable of Contents\nSecurities Repurchase Agreements\nAthene engages in repurchase transactions whereby it sells fixed income securities to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms or commercial banks, with a concurrent agreement to repurchase such securities at a determined future date. Athene requires that, at all times during the term of the repurchase agreements, it maintains sufficient cash or other liquid assets to allow it to fund substantially all of the repurchase price. Proceeds received from the sale of securities pursuant to these arrangements are generally invested in short-term investments or maintained in cash, with the offsetting obligation to repurchase the security included within payables for collateral on derivatives and securities to repurchase on the consolidated statements of financial condition. As per the terms of the repurchase agreements, Athene monitors the market value of the securities sold and may be required to deliver additional collateral (which may be in the form of cash or additional securities) to the extent that the value of the securities sold decreases prior to the repurchase date.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the payables for repurchase agreements were $5.7 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively, while the fair value of securities and collateral held by counterparties backing the repurchase agreements was $5.9 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, payables for repurchase agreements, based on original issuance, were comprised of $3.0 billion of short-term and $2.7 billion of long-term repurchase agreements. As of December 31, 2023, payables for repurchase agreements, based on original issuance, were comprised of $686 million of short-term and $3.2 billion of long-term repurchase agreements.\nDividends from Insurance Subsidiaries\nAHL is a holding company whose primary liquidity needs include the cash-flow requirements relating to its corporate activities, including its day-to-day operations, debt servicing, preferred and common stock dividend payments and strategic transactions, such as acquisitions. The primary source of AHL’s cash flow is dividends from its subsidiaries, which are expected to be adequate to fund cash flow requirements based on current estimates of future obligations.\nThe ability of AHL’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is limited by applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where the subsidiaries are domiciled, as well as agreements entered into with regulators. These laws and regulations require, among other things, the insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay.\nSubject to these limitations and prior notification to the appropriate regulatory agency, Athene’s U.S. insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay ordinary dividends based on calculations specified under insurance laws of the relevant state of domicile. Any distributions above the amount permitted by statute in any twelve-month period are considered to be extraordinary dividends, and require the approval of the appropriate regulator prior to payment. AHL does not currently plan on having the U.S. subsidiaries pay any dividends to their parents. \nDividends from AHL’s subsidiaries are projected to be the primary source of AHL’s liquidity. Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, each of Athene’s Bermuda insurance subsidiaries is prohibited from paying a dividend in an amount exceeding 25% of the prior year’s statutory capital and surplus, unless at least two members of the board of directors of the Bermuda insurance subsidiary and its principal representative in Bermuda sign and submit to the BMA an affidavit attesting that a dividend in excess of this amount would not cause the Bermuda insurance subsidiary to fail to meet its relevant margins. In certain instances, the Bermuda insurance subsidiary would also be required to provide prior notice to the BMA in advance of the payment of dividends. In the event that such an affidavit is submitted to the BMA in accordance with the Bermuda Insurance Act, and further subject to the Bermuda insurance subsidiary meeting its relevant margins, the Bermuda insurance subsidiary is permitted to distribute up to the sum of 100% of statutory surplus and an amount less than 15% of its total statutory capital. Distributions in excess of this amount require the approval of the BMA.\nThe maximum distribution permitted by law or contract is not necessarily indicative of the insurance subsidiaries’ actual ability to pay such distributions, which may be further restricted by business and other considerations, such as the impact of such distributions on surplus, which could affect Athene’s ratings or competitive position and the amount of premiums that can be written. Specifically, the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from rating agencies, including S&P, AM Best, Fitch and Moody’s, is of particular concern when determining the amount of capital available for distributions. AHL believes its insurance subsidiaries have sufficient statutory capital and surplus, combined with additional capital available to be provided by AHL, to meet their financial strength ratings objectives. Finally, state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory surplus of Athene’s insurance subsidiaries following any dividend or distribution must be reasonable in relation to their outstanding liabilities and adequate for the insurance subsidiaries’ financial needs.\n111\nTable of Contents\nOther Sources of Funding\nAthene may seek to secure additional funding at the AHL level by means other than dividends from subsidiaries, such as by drawing on its undrawn $1.25 billion AHL credit facility, drawing on its undrawn $2.6 billion AHL liquidity facility or by pursuing future issuances of debt or preferred stock to third-party investors. The AHL credit facility contains various standard covenants with which Athene must comply, including maintaining a consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio of not greater than 35%, maintaining a minimum consolidated net worth of no less than $14.8 billion and restrictions on the ability to incur liens, with certain exceptions. Rates, ratios and terms are as defined in the AHL credit facility. The AHL liquidity facility also contains various standard covenants with which Athene must comply, including maintaining an ALRe minimum consolidated net worth of no less than $10.2 billion and restrictions on the ability to incur liens, with certain exceptions. Rates and terms are as defined in the AHL liquidity facility.\nFuture Debt Obligations\nAthene had long-term debt of $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2024, which includes notes with maturities in 2028, 2030, 2031, 2033, 2034, 2051, 2052, 2054 and 2064. See note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding Athene’s debt arrangements. \nCapital\nAthene believes it has a strong capital position and is well positioned to meet policyholder and other obligations. Athene measures capital sufficiency using various internal capital metrics which reflect management’s view on the various risks inherent to its business, the amount of capital required to support its core operating strategies and the amount of capital necessary to maintain its current ratings in a recessionary environment. The amount of capital required to support Athene’s core operating strategies is determined based upon internal modeling and analysis of economic risk, as well as inputs from rating agency capital models and consideration of both NAIC RBC and Bermuda capital requirements. Capital in excess of this required amount is considered excess equity capital, which is available to deploy. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Athene’s U.S. RBC ratio was 419% and 392%, respectively, its Bermuda RBC ratio was 450% and 400%, respectively, and its consolidated RBC ratio was 430% and 412%, respectively. The formulas for determining the amount of RBC specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances or various levels of activity based on the perceived degree of risk. The RBC of Athene’s Bermuda insurance companies presented herein excludes the impact of any deferred taxes that may be recorded on a statutory basis as a result of the enactment of the Bermuda CIT. Athene is currently assessing deferred taxes that may be recorded on a statutory basis as a result of the Bermuda CIT, which could have a positive impact on the statutory capital and surplus of its Bermuda insurance companies.\nACRA\nACRA 1 provided Athene with access to on-demand capital to support its growth strategies and capital deployment opportunities. ACRA 1 provided a capital source to fund both Athene’s inorganic and organic channels. The commitment period for ACRA 1 expired in August 2023.\nSimilar to ACRA 1, ACRA 2 was funded in December 2022 as another long-duration, on-demand capital vehicle. Effective October 1, 2024, ACRA 2 repurchased a portion of its shares held by ALRe, which increased ADIP II’s ownership of economic interests in ACRA 2 to 63%, with ALRe owning the remaining 37%. ALRe holds all of ACRA 2’s voting interests. ACRA 2 participates in certain transactions by drawing a portion of the required capital for such transactions from third-party investors equal to ADIP II’s proportionate economic interest in ACRA 2.\nThese strategic capital solutions allow Athene the flexibility to simultaneously deploy capital across multiple accretive avenues, while maintaining a strong financial position. \n112\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. A summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of our accounting policies that are affected most by judgments, estimates and assumptions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Overall\nConsolidation\nWe consolidate entities on a variable interest or voting interest model or, if applicable, apply specialized accounting guidance for investment companies. Significant judgment may be required for the application of the VIE guidance and to determine whether entities qualify as investment companies under U.S. GAAP.\nThe assessment of whether an entity is a variable interest entity and the determination of whether Apollo should consolidate requires judgment. Those judgments include, but are not limited to: (i) determining whether the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (ii) evaluating whether the holders of equity investment at risk, as a group, can make decisions that have a significant effect on the success of the entity, (iii) determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive the expected residual returns from an entity and (iv) evaluating the nature of the relationship and activities of those related parties with shared power or under common control for purposes of determining which party within the related-party group is most closely associated with the VIE. Judgments are also made in determining whether a member in the equity group has a controlling financial interest, including power to direct activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and rights to receive benefits or obligations to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE. This analysis considers all relevant economic interests, including proportionate interests held through related parties. \nAdditionally, evaluating an entity to determine whether it meets the characteristics of an investment company under U.S. GAAP is qualitative in nature and may involve significant judgment. The Company has retained this specialized accounting for investment companies in consolidation. \nEquity-Based Compensation\n \nEquity-based compensation is generally measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Certain RSUs granted by the Company vest subject to continued employment and the Company’s receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods, sufficient to cover the associated equity-based compensation expense. Equity-based compensation expense for such awards, if and when granted, will be recognized on an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period to the extent the performance fee metrics are met or deemed probable. The addition of these performance measures helps to promote the interests of our shareholders and fund investors by making RSU vesting contingent on the realization and distribution of profits on our funds. For more information regarding Apollo’s equity-based compensation awards, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. The Company’s assumptions made to determine the fair value on grant date are embodied in the calculations of compensation expense.\nA significant part of our compensation expense is derived from amortization of RSUs. The fair value of all RSU grants is based on the grant date fair value, which considers the public share price of AGM. The Company has three types of RSU grants, which we refer to as Plan Grants, Bonus Grants, and Performance Grants. Plan Grants may or may not provide the right to receive dividend equivalents until the RSUs vest and the underlying shares are generally issued by March 15th after the year in which they vest. For Plan Grants, the grant date fair value is based on the public share price of the Company, and is discounted for transfer restrictions and lack of dividends until vested if applicable. Bonus Grants provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on both vested and unvested RSUs and Performance Grants provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on vested RSUs and may also provide the right to receive dividend equivalents on unvested RSUs. Both Bonus Grants and Performance Grants are generally issued by March 15th of the year following the year in which they vest. For Bonus Grants and Performance Grants, the grant date fair value for the periods presented is based on the public share price of AGM, and is discounted for transfer restrictions.\n113\nTable of Contents\nWe utilized the present value of a growing annuity formula to calculate a discount for the lack of pre-vesting dividends on certain Plan Grant and Performance Grant RSUs. The weighted average for the inputs utilized for the shares granted are presented in the table below for Plan Grants and Performance Grants:\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nPlan Grants:\nDividend Yield\n1\n1.5%\n2.1%\n3.0%\nCost of Equity Capital Rate\n2\n14.2%\n13.7%\n12.3%\nPerformance Grants:\nDividend Yield\n1\n1.3%\n2.2%\n2.9%\nCost of Equity Capital Rate\n2\n14.4%\n12.6%\n12.3%\n1\n Calculated based on the historical dividends paid during the year ended December 31, 2024 and the price of the Company’s common stock as of the measurement date of the grant on a weighted average basis.\n2\n Assumes a discount rate that was equivalent to the opportunity cost of foregoing distributions on unvested Plan Grant and Performance Grant RSUs as of the valuation date, based on the Capital Asset Pricing Model (“CAPM”). CAPM is a commonly used mathematical model for developing expected returns.\nWe utilize the Finnerty Model to calculate a marketability discount on the Plan Grant, Bonus Grant and Performance Grant RSUs to account for the lag between vesting and issuance. The Finnerty Model provides for a valuation discount reflecting the holding period restriction embedded in a restricted security preventing its sale over a certain period of time. \nThe Finnerty Model proposes to estimate a discount for lack of marketability such as transfer restrictions by using an option pricing theory. This model has gained recognition through its ability to address the magnitude of the discount by considering the volatility of a company’s stock price and the length of restriction. The concept underpinning the Finnerty Model is that a restricted security cannot be sold over a certain period of time. Further simplified, a restricted share of equity in a company can be viewed as having forfeited a put on the average price of the marketable equity over the restriction period (also known as an “Asian Put Option”). If we price an Asian Put Option and compare this value to that of the assumed fully marketable underlying security, we can effectively estimate the marketability discount. The inputs utilized in the Finnerty Model are (i) length of holding period, (ii) volatility and (iii) dividend yield. \n114\nTable of Contents\nThe weighted average for the inputs utilized for the shares granted are presented in the table below for Plan Grants, Bonus Grants and Performance Grants:\n \nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPlan Grants:\nHolding Period Restriction (in years)\n0.5\n4.1\n1.2\nVolatility\n1\n27.8%\n41.4%\n44.8%\nDividend Yield\n2\n1.5%\n2.1%\n3.0%\nBonus Grants:\nHolding Period Restriction (in years)\n0.2\n0.2\n0.2\nVolatility\n1\n24.0%\n38.5%\n34.5%\nDividend Yield\n2\n1.5%\n2.3%\n2.9%\nPerformance Grants:\nHolding Period Restriction (in years)\n2.3\n1.1\n0.9\nVolatility\n1\n34.9%\n41.9%\n37.4%\nDividend Yield\n2\n1.3%\n2.2%\n2.9%\n1\n The Company determined the expected volatility based on the volatility of the Company’s common stock price as of the grant date with consideration to comparable companies.\n2\n Calculated based on the historical dividends paid during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and the Company’s common stock price as of the measurement date of the grant on a weighted average basis.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions when the position is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Company’s tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether the Company has uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period during which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Asset Management\nInvestments, at Fair Value \nOn a quarterly basis, Apollo utilizes valuation committees consisting of members from senior management, to review and approve the valuation results related to the investments of the funds it manages. The Company also retains external valuation firms to provide third-party valuation consulting services to Apollo, which consist of certain limited procedures that management identifies and requests them to perform. The limited procedures provided by the external valuation firms assist management with validating their valuation results or determining fair value. The Company performs various back-testing procedures to validate their valuation approaches, including comparisons between expected and observed outcomes, forecast evaluations and variance analyses. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material.\nThe fair values of the investments in the funds we manage can be impacted by changes to the assumptions used in the underlying valuation models. For further discussion on the impact of changes to valuation assumptions see “Item 7A. \n115\nTable of Contents\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Sensitivities” in this report. There have been no material changes to the valuation approaches utilized during the periods that our financial results are presented in this report.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nExcept for the Company’s debt obligations (each as defined in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements), Apollo’s financial instruments are recorded at fair value or at amounts whose carrying values approximate fair value. See “—Investments, at Fair Value” above. While Apollo’s valuations of portfolio investments are based on assumptions that Apollo believes are reasonable under the circumstances, the actual realized gains or losses will depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may ultimately differ significantly from the assumptions on which the valuations were based. Financial instruments’ carrying values generally approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of those instruments or variable interest rates related to the borrowings. \nRevenue Recognition\nPerformance Fees\nApollo earns performance fees from funds we manage as a result of such funds achieving specified performance criteria. Such performance fees generally are earned based upon a fixed percentage of realized and unrealized gains of various funds after meeting any applicable hurdle rate or threshold minimum. \nPerformance allocations are performance fees that are generally structured from a legal standpoint as an allocation of capital to the Company. Performance allocations from certain of the funds that we manage are subject to contingent repayment and are generally paid to us as particular investments made by the funds are realized. If, however, upon liquidation of a fund, the aggregate amount paid to us as performance fees exceeds the amount actually due to us based upon the aggregate performance of the fund, the excess (in certain cases net of taxes) is required to be returned by us to that fund. We account for performance allocations as an equity method investment, and accordingly, we accrue performance allocations quarterly based on fair value of the underlying investments and separately assess if contingent repayment is necessary. The determination of performance allocations and contingent repayment considers both the terms of the respective partnership agreements and the current fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used. See “Investments, at Fair Value” below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments in our credit and equity funds.\nIncentive fees are performance fees structured as a contractual fee arrangement rather than a capital allocation. Incentive fees are generally received from the management of CLOs, managed accounts, ADS and MFIC. For a majority of our incentive fees, once the quarterly or annual incentive fees have been determined, there is no look-back to prior periods for a potential contingent repayment, however, certain other incentive fees can be subject to contingent repayment at the end of the life of the entity. In accordance with the revenue recognition standard, certain incentive fees are considered a form of variable consideration and therefore are deferred until fees are probable to not be significantly reversed. There is significant judgment involved in determining if the incentive fees are probable to not be significantly reversed, but generally the Company will defer the revenue until the fees are crystallized or are no longer subject to clawback or reversal. \nManagement Fees\nManagement fees related to the credit funds we manage can be based on net asset value, gross assets, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments, capital commitments, adjusted assets, capital contributions, or stockholders’ equity, all as defined in the respective partnership agreements. The management fee calculations for the credit funds we manage that consider net asset value, gross assets, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments and adjusted assets are normally based on the terms of the respective partnership agreements and the current fair value of the underlying investments within the funds. Estimates and assumptions are made when determining the fair value of the underlying investments within the funds and could vary depending on the valuation methodology that is used. The management fees related to equity funds we manage, by contrast, are generally based on a fixed percentage of the committed capital or invested capital. The corresponding fee calculations that consider committed capital or invested capital are both objective in nature and therefore do not require the use of significant estimates or assumptions. See “Investments, at Fair Value” below for further discussion related to significant estimates and assumptions used for determining fair value of the underlying investments in the credit and equity funds.\n116\nTable of Contents\nProfit Sharing Expense\n \nProfit sharing expense is primarily a result of agreements with employees to compensate them based on the ownership interest they have in the general partners of the Apollo funds. Therefore, changes in the fair value of the underlying investments in the funds we manage and advise affect profit sharing expense. Employees are generally allocated approximately 30% to 61%, of the total performance fees which is driven primarily by changes in fair value of the underlying fund’s investments and is treated as compensation expense. Additionally, profit sharing expenses paid may be subject to clawback from employees and former employees to the extent not indemnified. When applicable, the accrual for potential clawback of previously distributed profit sharing amounts, which is a component of due from related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition, represents all amounts previously distributed to employees and former employees that would need to be returned to the general partner if the Apollo funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds’ investments as of the reporting date. The actual general partner receivable, however, would not become realized until the end of a fund’s life.\nSeveral of the Company’s employee remuneration programs are dependent upon performance fee realizations, including the incentive pool, and dedicated performance fee rights and certain RSU awards for which vesting is contingent, in part, on the realization of performance fees in a specified period. The Company established these programs to attract and retain, and provide incentive to, partners and employees of the Company and to more closely align the overall compensation of partners and employees with the overall realized performance of the Company. Dedicated performance fee rights entitle their holders to payments arising from performance fee realizations. The incentive pool enables certain employees to earn discretionary compensation based on realized performance fees in a given year, which amounts are reflected in profit sharing expense in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Amounts earned by participants as a result of their performance fee rights (whether dedicated or incentive pool) will vary year-to-year depending on the overall realized performance of the Company (and, in the case of the incentive pool, on their individual performance). There is no assurance that the Company will continue to compensate individuals through the same types of arrangements in the future and there may be periods when the Company determines that allocations of realized performance fees are not sufficient to compensate individuals, which may result in an increase in salary, bonus and benefits, the modification of existing programs or the use of new remuneration programs. Reductions in performance fee revenues could also make it harder to retain employees and cause employees to seek other employment opportunities.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Policies - Retirement Services\nInvestments\nThe Company is responsible for the fair value measurement of investments presented in the consolidated financial statements. The Company performs regular analysis and review of its valuation techniques, assumptions and inputs used in determining fair value to evaluate if the valuation approaches are appropriate and consistently applied, and the various assumptions are reasonable. The Company also performs quantitative and qualitative analysis and review of the information and prices received from commercial pricing services and broker-dealers, to verify it represents a reasonable estimate of the fair value of each investment. In addition, the Company uses both internally-developed and commercially-available cash flow models to analyze the reasonableness of fair values using credit spreads and other market assumptions, where appropriate. For investment funds, the Company typically recognizes its investment, including those for which it has elected the fair value option, based on net asset value information provided by the general partner or related asset manager. For a discussion of investment funds for which it has elected the fair value option, see note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.\n117\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Fixed Maturity Securities, Equity Securities and Mortgage Loans\nThe following table presents the fair value of fixed maturity securities, equity securities and mortgage loans, including those with related parties and those held by consolidated VIEs, by pricing source and fair value hierarchy:\nDecember 31, 2024\n(In millions, except percentages)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nFixed maturity securities\nAFS securities\nPriced via commercial pricing services\n$\n116,317 \n$\n7,818 \n$\n108,495 \n$\n4 \nPriced via independent broker-dealer quotations\n37,582 \n— \n34,896 \n2,686 \nPriced via models or other methods\n30,268 \n— \n278 \n29,990 \nTrading securities\nPriced via commercial pricing services\n1,130 \n21 \n1,109 \n— \nPriced via independent broker-dealer quotations\n453 \n1 \n430 \n22 \nPriced via models or other methods\n573 \n— \n— \n573 \nTrading securities of consolidated VIEs\n2,301 \n— \n347 \n1,954 \nTotal fixed maturity securities, including related parties and consolidated VIEs\n188,624 \n7,840 \n145,555 \n35,229 \nEquity securities\nPriced via commercial pricing services\n1,263 \n190 \n1,073 \n— \nPriced via independent broker-dealer quotations\n— \n— \n— \n— \nPriced via models or other methods\n261 \n— \n— \n261 \nTotal equity securities, including related parties\n1,524 \n190 \n1,073 \n261 \nMortgage loans\nPriced via commercial pricing services\n61,057 \n— \n— \n61,057 \nPriced via independent broker-dealer quotations\n— \n— \n— \n— \nPriced via models or other methods\n3,479 \n— \n— \n3,479 \nMortgage loans of consolidated VIEs\n2,579 \n— \n— \n2,579 \nTotal mortgage loans, including related parties and consolidated VIEs\n67,115 \n— \n— \n67,115 \nTotal fixed maturity securities, equity securities and mortgage loans, including related parties and consolidated VIEs\n$\n257,263 \n$\n8,030 \n$\n146,628 \n$\n102,605 \nPercentage of total\n100.0 \n%\n3.1 \n%\n56.9 \n%\n40.0 \n%\nThe Company measures the fair value of its securities based on assumptions used by market participants in pricing the assets, which may include inherent risk, restrictions on the sale or use of an asset, or nonperformance risk. The estimate of fair value is the price that would be received to sell a security in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market, or the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market, for that security. Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, able and willing to transact an exchange while not under duress. The valuation of securities involves judgment, is subject to considerable variability and is revised as additional information becomes available. As such, changes in, or deviations from, the assumptions used in such valuations can significantly affect the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in security values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. The Company’s ability to sell securities, or the price ultimately realized upon the sale of securities, depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities. Accordingly, estimates of fair value are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current or future market exchange.\nFor fixed maturity securities, the Company obtains the fair values, when available, based on quoted prices in active markets that are regularly and readily obtainable. Generally, these are liquid securities and the valuation does not require significant management judgment. When quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair value is based on market standard valuation techniques, giving priority to observable inputs. The Company obtains the fair value for most marketable bonds without an active market from several commercial pricing services. The pricing services incorporate a variety of market observable information in their valuation techniques, including benchmark yields, broker-dealer quotes, credit quality, issuer spreads, bids, \n118\nTable of Contents\noffers, and other reference data. For certain fixed maturity securities without an active market, an internally-developed discounted cash flow or other approach is utilized to calculate the fair value. A discount rate is used, which adjusts a market comparable base rate for securities with similar characteristics for credit spread, market illiquidity or other adjustments. The fair value of privately placed fixed maturity securities is based on the credit quality and duration of comparable marketable securities, which may be securities of another issuer with similar characteristics. In some instances, the Company uses a matrix-based pricing model, which considers the current level of risk-free interest rates, corporate spreads, credit quality of the issuer and cash flow characteristics of the security. The Company also considers additional factors, such as net worth of the borrower, value of collateral, capital structure of the borrower, presence of guarantees and its evaluation of the borrower’s ability to compete in its relevant market.\nFor equity securities, the Company obtains the fair value, when available, based on quoted market prices. Other equity securities, typically private equities or equity securities not traded on an exchange, are valued based on other sources, such as commercial pricing services or brokers.\nFor mortgage loans, the Company uses independent commercial pricing services. Discounted cash flow analysis is performed through which the loans’ contractual cash flows are modeled and an appropriate discount rate is determined to discount the cash flows to arrive at a present value. Financial factors, credit factors, collateral characteristics and current market conditions are all taken into consideration when performing the discounted cash flow analysis. \nThe Company performs vendor due diligence exercises annually for all asset classes to review vendor processes, models and assumptions. Additionally, the Company reviews price movements on a quarterly basis to ensure reasonableness.\nDerivatives\nValuation of Embedded Derivatives on Indexed Annuities\nAthene issues and reinsures products, primarily indexed annuity products, or purchases investments that contain embedded derivatives. If Athene determines the embedded derivative has economic characteristics not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for separately, unless the fair value option is elected on the host contract.\nIndexed annuities and indexed universal life insurance contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate return or an equity market component for which interest credited is based on the performance of certain equity market indices. The equity market option is an embedded derivative, similar to a call option. The benefit reserve is equal to the sum of the fair value of the embedded derivative and the host (or guaranteed) component of the contracts. The fair value of the embedded derivative represents the present value of cash flows attributable to the indexed strategies. The embedded derivative cash flows are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates and policyholder behavior. The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects Athene’s own credit rating. The host contract is established at contract inception as the initial account value less the initial fair value of the embedded derivative and accreted over the policy’s life. Contracts acquired through a business combination which contain an embedded derivative are re-bifurcated as of the acquisition date.\nIn general, the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives will not directly correspond to the change in fair value of the hedging derivative assets. The derivatives are intended to hedge the index credits expected to be granted at the end of the current term. The options valued in the embedded derivatives represent the rights of the policyholder to receive index credits over the period indexed strategies are made available to the policyholder, which is typically longer than the current term of the options. From an economic basis, Athene believes it is suitable to hedge with options that align with the index terms of its indexed annuity products because policyholder accounts are credited with index performance at the end of each index term. However, because the value of an embedded derivative in an indexed annuity contract is longer-dated, there is a duration mismatch which may lead to differences in the recognition of income and expense for accounting purposes.\nA significant assumption in determining policy liabilities for indexed annuities is the vector of rates used to discount indexed strategy cash flows. The change in risk-free rates is expected to drive most of the movement in the discount rates between periods. Changes to credit spreads for a given credit rating as well as any change to Athene’s credit rating requiring a revised level of nonperformance risk would also be factors in the changes to the discount rate. If the discount rates used to discount the \n119\nTable of Contents\nindexed strategy cash flows were to fluctuate, there would be a resulting change in reserves for indexed annuities recorded through the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Athene had embedded derivative liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy of $11.2 billion. The increase (decrease) to the embedded derivatives on indexed annuity products from hypothetical changes in discount rates is summarized as follows:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\n+100 bps discount rate\n$\n(569)\n–100 bps discount rate\n626 \nHowever, these estimated effects do not take into account potential changes in other variables, such as equity price levels and market volatility, which can also contribute significantly to changes in carrying values. Therefore, the quantitative impact presented in the table above does not necessarily correspond to the ultimate impact on the consolidated financial statements. In determining the ranges, Athene has considered current market conditions, as well as the market level of discount rates that can reasonably be anticipated over the near-term. For additional information regarding sensitivities to interest rate risk and public equity risk, see “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n—\nSensitivities”.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nThe future policy benefit liabilities associated with long duration contracts include term and whole-life products, accident and health, disability, and deferred and immediate annuities with life contingencies, which include pension group annuities with life contingencies. Liabilities for nonparticipating long duration contracts are established as the estimated present value of benefits Athene expects to pay to or on behalf of the policyholder and related expenses less the present value of the net premiums to be collected. For immediate annuities with life contingencies, the liability for future policy benefits is equal to the present value of future benefits and related expenses.\nLiabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods which require the use of assumptions related to discount rate, expenses and policyholder behavior. Athene bases certain key assumptions related to policyholder behavior on industry standard data, adjusted to align with company experience, if needed. All cash flow assumptions, apart from expense assumptions, are established at contract issuance and reviewed annually, or more frequently, if actual experience suggests a revision is necessary.\nImmediate annuities with life contingencies, which include pension group annuities with life contingencies, and assumed whole life contracts represent the significant majority of Athene’s liabilities for future policy benefits. Significant assumptions for its immediate annuities with life contingencies include discount rates, assumptions for policyholder longevity and policyholder utilization for contracts with deferred lives, while significant assumptions for its whole life contracts include discount rates and assumptions for policyholder mortality, morbidity and lapse rates. \nIn general, the reserve for future policy benefits associated with life-contingent payout annuities will decrease when longevity decreases, resulting in remeasurement gains in the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the discount rate in periods after a cohort has closed will not impact interest expense recognition within the consolidated statements of operations. However, changes in the discount rate will impact the recorded reserve on the consolidated statements of financial condition, with an offsetting unrealized gain or loss recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). Athene uses a single A rate to calculate the present value of reserves related to its immediate annuities with life contingencies and assumed whole life products.\nFor limited-payment contracts where premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, a deferred profit liability is established to the extent that gross premium exceeds the net premium reserve and included within future policy benefits. When the net premium ratio for the corresponding future policy benefit is updated for actual experience and changes to projected cash flow assumptions, both the future policy benefit reserve and deferred profit liability are retrospectively recalculated from the contract issuance date. Also included within the liability for future policy benefits is negative VOBA that was established for blocks of insurance contracts acquired through the Mergers. Negative VOBA is related to Athene’s immediate annuities with life contingencies and is subsequently measured on a basis generally consistent with the deferred profit liability.\n120\nTable of Contents\nThe increase (decrease) to future policy benefit reserves from hypothetical changes in discount rates is summarized as follows:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\n+100 bps discount rate\n$\n(3,393)\n–100 bps discount rate\n4,048 \nMarket Risk Benefits\nMarket risk benefits represent contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contract holder from, and expose the insurance entity to, other-than-nominal capital market risk. Athene issues and reinsures deferred annuity contracts, which include both traditional deferred and indexed annuities, that contain GLWB and GMDB riders. These riders meet the criteria for and are classified as market risk benefits.\nMarket risk benefits are measured at fair value at the contract level and may be recorded as a liability or an asset. At contract inception, Athene assesses the fees and assessments that are collectible from the policyholder, which include explicit rider fees and other contract fees, and allocates them to the extent they are attributable to the market risk benefit. These attributed fees are used in the valuation of the market risk benefits and are never negative or exceed total explicit fees collectible from the policyholder. Athene is also required to project the expected benefits that will be required for the riders in excess of the projected account balance. Determining the projected benefits in excess of the projected account balance requires judgment for economic and actuarial assumptions, both of which are used in determining future policyholder account growth that will drive the amount of benefits required.\nEconomic assumptions include interest rates and implied equity volatilities throughout the duration of the liability. For riders on indexed annuities, this also includes assumptions about projected equity returns, which impact expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date and future equity option costs. When economic assumptions lead to an increase in expected future policy growth from higher interest and index crediting during the accumulation period, the higher projected account balance at the time of rider utilization decreases the inherent value of the rider as less payments for benefits are required in excess of the account balance. All else constant, the increase in the projected account balance will, therefore, result in a decrease to the market risk benefit liability, or an increase if the market risk benefit is in an asset position, with remeasurement gains recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPolicyholder behavior assumptions are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods to estimate decrements to policies with riders including lapses, full and partial withdrawals (surrender rate) and mortality and the utilization of the benefit riders. Base lapse rates consider the level of surrender charges and are dynamically adjusted based on the level of current interest rates relative to the guaranteed rates and the amount by which any rider guarantees are in a net positive position. Rider utilization assumptions consider the number and timing of policyholders electing the riders. Athene tracks and updates this assumption as experience emerges. Mortality assumptions are set at the product level and are generally based on standard industry tables with adjustments for historical experience and a provision for mortality improvement. While economic assumptions impact the projected account value and the benefits paid in excess of the account value, policyholder behavior assumptions, such as surrenders, impact the expected number of policies that will elect to utilize the rider. An expected increase in decrements and decrease in rider utilization, all else constant, will result in a decrease to the market risk benefit liability or an increase in the market risk benefit asset with remeasurement gains recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAll inputs, including expected fees and assessments and economic and policyholder behavior assumptions, are used to project excess benefits and fees over a range of risk-neutral, stochastic interest rate scenarios. For riders on indexed annuities, stochastic equity return scenarios are also included within the range. The discount rate used to present value the projected cash flows is a significant assumption, with the change in risk-free rates expected to drive most of the movement in discount rates between periods. A risk margin is deducted from the discount rate to reflect the uncertainty in the projected cash flows, such as variations in policyholder behavior, and a credit spread is added to reflect Athene’s risk of nonperformance. If the discount rates used were to fluctuate, there would be a resulting change in reserves for the market risk benefits recorded through the consolidated statements of operations, except for the portion related to the change in nonperformance risk, which is recorded through other comprehensive income (loss).\n121\nTable of Contents\nThe increase (decrease) to the net market risk benefit balance from hypothetical changes in the discount rate is summarized as follows:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\n+100 bps discount rate\n$\n(867)\n–100 bps discount rate\n748 \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nA list of recent accounting pronouncements that are relevant to Apollo and its industries is included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\nContractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies\nFixed and determinable payments due in connection with the Company’s material contractual obligations are as follows as of December 31, 2024:\n(In millions)\n2025\n2026\n - \n2027\n2028\n - \n2029\n2030 and Thereafter\nTotal\nAsset Management\nOperating lease obligations\n1\n$\n82 \n$\n160 \n$\n156 \n$\n430 \n$\n828 \nOther long-term obligations\n2\n33 \n1 \n— \n— \n34 \nAGM credit facility\n3\n1 \n2 \n2 \n— \n5 \nDebt obligations\n3\n234 \n934 \n1,071 \n6,446 \n8,685 \n350 \n1,097 \n1,229 \n6,876 \n9,552 \nRetirement Services\nInterest sensitive contract liabilities\n21,781 \n59,626 \n77,107 \n95,123 \n253,637 \nFuture policy benefits\n2,944 \n5,617 \n4,932 \n36,409 \n49,902 \nMarket risk benefits\n— \n— \n— \n6,219 \n6,219 \nOther policy claims and benefits\n107 \n— \n— \n— \n107 \nDividends payable to policyholders\n8 \n15 \n13 \n56 \n92 \nDebt obligations\n3\n333 \n664 \n1,603 \n10,234 \n12,834 \nSecurities to repurchase\n4\n4,281 \n1,689 \n— \n— \n5,970 \n29,454 \n67,611 \n83,655 \n148,041 \n328,761 \nObligations\n$\n29,804 \n$\n68,708 \n$\n84,884 \n$\n154,917 \n$\n338,313 \n1\n Operating lease obligations excludes $156 million of other operating expenses associated with operating leases. \n2\n Includes (i) payments on management service agreements related to certain assets and (ii) payments with respect to certain consulting agreements entered into by the Company.

Under the terms of the Transaction, Atlas originally agreed to pay CS an amount of $3.3 billion by February 8, 2028. This deferred purchase price is an obligation first of Atlas, second of AAA, third of AAM, fourth of AHL and fifth of AARe. Each of AARe and AAM issued an assurance letter to CS for the full deferred purchase obligation amount of $3.3 billion. In March 2024, in connection with Atlas concluding its investment management agreement with CS, Atlas will no longer receive $0.8 billion of fees and the deferred purchase price obligation is reduced by a corresponding amount from $3.3 billion to $2.5 billion. In addition, certain strategic investors have made equity commitments to Atlas which therefore obligates these investors for a portion of the deferred purchase price obligation.\nIn exchange for the purchase price, Atlas originally received approximately $0.4 billion in cash and a portfolio of senior secured warehouse assets, subject to debt, with approximately $1 billion of tangible equity value. These warehouse assets are senior secured assets at industry standard loan-to-value ratios, structured to investment grade-equivalent criteria, and were approved by Atlas in connection with this Transaction. Atlas also benefits generally from the net spread earned on these assets in excess of its cost of financing. Finally, Atlas will earn total fees of $0.4 billion under the terms of the investment management agreement with CS, including management fees and transition and termination payments. As a result, the guarantee related to the Company’s aforementioned assurance letter is not probable of payment and, therefore, a liability has not been reflected on the consolidated financial statements.\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nThe 2053 Subordinated Notes and the 2054 Subordinated Notes issued by AGM are guaranteed on a junior, unsecured basis, and the 2033 Senior Notes and the 2054 Senior Notes issued by AGM are both guaranteed on a senior, unsecured basis, by AAM, together with certain Apollo intermediary holding companies (collectively, the “Guarantors”). The Guarantors fully and unconditionally guarantee payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest (i) on the 2053 Subordinated Notes and the 2054 Subordinated Notes on a subordinated, unsecured basis and (ii) on the 2033 Senior Notes and the 2054 Senior Notes on a senior, unsecured basis. See note 14 of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these debt obligations.\nAGM, as issuer, and the Guarantors are holding companies. The primary sources of cash flow are dependent upon distributions from their respective subsidiaries to meet their future obligations under the notes and the guarantees, respectively. The 2033 Senior Notes, the 2054 Senior Notes, the 2053 Subordinated Notes and the 2054 Subordinated Notes are not guaranteed by any fee generating businesses, Apollo-managed funds, or Athene and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities will have a direct claim only against AGM as issuer.\nThe following tables present summarized financial information of AGM, as the issuer of the debt securities, and the Guarantors on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances within the Guarantors and equity in the earnings from and investments in any non-guarantor subsidiary.

Included in market risk are potential losses in value due to credit and counterparty risk, interest rate risk, currency risk, commodity price risk, equity price risk and inflation risk.\nIn our asset management business, our predominant exposure to market risk is related to our role as investment manager and general partner for the funds we manage and the sensitivity to movements in the fair value of their investments and resulting impact on performance fees and management fee revenues. Our direct investments in the funds we manage also expose us to market risk whereby movements in the fair values of the underlying investments will increase or decrease both net gains (losses) from investment activities and income (loss) from equity method investments.\nOur retirement services business is exposed to market risk through its investment portfolio, its counterparty exposures and its hedging and reinsurance activities. Athene’s primary market risk exposures are to credit risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk and inflation risk. \n \nRisk Management Framework\nThe Company’s risk management frameworks are designed to identify, assess and prioritize risks to ensure that senior management understands and can manage our risk profile. Governance over risk exists at both the board level and management level for both the asset management and retirement services businesses. The audit committee of the board of directors of AGM is tasked with reviewing major financial risk exposures of the Company and management’s risk assessment and risk management policies.\nAsset Management\nIn our asset management business, risks are analyzed across strategies from both a “bottom up” and “top down” perspective. We gather and analyze data, monitor investments and markets in detail, and constantly strive to better quantify, qualify and circumscribe relevant risks.\nEach risk management process is subject to our overall risk tolerance and philosophy and our asset management enterprise risk management framework. This framework governs all business units within the asset management business and (1) conveys our risk culture; (2) outlines our risk management methodology; (3) identifies key roles and responsibilities, and (4) summarizes our core risk areas including, but not limited to, market, credit and operational risks.\nInvestment and risk management processes are tailored to each respective investment portfolio subject to our overall risk tolerance and philosophy:\n124\nTable of Contents\n•\nWith respect to the credit funds we manage, we continuously monitor a variety of markets for attractive trading opportunities, applying a number of traditional and customized risk management metrics to analyze risk related to specific assets or portfolios.\n•\nThe investment process of the equity funds we manage involves a detailed analysis of potential acquisitions, with investment management teams assigned to monitor the strategic development, financing and capital deployment decisions of each portfolio investment.\nThe AAM Global Risk Committee (“AGRC”) is tasked with assisting AAM in monitoring and managing enterprise risk for the asset management business. The AGRC is chaired by a Co-President of AAM and includes other members of senior management of Apollo’s asset management business. Managing risk is the responsibility of all AAM employees. Businesses and investment professionals are responsible for all the risk taken on and managed in their business areas and risk management groups provide an objective challenge to, and oversight of, the business’ risk management.\nRisk management groups of the Company’s asset management business provide summary analysis of fund level market and credit risk to the portfolio managers of the funds managed by Apollo and the heads of the various business units. On a periodic basis, risk owners also provide analyses of select market and credit risk components to various members of senior management. In addition, the business and risk leaders of the Company’s asset management business review specific investments from the perspective of risk mitigation and discuss such analysis with the AGRC or other members of senior management when needed.\nRetirement Services\nThe processes supporting risk management for our retirement services business are designed to ensure that Athene’s risk profile is consistent with its stated risk appetite and that it maintains sufficient capital and liquidity to support its corporate plan, while meeting the requirements imposed by its policyholders, regulators and other stakeholders. The risk management function at Athene strives to maximize the value of its existing business platform to the Company’s stockholders, preserve the ability to realize business and market opportunities under stressed market conditions and withstand the impact of severely adverse events.\nAHL’s risk management framework includes a governance committee structure that supports accountability in current risk-based decision making and effective risk management. Governance committees are established at three levels: the AHL board of directors, AHL management and subsidiary management. AHL utilizes a host of assessment tools to monitor and assess its risk profile, results of which are shared with senior management periodically at management level committees, such as the risk committee (“RC”) and the investment and asset liability committee (“IALC”), and with the AHL board of directors quarterly. Business management retains the primary responsibility for day-to-day management of risk.\nThe risk management team at Athene consists of eight teams: Business and Operational Risk, ALM, Regulatory and Risk Analytics, Risk Policy and Derivatives Risk, Derivatives and Structured Solutions, Asset Risk Management, Strategic and Emerging Risk and Risk Operations and Change Management. The risk management team is led by AHL’s Chief Risk Officer, who reports to the chair of the AHL Risk Committee. AHL’s risk management team is comprised of more than 50 dedicated, full-time employees.\nAsset and Liability Management\nAsset and liability risk management is a joint effort that spans business management and the entire risk management team. Processes established to analyze and manage the risks of Athene’s assets and liabilities include but are not limited to:\n•\nanalyzing AHL’s liabilities to ascertain their sensitivity to behavioral variations and changes in market conditions and actuarial assumptions;\n•\nanalyzing interest rate risk, cash flow mismatch, and liquidity risk;\n•\nperforming scenario and stress analyses to examine their impacts on capital and earnings;\n•\nperforming cash flow testing and capital modeling;\n•\nmodeling the values of the derivatives embedded in its policy liabilities so that they can be effectively hedged;\n•\nhedging unwanted risks, including from embedded derivatives, interest rate exposures and currency risks;\n•\nreviewing its corporate plan and strategic objectives, and identifying prospective risks to those objectives under normal and stressed economic, behavioral and actuarial conditions; and\n•\nproviding appropriate risk reports that show consolidated risk exposures from assets and liabilities as well as the economic consequences of stress events and scenarios.\n125\nTable of Contents\nMarket Risk and Management of Market Risk Exposures\nAsset Management\nImpact on Management Fees\nOur management fees are based on one of the following:\n•\ncapital commitments to an Apollo fund;\n•\ncapital invested in an Apollo fund;\n•\nthe gross, net or adjusted asset value of an Apollo fund, as defined; or\n•\nas otherwise defined in the respective agreements.\nManagement fees could be impacted by changes in market risk factors, including (i) changes in invested capital or in market values to below cost, due to which management could consider an investment permanently impaired, in the case of certain funds or (ii) changes in gross or net asset value, for the credit funds. The proportion of our management fees that are based on NAV is dependent on the number and types of funds in existence and the current stage of each fund’s life cycle.\nImpact on Advisory and Transaction Fees—\nWe earn transaction fees relating to certain credit and equity transactions and may obtain reimbursement for certain out-of-pocket expenses incurred. Subsequently, on a quarterly or annual basis, ongoing advisory fees, and additional transaction fees in connection with additional purchases, dispositions, or follow-on transactions, may be earned. Management fee offsets and any broken deal costs, if applicable, are reflected as a reduction to advisory and transaction fees. Advisory and transaction fees will be impacted by changes in market risk factors to the extent that they limit our opportunities to engage in credit and equity transactions or impair our ability to consummate such transactions. The impact of changes in market risk factors on advisory and transaction fees is not readily predicted or estimated.\nImpact on Performance Fees\nWe earn performance fees from the funds we manage as a result of such funds achieving specified performance criteria. Our performance fees will be impacted by changes in market risk factors. However, several major factors will influence the degree of impact:\n•\nthe performance criteria for each individual fund in relation to how that fund’s results of operations are impacted by changes in market risk factors;\n•\nwhether such performance criteria are annual or over the life of the fund;\n•\nto the extent applicable, the previous performance of each fund in relation to its performance criteria; and\n•\nwhether each fund’s performance fee distributions are subject to contingent repayment.\nAs a result, the impact of changes in market risk factors on performance fees will vary widely from fund to fund. The impact is heavily dependent on the prior and future performance of each fund, and therefore is not readily predicted or estimated.\nMarket Risk\nWe are directly and indirectly affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk generally represents the risk that values of investments will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions. Market risk is inherent in each of the investments of the funds we manage, including equity investments, loans, short-term borrowings, long-term debt, hedging instruments, credit default swaps and other derivatives. Just a few of the market conditions that may shift from time to time, thereby exposing us to market risk, include fluctuations in interest, currency exchange rates and credit spreads, equity prices or changes in the implied volatility of interest rates. Volatility in debt and equity markets can impact our pace of capital deployment, the timing of receipt of transaction fee revenues and the timing of realizations. These market conditions could have an impact on the value of fund investments and rates of return. Accordingly, depending on the instruments or activities impacted, market risks can have wide ranging, complex adverse effects on our results from operations and our overall financial condition. We monitor market risk using certain strategies and methodologies which management evaluates periodically for appropriateness. We intend to continue to monitor this risk going forward and continue to monitor our exposure to all market factors.\n126\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is subject to a concentration risk related to the investors in the funds it manages. There are more than 1,000 investors in Apollo’s active credit and equity funds, and no individual investor accounts for more than 10% of the total committed capital to Apollo’s active funds.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk represents exposure we and the funds we manage have to instruments whose values vary with the change in interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, borrowings, investments in interest bearing securities and derivative instruments. We may seek to mitigate risks associated with the exposures by having the funds take offsetting positions in derivative contracts. Hedging instruments allow us to seek to mitigate risks by reducing the effect of movements in the level of interest rates, changes in the shape of the yield curve, as well as, changes in interest rate volatility. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks may include related derivatives such as options, futures and swaps.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents exposure we and the funds we manage have to investments or other activity whose value varies with the change in credit spreads, the change in the probability of default by the borrow or the actual default and failure to repay a loan or contractual obligation. Certain of the funds we manage are subject to certain inherent risks through their investments.\nCertain entities we manage invest substantially all of their excess cash in open-end money market funds and money market demand accounts, which are included in cash and cash equivalents. The money market funds invest primarily in government securities and other short-term, highly liquid instruments with a low risk of loss. We continually monitor the funds’ performance in order to manage any risk associated with these investments.\nCertain funds we manage hold derivative instruments that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of such agreements. We seek to minimize risk exposure by limiting the counterparties with which the funds enter into contracts to banks and investment banks who meet established credit and capital guidelines. Counterparty risk may be further mitigated by the exchange of collateral with a counterparty as a form of credit support for derivative transactions. As of December 31, 2024, we do not expect any counterparty to default on its obligations and therefore do not expect to incur any loss due to counterparty default.\nCertain investments of the funds we manage include lower-rated and comparable quality unrated distressed investments and other instruments. Investments in such debt instruments are accompanied by a greater degree of risk of loss due to default by the issuer because such debt instruments are generally unsecured and subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. These issuers generally have high levels of indebtedness and can be more sensitive to adverse market conditions, such as a recession or increasing interest rates, as compared to higher rated issuers. We seek to minimize risk exposure by subjecting each prospective investment to rigorous credit analysis and by making investment decisions based upon objectives that include capital preservation and appreciation, and industry and issuer diversification.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nForeign exchange risk represents exposures the funds we manage have to changes in the values of current fund holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies and investments in non-U.S. companies. The types of investments exposed to this risk include investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans, foreign currency-denominated transactions, and various foreign exchange derivative instruments whose values fluctuate with changes in currency exchange rates or foreign interest rates. Instruments used to mitigate this risk are foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures and forwards. These instruments may be used to help insulate the funds we manage against losses that may arise due to volatile movements in foreign exchange rates and/or interest rates.\nIn our capacity as investment manager of the funds we manage, we continuously monitor a variety of markets for attractive opportunities for managing risk. For example, certain of the funds we manage may put in place foreign exchange hedges or borrowings with respect to certain foreign currency denominated investments to provide a hedge against foreign exchange exposure.\n127\nTable of Contents\nNon-U.S. Operations\nWe have offices and conduct business throughout the world and are continuing to expand into foreign markets. Our fund investments and our revenues are primarily derived from our U.S. operations. With respect to our non-U.S. operations, we are subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments and changes in legislation relating to non-U.S. ownership. The funds we manage also invest in the securities of companies which are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions. As we continue to expand globally, we will continue to focus on monitoring and managing these risk factors as they relate to specific non-U.S. investments.\nRetirement Services\nCredit Risk and Counterparty Risk\nTo operate Athene’s business model, which is based on generating spread related earnings, it must bear credit risk. However, as Athene assumes credit risk through its investment, reinsurance and hedging activities, it endeavors to ensure that risk exposures remain diversified, that it is adequately compensated for the risks it assumes and that the level of risk is consistent with its risk appetite and objectives.\nCredit risk is a key risk taken in the asset portfolio, as the credit spread on Athene’s investments is what drives its spread related earnings. Athene manages credit risk by avoiding idiosyncratic risk concentrations, understanding and managing its systematic exposure to economic and market conditions through stress testing, monitoring investment activity daily and distinguishing between price and default risk from credit exposures. Concentration and portfolio limits are designed to ensure that exposure to default and impairment risk is sufficiently modest to not represent a solvency risk, even in severe economic conditions.\nThe approach to taking credit risk in our retirement services business is formulated based on:\n•\na fundamental view on existing and potential opportunities at the security level;\n•\nan assessment of the current risk/reward proposition for each market segment;\n•\nidentification of downside risks and assigning a probability for those risks; and\n•\nestablishing a plan for best execution of the investment action.\nA dedicated set of AHL risk managers monitor the asset risks to ensure that such risks are consistent with Athene’s risk appetite, standards for committing capital and overall strategic objectives. Athene’s risk management team is also a key contributor to the credit impairment evaluation process.\nIn addition to credit-risk exposures from its investment portfolio, Athene is also exposed to credit risk from its counterparty exposures related to derivative hedging and reinsurance activities. Derivative counterparty risk is managed by trading on a collateralized basis with counterparties under International Swaps and Derivatives Association documents with a credit support annex having zero-dollar collateral thresholds.\nAthene utilizes reinsurance to mitigate risks that are inconsistent with its strategy or objectives. For example, Athene has reinsured much of the mortality risk it would otherwise have accumulated through its various acquisitions and block reinsurance transactions, allowing it to focus on its core annuity business. These reinsurance agreements expose Athene to the credit risk of its counterparties. Athene manages this risk to avoid counterparty risk concentrations through various mechanisms: utilization of reinsurance structures such as funds withheld or modco to retain ownership of the assets and limit counterparty risk to the cost of replacing the counterparty; diversification across counterparties; and when possible, novating policies to eliminate counterparty risk altogether.\nInterest Rate Risk—\nSignificant interest rate risk may arise from mismatches in the timing of cash flows from Athene’s assets and liabilities. Management of interest rate risk at the company-wide level, and at the various operating company levels, is one of the main risk management activities in which AHL senior management engages.\nDepending upon the materiality of the risk and Athene’s assessment of how it would perform across a spectrum of interest rate environments, Athene may seek to mitigate interest rate risk using on-balance-sheet strategies (portfolio management) or off-balance-sheet strategies (derivative hedges such as interest rate swaps and futures). Athene monitors ALM metrics (such as key-rate durations and convexity) and employs quarterly cash flow testing requirements across all of its insurance companies to \n128\nTable of Contents\nassure the asset and liability portfolios are managed to maintain net interest rate exposures at levels that are consistent with its risk appetite. Athene has established a set of exposure and stress limits to communicate its risk tolerance and to ensure adherence to those risk tolerance levels. Risk management personnel and the RC and/or IALC (together, “AHL management committees”) are notified in the event that risk tolerance levels are exceeded. Depending on the specific risk threshold that is exceeded, the appropriate AHL management committee then makes a decision as to what actions, if any, should be undertaken.\nActive portfolio management is performed by our asset management business, with direction from the AHL management committees. ALM risk is also managed by the AHL management committees. The performance of Athene’s investment portfolio is reviewed periodically by the AHL management committees and board of directors. The AHL management committees strive to improve returns to stockholders and protect policyholders, while dynamically managing the risk within Athene’s expectations.\nEquity Risk—\nAthene’s FIAs require it to make payments to policyholders that are dependent on the performance of equity market indices. Athene seeks to minimize the equity risk from its liabilities by economically defeasing this equity exposure with granular, policy-level-based hedging. In addition, Athene’s investment portfolio can be invested in strategies involving public and private equity positions, though in general, it has limited appetite for passive, public equity investments.\nThe equity index hedging framework implemented is one of static and dynamic replication. Unique policy-level liability options are matched with static OTC options and residual risk arising from (1) policyholder behavior and other trading constraints (for example minimum trade size) and (2) the decision by the organization to enhance the value of the product offerings by dynamically managing a small portion of the exposure on custom indices, are managed dynamically by decomposing the risk of the portfolio (asset and liability positions) into market risk measures which are managed to pre-established risk limits. The portfolio risks are measured overnight and rebalanced daily to ensure that the risk profile remains within risk appetite. Valuation is done at the position level, and risks are aggregated and shown at the level of each underlying index. Risk measures that have term structure sensitivity, such as index volatility risk and interest rate risk, are monitored and risk managed along the term structure.\nAthene is also exposed to equity risk in its alternative investment portfolio. The form of those investments is typically a limited partnership interest in a fund. Athene currently targets fund investments that have characteristics resembling fixed income investments versus those resembling pure equity investments, but as holders of partnership positions, Athene’s investments are generally held as equity positions. Alternative investments are comprised of several categories, including at the most liquid end of the spectrum “liquid strategies”, (which is mostly exposure to publicly traded equities), followed by “equity” and “credit” strategies. Athene’s alternatives portfolio also includes strategic equity investments in origination platforms, insurance platforms and others.\nAthene’s investment mandate in its alternative investment portfolio is inherently opportunistic. Each investment is examined and analyzed on its own merits to gain a full understanding of the risks present, and with a view toward determining likely return scenarios, including the ability to withstand stress in a downturn. Athene has a strong preference for alternative investments that have some or all of the following characteristics, among others: (1) investments with credit- or debt-like characteristics (for example, a stipulated maturity and par value), or alternatively, investments with reduced volatility when compared to pure equity; or (2) investments that Athene believes have less downside risk.\nThe alternative investment portfolio is monitored to ensure diversification across asset classes and strategy, and the portfolio's performance under stress scenarios is evaluated routinely as part of management and board reviews. Since alternative investments are marked-to-market on the consolidated statements of financial condition, risk analyses focus on potential changes in market value across a variety of market stresses.\nCurrency Risk—\nAthene manages its currency risk to maintain minimal exposure to currency fluctuations. It attempts to hedge completely the currency risk arising on its statement of financial condition. In general, Athene matches currency exposure of assets and liabilities. When the currency denominations of the assets and liabilities do not match, Athene generally undertakes hedging activities to eliminate or mitigate currency mismatch risk.\nInflation Risk—\nAthene manages its inflation risk to maintain minimal exposure to changes in purchasing power. In general, it attempts to match inflation exposure of assets and liabilities. When the inflation exposure profiles of assets and liabilities do not match, Athene generally undertakes hedging activities to eliminate or mitigate inflation mismatch risk. Athene attempts to hedge the majority of inflation risk arising from the pension group annuity business that it reinsures.\n129\nTable of Contents\nScenario Analysis—\n Athene evaluates exposure to credit risk by analyzing its portfolio’s performance during simulated periods of economic stress. Athene manages business, capital and liquidity needs to withstand stress scenarios and target capital it believes will maintain its current ratings in a moderate recession scenario and maintain investment grade ratings under a deep recession scenario, a substantially severe financial crisis akin to the Lehman scenario in 2008. In the recession scenario, Athene calibrates recessionary shocks to several key risk factors (including but not limited to default rates, recoveries, credit spreads and U.S. Treasury yields) using data from the 1991, 2001 and 2008 recessions, and estimates impacts to the various sectors in its portfolio. In the deep recession scenario, Athene uses default probabilities from the 2008-2009 period, along with recovery and ratings migration rates, to estimate impairment impacts, and uses credit spread and interest rate movements from the 2008–2009 period to estimate mark to market changes. Management reviews the impacts of its stress test analyses on a quarterly basis.\nSensitivities\nAsset Management\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are primarily subject to interest rate risk through the investments of the funds we manage. For funds that pay management fees based on NAV or other bases that are sensitive to market value fluctuations, we anticipate our management fees would change consistent with the increase or decrease experienced by the underlying funds’ portfolios. In the event that interest rates were to increase by one percentage point, we estimate that management fees earned that were dependent upon estimated fair value would decrease by approximately $21 million and $21 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nCredit Risk\nSimilar to interest rate risk, we are also subject to credit risk through the investments of the funds we manage. In the event that credit spreads were to increase by one percentage point, we estimate that management fees earned that were dependent upon estimated fair value would decrease by approximately $21 million and $22 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe estimate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, a 10% decline in the rate of exchange of all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would result in the following declines in management fees and investment income (loss):\nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nManagement fees\n$\n29 \n$\n24 \nInvestment income (loss)\n3 \n1 \n1\n1\n We estimate a 10% decline in the rate of exchange of all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would result in increases in performance fees, included within investment income (loss), during the year ended December 31, 2023. As a result, such increases are not included within the decline in investment income (loss).\n \nNet Gains from Investment Activities and Investment Income\nOur assets and unrealized gains, and our related equity and net income are sensitive to changes in the valuations of the underlying investments of the funds we manage and could vary materially as a result of changes in our valuation assumptions and estimates. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies—Asset Management—Investments, at Fair Value” for details related to the valuation methods that are used and the key assumptions and estimates employed by such methods. We also quantify the Level 3 investments that are included on our consolidated statements of financial condition by valuation methodology in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. We employ a variety of valuation methods. Furthermore, the investments that we manage but are not on our consolidated statements of financial condition, and therefore impact performance fees, also employ a variety of valuation methods of which no single methodology is used more than any other. \n130\nTable of Contents\nManagement Fees\nManagement fees are primarily based on the net asset value of the relevant fund, gross assets, adjusted equity, capital commitments, invested capital, or as defined in the respective fund’s management agreements. Changes in the fair values of the investments that earn management fees based on net asset value, gross assets or adjusted equity will have a direct impact on the amount of management fees that are earned. Management fees earned that were dependent upon estimated fair value during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 would decrease by approximately $75 million and $58 million, respectively, if the fair values of the investments held by such funds were 10% lower during the same respective periods.\nManagement fees for equity funds we manage are generally charged on either (a) a fixed percentage of committed capital over a stated investment period or (b) a fixed percentage of invested capital of unrealized portfolio investments. Changes in values of investments could indirectly affect future management fees from such funds by, among other things, reducing the funds’ access to capital or liquidity and their ability to currently pay the management fees or if such change resulted in a write-down of investments below their associated invested capital.\nInvestment Income (Loss) and Net Gains from Investment Activities\nPerformance Allocations—\nPerformance allocations from the funds we manage generally are earned based on achieving specified performance criteria and are impacted directly by changes in the fair value of the funds’ investments. We anticipate that a 10% decline in the fair values of investments held by all of the funds we manage would decrease performance allocations by approximately $1.9 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nPrincipal Investment Income —\nFor select funds managed by Apollo, our share of income from equity method investments as a general partner in such funds is derived from unrealized gains or losses on investments in funds included in the consolidated financial statements. For funds in which we have an interest, but are not consolidated, our share of investment income is limited to our direct investments in the funds.\nWe anticipate that a 10% decline in the fair value of investments at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would result in an approximate $230 million and $247 million decrease in principal investment income and net gains (losses) from investment activities in our consolidated financial statements, respectively.\nRetirement Services\nInterest Rate Risk\nAthene assesses interest rate exposure for financial assets and liabilities using hypothetical stress tests and exposure analyses. Assuming all other factors are constant, if there was an immediate parallel increase in interest rates of 100 basis points from levels as of December 31, 2024, Athene estimates a net decrease to its point-in-time income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $3.0 billion, net of offsets. If there was a similar parallel increase in interest rates from levels as of December 31, 2023, Athene estimates a net decrease to its point-in-time income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $2.5 billion, net of offsets. The increase in sensitivity to point-in-time pre-tax income from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2024, when compared to December 31, 2023, was primarily driven by the growth experienced in 2024. The financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. These financial instruments include derivative instruments, embedded derivatives, mortgage loans, certain fixed maturity securities and market risk benefits. The sensitivity analysis excludes those financial instruments carried at fair value for which changes in fair value are recognized in equity, such as AFS fixed maturity securities.\n \nAssuming a 25 basis point increase in interest rates that persists for a 12-month period, the estimated impact to spread related earnings due to the change in net investment spread from floating rate assets and liabilities would be an increase of approximately $30 – $40 million, and a 25 basis point decrease would generally result in a similar decrease. This is calculated without regard to future changes to assumptions and excludes the impact of rate changes on cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2024 the balance in cash and cash equivalents plus restricted cash, net investment payables and receivables, reinsurance impacts and the net derivative collateral offsetting the related cash positions, was $6.8 billion, net of the amount attributable to the non-controlling interests. The decrease in sensitivity to spread related earnings due to the change in net investment spread from floating rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024, when compared to December 31, 2023, was \n131\nTable of Contents\ndriven by the decrease in Athene’s net floating rate position related to hedging actions as well as additional issuances of floating rate funding agreements in 2024.\nChanges in the fair value of market risk benefits due to current period movement in the interest rate curve used to discount the reserve are reflected in net income (loss) but excluded from spread related earnings. However, changes in interest rates that impact the cost of the projected GLWB and GMDB rider benefits, included within Athene’s market risk benefit reserve, are amortized within cost of funds in spread related earnings over the life of the business. Assuming a parallel increase in interest rates of 25 basis points, the estimated impact to spread related earnings over a 12-month period related to market risk benefits would be an increase of approximately $30 – $50 million, and a parallel decrease in interest rates of 25 basis points would generally result in a similar decrease. This is calculated without regard to future changes to assumptions.\nAthene is unable to make forward-looking estimates regarding the impact on net income (loss) of changes in interest rates that persist for a longer period of time, or changes in the shape of the yield curve over time, as a result of an inability to determine how such changes will affect certain of the items that Athene characterizes as “adjustments to income (loss) before income taxes” in its reconciliation between net income (loss) available to AHL common stockholder and spread related earnings. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Summary of Non-U.S. GAAP Measures” for the reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to AGM common stockholders to adjusted net income, of which spread related earnings is a component. The impact of changing rates on these adjustments is likely to be significant. See above for a discussion regarding the estimated impact on income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit of an immediate, parallel increase in interest rates of 100 basis points from levels as of December 31, 2024, which discussion encompasses the impact of such an increase on certain of the adjustment items. \nThe models used to estimate the impact of changes in market interest rates incorporate numerous assumptions, require significant estimates and assume an immediate change in interest rates without any discretionary management action to counteract such a change. Consequently, potential changes in Athene’s valuations indicated by these simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced under any given interest rate scenarios and these differences may be material. Because Athene actively manages its assets and liabilities, the net exposure to interest rates can vary over time. However, any such decreases in the fair value of fixed maturity securities, unless related to credit concerns of the issuer requiring recognition of credit losses, would generally be realized only if Athene were required to sell such securities at losses to meet liquidity needs.\nPublic Equity Risk\nAthene assesses public equity market risk for financial assets and liabilities using hypothetical stress tests and exposure analyses. Assuming all other factors are constant, if there was a decline in public equity market prices of 10% as of December 31, 2024, Athene estimates a net decrease to its point-in-time income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $617 million. As of December 31, 2023, Athene estimates that a decline in public equity market prices of 10% would cause a net decrease to its point-in-time income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments of $538 million. The increase in sensitivity to point-in-time income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2024, when compared to December 31, 2023, is primarily driven by equity market performance during the year, which has resulted in more equity exposure to public equity market price declines. The financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. These financial instruments include public equity investments, derivative instruments, market risk benefits and the FIA embedded derivative.\n132\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n \n(PCAOB ID No.\n34\n)\n134\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition\n138\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n140\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n141\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\n142\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n145\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n148\nNote 1.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \n134\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nFair Value of Certain Underlying Investments to Determine Performance Allocations— Refer to\n \nNote 2\n, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies \nand Note 4,\n Investments\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company, through its asset management business, recognizes performance allocations from certain funds it manages within investment income to the extent these funds meet or achieve certain performance criteria. The Company recognizes performance allocations each reporting period based on the terms outlined in the respective fund governing agreements. The change in the fair value of the underlying investments held by the funds is the significant input into the calculation of performance allocations to be recognized in investment income.\nCertain funds may hold significant illiquid investments whose fair values are based on unobservable inputs. These investments have limited observable market activity and the inputs used in the determination of the investments fair value require significant management judgement or estimation. Changes in the fair value of these investments directly impact the amount of performance allocations the Company is entitled to recognize as investment income for the period.\nWe considered the valuation of certain investments without readily determinable fair values used in the calculation of performance allocations as a critical audit matter because of the valuation techniques, assumptions, market impacts and the degree of subjectivity of certain unobservable inputs used in the valuation. Auditing the fair value of these investments required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased effort, including the involvement of our internal fair value specialists as needed, who possess significant fair value methodology and modeling expertise. \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation models and significant unobservable inputs utilized by the Company to estimate the fair value of certain illiquid investments held by the funds included the following, among others:\n•\nWe involved senior, more experienced audit team members in the performance of our audit procedures.\n•\nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s determination of the fair value of certain illiquid investments.\n•\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the valuation methods, assumptions and unobservable inputs used by the Company to determine the fair value of certain illiquid investments held by the funds.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s historical ability to accurately estimate the fair value of illiquid investments by comparing previous estimates of fair value to market transactions with third parties.\nValuation of Certain Structured Level 3 Asset-Backed Securities - Refer to Note 4\n, Investments, \nNote 7\n, Fair Value, \nand Note 18,\n Related Parties\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nInvestments in certain structured Level 3 asset-backed securities held by the Company, through its retirement services business, are reported at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. These investments without readily determinable market \n135\nTable of Contents\nvalues, are valued using significant unobservable inputs that involve considerable judgment by management. The Company uses internal modeling techniques based on projected cash flows and certain other unobservable inputs to value its structured Level 3 asset-backed securities. The significant unobservable inputs may include discount rates, issue specific credit adjustments, material non-public financial information, estimation of future earnings and cash flows, default rate assumptions, and liquidity assumptions.\nGiven that the Company utilizes valuation models and significant unobservable inputs to estimate the fair value for certain of its structured Level 3 asset-backed securities, performing audit procedures to evaluate these inputs required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the valuation models and significant unobservable inputs utilized by the Company to estimate the fair value of investments in certain structured Level 3 asset-backed securities included the following, among others:\n•\nWe involved senior, more experienced audit team members in the performance of our audit procedures.\n•\nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s determination of the fair value of these securities.\n•\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we:\n–\nEvaluated the valuation models and unobservable inputs used by the Company to estimate fair value for a sample of these securities.\n–\nDeveloped independent fair value estimates and compared our estimates to the Company’s estimates for a sample of these securities.\n•\nOn a sample basis, we evaluated the Company’s historical ability to accurately estimate the fair value of these securities by comparing previous estimates of fair value to market transactions with third parties adjusted for changes in market conditions. \nCertain Assumptions Used in the Valuation of Market Risk Benefits and Interest Sensitive Contract Liabilities - Refer to Note 2, \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n, Note 7, \nFair Value\n, and Note 11, \nLong-duration Contracts\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company determines estimated valuations of Market Risk Benefits and Interest Sensitive Contract Liabilities, which include embedded derivatives. The Company’s valuations are based on actuarial methodologies and include significant unobservable inputs associated with underlying economic and future policyholder behavior assumptions.\nSignificant judgment is applied by the Company in determining these assumptions. Specifically, the future policyholder behavior assumptions related to lapses and the use of benefit riders, as well as the assumptions for the future equity option costs or option budget and risk margin involve significant unobservable inputs and may materially impact the estimated valuation of Market Risk Benefits and Interest Sensitive Contract Liabilities, which include embedded derivatives.\nGiven the significant judgement involved with determining these economic and policyholder behavior assumptions, auditing these estimates requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our fair value and actuarial specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to these economic and policyholder behavior assumptions determined by the Company included the following, among others:\n•\nWe involved senior, more experienced audit team members, including fair value and actuarial specialists, to plan and perform audit procedures.\n•\nWe tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s development of these assumptions, including those controls over the underlying data.\n136\nTable of Contents\n•\nWith the assistance of our fair value and actuarial specialists, we:\n–\nEvaluated the methods, models, and judgements applied by the Company in determining these assumptions, including evaluating the results of experience studies or other data used as a basis for setting those assumptions.\n–\nEvaluated the reasonableness of the Company’s assumptions by comparing those selected by management to those independently developed by our fair value and actuarial specialists, drawing upon standard actuarial and industry practices.\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nNew York, NY\nFebruary 24, 2025\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2007.\n137\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Organization\n \nApollo Global Management, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, “Apollo” or the “Company”) is a high-growth, global alternative asset manager and a retirement services provider. Its asset management business focuses on \ntwo\n investing strategies: credit and equity. Through its asset management business, Apollo raises, invests and manages funds, accounts and other vehicles, on behalf of some of the world’s most prominent pension, endowment and sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies, as well as other institutional and individual investors. Apollo’s retirement services business is conducted by Athene, a leading financial services company that specializes in issuing, reinsuring and acquiring retirement savings products for the increasing number of individuals and institutions seeking to fund retirement needs.\nMerger with Athene\nOn January 1, 2022, Apollo and Athene completed the previously announced merger transactions pursuant to the Merger Agreement (the “Mergers”). As a result of the Mergers, AAM and AHL became consolidated subsidiaries of AGM. \nReferences herein to “Apollo” and the “Company” refer to AGM and its subsidiaries, including Athene, unless the context requires otherwise such as in sections where it refers to the asset management business only. See\n \nnote\n \n3 for additional information.\nCorporate Recapitalization\nIn connection with the closing of the Mergers, the Company completed a corporate recapitalization (the “Corporate Recapitalization”) which resulted in the recapitalization of the Company from an umbrella partnership C corporation (“Up-C”) structure to a corporation with a single class of common stock with \none\n vote per share.\nGriffin Capital Acquisitions\nOn March 1, 2022, the company completed the acquisition of Griffin Capital’s U.S. wealth distribution business. On May 3, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of the U.S. asset management business of Griffin Capital in exchange for closing consideration of $\n213\n million and contingent consideration of $\n64\n million, substantially all of which was settled in shares of AGM common stock, per the transaction agreement signed December 2, 2021.\n \n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The results of the Company and its subsidiaries are presented on a consolidated basis. Any ownership interest other than the Company’s interest in its subsidiaries is reflected as a non-controlling interest. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Management believes it has made all necessary adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) so that the consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and that any estimates made are reasonable and prudent. Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported amounts to conform to the current period’s presentation.\nFollowing the Mergers, the Company’s principal subsidiaries, AAM and AHL, together with their subsidiaries, operate an asset management business and a retirement services business, respectively, which possess distinct characteristics. As a result, the Company’s financial statement presentation is organized into \ntwo\n tiers: asset management and retirement services. The Company believes that separate presentation provides a more informative view of the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations than an aggregated presentation. \nThe following summary of significant accounting policies first includes those most significant to the overall Company and then specific accounting policies for each of the asset management and retirement services businesses, respectively.\n148\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSignificant Accounting Policies – Overall\nConsolidation \nThe Company consolidates entities where it has a controlling financial interest unless there is a specific scope exception that prevents consolidation. The types of entities with which the Company is involved generally include, but are not limited to:\n•\nsubsidiaries, which includes AAM and its subsidiaries, including management companies and general partners of funds that the Company manages, and AHL and its subsidiaries \n•\nfunds, including entities that have attributes of an investment company \n•\nCLOs\nEach of these entities is assessed for consolidation based on its specific facts and circumstances. In determining whether to consolidate an entity, the Company first evaluates whether the entity is a VIE or a VOE and applies the appropriate consolidation model as discussed below. If an entity is not consolidated, then the Company’s investment is generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting or as a financial instrument as discussed in the related policy discussions below.\n \nInvestment Companies\nJudgment is required to evaluate whether an entity has the necessary characteristics to be accounted for as an investment company under U.S. GAAP. The funds managed by the Company that meet the investment company criteria reflect their investments at fair value. The Company has retained this specialized accounting for investment companies in consolidation. \nVariable Interest Entities\nAll entities are first considered under the VIE model. VIEs are entities that 1) do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support or 2) have equity investors at risk that do not have the ability to make significant decisions related to the entity’s operations, absorb expected losses, or receive expected residual returns. \nThe Company consolidates a VIE if it is the primary beneficiary of the entity. The Company is deemed the primary beneficiary when it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE, which is defined as possessing both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance (“primary beneficiary power”) and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (“significant variable interest”). The Company performs the VIE and primary beneficiary assessment at inception of its involvement with a VIE and on an ongoing basis if facts and circumstances change. \nTo assess whether the Company has the primary beneficiary power under the VIE consolidation model, it considers the design of the entity as well as ongoing rights and responsibilities. In general, the parties that can make the most significant decisions regarding asset management have control over servicing, liquidation rights or the unilateral right to remove the decision-makers. To assess whether the Company has a significant variable interest, the Company considers all its economic interests that are considered variable interests in the entity, including interests held through related parties. This assessment requires judgment in considering whether those interests are significant. \nAssets and liabilities of the consolidated VIEs are primarily shown in separate sections within the consolidated statements of financial condition. Changes in the fair value of the consolidated VIEs’ assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income and expenses are primarily presented within net gains from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities in the consolidated statements of operations. The portion attributable to non-controlling interests is reported within net income attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of operations. For additional disclosures regarding VIEs, see notes 6 and 18.\nVoting Interest Entities\nEntities that are not determined to be VIEs are generally considered VOEs. Under the voting interest model, the Company consolidates those entities it controls through a majority voting interest. The Company does not consolidate those VOEs in which substantive kick-out rights have been granted to the unrelated investors to either dissolve the fund or remove the general partner.\n149\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNon-controlling Interests\nFor entities that are consolidated, but not wholly owned, a portion of the income or loss and corresponding equity is allocated to owners other than the Company. The aggregate of the income or loss and corresponding equity that is not owned by the Company is included in non-controlling interests in the consolidated financial statements. Non-controlling interests also include ownership interests in certain consolidated funds and VIEs. \nNon-controlling interests are presented as a separate component of equity on the Company’s consolidated statements of financial condition. Net income (loss) includes the net income (loss) attributable to the holders of non-controlling interests on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. Profits and losses are allocated to non-controlling interests in proportion to their relative ownership interests regardless of their basis.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and related footnotes. The Company’s most significant estimates include goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, performance allocations, incentive fees, non-cash compensation, fair value of investments (including derivatives) and debt, impairment of investments and allowances for expected credit losses, and future policy benefit reserves. While such impact may change considerably over time, the estimates and assumptions affecting the Company’s consolidated financial statements are based on the best available information as of December 31, 2024. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments, including money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities, with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Interest income from cash and cash equivalents is recorded in other income for asset management and net investment income for retirement services in the consolidated statements of operations. The carrying values of the money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities represent their fair values due to their short-term nature. Substantially all of the Company’s cash on deposit is in interest bearing accounts with major financial institutions and exceed insured limits.\nRestricted Cash and Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents represent balances that are restricted as to withdrawal or usage.\nRestricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalents held in funds in trust as part of certain coinsurance agreements to secure statutory reserves and liabilities of the coinsured parties. Restricted cash also includes cash deposited at a bank that is pledged as collateral in connection with leased premises.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company holds foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. Non-monetary assets and liabilities of the Company’s international subsidiaries are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates specific to each asset and liability, the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period are used for all others. The results of the Company’s foreign operations are remeasured using an average exchange rate for the respective reporting period. Currency remeasurement adjustments and gains and losses on the settlement of foreign currency translations are included within other income (loss), net for asset management or investment related gains (losses) for retirement services in the consolidated statements of operations. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Currency translation adjustments are included within other comprehensive income (loss), before tax within the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). The change in unrealized foreign currency exchange of any non-U.S. dollar denominated AFS securities are included in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) unless they are designated as part of a fair value hedge.\n150\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInvestments \nEquity Method Investments\n \nFor investments in entities over which the Company exercises significant influence but does not meet the requirements for consolidation and has not elected the fair value option, the Company uses the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records its share of the underlying income or loss of such entities adjusted for distributions. The Company’s share of the underlying net income or loss of such entities is recorded in investment income (loss) for asset management and net investment income for retirement services in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe carrying amounts of equity method investments are recorded in investments or investments in related parties in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Generally, the underlying entities that the Company manages and invests in are primarily investment companies, and the carrying value of the Company’s equity method investments approximates fair value.\nOther Investments\n \nThe Company elected to account for certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values that did not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair values based on NAV per share (or its equivalent) at cost less impairment, subject to adjustments based on observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\n \nReverse Repurchase Agreements and Repurchase Agreements\nA reverse repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the Company purchases financial instruments from a seller and simultaneously enters into an agreement to resell the same or substantially the same financial instruments to the seller at a fixed and determinable price at a future date. A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the Company sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substant\nially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a fixed and determinable price at a future date. \nAlthough reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements generally involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial \ninstruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements because they require the financial instruments to be resold or repurchased before or at the maturity of the agreement. As a result, the collateral received under reverse repurchase agreements are not recognized and the collateral pledged under repurchase agreements are not derecognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition. \nWithin asset management, reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements generally sit within consolidated VIEs and as such, those reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements are reflected as investments and other liabilities, respectively, within the consolidated VIE section of the statements of financial condition. Additionally, the income (loss) related to those reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements from consolidated VIEs are included in net gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities on the consolidated statements of operations. Reverse repurchase agreements within asset management are generally accounted for by electing the fair value option. For retirement services, the receivable under the reverse repurchase agreement is recorded as investment for the principal amount loan\ned under the agreement and the payable under a repurchase agreement is recognized as payables for collateral on derivatives and securities to repurchase on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Earnings from reverse repurchase agreements are included in net investment income for retirement services on the consolidated statements of operations. \nFor reverse repurchase agreements, the Company generally requires collateral with a fair value at least equal to the carrying value of the loaned amount, monitors the market value of the collateral on a periodic basis, and delivers or obtains additional collateral due to changes in the fair value of the collateral, as appropriate, in order to mitigate credit exposure.\n \nFinancial Instruments held by Consolidated VIEs\nThe consolidated VIEs managed by the Company are primarily investment companies and CLOs. Their investments include debt and equity securities held at fair value and reverse repurchase agreements. Financial instruments are generally accounted for on a trade date basis.\n151\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUnder a measurement alternative permissible for consolidated collateralized financing entities, the Company measures both the financial assets and financial liabilities of consolidated CLOs in its consolidated financial statements in both cases using the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever are more observable.\nWhere financial assets are more observable, the financial assets of the consolidated CLOs are measured at fair value and the financial liabilities are measured in consolidation as: (i) the sum of the fair value of the financial assets and the carrying value of any non-financial assets that are incidental to the operations of the CLOs less (ii) the sum of the fair value of any beneficial interests retained by the Company (other than those that represent compensation for services) and the Company’s carrying value of any beneficial interests that represent compensation for services. The resulting amount is allocated to the individual financial liabilities (other than the beneficial interest retained by the Company) using a reasonable and consistent methodology. \nWhere financial liabilities are more observable, the financial liabilities of the consolidated CLOs are measured at fair value and the financial assets are measured in consolidation as: (i) the sum of the fair value of the financial liabilities, and the carrying value of any non-financial liabilities that are incidental to the operations of the CLOs less (ii) the carrying value of any non-financial assets that are incidental to the operations of the CLOs. The resulting amount is allocated to the individual financial assets using a reasonable and consistent methodology. \nNet income (loss) attributable to Apollo Global Management, Inc. reflects the Company’s own economic interests in the consolidated CLOs, including (i) changes in the fair value of the beneficial interests retained by the Company and (ii) beneficial interests that represent compensation for collateral management services.\nCertain consolidated VIEs have applied the fair value option for certain investments in private debt securities that otherwise would not have been carried at fair value with gains and losses in net income.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The actual realized gains or losses will depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale, all of which may ultimately differ significantly from the assumptions on which the valuations were based. \nFair Value Option\nEntities are permitted to elect the fair value option (“FVO”) to carry at fair value certain financial assets and financial liabilities, including investments otherwise accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The FVO election is irrevocable and is applied to financial instruments on an individual basis at initial recognition or at eligible remeasurement events.\n Please refer to note 7 for additional information and other instances of when the Company has elected the FVO.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nU.S. GAAP establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework which prioritizes and ranks the level of market price observability used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. Market price observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace, including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants. Financial instruments with readily available quoted prices in active markets generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment used in measuring fair value.\nFinancial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values, as follows:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical financial instruments as of the reporting date. The Company does not adjust the quoted price for these financial instruments, even in situations where the Company holds a large position and the sale of such position would likely deviate from the quoted price.\nLevel 2 – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of models or other valuation \n152\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nmethodologies. These financial instruments exhibit higher levels of liquid market observability as compared to Level 3 financial instruments. \nLevel 3 – Pricing inputs are unobservable for the financial instrument and includes situations where there is little observable market activity for the financial instrument. The inputs into the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Financial instruments that are included in this category generally include investments where the fair value is based on observable inputs as well as unobservable inputs.\nWhen a security is valued based on broker quotes, the Company subjects those quotes to various criteria in making the determination as to whether a particular financial instrument would qualify for classification as Level 2 or Level 3. These criteria include, but are not limited to, the number and quality of the broker quotes, the standard deviations of the observed broker quotes, and the percentage deviation from external pricing services.\nInvestments in securities that are traded on a securities exchange or comparable over-the-counter quotation systems are valued based on Apollo’s pricing procedures, which utilize third party pricing vendors, broker dealers and closing prices from exchanges. If no sales of such investments are reported on such date, and in the case of over-the-counter securities or other investments for which the last sale date is not available, valuations are based on independent market quotations obtained from market participants, recognized pricing services or other sources deemed relevant, and the prices are based on the average of the “bid” and “ask” prices, or at ascertainable prices at the close of business on such day. Market quotations are generally based on valuation pricing models or market transactions of similar securities adjusted for security-specific factors such as relative capital structure priority and interest and yield risks, among other factors. When market quotations are not available, a model-based approach is used to determine fair value.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, a financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument when the fair value is based on unobservable inputs.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting where the consideration transferred for the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed using the fair values determined by management as of the acquisition date. Contingent consideration obligations that are elements of the consideration transferred are recognized as of the acquisition date as part of the fair value transferred in exchange for the acquired business. Acquisition-related costs incurred in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired business. Goodwill is recorded in separate line items for both the Asset Management and Retirement Services segments. See note 3 for disclosure regarding the goodwill recorded related to the Mergers.\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The impairment test is performed at the reporting unit level, which is generally at the level of the Company’s reportable segments. The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2024 and 2023 and did not identify any impairment.\n \nOther Assets \nOther assets are primarily comprised of deferred tax assets, leases and fixed assets. \nFixed assets consist primarily of leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures, equipment, and computer hardware and are recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the assets’ estimated useful lives and in the case of leasehold improvements the lesser of the useful life or the term of the lease. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. The Company \n153\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nevaluates long-lived assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may be impaired.\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation consists of (i) salary, bonus, and benefits, which includes base salaries, discretionary and non-discretionary bonuses, severance and employee benefits, (ii) equity-based awards granted to employees and non-employees that are measured based on the grant date fair value of the award and (iii) profit sharing expense, which primarily consists of a portion of performance revenues earned from certain funds that are allocated to employees and former employees. Compensation costs are recorded in compensation and benefits for asset management and policy and other operating expense for retirement services in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEmployees and non-employees who provide services to the Company are granted equity-based awards as compensation that are measured based on the grant date fair value of the award. Equity-based awards that do not require future service (\ni.e.\n, vested awards) are expensed immediately. Equity-based employee awards that require future service are expensed over the relevant period of service. Equity-based awards that require performance metrics to be met are expensed only when the performance metric is met or deemed probable. Profit sharing amounts are recognized as the related performance revenues are earned. Accordingly, profit sharing amounts can be reversed during periods when there is a decline in performance revenues that were previously recognized. Profit sharing amounts are generally not paid until the related performance revenue is distributed to the general partner upon realization of the fund’s investments (which may be distributed in cash or in-kind).\nEarnings Per Share\nAs the Company has issued participating securities, the two-class method of computing earnings per share is used for all periods presented for common stock and participating securities as if all earnings for the period had been distributed. Under the two-class method, during periods of net income, the net income is first reduced for distributions declared on all classes of securities to arrive at undistributed earnings. During periods of net losses, the net loss is reduced for distributions declared on participating securities only if the security has the right to participate in the earnings of the entity and an objectively determinable contractual obligation to share in net losses of the entity. Participating securities include vested and unvested RSUs that participate in distributions, as well as unvested restricted shares.\nWhether during a period of net income or net loss, under the two-class method the remaining earnings are allocated to common stock and participating securities to the extent that each security shares in earnings as if all of the earnings for the period had been distributed. Earnings or losses allocated to each class of security are then divided by the applicable weighted average outstanding shares to arrive at basic earnings per share. For the diluted earnings, the denominator includes all outstanding shares of common stock and includes the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The numerator is adjusted for any changes in income or loss that would result from the issuance of these potential shares of common stock.\nShare Repurchase\nWhen shares are repurchased, the Company can choose to record treasury shares or account for the repurchase as a constructive retirement. The Company accounted for share repurchases as constructive retirement, whereby it reduced common stock and additional paid-in capital by the amount of the original issuance, with any excess purchase price recorded as a reduction to retained earnings. Under this method, issued and outstanding shares are reduced by the shares repurchased, and no treasury stock is recognized on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nIncome Taxes \nAGM is a Delaware corporation and generally all of its income is subject to U.S. corporate income taxes. Certain subsidiaries of the Company operate as partnerships for U.S. income tax purposes and are subject to NYC UBT. Certain non-U.S. entities are also subject to non-U.S. corporate income taxes. In conjunction with the Mergers, Apollo underwent a reorganization from an Up-C structure to a C-corporation with a single class of common stock. Prior to the Mergers, Athene, and certain of its non-U.S. subsidiaries were not subject to U.S. corporate income taxes on their earnings. Due to the Mergers, Athene’s non-U.S. earnings will generally be subject to U.S. corporate income taxes.\n154\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSignificant judgment is required in determining tax expense and in evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions. The Company recognizes the tax benefit of uncertain tax positions only where the position is “more likely than not” to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized. The Company’s tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether the Company has uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases using currently enacted tax rates. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period during which the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nSignificant judgment and estimates are required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established as well as the amount of such allowances. When making such determination, consideration is given to, among other things, the following:\n•\nwhether sufficient taxable income exists within the allowed carryback or carryforward periods;\n•\nwhether future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will occur, including any tax planning strategies that could be used;\n•\nthe nature or character (\ne.g.\n, ordinary vs. capital) of the deferred tax assets and liabilities; and\n•\nwhether future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards exists.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nDebt issuance costs consist of costs incurred in obtaining financing and are amortized over the term of the financing using the effective interest method. These costs are generally recorded as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements \nIncome Taxes—Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures (ASU 2023-09)\nIn December 2023, the FASB made amendments to update disclosures on income taxes including rate reconciliation, income taxes paid, and certain amendments on disaggregation by federal, state, and foreign taxes, as relevant.\nThe guidance is mandatorily effective for the Company for annual periods beginning in 2025; however, early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements. \nIntangibles—Goodwill and Other—Crypto Assets: Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets (ASU 2023-08)\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued amendments on the accounting for and disclosure of crypto assets. The guidance requires assets that meet certain conditions be accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The ASU also requires disclosures about significant holdings, contractual sale restrictions, and changes during the reporting period.\nThe guidance is mandatorily effective for the Company on January 1, 2025. The Company expects the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements to be immaterial. \nBusiness Combinations – Joint Venture Formations (ASU 2023-05)\nThe amendments in this update address how a joint venture initially recognizes and measures contributions received at its formation date. The amendments require a joint venture to apply a new basis of accounting upon formation and to initially recognize its assets and liabilities at fair value. \nThe guidance is effective prospectively for all joint ventures formed on or after January 1, 2025, while retrospective application may be elected for a joint venture formed before the effective date. The Company expects the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements to be immaterial.\n155\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCompensation – Stock Compensation (ASU 2024-01)\nIn March 2024, the FASB issued guidance in ASU 2024-01 that clarifies how an entity determines whether it is required to account for profits interest awards (and similar awards) in accordance with ASC 718 or other guidance. The ASU provides specific examples on when a profits interest award should be accounted for as a share-based payment arrangement under ASC 718 or in a manner similar to a cash bonus or profit-sharing arrangement under ASC 710 or other ASC topics. \nThe guidance is mandatorily effective for the Company on January 1, 2025. The Company expects the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements to be immaterial. \nIncome Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (ASU 2024-03)\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance that requires disaggregation of certain expense captions into specified categories in disclosures within the footnotes to the financial statements. The ASU requires tabular presentation of each relevant expense caption on the face of the income statement including employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and certain other expenses, when applicable.\nThe guidance is mandatorily effective for the Company in its 2027 annual report and in interim periods in 2028; early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new pronouncement on its consolidated financial statements. \nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSegment Reporting – Improvements to Reporting Segment Disclosures (ASU 2023-07) \nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to incrementally add disclosures for public entities’ reporting segments including significant segment expenses and other segment items. \nThe Company adopted the guidance for the annual reporting period ended December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 21, \nSegments\n, for the expanded disclosures.\nInvestments– Equity Method and Joint Ventures (ASU 2023-02)\nIn March 2023, the FASB issued guidance to introduce the option of applying the proportional amortization method (“PAM”) to account for investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits or other income tax benefits when certain requirements are met. Previously, PAM only applied to low-income housing tax credit investments. \nThe Company early adopted the guidance on October 1, 2023, and there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nFair Value Measurement — Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions (ASU 2022-03)\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued clarifying guidance that a restriction which is a characteristic of the holding entity rather than a characteristic of the equity security itself should not be considered in its fair value measurement. As a result, the Company is required to measure the fair value of equity securities subject to contractual restrictions attributable to the holding entity on the basis of the market price of the same equity security without those contractual restrictions. Companies are not permitted to recognize a contractual sale restriction attributable to the holding entity as a separate unit of account. The guidance also requires disclosures for these equity securities. \nThe Company early adopted the guidance on July 1, 2023. The Company applied the guidance on a prospective basis, and there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\n156\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848) — Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 (ASU 2022-06, ASU 2021-01, ASU 2020-04)\nThe Company adopted ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 and elected to apply certain of the practical expedients related to contract modifications, hedge accounting relationships, and derivative modifications pertaining to discounting, margining, or contract price alignment. The main purpose of the practical expedients is to ease the administrative burden of accounting for contracts impacted by reference rate reform, and these elections did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. ASU 2022-06 amended and deferred the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024, after which the Company will no longer be permitted to apply the expedients provided in Topic 848.\nSignificant Accounting Policies – Asset Management\nU.S. Treasury Securities, at fair value\nU.S. Treasury securities, at fair value includes U.S. Treasury bills with original maturities greater than three months when purchased. These securities are recorded at fair value in investments in the consolidated statements of financial condition. Interest income on such securities is separately presented from the overall change in fair value and is recognized in interest income for asset management in the consolidated statements of operations. Any remaining change in fair value of such securities, that is not recognized as interest income, is recognized in net gains (losses) from investment activities for asset management in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nDue from/to Related Parties\nDue from/to related parties includes amounts due from and due to existing employees, certain former employees, portfolio companies of the funds and non-consolidated funds.\nDeferred Revenue\nApollo records deferred revenue, which is a type of contract liability, when consideration is received in advance of management services provided. Deferred revenue is reversed and recognized as revenue over the period that the agreed upon services are performed. It is included in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nApollo also earns management fees which are subject to an offset. When Apollo receives cash for advisory and transaction fees, a certain percentage of such advisory and/or transaction fees, as applicable, is allocated as a credit to reduce future management fees, otherwise payable by the relevant fund. Such credit is recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated statements of financial condition within the accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities line item. A portion of any excess advisory and transaction fees may be required to be returned to the limited partners of certain funds upon such fund’s liquidation. As the management fees earned by Apollo are presented on a gross basis, any management fee offsets calculated are presented as a reduction to advisory and transaction fees in the consolidated statements of operations. \nAdditionally, Apollo earns advisory fees pursuant to the terms of the advisory agreements with certain of the portfolio companies that are owned by the funds Apollo manages. When Apollo receives a payment from a portfolio company that exceeds the advisory fees earned at that point in time, the excess payment is recorded as deferred revenue in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The advisory agreements with the portfolio companies vary in duration and the associated fees are received monthly, quarterly, or annually.\nDeferred revenue is reversed and recognized as revenue over the period that the agreed upon services are performed. There was $\n155\n million of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 that was previously deferred as of January 1, 2024.\nUnder the terms of the funds’ partnership agreements, Apollo is normally required to bear organizational expenses over a set dollar amount and placement fees or costs in connection with the offering and sale of interests in the funds it manages to investors. In cases where the limited partners of the funds are determined to be the customer in an arrangement, placement fees may be capitalized as a cost to acquire a customer contract and amortized over the life of the customer contract. Capitalized placement fees are recorded within other assets in the consolidated statements of financial condition, while amortization is recorded within general, administrative and other in the consolidated statements of operations. In certain instances, the placement fees are paid over a period of time. Based on the management agreements with the funds, Apollo considers \n157\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nplacement fees and organizational costs paid in determining if cash has been received in excess of the management fees earned. Placement fees and organizational costs are normally the obligation of Apollo but can be paid for by the funds. When these costs are paid by the fund, the resulting obligations are included within deferred revenue. The deferred revenue balance will also be reduced during future periods when management fees are earned but not paid.\nRedeemable non-controlling interests\nRedeemable non-controlling interests are attributable to VIEs and, for periods prior to December 31, 2023, primarily represented the shares issued by the Company’s previously consolidated SPACs. The redeemable non-controlling interests are initially recorded at their original issue price, net of issuance costs and the initial fair value of separately traded warrants. The carrying amount is accreted to its redemption value over the period from the date of issuance to the earliest redemption date of the instrument. The accretion to redemption value is generally recorded against additional paid-in capital.\n \nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, our consolidated SPACs were liquidated in accordance with their governing documents, and all of their outstanding shares were redeemed. Refer to note 18 for further detail.\nRevenues\nThe revenues of the asset management business include (i) management fees; (ii) advisory and transaction fees, net; (iii) investment income, which is comprised of performance allocations and principal investment income; and (iv) incentive fees. \nThe revenue guidance requires that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services (\ni.e.\n, the transaction price). When determining the transaction price under the revenue guidance, an entity may recognize variable consideration only to the extent that it is probable to not be significantly reversed. The revenue guidance also requires disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. \nPerformance allocations are accounted for under guidance applicable to equity method investments, and therefore not within the scope of the revenue guidance. Apollo recognizes performance allocations within investment income along with the related principal investment income (as further described below) in the consolidated statements of operations and within the investments line in the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nRefer to disclosures below for additional information on each of the revenue streams of the asset management business.\nManagement Fees\nManagement fees are recognized over time during the periods in which the related services are performed in accordance with the contractual terms of the related agreement. Management fees are generally based on (1) a percentage of the capital committed during the commitment period, and thereafter based on the remaining invested capital of unrealized investments, or (2) net asset value, gross assets or as otherwise provided in the respective agreements. Included in management fees are certain expense reimbursements where Apollo is considered the principal under the agreements and is required to record the expense and related reimbursement revenue on a gross basis.\nAdvisory and Transaction Fees, Net\nAdvisory and transaction fees generally include arranging fees and structuring fees related to Apollo’s funds, portfolio companies of Apollo funds and third parties, including management consulting fees and directors’ fees. The Company evaluates its contractual obligations in accordance with the terms of the related legal agreements when determining whether there is an identifiably distinct performance obligation. Depending on the identifiably distinct service, advisory and transaction fees may be recognized at a point in time or over time. Advisory and transaction fees associated with deal completion are generally recognized at the point in time of completion. Certain other advisory fees that are associated with an identifiably distinct structuring service are recognized over time as the underlying structuring services are provided.  \nThe amounts due from fund portfolio companies are recorded in due from related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Under the terms of the limited partnership agreements for certain funds, the management fee payable by the funds may be subject to a reduction based on a certain percentage of such advisory and transaction fees, net of applicable \n158\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nbroken deal costs. Advisory and transaction fees are reduced by these management fee offsets in the consolidated statements of operations. \nUnderwriting fees, which are also included within advisory and transaction fees, net, include gains, losses and fees, arising from securities offerings in which one of the Company’s subsidiaries participates in the underwriter syndicate. Underwriting fees are recognized at a point in time when the underwriting is completed. Underwriting fees recognized but not received are recorded in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nDuring the normal course of business, Apollo incurs certain costs related to certain transactions that are not consummated, or “broken deal costs”. These costs (\ne.g.\n, research costs, due diligence costs, professional fees, legal fees and other related items) are determined to be broken deal costs upon management’s decision to no longer pursue the transaction. In accordance with the related fund agreement, in the event the deal is deemed broken, all of the costs are reimbursed by the funds and then included as a component of the calculation of the management fee offset. If a deal is successfully completed, Apollo is reimbursed by the fund or fund’s portfolio company for all costs incurred and no offset is generated. As Apollo acts as an agent for the funds it manages, any transaction costs incurred and paid by Apollo on behalf of the respective funds relating to successful or broken deals are recorded net on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, and any receivable from the respective funds is recorded in due from related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nInvestment Income\nInvestment income is comprised of performance allocations and principal investment income.\nPerformance Allocations. \nPerformance allocations are a type of performance revenue (\ni.e.\n, income earned based on the extent to which an entity’s performance exceeds predetermined thresholds). Performance allocations are generally structured from a legal standpoint as an allocation of capital in which Apollo’s capital account receives allocations of the returns of an entity when those returns exceed predetermined thresholds. The determination of which performance revenues are considered performance allocations is primarily based on the terms of an agreement with the entity.\nApollo recognizes performance allocations within investment income along with the related principal investment income (as described further below) in the consolidated statements of operations and within the investments line in the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nWhen applicable, Apollo may record a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance allocations. The general partner obligation is based upon an assumed liquidation of a fund’s net assets as of the reporting date and is reported within due to related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The actual determination and any required payment of any such general partner obligation would not take place until the final disposition of a fund’s investments based on the contractual termination of the fund or as otherwise set forth in the respective governing document of the fund.\nPrincipal Investment Income. \nPrincipal investment income includes Apollo’s income or loss from equity method investments and certain other investments in entities in which Apollo is generally eligible to receive performance allocations. Income from equity method investments includes Apollo’s share of net income or loss generated from its investments, which are not consolidated, but in which it exerts significant influence.\nIncentive Fees\nIncentive fees are a type of performance revenue. Incentive fees differ from performance allocations in that incentive fees do not represent an allocation of capital but rather a contractual fee arrangement with the entity. Incentive fees are considered a form of variable consideration as they are subject to clawback or reversal and therefore must be deferred until the fees are probable to not be significantly reversed. Accrued but unpaid incentive fees are reported within other assets in Apollo’s consolidated statements of financial condition. Apollo’s incentive fees are generally received from CLOs, managed accounts and certain other vehicles it manages.\n \nProfit Sharing\nProfit sharing expense and profit sharing payable primarily consist of a portion of performance revenues earned from certain funds that are allocated to employees and former employees. Profit sharing amounts are recognized as the related performance revenues are earned. Accordingly, profit sharing amounts can be reversed during periods when there is a decline in performance \n159\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrevenues that were previously recognized. Profit sharing expense is recorded in compensation and benefits for asset management in the consolidated statements of operations. Profit sharing payable is recorded in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities for Asset Management in the consolidated statements of financial condition. \nProfit sharing amounts are generally not paid until the related performance revenue is distributed to the general partner upon realization of the fund’s investments. Under certain profit-sharing arrangements, Apollo requires that a portion of certain of the performance revenues distributed to its employees be used to purchase restricted common stock issued under the Equity Plan. Prior to distribution of the performance revenue, the Company records the value of the equity-based awards expected to be granted in other assets and other liabilities within the consolidated statements of financial condition. Such equity-based awards are recorded as equity-based compensation expense over the relevant service period once granted.\nAdditionally, profit sharing amounts previously distributed may be subject to clawback from employees and former employees. When applicable, the accrual for potential clawback of previously distributed profit sharing amounts, which is a component of due from related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition, represents all amounts previously distributed to employees and former employees that would need to be returned to the general partner if the funds were to be liquidated based on the fair value of the underlying fund’s investments as of the reporting date. The actual general partner receivable, however, would not become realized until the final disposition of a fund’s investments based on the contractual termination of the fund or as otherwise set forth in the respective governing document of the fund.\nProfit sharing payable also includes contingent consideration obligations that were recognized in connection with certain acquisitions. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as compensation and benefits for asset management.\nApollo has performance-based incentive arrangements for certain employees designed to more closely align compensation on an annual basis with the overall realized performance of the Company’s asset management business. These arrangements enable certain employees to earn discretionary compensation based on performance revenue earned by Apollo’s asset management business in a given year, which amounts are reflected in compensation and benefits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for asset management. Apollo may also use dividends it receives from investments in certain perpetual capital vehicles to compensate employees. These amounts are recorded as compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of operations for asset management.\nOther Income (Loss)\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities\nNet gains (losses) from investment activities include both realized gains and losses and the change in unrealized gains and losses in Apollo’s investments, at fair value between the opening reporting date and the closing reporting date.\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities\nChanges in the fair value of the consolidated VIEs’ assets and liabilities and related interest, dividend and other income and expenses are presented within net gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities and are attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated statements of operations.\nOther Income (Loss), Net\nOther income (loss), net includes the recognition of gains (losses) arising from the remeasurement of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, gains arising from the remeasurement of the tax receivable agreement liability (see note 18), and other miscellaneous non-operating income and expenses.\n160\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSignificant Accounting Policies – Retirement Services\nInvestments \nFixed Maturity Securities\nFixed maturity securities include bonds, CLOs, ABS, RMBS, CMBS and redeemable preferred stock. Athene classifies fixed maturity securities as AFS or trading at the time of purchase and subsequently carries them at fair value. Classification is dependent on a variety of factors, including expected holding period, election of the fair value option and asset and liability matching. \nAFS Securities\nAFS securities are held at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition, with unrealized gains and losses, exclusive of allowances for expected credit losses, generally reflected in AOCI on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Unrealized gains or losses relating to identified risks within AFS securities in fair value hedging relationships are reflected in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. \nTrading Securities\nThe fair value option is elected for certain fixed maturity securities. These fixed maturity securities are classified as trading, with changes to fair value included in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Although the securities are classified as trading, the trading activity related to these investments is primarily focused on asset and liability matching activities and is not intended to be an income strategy based on active trading. As such, the activity related to these investments on the consolidated statements of cash flows is classified as investing activities. \nTransactions in securities are generally recorded on a trade date basis, with any unsettled trades recorded in other assets or other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Bank loans, private placements and investment funds are recorded on a settlement date basis.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities include common stock, mutual funds and non-redeemable preferred stock. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Investments\nAthene purchases certain structured securities, primarily RMBS, which upon assessment have been determined to meet the definition of PCD investments. Additionally, structured securities classified as beneficial interests follow the initial measurement guidance for PCD investments if there is a significant difference between contractual cash flows adjusted for expected prepayments and expected cash flows at the date of recognition. The initial allowance for credit losses for PCD investments is recorded through a gross-up adjustment to the initial amortized cost. For structured securities classified as beneficial interests, the initial allowance is calculated as the present value of the difference between contractual cash flows adjusted for expected prepayments and expected cash flows at the date of recognition. The non-credit purchase discount or premium is amortized into investment income using the effective interest method. The credit discount, represented by the allowance for expected credit losses, is remeasured each period following the policies for measuring credit losses described in the “Credit Losses – Available-for-Sale Securities” section below. \nMortgage Loans \nAthene elected the fair value option on its mortgage loan portfolio. Interest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on its contractual interest rate. Interest is accrued on loans until it is probable it will not be received, or the loan is 90 days past due, unless guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies. Interest income and prepayment fees are reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in the fair value of the mortgage loan portfolio are reported in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations.\n161\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInvestment Funds \nAthene invests in certain non-fixed income, alternative investments in the form of limited partnerships or similar legal structures (investment funds). For investment funds in which it does not hold a controlling financial interest, Athene typically accounts for such investments using the equity method, where the cost is recorded as an investment in the fund, or it has elected the fair value option. Adjustments to the carrying amount reflect pro rata ownership percentage of the operating results as indicated by NAV in the investment fund financial statements, which can be on a lag of up to three months when investee information is not received in a timely manner. \nAthene’s proportionate share of investment fund income is recorded within net investment income, or, for consolidated VIEs, revenues of consolidated VIEs, on the consolidated statements of operations. Contributions paid or distributions received by Athene are recorded directly to the investment fund balance as an increase to carrying value or as a return of capital, respectively. \nPolicy Loans\nPolicy loans are funds provided to policyholders in return for a claim on the policyholder’s account balance. The funds provided are limited to a specified percentage of the account balance. The majority of policy loans do not have a stated maturity and the balances and accrued interest are repaid with proceeds from the policyholder’s account balance. Policy loans are reported at the unpaid principal balance. Interest income is recorded as earned using the contract interest rate and is reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. \nFunds Withheld at Interest\nFunds withheld at interest represents a receivable for amounts contractually withheld by ceding companies in accordance with funds withheld coinsurance (“funds withheld”) and modified coinsurance (“modco”) reinsurance agreements in which Athene is the reinsurer. Generally, assets equal to statutory reserves are withheld and legally owned by the ceding company, and any excess or shortfall is settled periodically. The underlying agreements contain embedded derivatives as discussed below. \nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments consist of financial instruments with maturities of greater than three months but less than twelve months when purchased. Short-term debt securities are accounted for as trading or AFS consistent with the policies for those investments. Short-term loans are carried at amortized cost. Fair values are determined consistently with methodologies described in note 7 for the respective investment type.\nOther Investments \nOther investments include, but are not limited to, term loans collateralized by mortgages on residential and commercial real estate, other uncollateralized loans, investments in real estate and corporate owned life insurance. Athene elected the fair value option on the term loans and other uncollateralized loans. Investments in real estate are held at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairments. Corporate owned life insurance is held at cash surrender value. \nInterest income is accrued on the principal amount of the loan based on its contractual interest rate. Interest on loans is accrued until it is probable it will not be received or the loan is 90 days past due. Changes in the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance, interest income, amortization of premiums and discounts, and prepayment and other fees are reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. Changes in fair value are reported in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations.\nInvestment Income \nInvestment income is recognized as it accrues or is legally due, net of investment management and custody fees. Investment income on fixed maturity securities includes coupon interest, as well as the amortization of any premium and the accretion of any discount. Investment income on equity securities represents dividend income and preferred coupon interest. Realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains and losses on investments sold are determined based on a first-in first-out method.\n \n162\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCredit Losses – Available-for-Sale Securities and Other\nAFS securities with a fair value that has declined below amortized cost are evaluated to determine how the decline in fair value should be recognized. If Athene determines, based on the facts and circumstances related to the specific security, that Athene intends to sell a security or it is more likely than not that Athene would be required to sell a security before the recovery of its amortized cost, any existing allowance for expected credit losses is reversed and the amortized cost of the security is written down to fair value. If neither of these conditions exist, Athene evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from a credit loss or other factors.\nFor non-structured AFS securities, relevant facts and circumstances are qualitatively considered in evaluating whether a decline below fair value is credit-related. Relevant facts and circumstances include but are not limited to: (1) the extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost; (2) changes in agency credit ratings, (3) adverse conditions related to the security’s industry or geographical area, (4) failure to make scheduled payments, and (5) other known changes in the financial condition of the issuer or quality of any underlying collateral or credit enhancements. For structured AFS securities meeting the definition of beneficial interests, the qualitative assessment is bypassed, and any securities having experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost move directly to a quantitative analysis.\nIf upon completion of this analysis it is determined that a potential credit loss exists, an allowance for expected credit losses is established equal to the amount by which the present value of expected cash flows is less than amortized cost, limited by the amount by which fair value is less than amortized cost. A non-structured security’s cash flow estimates are derived from scenario-based outcomes of expected corporate restructurings or the disposition of assets using security-specific facts and circumstances including timing, security interests and loss severity. A structured security’s cash flow estimates are based on security-specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, loss severity, prepayments and structural support, including subordination and guarantees. The expected cash flows are discounted at the effective interest rate implicit to the security at the date of purchase or the current yield to accrete a structured security. For securities with a contractual interest rate that varies based on changes in an independent factor, such as an index or rate, the effective interest rate is calculated based on the factor as it changes over the life of the security. Inherently under the discounted cash flow model, both the timing and amount of expected cash flows affect the measurement of the allowance for expected credit losses.\nThe allowance for expected credit losses is remeasured each period for the passage of time, any change in expected cash flows, and changes in the fair value of the security. All impairments, whether intent or requirement to sell or credit-related, and all changes in the allowance for expected credit losses are recorded through the provision for credit losses within investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations.\nAthene also establishes an allowance for expected credit losses for assets held at amortized cost at the time of purchase, which includes certain other loans and reinsurance assets. The allowance for expected credit losses considers past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions or macroeconomic forecasts. Athene uses a quantitative probability of default and loss given default methodology to develop the estimate of expected credit loss. The provision for credit losses for reinsurance assets held at amortized cost is recorded through policy and other operating expenses on the consolidated statements of operations.\nAthene has elected to present accrued interest receivable separately in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Athene has also elected the practical expedient to exclude the accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost balance used to calculate the allowance for expected credit losses, as Athene has a policy to write off such balances in a timely manner, when they become 90 days past due. Any write-off of accrued interest is recorded through a reversal of net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations.\nUpon determining that all or a portion of the amortized cost of an asset is uncollectible, which is generally when all efforts for collection are exhausted, the amortized cost is written off against the existing allowance. Any write off in excess of the existing allowance is recorded through the provision for credit losses within investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations.\nDerivative Instruments\nAthene invests in derivatives to hedge the risks experienced from ongoing operations, such as \nequity, interest rate, foreign currency and market volatility\n, or for other risk management purposes, which primarily involve managing liability risks \n163\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nassociated with indexed annuity products and reinsurance agreements. Derivatives are financial instruments with values that are derived from interest rates, foreign exchange rates, financial indices or other combinations of an underlying and notional. Derivative assets and liabilities are carried at fair value on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Athene elects to present any derivatives subject to master netting provisions as a gross asset or liability and gross of collateral. Disclosures regarding balance sheet presentation of derivatives subject to master netting agreements are discussed in note 5. Athene may designate derivatives as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges.\nHedge Documentation and Hedge Effectiveness\nTo qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, Athene formally documents its designation of the hedge as a cash flow, fair value or net investment hedge and risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction. This documentation identifies how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the designated risks related to the hedged item and the method that will be used to retrospectively and prospectively assess the hedge effectiveness and the method which will be used to measure ineffectiveness. A derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk of the hedged item. Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and periodically throughout the life of the hedge accounting relationship.\nFor a cash flow hedge, all changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative are reported within AOCI and the related gains or losses on the derivative are reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations when the cash flows of the hedged item affect earnings. \nFor a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged item related to the designated risk being hedged are reported on the consolidated statements of operations according to the nature of the risk being hedged. Additionally, changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in AOCI and amortized into income over the life of the hedge accounting relationship. \nFor a net investment hedge, changes in the fair value of the hedging derivative are reported within AOCI to offset the translation adjustments for subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. \nAthene discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when: (1) it determines the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the estimated cash flows or fair value of a hedged item; (2) the derivative expires, is sold, terminated, or exercised; or (3) the derivative is de-designated as a hedging instrument. When hedge accounting is discontinued, the derivative continues to be carried on the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. \nFor a derivative not designated as a hedge, changes in the derivative’s fair value and any income received or paid on derivatives at the settlement date are included in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nEmbedded Derivatives\nAthene issues and reinsures products, primarily indexed annuity products, or purchases investments that contain embedded derivatives. If it determines the embedded derivative has economic characteristics that are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics of the host contract, and a separate instrument with the same terms would qualify as a derivative instrument, the embedded derivative is bifurcated from the host contract and accounted for separately, unless the fair value option is elected on the host contract. Under the fair value option, bifurcation of the embedded derivative is not necessary as the entire contract is carried at fair value with all related gains and losses recognized in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Embedded derivatives are carried on the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value in the same line item as the host contract. \nFixed indexed annuity, index-linked variable annuity and indexed universal life insurance contracts allow the policyholder to elect a fixed interest rate return or an equity market component for which interest credited is based on the performance of certain equity market indices. The equity market option is an embedded derivative. The benefit reserve is equal to the sum of the fair value of the embedded derivative and the host (or guaranteed) component of the contracts. The fair value of the embedded derivatives represents the present value of cash flows attributable to the indexed strategies. The embedded derivative cash flows are based on assumptions for future policy growth, which include assumptions for expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date, future equity option costs, volatility, interest rates and policyholder behavior assumptions, including lapses and the use of benefit riders. The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects Athene’s own \n164\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncredit rating. The host contract is established at contract inception as the initial account value less the initial fair value of the embedded derivative and accreted over the policy’s life. Contracts acquired through a business combination which contain an embedded derivative are re-bifurcated as of the acquisition date. Changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives associated with fixed indexed annuities, index-linked variable annuities and indexed universal life insurance contracts are included in interest sensitive contract benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. \nAdditionally, reinsurance agreements written on a funds withheld or modco basis contain embedded derivatives. Athene has determined that the right to receive or obligation to pay the total return on the assets supporting the funds withheld at interest or funds withheld liability, respectively, represents a total return swap with a floating rate leg. The fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld and modco agreements is computed as the unrealized gain (loss) on the underlying assets and is included within funds withheld at interest for assumed agreements, and for ceded agreements the funds withheld liability is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives is recorded in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations. Assumed and ceded earnings from funds withheld at interest, funds withheld liability and changes in the fair value of embedded derivatives are reported in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Contributions to and withdrawals from funds withheld at interest and funds withheld liability are reported in operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n \nReinsurance\nAthene assumes and cedes insurance and investment contracts under coinsurance, funds withheld, modco, and yearly renewable term bases. Reinsurance accounting is applied for transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (risk transfer). To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance agreement must transfer insurance risk arising from uncertainties about both underwriting and timing risks. Cessions under reinsurance do not discharge obligations as the primary insurer, unless the requirements of assumption reinsurance have been met. Athene generally has the right of offset on reinsurance transactions, but has elected to present reinsurance settlement amounts due to and from Athene on a gross basis.\nFor assets and liabilities ceded under reinsurance agreements, Athene generally applies the same measurement guidance for Athene’s directly issued or assumed contracts. Ceded amounts are recorded within reinsurance recoverable on the consolidated statements of financial condition. For reinsurance of in-force contracts that pass risk transfer, the issue year used for the purpose of measuring the reinsurance recoverable is dependent on the effective date of the reinsurance agreement, which may differ from the issue year for the direct or assumed contract. The issue year informs the locked-in discount rate used for the purposes of interest accretion. This may result in different discount rates used for the direct or assumed reserves and ceded reserves when reinsuring an in-force block of insurance contracts. For flow reinsurance of insurance contracts that pass risk transfer, the contracts have the same cash flow assumptions as the direct or assumed contracts when the terms are consistent between those respective contracts and the ceded reinsurance agreement. When Athene recognizes an immediate loss due to the present value of future benefits and expenses exceeding the present value of future gross premiums, a gain is recognized on the corresponding reinsurance recoverable to the extent it does not result in gain recognition at treaty inception. Likewise, where the direct or assumed reserve has been floored to zero, the corresponding reinsurance recoverable will be consistently set to zero. See “Future Policy Benefits” below for further information.\nAccounting for reinsurance requires the use of assumptions, particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks. Athene attempts to minimize its counterparty credit risk through the structuring of the terms of its reinsurance agreements, including the use of trusts, and monitors credit ratings of counterparties for signs of declining credit quality. When a ceding company does not report information on a timely basis, Athene records accruals based on the best available information at the time, which includes the reinsurance agreement terms and historical experience. Athene periodically compares actual and anticipated experience to the assumptions used to establish reinsurance assets and liabilities. See note 8 for more information.\nAssets and liabilities assumed or ceded under coinsurance, funds withheld, modco, or yearly renewable term are presented gross on the consolidated statements of financial condition. For investment contracts, the change in the direct or assumed and ceded reserves are presented net in interest sensitive contract benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. For insurance contracts, the change in the direct or assumed and ceded reserves and benefits are presented net in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations, except any changes related to the discount rate are presented net in OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). For market risk benefits, the change in the direct or assumed and ceded reserves are presented net in market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses on the consolidated statements of operations, except for changes related to instrument-specific credit risk on direct and assumed contracts which are presented net in OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss).\n165\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor the reinsurance of existing in-force blocks that transfer significant insurance risk, the difference between the assets received or paid and the liabilities assumed or ceded represents the net cost of reinsurance at the inception of the reinsurance agreement. The net cost of reinsurance is amortized on a basis consistent with the methodologies and assumptions used to amortize DAC and deferred sales inducements (“DSI”), or on a consistent basis with deferred profit liability dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract.\nDeferred Acquisition Costs, Deferred Sales Inducements and Value of Business Acquired \nDeferred Acquisition Costs and Deferred Sales Inducements\nCosts related directly to the successful acquisition of new, or the renewal of existing, insurance or investment contracts are deferred. These costs consist of commissions and policy issuance costs, as well as sales inducements credited to policyholder account balances, and are included in deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of financial condition. These costs are not capitalized until they are incurred.\nDeferred costs related to universal life-type policies and investment contracts with significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are grouped into cohorts based on issue year and contract type and amortized on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts. The cohorts and assumptions used for the amortization of deferred costs are consistent with those used in estimating the related liabilities for these contracts. The constant level basis generally is the initial premium or deposit and is projected based on assumptions related to policyholder behavior, including lapses and mortality, over the expected term of the contracts. Each reporting period, Athene replaces expected experience with actual experience to determine the related amortization expense. Changes to projected experience are recognized in amortization expense prospectively over the remaining contract term. Amortization of DAC and DSI is included in amortization of deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of operations.\nDeferred costs related to investment contracts without significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of the policyholder funds are amortized using the effective interest method. The effective interest method amortizes the deferred costs by discounting the future liability cash flows at a break-even rate. The break-even rate is solved for such that the present value of future liability cash flows is equal to the net liability at the inception of the contract. The deferred costs represent the difference between the net and gross liability and the change relates to amortization for the period.\nValue of Business Acquired\nAthene establishes VOBA for blocks of insurance contracts acquired through the acquisition of insurance entities. It records the fair value of the liabilities assumed in two components: reserves and VOBA. Reserves are established using Athene’s best estimate assumptions as of the business combination date. VOBA is the difference between the fair value of the liabilities and the reserves. VOBA can be either positive or negative and is amortized in relation to respective policyholder liabilities. Significant assumptions that impact VOBA amortization are consistent with those that impact the measurement of policyholder liabilities. Athene performs periodic tests to determine if positive VOBA remains recoverable. If Athene determines that positive VOBA is not recoverable, Athene records a cumulative charge to the current period. Any negative VOBA is recorded to the same financial statement line on the consolidated statements of financial condition as the associated reserves. Positive VOBA is recorded in deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of financial condition. See note 9 for further information.\nInterest Sensitive Contract Liabilities\nUniversal life-type policies and investment contracts include traditional deferred annuities; indexed annuities consisting of fixed indexed, index-linked variable annuities in the accumulation phase, and assumed indexed universal life without significant mortality risk; funding agreements; immediate annuities without significant mortality risk (which include pension group annuities without life contingencies); universal life insurance; and other investment contracts inclusive of assumed endowments without significant mortality risk. Athene carries liabilities for traditional deferred annuities, indexed annuities, funding agreements and universal life insurance at the account balances without reduction for potential surrender or withdrawal charges, except for a block of universal life business ceded to Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “Global Atlantic”), which it carries at fair value. Liabilities for immediate annuities without significant mortality risk are calculated as the present value of future liability cash flows and policy maintenance expenses discounted at contractual interest \n166\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrates. Certain of Athene’s universal life-type policies and investment contracts are offered with additional contract features that meet the definition of a market risk benefit. See “Market Risk Benefits” below for further information.\nUnearned revenue liabilities are established when amounts are assessed against the policyholder for services to be provided in future periods. These balances are amortized consistent with the methodologies and assumptions used to amortize DAC and DSI.\nChanges in interest sensitive contract liabilities, excluding deposits and withdrawals, are recorded in interest sensitive contract benefits or product charges on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest sensitive contract liabilities are not reduced for amounts ceded under reinsurance agreements which are reported as reinsurance recoverable on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\n \nFuture Policy Benefits\nAthene issues or reinsures contracts classified as long-duration, which include term and whole life, accident and health, disability, and deferred and immediate annuities with life contingencies (which include pension group annuities with life contingencies). Liabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established as the estimated present value of benefits we expect to pay to or on behalf of the policyholder and related expenses less the present value of the net premiums to be collected, referred to as the net premium ratio. The contracts are grouped into cohorts based on issue year and contract type, with an exception for pension group annuities, which are generally assessed at the group annuity contract level. Contracts with different issuance years are not combined. Contracts acquired in a business combination are grouped into a single cohort by contract type, except for pension group annuities, which follow the group annuity contract level.\nLiabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods which require the use of assumptions related to discount rate, expenses, longevity, mortality, morbidity, persistency and other policyholder behavior. Athene bases certain key assumptions, such as longevity, mortality and morbidity, on industry standard data adjusted to align with actual company experience, if needed. Athene has elected to use expense assumptions that are locked in at issuance for each cohort. All other cash flow assumptions are established at contract issuance and reviewed annually or more frequently if actual experience suggests a revision is necessary. The effects of changes in cash flow assumptions impacting the net premium ratio are recorded as remeasurement changes in the period in which they are made. As cash flow assumptions are reviewed at least annually, there is no provision for adverse deviation included within the liability.\nActual experience is recognized in the period in which the experience arises. Actual experience is then incorporated into the net premium ratio for all products and cohorts on a quarterly basis. When the net premium ratio is revised, whether to incorporate actual experience each reporting period or for the review of cash flow assumptions, the liability is recalculated as of the beginning of the period, discounted at the original contract issuance discount rate, and compared with the carrying amount of the liability as of the same date to determine the current period change. The current period change in the liability is recognized as remeasurement gain or loss.\nTo the extent the present value of future benefits and expenses exceeds the present value of gross premiums, Athene will cap the net premium ratio at one hundred percent by increasing the corresponding liability and recognizing an immediate loss through the consolidated statements of operations. The liability is never recorded at an amount less than zero for the cohort.\nThe liability for nonparticipating long-duration contracts is discounted using an upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yield aligned to the characteristics of the liability, including the duration and currency of the underlying cash flows. In determining reference portfolio of instruments, Athene has used a single A equivalent level rate and maximized the use of observable data to the extent possible for the duration of its liabilities. The discount rate is required to be updated at the end of each reporting period for the remeasurement of the liability but is locked-in for each cohort for the purpose of interest accretion expense.\nChanges in the value of the liability for nonparticipating long-duration contracts due to changes in the discount rate are recognized as a component of OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Changes in the liability for remeasurement gains or losses and all other changes in the liability are recorded in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations.\nFuture policy benefits include liabilities for no-lapse guarantees on universal life insurance and fixed indexed universal life insurance. Athene establishes future policy benefits for no-lapse guarantees by estimating the expected value of death benefits \n167\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\npaid after policyholder account balances have been exhausted. Athene recognizes these benefits proportionally over the life of the contracts based on total actual and expected assessments. The methods Athene uses to estimate the liabilities have assumptions about policyholder behavior, mortality, expected yield on investments supporting the liability and market conditions affecting policyholder account balance growth.\nFor the liabilities associated with no-lapse guarantees, each reporting period Athene updates expected excess benefits and assessments with actual excess benefits and assessments. Athene also periodically revises the key assumptions used in the calculation of the liabilities that result in revisions to the expected excess benefits and assessments. The effects of changes in assumptions are recorded as unlocking in the period in which the changes are made. Changes in the liabilities associated with no-lapse guarantees are recorded in future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations.\nFuture policy benefits are not reduced for amounts ceded under reinsurance agreements, which are reported as reinsurance recoverable on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nMarket Risk Benefits\nMarket risk benefits represent contracts or contract features that both provide protection to the contract holder from, and expose the insurance entity to, other-than-nominal capital market risk. Athene’s deferred annuity contracts which contain GLWB and GMDB riders that meet the criteria for, and are classified as, market risk benefits.\nMarket risk benefits are measured at fair value at the contract level and may be recorded as a liability or an asset, which are recorded on the consolidated statements of financial condition in market risk benefits or other assets, respectively. Multiple market risk benefits on a contract are treated as a single, compound market risk benefit. At contract inception, Athene assesses the fees and assessments that are collectible from the policyholder and allocates them to the extent they are attributable to the market risk benefit. These attributed fees are used in the valuation of the market risk benefits and are never negative or exceed total explicit fees collectible from the policyholder. If the fees are sufficient to cover the projected benefits, a non-option based valuation model is used. If the fees are insufficient to cover the projected benefits, an option-based valuation model is used to compute the market risk benefit liability at contract inception, with an equal and offsetting adjustment recognized in interest sensitive contract liabilities.\nChanges in fair value of market risk benefits are recorded in market risk benefits remeasurement (gains) losses on the consolidated statements of operations, excluding portions attributed to changes in instrument-specific credit risk, which are recorded in OCI on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). Market risk benefits are not reduced for market risk benefits ceded under reinsurance agreements. Ceded market risk benefits are measured at fair value and recorded within reinsurance recoverable on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nUpon annuitization of the contract or the extinguishment of the account balance, the market risk benefit, related annuity contract and unamortized deferred costs are derecognized, including amounts within AOCI. A payout annuity is then established for GLWBs.\nRevenues\nRevenues for universal life-type policies and investment contracts, including surrender and market value adjustments, costs of insurance, policy administration, GMDB, GLWB and no-lapse guarantee charges, are earned when assessed against policyholder account balances during the period. Interest credited to policyholder account balances and the change in fair value of embedded derivatives within fixed indexed annuity contracts is included in interest sensitive contract benefits on the consolidated statements of operations.\nPremiums for long-duration contracts, including products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, a deferred profit liability is established equal to the excess of the gross premium over the net premium. The deferred profit liability is recognized in future policy benefits on the consolidated statements of financial condition and amortized into income in relation to either applicable policyholder liabilities for immediate annuities with life contingencies (which includes pension group annuities) or insurance in-force for whole life products through future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations.\n168\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWhen the net premium ratio for the corresponding future policy benefit is updated for actual experience and changes to projected cash flow assumptions, the deferred profit liability is retrospectively recalculated from the contract issuance date through the beginning of the current reporting period. The revised deferred profit liability is compared to the beginning of the period carrying amount to determine the change to be recognized as a remeasurement gain or loss within future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations. Unlike the related future policy benefit, the deferred profit liability will not be remeasured for changes in discount rates each reporting period. Negative VOBA balances associated with payout contracts involving life contingencies, including pension group annuities, are accounted for in a manner similar to the deferred profit liability.\nAll insurance-related revenue is reported net of reinsurance ceded\n.\n3. Merger with Athene\nOn January 1, 2022, Apollo and Athene completed the previously announced merger transactions pursuant to the Merger Agreement. As a result of the Mergers, AAM and AHL became subsidiaries of AGM.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, each issued and outstanding Athene common share was converted automatically into \n1.149\n shares of common stock of AGM and any cash paid in lieu of fractional shares. \nThe purchase price was as follows:\n(In millions, except share price data and exchange ratio)\nAHL common shares purchased\n138\n \nExchange ratio\n1.149\n \nShares of common stock issued in exchange\n158\n \nAGM Class A shares closing price\n$\n72.43\n \nTotal merger consideration at closing\n$\n11,455\n \nFair value of estimated RSUs, options and warrants assumed and other equity consideration\n1,2\n699\n \nEffective settlement of pre-existing relationships\n3\n896\n \nTotal merger consideration\n13,050\n \nFair value of AHL common shares previously held (\n55\n million shares) and other adjustments\n4,5\n4,554\n \nTotal AHL equity value held by AGM\n17,604\n \nNon-controlling interest\n6\n4,942\n \nTotal AHL equity value\n$\n22,546\n \n1 \nAGM issued one-time grants of fully vested RSUs and options to certain executives and stockholders of Athene vesting upon consummation of the Mergers. Additionally, all issued and outstanding warrants of Athene prior to the Merger Date were exchanged for shares of AGM common stock at the time of the Mergers. The fair value of these awards is $\n600\n million and is treated as part of consideration transferred.\n2\n AGM issued replacement awards for all outstanding Athene equity awards. $\n99\n million was included as part of consideration for the portion that was attributable to pre-combination services and $\n53\n million will be treated as post-combination compensation expense.\n3\n The pre-existing relationship related to receivables, payables, and dividends between Apollo and Athene. Total fees payable to AGM by Athene for asset management and advisory services were approximately $\n146\n million. A cash dividend of $\n750\n million was declared by Athene to its common stockholders with Apollo owning \n100\n% of the common shares as of the dividend record date.\n4\n Based on the December 31, 2021 closing price of AHL common shares on the NYSE.\n5\n Other adjustments includes pushdown of goodwill arising out of deferred tax liabilities associated with identifiable net assets of Athene.\n6\n Non-controlling interest in Athene includes holders of Athene’s preferred shares and third-party investors in ACRA 1 and in consolidated VIEs of Athene. The fair value of Athene’s preferred shares was based on the closing stock price of Athene’s preferred shares immediately prior to the consummation of the Athene merger and the fair value of the non-controlling interest in ACRA 1 was determined using the discounted distribution model approach. \nThe Mergers were accounted for as a business combination. The consideration was allocated to Athene's assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their fair values as of the Merger Date. The business combination was achieved in steps. The Company previously held its equity interests in the acquiree at fair value.\nGoodwill of $\n4.1\n billion was recorded based on the amount that the Athene equity value exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired less the amounts attributable to non-controlling interests. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the scale, skill sets, operations, and synergies that can be achieved subsequent to the Mergers. The goodwill recorded is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill on the consolidated statements of financial position includes the impacts of foreign currency translation.\n169\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe financial statements were not retrospectively adjusted for the changes to the provisional values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed that occurred in subsequent periods. Adjustments were recognized as information related to the preliminary fair value calculation was obtained. The effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, as a result of changes to the provisional amounts, were recorded in the same period as the financial statements, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the Merger Date.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value amounts recognized for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulting goodwill as of the Merger Date:\n(In millions)\nFair Value and Goodwill Calculation\nMerger consideration\n$\n13,050\n \nFair value of previously held equity interest\n4,554\n \nTotal Athene Value to be Held by the Company\n17,604\n \nTotal Value to Allocate\nInvestments\n176,015\n \nCash and cash equivalents\n9,479\n \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\n796\n \nInvestment in related parties\n33,863\n \nReinsurance recoverable\n4,977\n \nVOBA\n3,372\n \nAssets of consolidated variable interest entities\n3,635\n \nOther assets\n6,115\n \nEstimated fair value of total assets acquired (excluding goodwill)\n238,252\n \nInterest sensitive contract liabilities \n160,241\n \nFuture policy benefits\n41,482\n \nMarket risk benefits\n4,813\n \nDebt\n3,295\n \nPayables for collateral on derivatives and securities to repurchase\n7,044\n \nLiabilities of consolidated variable interest entities\n461\n \nOther liabilities\n2,443\n \nEstimated fair value of total liabilities assumed\n219,779\n \nNon-controlling interest\n4,942\n \nEstimated fair value of net assets acquired, excluding goodwill\n13,531\n \nGoodwill attributable to Athene\n$\n4,073\n \nThe Company finalized purchase accounting during the fourth quarter of 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded adjustments which decreased provisional goodwill by $\n108\n million. The adjustments were comprised of $\n25\n million for measurement period adjustments and $\n83\n million to adjust the valuation of an investment. The measurement period adjustments were primarily related to decreases in interest sensitive contract liabilities and future policy benefits and the effects to the consolidated statements of operations were immaterial to those periods.\nThe Company performed a valuation of the acquired investments, policy liabilities, VOBA, other identifiable intangibles, and funds withheld at interest payables and receivables using methodologies consistent with those described in note 2 and note 7.\nValue of business acquired and Other identifiable intangible assets\nVOBA represents the difference between the fair value of liabilities acquired and reserves established using best estimate assumptions at the Merger Date. Other identifiable intangible assets are included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition and summarized as follows:\n170\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDistribution Channels\nTrade Name\nInsurance Licenses\nThese assets are valued using the excess earnings method, which derives value based on the present value of the cash flow attributable to the distribution channels, less returns for contributory assets. Amortization of these assets is on a straight-line basis.\nThis represents the Athene trade name and was valued using the relief-from-royalty method considering publicly available third-party trade name royalty rates as well as expected premiums generated by the use of the trade name over its anticipated life. Amortization of this asset is on a straight-line basis.\nLicenses are protected through registration and were valued using the market approach based on third-party market transactions from which the prices paid for state insurance licenses could be derived.

Strategic origination platforms include investments sourced by affiliated platforms that originate loans to third parties and in which Athene gains exposure directly to the loan or indirectly through its ownership of the origination platform and/or securitizations of assets originated by the origination platform. Retirement services platforms include investments in equity of financial services companies. The credit strategy is comprised of direct origination, asset-backed, multi-credit and opportunistic credit funds focused on generating excess returns through high-quality credit underwriting and origination. The equity strategy is comprised of private equity, hybrid value, secondaries equity, real estate equity, impact investing, infrastructure and clean transition equity funds that raise capital from investors to pursue control-oriented investments across the universe of private assets. Investment funds can meet the definition of VIEs. The investment funds do not specify timing of distributions on the funds’ underlying assets. \nThe following summarizes Athene’s investment funds, including related parties and consolidated VIEs: \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023 \n1\n(In millions, except percentages)\nCarrying Value\nPercentage of Total\nCarrying Value\nPercentage of Total\nInvestment funds\nEquity\n$\n107\n \n0.6\n \n%\n$\n109\n \n0.6\n \n%\nInvestment funds – related parties\nStrategic origination platforms\n29\n \n0.2\n \n%\n32\n \n0.2\n \n%\nRetirement services platforms\n1,317\n \n6.7\n \n%\n1,300\n \n7.4\n \n%\nEquity\n244\n \n1.2\n \n%\n267\n \n1.5\n \n%\nCredit\n253\n \n1.3\n \n%\n20\n \n0.1\n \n%\nOther\n10\n \n0.1\n \n%\n13\n \n0.1\n \n%\nTotal investment funds – related parties\n1,853\n \n9.5\n \n%\n1,632\n \n9.3\n \n%\nInvestment funds – consolidated VIEs\nStrategic origination platforms\n6,347\n \n32.3\n \n%\n4,987\n \n28.4\n \n%\nRetirement services platforms\n—\n \n—\n \n%\n483\n \n2.8\n \n%\nEquity\n7,597\n \n38.7\n \n%\n6,925\n \n39.4\n \n%\nCredit\n3,062\n \n15.6\n \n%\n2,852\n \n16.2\n \n%\nOther\n654\n \n3.3\n \n%\n573\n \n3.3\n \n%\nTotal investment funds – consolidated VIEs\n17,660\n \n89.9\n \n%\n15,820\n \n90.1\n \n%\nTotal investment funds, including related parties and consolidated VIEs\n$\n19,620\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n17,561\n \n100.0\n \n%\n1\n Prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation as a result of aligning the investment fund categories to reflect the Company’s updated investment strategies.\nConcentrations\n—\nThe following table represents Athene’s investment concentrations in excess of 10% of stockholders’ equity:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nAP Grange Holdings, LLC\n$\n4,661\n \nAtlas\n1\n3,172\n \nFox Hedge L.P.\n2,924\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nWheels, Inc.

Hedge effectiveness is assessed based on the changes in forward rates. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, these derivatives had gains of $\n3\n million, losses of $\n4\n million, and gains of $\n30\n million, respectively. These derivatives are included in foreign currency translation and other adjustments on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative foreign currency translations recorded in AOCI related to these net investment hedges were gains of $\n29\n million and $\n26\n million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were no amounts deemed ineffective.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedges\nEquity options\nAthene uses equity indexed options to economically hedge fixed indexed annuity products that guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on a percentage of the gain in a specified market index, including the S&P 500 and other bespoke indices. To hedge against adverse changes in equity indices, Athene enters into contracts to buy equity indexed options. The contracts are net settled in cash based on differentials in the indices at the time of exercise and the strike price.\nFutures\nAthene purchases futures contracts to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related indices. Athene enters into exchange-traded futures with regulated futures commission clearing brokers who are members of a trading exchange. Under exchange-traded futures contracts, Athene agrees to purchase a specified number of contracts with other parties and to post variation margin on a daily basis in an amount equal to the difference in the daily fair values of those contracts.\nInterest rate swaps and forwards\nAthene uses\n interest rate swaps and forwards to reduce market risks from interest rate changes and to alter interest rate exposure arising from duration mismatches between assets and liabilities. With an interest rate swap,\n Athene agrees \nwith another party to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts tied to an agreed-upon notional principal amount at specified intervals.\nOther swaps\nOther swaps include total return swaps, credit default swaps and swaptions. Athene purchases total rate of return swaps to gain exposure and benefit from a reference asset or index without ownership. Credit default swaps provide a measure of protection against the default of an issuer or allow Athene to gain credit exposure to an issuer or traded index. Athene uses credit default swaps coupled with a bond to synthetically create the characteristics of a reference bond. Swaptions provide an option to enter into an interest rate swap and are used by Athene to hedge against interest rate exposure.\nEmbedded derivatives\nAthene has embedded derivatives which are required to be separated from their host contracts and reported as derivatives.

Where possible, \nAthene maintains \ncollateral arrangements and uses master netting agreements that provide for a single net payment from one counterparty to another at each due date and upon termination.\n Athene has also established counterparty exposure limits, where possible, in order to evaluate if there is sufficient collateral to support the net exposure.\n \nCollateral arrangements typically require the posting of collateral in connection with its derivative instruments. Collateral agreements often contain posting thresholds, some of which may vary depending on the posting party’s financial strength ratings. Additionally, a decrease in \nAthene’s \nfinancial strength rating to a specified level can result in settlement of the derivative position.\nThe estimated fair value of \nAthene’s \nnet derivative and other financial assets and liabilities after the application of master netting agreements and collateral were as follows:\nGross amounts not offset on the consolidated statements of financial condition\n(In millions)\nGross amount recognized\n1\nFinancial instruments\n2\nCollateral (received)/pledged\nNet amount\nOff-balance sheet securities collateral\n3\nNet amount after securities collateral\nDecember 31, 2024\nDerivative assets\n$\n8,154\n \n$\n(\n2,209\n)\n$\n(\n5,922\n)\n$\n23\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n23\n \nDerivative liabilities\n(\n3,556\n)\n2,209\n \n1,333\n \n(\n14\n)\n2\n \n(\n12\n)\nDecember 31, 2023\nDerivative assets\n$\n5,298\n \n$\n(\n1,497\n)\n$\n(\n3,676\n)\n$\n125\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n125\n \nDerivative liabilities\n(\n1,995\n)\n1,497\n \n848\n \n350\n \n—\n \n350\n \n1\n The gross amounts of recognized derivative assets and derivative liabilities are reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition.

Amounts do not include any excess of collateral pledged or received.\n184\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n6. Variable Interest Entities\nA variable interest in a VIE is an investment or other interest that will absorb portions of the VIE’s expected losses and/or receive expected residual returns. Variable interests in consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs are discussed separately below.\nConsolidated VIEs \nConsolidated VIEs include certain CLOs and funds managed by the Company and other entities where the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary. In addition, during 2023 and 2022, consolidated VIEs also included SPACs which were liquidated during the fourth quarter of 2023. See note 18 for further details regarding Apollo’s previously consolidated SPACs.\nThe assets of consolidated VIEs are not available to creditors of the Company, and the investors in these consolidated VIEs have no recourse against the assets of the Company. Similarly, there is no recourse to the Company for the consolidated VIEs’ liabilities.\nOther assets of the consolidated VIEs include interest receivables, receivables from affiliates and reverse repurchase agreements. Other liabilities include debt and short-term payables.\nEach series of notes in a respective consolidated VIE participates in distributions from the VIE, including principal and interest from underlying investments. Amounts allocated to the noteholders reflect amounts that would be distributed if the VIE’s affairs were wound up and its assets sold for cash equal to their respective carrying values, its liabilities satisfied in accordance with their terms, and all the remaining amounts distributed to the noteholders. The respective VIEs that issue the notes payable are marked at their prevailing net asset value, which approximates fair value.\nResults from certain funds managed by Apollo are reported on a three-month lag based upon the availability of financial information.\nNet Gains (Losses) from Investment Activities of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities—Asset Management\nThe following table presents net gains (losses) from investment activities of the consolidated VIEs:\nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n1\n2023\n1\n2022\n1\nNet gains (losses) from investment activities\n$\n39\n \n$\n67\n \n$\n93\n \nNet gains (losses) from debt\n(\n8\n)\n—\n \n144\n \nInterest and other income\n172\n \n176\n \n354\n \nInterest and other expenses\n(\n113\n)\n(\n113\n)\n(\n97\n)\nNet gains (losses) from investment activities of consolidated variable interest entities\n$\n90\n \n$\n130\n \n$\n494\n \n1 \nAmounts reflect consolidation eliminations.\nIn addition, we recognize revenues and expenses of certain consolidated VIEs within management fees, investment income (loss), compensation and benefits and general, administrative and other. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $\n51\n million of revenues and $\n77\n million of expenses related to the activities of these VIEs. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $\n22\n million of revenues and $\n5\n million of expenses related to the activities of these VIEs.\n185\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSubscription Lines\nIncluded within other liabilities are amounts due to third-party institutions by the consolidated VIEs. \nThe following table summarizes the principal provisions of those amounts:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nPrincipal Outstanding\nWeighted Average Interest Rate\nWeighted Average Remaining Maturity in Years\nPrincipal Outstanding\nWeighted Average Interest Rate\nWeighted Average Remaining Maturity in Years\nAsset Management\nSubscription lines\n1\n$\n1,198\n \n6.84\n \n%\n0.06\n$\n1,072\n \n7.16\n \n%\n0.09\nTotal – Asset Management\n$\n1,198\n \n$\n1,072\n \n1 \nThe subscription lines of the consolidated VIEs are collateralized by assets held by each respective vehicle and assets of one vehicle may not be used to satisfy the liabilities of another vehicle.\nThe consolidated VIEs’ debt obligations contain various customary loan covenants. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was not aware of any instances of non-compliance with any of these covenants.\nReverse Repurchase Agreements \nAs of December 31, 2023, fair value of collateral received under reverse repurchase agreements was $\n453\n million. There was no rehypothecation of the collateral received under reverse repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2023.\nRevenues of Consolidated Variable Interest Entities—Retirement Services\nThe following summarizes the statements of operations activity of the consolidated VIEs:\nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTrading securities\n$\n152\n \n$\n102\n \n$\n34\n \nMortgage loans\n128\n \n110\n \n88\n \nInvestment funds\n46\n \n41\n \n9\n \nOther\n(\n22\n)\n1\n \n(\n10\n)\nNet investment income\n304\n \n254\n \n121\n \nNet recognized investment gains (losses) on trading securities\n17\n \n10\n \n(\n66\n)\nNet recognized investment losses on mortgage loans\n(\n35\n)\n(\n22\n)\n(\n250\n)\nNet recognized investment gains on investment funds\n1,542\n \n1,228\n \n552\n \nOther gains (losses)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n29\n)\n83\n \nInvestment related gains (losses)\n1,518\n \n1,187\n \n319\n \nRevenues of consolidated variable interest entities\n$\n1,822\n \n$\n1,441\n \n$\n440\n \nUnconsolidated Variable Interest Entities—Asset Management\nThe following table presents the maximum exposure to losses relating to these VIEs for which Apollo has concluded that it holds a significant variable interest, but that it is not the primary beneficiary.\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nMaximum Loss Exposure\n1,2\n$\n614\n \n$\n325\n \n1 \nRepresents Apollo’s direct investment in those entities in which it holds a significant variable interest and certain other investments.

These entities are deemed VIEs due to insufficient equity within the structure and lack of control by the equity investors over the activities that significantly impact the economics of the entity. In general, Athene is a debt investor within these entities and, as such, holds a variable interest; however, due to the debt holders’ lack of ability to control the decisions within the structure that significantly impact the entity, and the fact the debt holders are protected from losses due to the subordination of the equity tranche, the debt holders are not deemed the primary beneficiary. Securitization vehicles in which Athene holds the residual tranche are not consolidated because Athene does not unilaterally have substantive rights to remove the general partner, or when assessing related party interests, Athene is not under common control, as defined by U.S. GAAP, with the related parties, nor are substantially all of the activities conducted on Athene’s behalf; therefore, Athene is not deemed the primary beneficiary. Debt investments and investments in the residual tranche of securitization entities are considered debt instruments, and are held at fair value.\nInvestment funds\nInvestment funds include non-fixed income, alternative investments in the form of limited partnerships or similar legal structures. \nEquity securities\nAthene invests in preferred equity securities issued by entities deemed to be VIEs due to insufficient equity within the structure. \nAthene’s risk of loss associated with its non-consolidated investments depends on the investment. Investment funds, equity securities and trading securities are limited to the carrying value plus unfunded commitments. AFS securities are limited to amortized cost plus unfunded commitments.\nThe following summarizes the carrying value and maximum loss exposure of these non-consolidated investments:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions)\nCarrying Value\nMaximum Loss Exposure\nCarrying Value\nMaximum Loss Exposure\nInvestment funds\n$\n107\n \n$\n987\n \n$\n109\n \n$\n876\n \nInvestment in related parties – investment funds\n1,853\n \n3,226\n \n1,632\n \n2,377\n \nAssets of consolidated VIEs – investment funds\n17,660\n \n23,488\n \n15,820\n \n22,129\n \nInvestment in fixed maturity securities\n72,523\n \n74,797\n \n48,155\n \n50,623\n \nInvestment in related parties – fixed maturity securities\n17,239\n \n21,793\n \n13,495\n \n15,608\n \nInvestment in related parties – equity securities\n234\n \n234\n \n318\n \n318\n \nTotal non-consolidated investments\n$\n109,616\n \n$\n124,525\n \n$\n79,529\n \n$\n91,931\n \n187\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n7.

assumptions as those carried at fair value. The financial instruments presented above are reported at carrying value on the consolidated statements of financial condition; however, in the case of policy loans, funds withheld at interest and liability, short-term investments, and securities to repurchase, the carrying amount approximates fair value.\nInterest sensitive contract liabilities \n– \nThe carrying and fair value of interest sensitive contract liabilities above includes fixed indexed and traditional fixed annuities without mortality or morbidity risks, funding agreements and payout annuities without life contingencies. The embedded derivatives within fixed indexed annuities without mortality or morbidity risks are excluded, as they are carried at fair value. The valuation of these investment contracts is based on discounted cash flow methodologies using significant unobservable inputs. The estimated fair value is determined using current market risk-free interest rates, adding a spread to reflect nonperformance risk and subtracting a risk margin to reflect uncertainty inherent in the projected cash flows. \nDebt \n– \nThe fair value of debt is obtained from commercial pricing services. See note 14 for further information on debt.\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\nAsset Management\nDiscounted Cash Flow and Direct Capitalization Model\nWhen a discounted cash flow or direct capitalization model is used to determine fair value, the significant input used in the valuation model is the discount rate applied to present value the projected cash flows or the capitalization rate, respectively. Increases in the discount or capitalization rate can significantly lower the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations; conversely decreases in the discount or capitalization rate can significantly increase the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations. See note 19 for further discussion of the contingent consideration obligations.\nOption Model\nWhen an option model is used to determine fair value, the significant input used in the valuation model is the volatility rate applied to present value the projected cash flows. Increases in the volatility rate can significantly lower the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations; conversely decreases in the discount or capitalization rate can significantly increase the fair value of an investment and the contingent consideration obligations. \n202\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConsolidated VIEs’ Investments\nThe significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the equity securities, bank loans and bonds is the discount rate applied in the valuation models. This input in isolation can cause significant increases or decreases in fair value, which would result in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The discount rate is determined based on the market rates an investor would expect for a similar investment with similar risks. \nNAV\nCertain investments and investments of VIEs are valued using the NAV per share equivalent calculated by the investment manager as a practical expedient to determine an independent fair value.\nRetirement Services\nAFS, trading and equity securities \nAthene uses\n \ndiscounted cash flow models to calculate the fair value for certain fixed maturity and equity securities. The discount rate is a significant unobservable input because the credit spread includes adjustments made to the base rate. The base rate represents a market comparable rate for securities with similar characteristics. This excludes assets for which fair value is provided by independent broker quotes.\nMortgage loans \nAthene uses discounted cash flow models from independent commercial pricing services to calculate the fair value of its mortgage loan portfolio. The discount rate is a significant unobservable input. This approach uses market transaction information and client portfolio-oriented information, such as prepayments or defaults, to support the valuations.\nInterest sensitive contract liabilities – embedded derivative\n \nSignificant unobservable inputs used in the fixed indexed annuities embedded derivative of the interest sensitive contract liabilities valuation include:\n1.\nNonperformance risk – For contracts Athene issues, it uses the credit spread, relative to the U.S. Treasury curve based on Athene’s public credit rating as of the valuation date. This represents Athene’s credit risk for use in the estimate of the fair value of embedded derivatives.\n2.\nOption budget – Athene assumes future hedge costs in the derivative’s fair value estimate. The level of option budgets determines the future costs of the options and impacts future policyholder account value growth.\n3.\nPolicyholder behavior – Athene regularly reviews the full withdrawal (surrender rate) assumptions. These are based on initial pricing assumptions updated for actual experience. Actual experience may be limited for recently issued products.\nValuation of Underlying Investments\n \nAsset Management\nAs previously noted, the underlying entities that Apollo manages and invests in are primarily investment companies that account for their investments at estimated fair value.\nOn a quarterly basis, valuation committees consisting of members from senior management review and approve the valuation results related to the investments of the funds Apollo manages. Apollo also retains external valuation firms to provide third-party valuation consulting services to Apollo, which consist of certain limited procedures that management identifies and requests them to perform. The limited procedures provided by the external valuation firms assist management with validating their valuation results or determining fair value. Apollo performs various back-testing procedures to validate their valuation approaches, including comparisons between expected and observed outcomes, forecast evaluations and variance analyses. However, because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, those estimated values may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed, and the differences could be material.\n203\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCredit Investments\nCredit investments are generally valued based on third-party vendor prices and/or quoted market prices and valuation models. Valuations using quoted market prices are based on the average of the “bid” and the “ask” quotes provided by multiple brokers wherever possible without any adjustments. Apollo will designate certain brokers to use to value specific securities. In determining the designated brokers, Apollo considers the following: (i) brokers with which Apollo has previously transacted, (ii) the underwriter of the security and (iii) active brokers indicating executable quotes. In addition, when valuing a security based on broker quotes wherever possible Apollo tests the standard deviation amongst the quotes received and the variance between the concluded fair value and the value provided by a pricing service. When relying on a third-party vendor as a primary source, Apollo (i) analyzes how the price has moved over the measurement period, (ii) reviews the number of brokers included in the pricing service’s population, if available, and (iii) validates the valuation levels with Apollo’s pricing team and traders. \nDebt securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value utilizing a model-based approach to determine fair value. Valuation approaches used to estimate the fair value of illiquid credit investments also may include the income approach, as described below. The valuation approaches used consider, as applicable, market risks, credit risks, counterparty risks and foreign currency risks.\nEquity Investments\nThe majority of illiquid equity investments are valued using the market approach and/or the income approach, as described below.\nMarket Approach\nThe market approach is driven by current market conditions, including actual trading levels of similar companies and, to the extent available, actual transaction data of similar companies. Judgment is required by management when assessing which companies are similar to the subject company being valued. Consideration may also be given to any of the following factors: (1) the subject company’s historical and projected financial data; (2) valuations given to comparable companies; (3) the size and scope of the subject company’s operations; (4) the subject company’s individual strengths and weaknesses; (5) expectations relating to the market’s receptivity to an offering of the subject company’s securities; (6) applicable restrictions on transfer; (7) industry and market information; (8) general economic and market conditions; and (9) other factors deemed relevant. Market approach valuation models typically employ a multiple that is based on one or more of the factors described above.\nEnterprise value as a multiple of EBITDA is common and relevant for most companies and industries, however, other industry specific multiples are employed where available and appropriate.\n \nSources for gaining additional knowledge related to comparable companies include public filings, annual reports, analyst research reports and press releases. Once a comparable company set is determined, Apollo reviews certain aspects of the subject company’s performance and determines how its performance compares to the group and to certain individuals in the group. Apollo compares certain measurements such as EBITDA margins, revenue growth over certain time periods, leverage ratios and growth opportunities. In addition, Apollo compares the entry multiple and its relation to the comparable set at the time of acquisition to understand its relation to the comparable set on each measurement date.\nIncome Approach\nThe income approach provides an indication of fair value based on the present value of cash flows that a business or security is expected to generate in the future. The most widely used methodology for the income approach is a discounted cash flow method. Inherent in the discounted cash flow method are significant assumptions related to the subject company’s expected results, the determination of a terminal value and a calculated discount rate, which is normally based on the subject company’s WACC. The WACC represents the required rate of return on total capitalization, which is comprised of a required rate of return on equity, plus the current tax-effected rate of return on debt, weighted by the relative percentages of equity and debt that are typical in the industry. The most critical step in determining the appropriate WACC for each subject company is to select companies that are comparable in nature to the subject company and the credit quality of the subject company. Sources for gaining additional knowledge about the comparable companies include public filings, annual reports, analyst research reports and press releases. The general formula then used for calculating the WACC considers the after-tax rate of return on debt capital and the rate of return on common equity capital, which further considers the risk-free rate of return, market beta, market \n204\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrisk premium and small stock premium, if applicable. The variables used in the WACC formula are inferred from the comparable market data obtained. The Company evaluates the comparable companies selected and concludes on WACC inputs based on the most comparable company or analyzes the range of data for the investment.\nThe value of liquid investments, where the primary market is an exchange (whether foreign or domestic), is determined using period end market prices. Such prices are generally based on the close price on the date of determination.\nCertain of the funds Apollo manages may also enter into foreign currency exchange contracts, total return swap contracts, credit default swap contracts and other derivative contracts, which may include options, caps, collars and floors. Foreign currency exchange contracts are marked-to-market by recognizing the difference between the contract exchange rate and the current market rate as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. If securities are held at the end of the period, the changes in value are recorded in income as unrealized. Realized gains or losses are recognized when contracts are settled. Total return swap and credit default swap\n \ncontracts are recorded at fair value as an asset or liability with changes in fair value recorded as unrealized appreciation or depreciation. Realized gains or losses are recognized at the termination of the contract based on the difference between the close-out price of the total return or credit default swap contract and the original contract price. Forward contracts are valued based on market rates obtained from counterparties or prices obtained from recognized financial data service providers.\nRetirement Services\nAFS and trading securities\nThe fair values for most marketable securities without an active market are obtained from several commercial pricing services. These are classified as Level 2 assets. The pricing services incorporate a variety of market observable information in their valuation techniques, including benchmark yields, trading activity, credit quality, issuer spreads, bids, offers and other reference data. This category typically includes U.S. and non-U.S. corporate bonds, U.S. agency and government guaranteed securities, CLO, ABS, CMBS and RMBS. \nAthene also has fixed maturity securities priced based on indicative broker quotes or by employing market accepted valuation models. For certain fixed maturity securities, the valuation model uses significant unobservable inputs and these are included in Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Significant unobservable inputs used include discount rates, issue-specific credit adjustments, material non-public financial information, estimation of future earnings and cash flows, default rate assumptions, liquidity assumptions and indicative quotes from market makers.\nPrivately placed fixed maturity securities are valued based on the credit quality and duration of comparable marketable securities, which may be securities of another issuer with similar characteristics. In some instances, a matrix-based pricing model is used. These models consider the current level of risk-free interest rates, corporate spreads, credit quality of the issuer and cash flow characteristics of the security. Additional factors such as net worth of the borrower, value of collateral, capital structure of the borrower, presence of guarantees and Athene’s evaluation of the borrower’s ability to compete in its relevant market are also considered. Privately placed fixed maturity securities are classified as Level 2 or 3. \nEquity securities\nFair values of publicly traded equity securities are based on quoted market prices and classified as Level 1. Other equity securities, typically private equities or equity securities not traded on an exchange, are valued based on other sources, such as commercial pricing services or brokers, and are classified as Level 2 or 3. \nMortgage loans\nAthene estimates fair value monthly using discounted cash flow analysis and rates being offered for similar loans to borrowers with similar credit ratings. Loans with similar characteristics are aggregated for purposes of the calculations. The discounted cash flow model uses unobservable inputs, including estimates of discount rates and loan prepayments. Mortgage loans are classified as Level 3. \n205\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInvestment funds\nInvestment funds are typically measured using NAV as a practical expedient in determining fair value and are not classified in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value reflects a pro rata ownership percentage as indicated by NAV in the investment fund financial statements, which may be adjusted if it is determined NAV is not calculated consistent with investment company fair value principles. The underlying investments of the investment funds may have significant unobservable inputs, which may include but are not limited to, comparable multiples and WACC rates applied in valuation models or a discounted cash flow model.\nCertain investment funds for which Athene has elected the fair value option are included in Level 3 and are priced based on market accepted valuation models. The valuation models use significant unobservable inputs, which include material non-public financial information, estimation of future distributable earnings and demographic assumptions.\nOther investments\n \nThe fair values of other investments are determined using a discounted cash flow model using discount rates for similar investments. \nFunds withheld at interest embedded derivatives\nFunds withheld at interest embedded derivatives represent the right to receive or obligation to pay the total return on the assets supporting the funds withheld at interest or funds withheld liability, respectively, and are analogous to a total return swap with a floating rate leg. The fair value of embedded derivatives on funds withheld and modco agreements is measured as the unrealized gain (loss) on the underlying assets and classified as Level 3.\nDerivatives\nDerivative contracts can be exchange traded or over the counter. Exchange-traded derivatives typically fall within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy depending on trading activity. Over-the-counter derivatives are valued using valuation models or an income approach using third-party broker valuations. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlation of the inputs. Athene considers and incorporates counterparty credit risk in the valuation process through counterparty credit rating requirements and monitoring of overall exposure. Athene also evaluates and includes its own nonperformance risk in valuing derivatives. The majority of Athene’s derivatives trade in liquid markets; therefore, it can verify model inputs and model selection does not involve significant management judgment. These are typically classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. \nInterest sensitive contract liabilities embedded derivatives\nEmbedded derivatives related to interest sensitive contract liabilities with fixed indexed annuity products are classified as Level 3. The valuations include significant unobservable inputs associated with economic assumptions and actuarial assumptions for policyholder behavior. \nAmerUs Closed Block \nAthene elected the fair value option for the future policy benefits liability in the AmerUs Closed Block. The valuation technique is to set the fair value of policyholder liabilities equal to the fair value of assets. There is an additional component which captures the fair value of the open block’s obligations to the closed block business. This component is the present value of the projected release of required capital and future earnings before income taxes on required capital supporting the AmerUs Closed Block, discounted at a rate which represents a market participant’s required rate of return, less the initial required capital. Unobservable inputs include estimates for these items. The AmerUs Closed Block policyholder liabilities and any corresponding reinsurance recoverable are classified as Level 3. \nILICO Closed Block\nAthene elected the fair value option for the ILICO Closed Block. The valuation technique is to set the fair value of policyholder liabilities equal to the fair value of assets. There is an additional component which captures the fair value of the open block’s obligations to the closed block business. This component uses the present value of future cash flows which include \n206\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncommissions, administrative expenses, reinsurance premiums and benefits, and an explicit cost of capital. The discount rate includes a margin to reflect the business and nonperformance risk. Unobservable inputs include estimates for these items. The ILICO Closed Block policyholder liabilities and corresponding reinsurance recoverable are classified as Level 3. \nUniversal life liabilities and other life benefits\nAthene elected the fair value option for certain blocks of universal and other life business ceded to Global Atlantic. Athene uses a present value of liability cash flows. Unobservable inputs include estimates of mortality, persistency, expenses, premium payments and a risk margin used in the discount rates that reflect the riskiness of the business. The universal life policyholder liabilities and corresponding reinsurance recoverable are classified as Level 3. \nOther liabilities\nOther liabilities include funds withheld liability embedded derivatives, as described above in funds withheld at interest embedded derivatives, and a ceded modco agreement of certain inforce funding agreement contracts for which Athene elected the fair value option. Athene estimates the fair value of the ceded modco agreement by discounting projected cash flows for net settlements and certain periodic and non-periodic payments. Unobservable inputs include estimates for asset portfolio returns and economic inputs used in the discount rate, including risk margin. Depending on the projected cash flows and other assumptions, the contract may be recorded as an asset or liability. The estimate is classified as Level 3.\n8. Reinsurance\nThe following summarizes the effect of reinsurance on premiums and future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations:\nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPremiums\nDirect\n$\n1,089\n \n$\n10,525\n \n$\n11,373\n \nReinsurance assumed\n313\n \n2,313\n \n377\n \nReinsurance ceded\n(\n84\n)\n(\n89\n)\n(\n112\n)\nTotal premiums\n$\n1,318\n \n$\n12,749\n \n$\n11,638\n \nFuture policy and other policy benefits\nDirect\n$\n2,779\n \n$\n12,321\n \n$\n12,142\n \nReinsurance assumed\n550\n \n2,389\n \n416\n \nReinsurance ceded\n(\n275\n)\n(\n276\n)\n(\n93\n)\nTotal future policy and other policy benefits\n$\n3,054\n \n$\n14,434\n \n$\n12,465\n \nReinsurance typically provides for recapture rights on the part of the ceding company for certain events of default. Additionally, some agreements require placement of assets in trust accounts for the benefit of the ceding entity. The required minimum assets are equal to or greater than statutory reserves, as defined by the agreement, and were $\n26.1\n billion and $\n21.6\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Although Athene owns assets placed in trust, their use is restricted based on the trust agreement terms. If the statutory book value of the assets, or in certain cases fair value, in a trust declines because of impairments or other reasons, Athene may be required to contribute additional assets to the trust. In addition, the assets within a trust may be subject to a pledge in favor of the applicable reinsurance company.\n207\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReinsurance transactions\nAthene entered into a coinsurance agreement to reinsure a block of whole life policies during the fourth quarter of 2023. There were no block reinsurance transactions during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022. \nThe following summarizes the block reinsurance agreement at inception:\n(In millions)\nYear ended December 31, 2023\nLiabilities assumed\n$\n1,975\n \nLess: Assets received\n2,158\n \nDeferred profit liability\n1\n$\n(\n183\n)\n1 \nIncluded within future policy benefits on the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nCatalina\nAthene has reinsurance agreements with certain affiliates of Catalina Holdings (Bermuda) Ltd. (together with its subsidiaries, “Catalina”). See note 18 for further information on these reinsurance agreements. \nGlobal Atlantic\nAthene has a coinsurance and assumption agreement with Global Atlantic. The agreement ceded all existing open block life insurance business issued by AAIA, with the exception of enhanced guarantee universal life insurance products. Athene also entered into a coinsurance agreement with Global Atlantic to cede all policy liabilities of the ILICO Closed Block. The ILICO Closed Block consists primarily of participating whole life insurance policies. Athene also has an excess of loss arrangement with Global Atlantic to be reimbursed for any payments required from Athene’s general assets to meet the contractual obligations of the AmerUs Closed Block not covered by existing reinsurance through Athene Re USA IV. The AmerUs Closed Block consists primarily of participating whole life insurance policies. Since all liabilities were covered by the existing reinsurance at close, no reinsurance premiums were ceded. The assets backing the AmerUs Closed Block are managed, on AAIA’s behalf, by Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Global Atlantic maintained a series of trust and custody accounts under the terms of these agreements with assets equal to or greater than a required aggregate statutory balance of $\n2.5\n billion and $\n2.5\n billion, respectively. \nProtective Life Insurance Company (“Protective”)\n \nAthene reinsured certain of its life and health business to Protective under a coinsurance agreement.

Significant inputs and assumptions are required for determining the expected duration of the cohort and involves using accepted actuarial methods to determine decrement rates related to policyholder behavior for lapses, withdrawals (surrenders) and mortality. The assumptions used to determine the amortization of DAC and DSI are consistent with those used to estimate the related liability balance.\nDeferred costs related to investment contracts without significant revenue streams from sources other than investment of policyholder funds are amortized using the effective interest method, which primarily includes funding agreements. The effective interest method requires inputs to project future cash flows, which for funding agreements includes contractual terms of notional value, periodic interest payments based on either fixed or floating interest rates, and duration. For other investment-type contracts which include immediate annuities and assumed endowments without significant mortality risks, assumptions are required related to policyholder behavior for lapses and withdrawals (surrenders).\nThe expected amortization of VOBA for the next five years is as follows:\n(In millions)\nExpected Amortization\n2025\n$\n295\n \n2026\n261\n \n2027\n227\n \n2028\n194\n \n2029\n167\n \n209\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n10.

In connection with the completion of the Mergers, the Company recognized goodwill of $\n4.1\n billion as of the Merger Date. See note 3 for further disclosure regarding the goodwill recorded as a result of the Mergers.\nIn connection with the completion of the Mergers, the Company undertook a strategic review of its operating structure and business segments to assess the performance of its businesses and the allocation of resources. As a result, the Company reorganized into \nthree\n reportable segments: Asset Management, Retirement Services, and Principal Investing. The Company conducted interim impairment testing immediately prior to and subsequent to the reorganization and determined there to be no impairment of historical goodwill.\nApollo acquired Griffin Capital’s U.S. wealth distribution business and U.S. asset management business in \ntwo\n separate closings on March 1, 2022 and May 3, 2022 and recorded goodwill of $\n13\n million and $\n134\n million, respectively, on each acquisition date. All of the goodwill associated with the Griffin Capital acquisitions is included within the Asset Management segment.\n11. Long-duration Contracts\nInterest sensitive contract liabilities – \nInterest sensitive contract liabilities primarily include:\n▪\ntraditional deferred annuities,\n▪\nindexed annuities consisting of fixed indexed, index-linked variable annuities, and assumed indexed universal life without significant mortality risk,\n▪\nfunding agreements, and\n▪\nother investment-type contracts comprising of immediate annuities without significant mortality risk (which includes pension group annuities without life contingencies) and assumed endowments without significant mortality risks.\nThe following represents a rollforward of the policyholder account balance by product within interest sensitive contract liabilities.

For whole life products, significant assumptions and inputs include policyholder demographic data, assumptions for mortality, morbidity, and lapse and discount rates. \nAthene bases certain key assumptions related to policyholder behavior on industry standard data adjusted to align with actual company experience, if necessary. At least annually, Athene reviews all significant cash flow assumptions and updates as necessary, unless emerging experience indicates a more frequent review is necessary. The discount rate reflects market observable inputs from upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yields and is interpolated, where necessary, to conform to the duration of Athene’s liabilities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the present value of expected future policy benefits decreased by $\n3,400\n million, which was driven by $\n4,561\n million of benefit payments, a $\n1,440\n million change in discount rate assumptions due to an increase in rates, and a $\n356\n million change in foreign exchange, partially offset by $\n1,871\n million of interest accrual and $\n1,115\n million of issuances, primarily pension group annuities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the present value of expected future policy benefits increased by $\n11,950\n million, which was driven by $\n13,518\n million of issuances, primarily pension group annuities, a $\n2,236\n million change in discount rate assumptions related to a decrease in rates, and $\n1,664\n million of interest accrual, partially offset by $\n3,852\n million of benefit payments, a $\n1,509\n million reduction in reserve related to recapture, and $\n297\n million resulting from favorable unlocking of assumptions, primarily related to higher interest rates and favorable mortality experience lowering future benefit payments. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the present value of expected future policy benefits increased by $\n1,144\n million, which was driven by $\n11,528\n million of issuances, primarily pension group annuities, and $\n1,146\n million of interest accrual, partially offset by an $\n8,425\n million change in discount rate assumptions related to an increase in rates, and $\n2,921\n million of benefit payments.\nThe following is a summary of remeasurement gains (losses) included within future policy and other policy benefits on the consolidated statements of operations:\nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nReserves\n$\n25\n \n$\n364\n \n$\n120\n \nDeferred profit liability\n(\n48\n)\n(\n246\n)\n(\n126\n)\nNegative VOBA\n39\n \n(\n65\n)\n21\n \nTotal remeasurement gains (losses)\n$\n16\n \n$\n53\n \n$\n15\n \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022.

Judgment is required for both economic and actuarial assumptions, which can be either observable or unobservable, that impact future policyholder account growth.\nEconomic assumptions include interest rates and implied volatilities throughout the duration of the liability. For indexed annuities, assumptions also include projected equity returns which impact cash flows attributable to indexed strategies, implied equity volatilities, expected index credits on the next policy anniversary date and future equity option costs. Assumptions related to the level of option budgets used for determining the future equity option costs and the impact on future policyholder account value growth are considered unobservable inputs.\nPolicyholder behavior assumptions are unobservable inputs and are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods to estimate withdrawals (surrender rate) and income rider utilization. Assumptions are generally based on industry data and pricing assumptions which are updated for actual experience, if necessary. Actual experience may be limited for recently issued products.\nAll inputs are used to project excess benefits and fees over a range of risk-neutral, stochastic interest rate scenarios. For indexed annuities, stochastic equity return scenarios are also included within the range. A risk margin is incorporated within the discount rate to reflect uncertainty in the projected cash flows such as variations in policyholder behavior, as well as a credit spread to reflect nonperformance risk, which is considered an unobservable input. Athene uses its public credit rating relative to the U.S. Treasury curve as of the valuation date to reflect its nonperformance risk in the fair value estimate of market risk benefits.\nThe following summarizes the unobservable inputs for market risk benefits:\nDecember 31, 2024\n(In millions, except percentages)\nFair Value\nValuation Technique\nUnobservable Inputs\nMinimum\nMaximum\nWeighted Average\nImpact of an Increase in the Input on Fair Value\nMarket risk benefits, net\n$\n3,715\n \nDiscounted cash flow\nNonperformance risk\n0.4\n \n%\n1.1\n \n%\n1.0\n \n%\n1\nDecrease\nOption budget\n0.5\n \n%\n6.0\n \n%\n2.3\n \n%\n2\nDecrease\nSurrender rate\n3.3\n \n%\n7.2\n \n%\n4.6\n \n%\n2\nDecrease\nUtilization rate\n28.6\n \n%\n95.0\n \n%\n84.9\n \n%\n3\nIncrease\nDecember 31, 2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nFair Value\nValuation Technique\nUnobservable Inputs\nMinimum\nMaximum\nWeighted Average\nImpact of an Increase in the Input on Fair Value\nMarket risk benefits, net\n$\n3,373\n \nDiscounted cash flow\nNonperformance risk\n0.4\n \n%\n1.4\n \n%\n1.2\n \n%\n1\nDecrease\nOption budget\n0.5\n \n%\n6.0\n \n%\n1.9\n \n%\n2\nDecrease\nSurrender rate\n3.2\n \n%\n6.4\n \n%\n4.5\n \n%\n2\nDecrease\nUtilization rate\n28.6\n \n%\n95.0\n \n%\n83.6\n \n%\n3\nIncrease\nDecember 31, 2022\n(In millions, except percentages)\nFair Value\nValuation Technique\nUnobservable Inputs\nMinimum\nMaximum\nWeighted Average\nImpact of an Increase in the Input on Fair Value\nMarket risk benefits, net\n$\n2,489\n \nDiscounted cash flow\nNonperformance risk\n0.2\n \n%\n1.6\n \n%\n1.4\n \n%\n1\nDecrease\nOption budget\n0.5\n \n%\n5.3\n \n%\n1.7\n \n%\n2\nDecrease\nSurrender rate\n3.3\n \n%\n6.7\n \n%\n4.4\n \n%\n2\nDecrease\nUtilization rate\n28.6\n \n%\n95.0\n \n%\n82.3\n \n%\n3\nIncrease\n1\n The nonperformance risk weighted average is based on the cash flows underlying the market risk benefit reserve.\n2\n The option budget and surrender rate weighted averages are calculated based on projected account values.\n3\n The utilization of GLWB withdrawals represents the estimated percentage of policyholders that are expected to use their income rider over the duration of the contract, with the weighted average based on current account values.\n219\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12.

The IRA contains a number of tax-related provisions, including a 15% minimum corporate income tax on certain large corporations (“CAMT”) as well as an excise tax on stock repurchases. Based on interpretations and assumptions the Company has made regarding the CAMT provisions of the IRA, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset and offsetting increase to current taxes owed but CAMT does not have a material impact to the effective tax rate. The excise tax has no material impact to the consolidated financial statements. \nAHL changed its domicile from Bermuda to the United States, causing AHL to become a U.S.-domiciled corporation and a U.S. taxpayer effective December 31, 2023 (the “Redomicile”) and is subject to U.S. corporate income tax for 2024 and future years. AHL’s Bermuda subsidiaries (and AHL for pre-Redomicile periods) file protective U.S. income tax returns. AHL’s U.S. subsidiaries file, and AHL for post-Redomicile periods will file, income tax returns with the U.S. federal government and various state governments. \nOn December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023 (“Bermuda CIT”). Commencing on January 1, 2025, the Bermuda CIT generally imposes a 15% corporate income tax on in-scope entities that are resident in Bermuda or have a Bermuda permanent establishment, without regard to any assurances that have been given pursuant to the Exempted Undertakings Tax Protection Act 1966. The Company’s results as of December 31, 2024 include material deferred tax assets resulting from the passage of the Bermuda CIT, primarily related to an opening tax loss carryforward. \nThe U.K. enacted legislation in July 2023 implementing certain provisions of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development’s “Pillar Two” global minimum tax initiative (“Pillar Two”) that applies to multinational enterprises for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. On February 22, 2024, the U.K. enacted certain amendments to its Pillar Two legislation which similarly took effect for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2024. The Company continues to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of Pillar Two, pending legislative adoption by individual countries, as such legislative changes could result in changes to our effective tax rate. The Company evaluated the enacted legislation and concluded there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe primary jurisdictions in which the Company operates and incurs income taxes are the United States, the United Kingdom, and Bermuda (beginning January 1, 2025). There are no material unremitted earnings with respect to the United Kingdom or other foreign jurisdictions. The Company has accumulated undistributed earnings generated by certain foreign subsidiaries, which are intended to be indefinitely reinvested. As such, no deferred taxes have been recorded related to the accumulated undistributed earnings. The Company determined that estimating the unrecognized tax liability is not practicable.\nThe following table reconciles the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate to the effective income tax rate: \n \nYears ended December 31,\n (In millions, except percentages) \n2024\n2023\n2022\nU.S. federal statutory tax rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nIncome passed through to non-controlling interests\n(\n3.5\n)\n(\n4.6\n)\n(\n9.0\n)\nState and local income taxes (net of federal benefit)\n0.5\n \n1.2\n \n(\n0.1\n)\nImpact of Mergers\n—\n \n—\n \n7.3\n \nImpact of foreign taxes (net of foreign tax credit)\n(\n2.6\n)\n(\n31.0\n)\n—\n \nImpact of equity-based compensation\n(\n1.0\n)\n1.0\n \n0.1\n \nImpact of valuation allowance\n0.6\n \n(\n1.3\n)\n—\n \nTax Credits\n(\n0.5\n)\n(\n0.6\n)\n—\n \nRedomicile\n0.1\n \n(\n1.2\n)\n—\n \nOther\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n1.0\n)\n(\n1.9\n)\nEffective income tax rate\n14.3\n \n%\n(\n16.5\n)\n%\n17.4\n \n%\n221\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe income tax provision (benefit) is presented in the following table:\n \nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome tax provision (benefit)\n$\n1,062\n \n$\n(\n923\n)\n$\n(\n739\n)\nIncome tax provision (benefit) from other comprehensive income (loss)\n21\n \n513\n \n(\n1,933\n)\nTotal income tax provision (benefit)\n$\n1,083\n \n$\n(\n410\n)\n$\n(\n2,672\n)\nDeferred income taxes are recorded due to temporary differences between the tax basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the consolidated statements of financial condition.

As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income tax returns for the years 2021 through 2023 are open under the general statute of limitations provisions and therefore subject to examination. Currently, the Internal Revenue Service is examining the tax returns of the Company and certain subsidiaries for tax years 2019 to 2021. The State and City of New York are examining certain subsidiaries’ tax returns for tax years 2014 to 2021. The United Kingdom tax authorities are currently examining certain subsidiaries’ tax returns for tax years 2015 to 2022.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to the unrecognized tax benefits in its provision for income taxes.

Equity-based awards granted to employees and non-employees as compensation are measured based on the grant date fair value of the award, which considers the public share price of AGM’s common stock subject to certain discounts, as applicable. \nThe Company grants both service-based and performance-based awards. The estimated total grant date fair value for service-based awards is charged to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally \none\n to \nfive years\n from the date of grant. Certain service-based awards are tied to profit sharing arrangements in which a portion of the performance fees distributed to the general partner are required to be used by employees to purchase restricted shares of common stock or is delivered in the form of RSUs, which are granted under the Company’s Equity Plan. Performance-based awards vest subject to continued employment and the Company’s achievement of specified performance goals. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, equity-based compensation expense for performance grants are typically recognized on an accelerated recognition method over the requisite service period to the extent the performance revenue metrics are met or deemed probable. Equity-based awards that do not require future service (\ni.e.\n, vested awards) are expensed immediately. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded equity-based compensation expense of $\n721\n million, $\n1.0\n billion and $\n540\n million, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, there was $\n588\n million of estimated unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSU awards. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n2.0\n years. \n227\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average discounts for plan grants, bonus grants and performance grants:\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPlan grants:\nDiscount for the lack of distributions until vested\n1\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n0.2\n \n%\nMarketability discount for transfer restrictions\n2\n4.4\n \n%\n15.4\n \n%\n10.0\n \n%\nBonus grants:\nMarketability discount for transfer restrictions\n2\n2.5\n \n%\n4.0\n \n%\n3.5\n \n%\nPerformance grants:\nDiscount for the lack of distributions until vested\n1\n—\n \n%\n0.2\n \n%\n1.3\n \n%\nMarketability discount for transfer restrictions\n2\n11.0\n \n%\n9.7\n \n%\n7.6\n \n%\n1\n Based on the present value of a growing annuity calculation.\n2\n Based on the Finnerty Model calculation.\nService-Based Awards\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company awarded \n3.7\n million, \n5.0\n million and \n5.1\n million of service-based RSUs, respectively, with a grant date fair value of $\n405\n million, $\n339\n million and $\n310\n million, respectively. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded equity-based compensation expense on service-based RSUs of $\n398\n million, $\n313\n million and $\n245\n million, respectively. \nPerformance-Based Awards\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company awarded \n1.5\n million, \n1.5\n million and \n3.9\n million of performance-based RSUs, respectively, with a grant date fair value of $\n181\n million, $\n97\n million and $\n228\n million, respectively, which primarily vest subject to continued employment and the Company’s receipt of performance revenues, within prescribed periods, sufficient to cover the associated equity-based compensation expense.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded equity-based compensation expense on performance-based awards of $\n260\n million, $\n175\n million and $\n205\n million, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company issued equity awards where the number of shares to be issued is variable based on the achievement of specified performance targets. Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period based upon the probable outcome of the performance condition and the performance-based compensation is classified as a liability, and therefore, the fair value of these awards is remeasured each reporting period. Given the number of shares to be issued in settlement of these awards is not yet known, the tables below exclude the impact of these awards.\nIn December 2021, the Company awarded one-time grants to the Co-Presidents of AAM of \n6.0\n million RSUs which vest on a cliff basis subject to continued employment over \nfive years\n, with \n2.0\n million of those RSUs also subject to the Company’s achievement of certain fee related earnings and spread related earnings per share metrics.

Equity \nCommon Stock\nHolders of common stock are entitled to participate in dividends from the Company on a pro rata basis.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company issued shares of common stock in settlement of vested RSUs. The Company has generally allowed holders of vested RSUs and exercised share options to settle their tax liabilities by reducing the number of shares of common stock issued to them, which the Company refers to as “net share settlement.” Additionally, the Company has generally allowed holders of share options to settle their exercise price by reducing the number of shares of common stock issued to them at the time of exercise by an amount sufficient to cover the exercise price. The net share settlement results in a liability for the Company and a corresponding adjustment to retained earnings (accumulated deficit).\nOn January 3, 2022, the Company announced a share repurchase program, pursuant to which, the Company was authorized to repurchase (i) up to an aggregate of $\n1.5\n billion of shares of its common stock in order to opportunistically reduce its share count and (ii) up to an aggregate of $\n1.0\n billion of shares of its common stock in order to offset the dilutive impact of share issuances under its equity incentive plans. On February 21, 2023, the AGM board of directors approved a reallocation of the Company’s share repurchase program, pursuant to which, the Company was authorized to repurchase (i) up to an aggregate of $\n1.0\n billion of shares of its common stock in order to opportunistically reduce its share count, a decrease of $\n0.5\n billion of \n229\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nshares from the previously authorized amount and (ii) up to an aggregate of $\n1.5\n billion of shares of its common stock in order to offset the dilutive impact of share issuances under its equity incentive plans, an increase of $\n0.5\n billion of shares from the previously authorized amount.\nOn February 8, 2024, the AGM board of directors terminated the Company’s prior share repurchase program and approved a new share repurchase program, pursuant to which, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $\n3.0\n billion of shares of its common stock to opportunistically reduce the Company’s share count or offset the dilutive impact of share issuances under the Company’s equity incentive plans. Shares of common stock may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions, pursuant to a trading plan adopted in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise, as well as through reductions of shares that otherwise would have been issued to participants under the Company’s Equity Plan in order to satisfy associated tax obligations. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at any specific time. The program is effective until the aggregate repurchase amount that has been approved by the AGM board of directors has been expended and may be suspended, extended, modified or discontinued at any time.\nThe table below outlines the share activity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 :\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nShares of common stock issued in settlement of vested RSUs and options exercised\n1\n7,852,512\n \n8,643,520\n \n6,663,694\n \nShares issued to Apollo Opportunity Foundation\n2\n—\n \n—\n \n1,724,137\n \nReduction of shares of common stock issued\n3\n(\n2,998,607\n)\n(\n3,185,680\n)\n(\n2,896,130\n)\nShares of common stock purchased related to share issuances and forfeitures\n4\n(\n150,676\n)\n(\n162,123\n)\n(\n219,960\n)\nIssuance of shares of common stock for equity-based awards\n4,703,229\n \n5,295,717\n \n5,271,741\n \n1\n The gross value of shares issued was $\n868\n million, $\n626\n million and $\n420\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, based on the closing price of the shares of common stock at the time of issuance.\n2\n Shares issued to Apollo Opportunity Foundation in connection with an irrevocable pledge to contribute \n1.7\n million shares of common stock.

If declared, dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be payable quarterly on January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each year, commencing on October 31, 2023, and \n230\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nending on, and including, July 31, 2026. The first dividend payment on October 31, 2023 was $\n0.7500\n per share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, with subsequent quarterly cash dividends expected to be $\n0.8438\n per share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\nUnless converted earlier in accordance with its terms, each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert on the mandatory conversion date, which is expected to be July 31, 2026, into between \n0.5056\n shares and \n0.6067\n shares of common stock, in each case, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments described in the certificate of designations related to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Certificate of Designations”).

The amount is payable to the Company over five years and is held at fair value.\n2\n Includes $\n175\n million as of December 31, 2023 related to the AOG Unit Payment, which was payable in equal quarterly installments through December 31, 2024.\nTax Receivable Agreement\nAll Apollo Operating Group entities have made, or will make, an election under Section 754 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). The election results in an increase to the tax basis of underlying assets which will reduce the amount of gain and associated tax that AGM and its subsidiaries will otherwise be required to pay in the future.\nThe tax receivable agreement (“TRA”) provides for payment to the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners of \n85\n% of the amount of cash tax savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes the Company realizes as a result of the increases in tax basis of assets resulting from exchanges of AOG Units for Class A shares that have occurred in prior years. AGM and its subsidiaries retain the benefit of the remaining \n15\n% of actual cash tax savings. If the Company does not make the required annual payment on a timely basis as outlined in the tax receivable agreement, interest is accrued on the balance until the payment date.\n235\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFollowing the closing of the Mergers, as the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners no longer own AOG Units, there were no new exchanges subject to the TRA.\nAOG Unit Payment\nOn December 31, 2021, holders of AOG Units (other than Athene and the Company) sold and transferred a portion of such AOG Units to a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of the Company, in exchange for an amount equal to $\n3.66\n multiplied by the total number of AOG Units held by such holders immediately prior to such transaction. The remainder of the AOG Units held by such holders were exchanged for shares of AGM common stock concurrently with the consummation of the Mergers on January 1, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the outstanding payable amount due to Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners was fully paid with no remaining amounts outstanding.\nDue from Employees and Former Employees\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, due from related parties includes various amounts due to Apollo, including employee loans and return of profit-sharing distributions. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the balance includes interest-bearing employee loans receivable of $\n4\n million and $\n3\n million, respectively. The outstanding principal amount of the loans as well as all accrued and unpaid interest is required to be repaid on a specified date, either during the relevant employee’s tenure or at the date of the relevant employee’s resignation, in accordance with the contractual terms of each respective loan arrangement.\nThe receivable from certain employees and former employees includes an amount for the potential return of profit-sharing distributions that would be due if certain funds were liquidated of $\n94\n million and $\n99\n million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nIndemnity\nCertain of the performance revenues Apollo earns from funds may be subject to repayment by its subsidiaries that are general partners of the funds in the event that certain specified return thresholds are not ultimately achieved. The Former Managing Partners, Contributing Partners and certain other investment professionals have personally guaranteed, subject to certain limitations, the obligations of these subsidiaries in respect of this obligation. Such guarantees are several and not joint and are limited to a particular individual’s distributions. Apollo has agreed to indemnify each of the Former Managing Partners and certain Contributing Partners against all amounts that they pay pursuant to any of these personal guarantees in favor of certain funds that it manages (including costs and expenses related to investigating the basis for or objecting to any claims made in respect of the guarantees) for all interests that the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners contributed or sold to the Apollo Operating Group.\nApollo recorded an indemnification liability of $\n0.4\n million and $\n0.3\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nDue to Related Parties\nBased upon an assumed liquidation of certain of the funds Apollo manages, it has recorded a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance allocations, which represents amounts due to certain funds. The obligation is recognized based upon an assumed liquidation of a fund’s net assets as of the reporting date. The actual determination and any required payment would not take place until the final disposition of a fund’s investments based on the contractual termination of the fund or as otherwise set forth in the respective governing document of the fund. \nApollo recorded general partner obligations to return previously distributed performance allocations related to certain funds of $\n213\n million and $\n174\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nAthora\nApollo, through ISGI, provides investment advisory services to certain portfolio companies of funds managed by Apollo and Athora, a strategic liabilities platform that acquires or reinsures blocks of insurance business in the German and broader \n236\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEuropean life insurance market (collectively, the “Athora Accounts”). AAM and its subsidiaries had equity commitments outstanding to Athora of up to $\n331\n million as of December 31, 2024, subject to certain conditions.\nAthora Sub-Advised\nApollo provides sub-advisory services with respect to a portion of the assets in certain portfolio companies of funds managed by Apollo and the Athora Accounts. Apollo broadly refers to “Athora Sub-Advised” assets as those assets in the Athora Accounts which Apollo explicitly sub-advises as well as those assets in the Athora Accounts which are invested directly in funds and investment vehicles Apollo manages.\nApollo earns a base management fee on the aggregate market value of substantially all of the investment accounts of or relating to Athora and also a sub-advisory fee on the Athora Sub-Advised assets, which varies depending on the specific asset class.\nSee “—Athora” in the Retirement Services section below for further details on Athene’s relationship with Athora.\nRegulated Entities and Affiliated Service Providers\nApollo Global Securities, LLC (“AGS”) is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, subject to the minimum net capital requirements of the SEC. AGS was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2024. From time to time AGS, as well as other Apollo affiliates, provide services to related parties of Apollo, including Apollo funds and their portfolio companies, whereby the Company or its affiliates earn fees for providing such services. \nGriffin Capital Securities, LLC (“GCS”) is a registered broker-dealer with the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, subject to the minimum net capital requirements of the SEC. GCS was in compliance with these requirements as of December 31, 2024.\nMidCap Financial\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company modified a performance allocation arrangement with MidCap Financial which included a reversal of unrealized performance allocations of $\n124\n million. This resulted in a modification to the calculation of performance allocations beginning in June 2023 to be based solely on net income.\nInvestment in SPACs\nApollo previously sponsored and consolidated SPACs, as described below.\nIn October 2020, APSG I, a SPAC sponsored by Apollo, completed an IPO, ultimately raising total gross proceeds of $\n817\n million. APSG Sponsor, L.P., a subsidiary of Apollo, held Class B ordinary shares of APSG I, and consolidated it as a VIE. In May 2022, APSG I completed a business combination with American Express Global Business Travel. As a result of the business combination, Apollo no longer consolidates APSG I as a VIE. The deconsolidation resulted in an unrealized gain of $\n162\n million, which includes $\n82\n million of unrealized gains related to previously held Class B ordinary shares, which converted to Class A ordinary shares of the newly merged entity, presented in net gains from investment activities within Other income (loss) - Asset Management in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022. Apollo continues to hold a non-controlling interest in the merged entity at fair value, elected under the fair value option, which is primarily presented within Investments (Asset Management) in the consolidated statements of financial condition.\nOn February 12, 2021, APSG II, a SPAC sponsored by Apollo, completed an IPO, raising total gross proceeds of $\n690\n million. APSG Sponsor II, L.P., a subsidiary of Apollo, held Class B ordinary shares of APSG II, and consolidated APSG II as a VIE. In May 2023, APSG II amended its articles of association to extend the completion window for an initial business combination until February 12, 2024. Also in May 2023, shareholders holding an aggregate of \n51,089,882\n of APSG II’s Class A ordinary shares exercised their right to redeem their shares. The remaining \n17,910,118\n Class A ordinary shares were liquidated in November 2023. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a loss of $\n31\n million.\nOn July 13, 2021, Acropolis Infrastructure Acquisition Corp. (“Acropolis”), a SPAC sponsored by Apollo, completed an IPO, ultimately raising total gross proceeds of $\n345\n million. Acropolis Infrastructure Acquisition Sponsor, L.P., a subsidiary of Apollo, held Class B common stock of Acropolis, and consolidated Acropolis as a VIE. In June 2023, Acropolis amended its \n237\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncertificate of incorporation to extend the completion window for an initial business combination until July 13, 2024. Also in June 2023, shareholders holding an aggregate of \n26,499,201\n shares of Acropolis’ Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem their shares. The remaining \n8,000,799\n shares of Class A common stock were liquidated in December 2023. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company recognized a loss of $\n9\n million.\nThe tables below present the financial information of these previously consolidated SPACs in the aggregate.\nYears ended December 31,\n (In millions)\n2023\n2022\nExpenses:\nGeneral, administrative and other\n$\n3\n \n$\n8\n \nTotal Expenses\n3\n8\nOther Income (Loss):\nNet gains (losses) from investment activities\n(\n15\n)\n20\n \nInterest income\n27\n \n13\n \nTotal Other Income (Loss)\n12\n \n33\n \nIncome (loss) before income tax provision\n9\n \n25\n \nIncome tax provision\n(\n2\n)\n(\n1\n)\nNet Income (Loss)\n7\n \n24\n \nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n(\n41\n)\n—\n \nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Apollo Global Management, Inc.\n(\n34\n)\n24\n \nRetirement Services\nAAA\nAthene consolidates AAA as a VIE and AAA holds the majority of Athene’s alternative investment portfolio. Apollo established AAA to provide a single vehicle through which investors may participate in a portfolio of alternative investments, including those managed by Apollo. Additionally, the Company believes AAA enhances its ability to increase alternative assets under management by raising capital from third parties, which allows it to achieve greater scale and diversification for alternatives. During the third quarter of 2024, AAA underwent a restructuring which resulted in a change in consolidation that reduced Athene’s non-controlling interests by $\n1.1\n billion and does not represent a withdrawal from AAA. \nAthora\nAthene has a cooperation agreement with Athora, pursuant to which, among other things, (1) for a period of \n30\n days from the receipt of notice of a cession, Athene has the right of first refusal to reinsure (i) up to \n50\n% of the liabilities ceded from Athora’s reinsurance subsidiaries to Athora Life Re Ltd. and (ii) up to \n20\n% of the liabilities ceded from a third party to any of Athora’s insurance subsidiaries, subject to a limitation in the aggregate of \n20\n% of Athora’s liabilities, (2) Athora agreed to cause its insurance subsidiaries to consider the purchase of certain funding agreements and/or other spread instruments issued by Athene’s insurance subsidiaries, subject to a limitation that the fair market value of such funding agreements purchased by any of Athora’s insurance subsidiaries may generally not exceed \n3\n% of the fair market value of such subsidiary’s total assets, and (3) Athene provides Athora with a right of first refusal to pursue acquisition and reinsurance transactions in Europe (other than the U.K.). Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the cooperation agreement, Athora is only required to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its subsidiaries to adhere to the provisions set forth in the cooperation agreement and therefore Athora’s ability to cause its subsidiaries to act pursuant to the cooperation agreement may be limited by, among other things, legal prohibitions or the inability to obtain the approval of the board of directors or other applicable governing body of the applicable subsidiary, which approval is solely at the discretion of such governing body. As of December 31, 2024, Athene had not exercised its right of first refusal to reinsure liabilities ceded to Athora’s insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries.\n238\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table summarizes Athene’s investments in Athora:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nInvestment fund\n$\n1,033\n \n$\n1,082\n \nNon-redeemable preferred equity and corporate debt securities\n277\n \n249\n \nTotal investment in Athora\n$\n1,310\n \n$\n1,331\n \nAdditionally, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Athene had $\n57\n million and $\n61\n million, respectively, of funding agreements outstanding to Athora. Athene also has commitments to make additional investments in Athora of $\n502\n million as of December 31, 2024.\nAtlas\nAthene has an equity investment in Atlas, an asset-backed specialty lender, through its investment in AAA and, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Athene held $\n3.2\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion, respectively, of AFS securities issued by Atlas. Athene also held $\n724\n million and $\n921\n million of reverse repurchase agreements issued by Atlas as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, Athene has commitments to make additional investments in Atlas of $\n3.0\n billion. Additionally, see note 19 for further information on assurance letters issued in support of Atlas.\nCatalina \nAthene has an investment in Apollo Rose II (B) (“Apollo Rose”). Apollo Rose holds common and preferred equity interests in Catalina. During the third quarter of 2024, Athene distributed $\n141\n million of its investment in Apollo Rose representing Catalina common equity interests, which is subsequently held by an asset management subsidiary of AGM.\nAthene has a strategic modco reinsurance agreement with Catalina to cede certain inforce funding agreements. Athene elected the fair value option on this agreement and had a liability of $\n221\n million and $\n330\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which is included in other liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition. During the first quarter of 2024, Athene entered into a modco reinsurance agreement with Catalina to cede a quota share of retail deferred annuity products. As of December 31, 2024, Athene had a reinsurance recoverable balance of $\n4.3\n billion related to this agreement. \nSkylign\nAthene has investments in Skylign Aviation Holdings, LP (“Skylign”), a leading aviation finance group focused on aviation lending and leasing, both directly through notes issued by PK AirFinance, a subsidiary of Skylign, and indirectly through AAA, as Athene contributed certain of its investments in PK AirFinance to AAA during the second quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Athene held $\n1.6\n billion and $\n1.6\n billion, respectively, of Skylign senior notes, which are included in investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. Athene has commitments to make additional investments in Skylign of $\n40\n million as of December 31, 2024.\nVenerable\nVA Capital Company LLC (“VA Capital”) is owned by a consortium of investors, led by affiliates of Apollo, Crestview Partners III Management, LLC and Reverence Capital Partners L.P., and is the parent of Venerable. Athene has a minority equity investment in VA Capital, which was $\n178\n million and $\n181\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, that is included in investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition and accounted for as an equity method investment. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2024, Athene purchased an interest in AP Violet ATH Holdings, LP from Athora. Athene consolidated AP Violet ATH Holdings, L.P. as of December 31, 2024 and its investment of $\n106\n million primarily represents an interest in VA Capital.\nAthene also has coinsurance and modco agreements with VIAC, which is a subsidiary of Venerable. VIAC is a related party due to Athene’s investment in VA Capital. Effective July 1, 2023, VIAC recaptured $\n2.7\n billion of reserves, which represents a portion of their business that was subject to those coinsurance and modco agreements. Athene recognized a gain of $\n555\n million, which is included in other revenues on the consolidated statements of operations, in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of the settlement of the recapture agreement. As a result of Athene’s intent to transfer the assets supporting this business to \n239\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nVIAC in connection with the recapture, Athene was required by U.S. GAAP to recognize the unrealized losses on these assets of $\n104\n million as intent-to-sell impairments in the second quarter of 2023. \nAdditionally, Athene has term loans receivable from Venerable due in 2033, which are included in investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The loans are held at fair value and were $\n331\n million and $\n343\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. While management viewed the overall transactions with Venerable as favorable to Athene, the stated interest rate of \n6.257\n% on the initial term loan to Venerable represented a below-market interest rate, and management considered such rate as part of its evaluation and pricing of the reinsurance transactions.\nWheels\nAthene invests in Wheels indirectly through its investment in AAA. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Athene also owned $\n1.0\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion, respectively, of AFS securities issued by Wheels, which are included in investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. \nAthene\n also has commitments to make additional investments in Wheels of $\n100\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2024.\nApollo/Athene Dedicated Investment Programs\n    \nAthene’s subsidiary, ACRA 1 is partially owned by ADIP I, a series of funds managed by Apollo. Athene’s subsidiary, ALRe, currently directly holds \n37\n% of the economic interests in ACRA 1 and all of ACRA 1’s voting interests, with ADIP I holding the remaining \n63\n% of the economic interests. ACRA 2 is partially owned by ADIP II, a fund managed by Apollo. ADIP II owns \n63\n% of the economic interests in ACRA 2, with ALRe directly owning the remaining \n37\n% of the economic interests. ALRe holds all of ACRA 2’s voting interests. \nAthene received capital contributions and paid distributions relating to ACRA of the following:\nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nContributions from ADIP\n$\n954\n \n$\n996\n \n$\n1,047\n \nDistributions to ADIP\n(\n920\n)\n(\n539\n)\n(\n63\n)\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, Athene purchased investments in ADIP I and ADIP II. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Athene held investments in ADIP of $\n238\n million, which are accounted for as equity method investments and included investments in related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Athene has commitments to make additional investments in ADIP of $\n324\n million.\n19. Commitments and Contingencies\nInvestment Commitments\nThe Company has unfunded capital commitments of $\n564\n million as of December 31, 2024 related to the funds it manages. Separately, Athene had commitments to make investments, inclusive of related party commitments discussed previously and those of its consolidated VIEs, of $\n24.0\n billion as of December 31, 2024. Athene’s commitments primarily include \ncapital contributions to investment funds and mortgage loan commitments. \nThe Company expects most of the current commitments will be invested over the next five years; however, these commitments could become due any time upon counterparty request. \nContingent Obligations\nPerformance allocations with respect to certain funds are subject to reversal in the event of future losses to the extent of the cumulative revenues recognized in income to date. If all of the existing investments became worthless, the amount of cumulative revenues that have been recognized by Apollo through December 31, 2024 and that could be reversed approximates $\n5.5\n billion. Performance allocations are affected by changes in the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds that Apollo manages. Valuations, on an unrealized basis, can be significantly affected by a variety of external factors including, but not limited to, bond yields and industry trading multiples. Movements in these items can affect valuations quarter to quarter even if the underlying business fundamentals remain stable. Management views the possibility of all of the investments becoming worthless as remote.\n240\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAdditionally, at the end of the life of certain funds, Apollo may be obligated as general partner, to repay the funds’ performance allocations received in excess of what was ultimately earned. This obligation amount, if any, will depend on final realized values of investments at the end of the life of each fund or as otherwise set forth in the partnership agreement of the fund.\nCertain funds may not generate performance allocations as a result of unrealized and realized losses that are recognized in the current and prior reporting periods. In certain cases, performance allocations will not be generated until additional unrealized and realized gains occur. Any appreciation would first cover the deductions for invested capital, unreturned organizational expenses, operating expenses, management fees and priority returns based on the terms of the respective fund agreements.\nOne of Apollo’s subsidiaries, AGS, provides underwriting commitments in connection with securities offerings of related parties of Apollo, including portfolio companies of the funds Apollo manages, as well as third parties. As of December 31, 2024, there were no open underwriting commitments.\nThe Company, along with a third-party institutional investor, has committed to provide financing to a consolidated VIE that invests across Apollo’s capital markets platform (such VIE, the “Apollo Capital Markets Partnership”). Pursuant to these arrangements, the Company has committed equity financing to the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership. The Apollo Capital Markets Partnership also has a revolving credit facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as lead arranger, administrative agent and letter of credit issuer, Mizuho Bank Ltd., and other lenders party thereto, pursuant to which it may borrow up to $\n2.5\n billion. The revolving credit facility, which has a final maturity date of April 1, 2025, is non-recourse to the Company, except that the Company provided customary comfort letters with respect to its capital contributions to the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership. As of December 31, 2024, the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership had funded commitments of $\n1.2\n billion, on a net basis, to transactions across Apollo’s capital markets platform, all of which were funded through the revolving credit facility and other asset-based financing. No capital had been funded by the Company to the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership pursuant to its commitment.\nWhether the commitments of the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership are actually funded, in whole or in part, depends on the contractual terms of such commitments, including the satisfaction or waiver of any conditions to closing or funding. It is expected that between the time the Apollo Capital Markets Partnership makes a commitment and funding of such commitment, efforts will be made to syndicate such commitment to, among others, third parties, which should reduce its risk when committing to certain transactions. The Apollo Capital Markets Partnership may also, with respect to a particular transaction, enter into other arrangements with third parties which reduce its commitment risk.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Stone Tower in 2012, Apollo agreed to pay its former owners a specified percentage of future performance revenues earned from certain of its funds, CLOs, and strategic investment accounts. This obligation was determined based on the present value of estimated future performance revenue payments and is recorded in other liabilities. The fair value of the remaining contingent obligation was $\n67\n million and $\n67\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. This contingent consideration obligation is remeasured to fair value at each reporting period until the obligations are satisfied. The changes in the fair value of the Stone Tower contingent consideration obligation is reflected in profit sharing expense within compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Griffin Capital’s U.S. asset management business on May 3, 2022, Apollo agreed to pay its former owners certain share-based consideration contingent on specified AUM and capital raising thresholds. This obligation was determined based on the present value of estimated future performance relative to such thresholds and is recorded in other liabilities. \nAs of December 31, 2023, the fair value of the remaining contingent obligation was $\n26\n million. During the second quarter of 2024, the specified capital raise thresholds were achieved and the Company issued \n742,742\n shares of common stock to settle the share-based consideration obligation to Griffin Capital’s former owners. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining contingent obligation based on the specified AUM threshold was not met and the contingent obligation expired without satisfaction, therefore, there is \nno\n remaining contingent obligation outstanding. The Company recorded a loss of $\n58\n million related to these contingent obligations in 2024. The changes in the fair value of the Griffin Capital contingent consideration obligation were reflected in other income (loss) in the consolidated statements of income through December 31, 2024. \n241\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFunding Agreements\nAthene is a member of the \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (“\nFHLB”) and, through its membership, has issued funding agreements to the FHLB in exchange for cash advances. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Athene had $\n15.6\n billion and $\n6.5\n billion, respectively, of FHLB funding agreements outstanding. Athene is required to provide collateral in excess of the funding agreement amounts outstanding, considering any discounts to the securities posted and prepayment penalties.\nAthene has a funding agreement backed notes (“FABN”) program, which allows Athene Global Funding, a special purpose, unaffiliated statutory trust, to offer its senior secured medium-term notes. Athene Global Funding uses the net proceeds from each sale to purchase one or more funding agreements from Athene. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Athene had $\n24.1\n billion and $\n19.9\n billion, respectively, of FABN funding agreements outstanding. Athene had $\n10.2\n billion of board-authorized FABN capacity remaining as of December 31, 2024.\nAthene also issues secured and other funding agreements. Secured funding agreements involve special-purpose, unaffiliated entities entering into repurchase agreements with a third party, the proceeds of which are used by the special-purpose entities to purchase funding agreements from Athene. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Athene had $\n14.8\n billion and $\n6.0\n billion, respectively, of secured and other funding agreements outstanding.\nPledged Assets and Funds in Trust (Restricted Assets)\nAthene’s total restricted assets included on the consolidated statements of financial condition are as follows:\n(In millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAFS securities\n$\n46,337\n \n$\n32,458\n \nTrading securities\n1,665\n \n139\n \nEquity securities\n286\n \n80\n \nMortgage loans\n27,883\n \n14,257\n \nInvestment funds\n777\n \n409\n \nDerivative assets\n91\n \n73\n \nShort-term investments\n2\n \n153\n \nOther investments\n1,507\n \n313\n \nRestricted cash and cash equivalents\n953\n \n1,761\n \nTotal restricted assets\n$\n79,501\n \n$\n49,643\n \nThe restricted assets are primarily related to reinsurance trusts established in accordance with coinsurance agreements and the FHLB and secured funding agreements described above.\nLetters of Credit\nAthene has undrawn letters of credit totaling $\n1.3\n billion as of December 31, 2024. These letters of credit were issued for Athene’s reinsurance program and have expirations through May 22, 2028. \nAtlas\nIn connection with the Company and CS’s previously announced transaction, whereby Atlas acquired certain assets of the CS Securitized Products Group, \ntwo\n subsidiaries of the Company have each issued an assurance letter to CS to guarantee the full five year deferred purchase obligation of Atlas in the amount of $\n3.3\n billion. In March 2024, in connection with Atlas concluding its investment management agreement with CS, the deferred purchase obligation amount was reduced to $\n2.5\n billion. In addition, certain strategic investors have made equity commitments to Atlas which therefore obligates these investors for a portion of the deferred purchase obligation. The Company’s guarantee is not probable of payment, therefore, there is no liability on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n242\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters\nThe Company is party to various legal actions arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including claims and lawsuits, arbitrations, reviews, investigations or proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies regarding the Company’s business. \nOn December 21, 2017, several entities referred to collectively as “Harbinger” commenced an action in New York Supreme Court captioned \nHarbinger Capital Partners II LP et al. v. Apollo Global Management LLC, et al.\n (No. 657515/2017). The complaint named as defendants AAM, and funds managed by Apollo that invested in SkyTerra Communications, Inc. (“SkyTerra”), among others. The complaint alleged that during the period of Harbinger’s various equity and debt investments in SkyTerra from 2004 to 2010, the defendants concealed from Harbinger material defects in SkyTerra technology. The complaint further alleged that Harbinger would not have made investments in SkyTerra totaling approximately $\n1.9\n billion had it known of the defects, and that the public disclosure of these defects ultimately led to SkyTerra filing for bankruptcy in 2012 (after it had been renamed LightSquared). The complaint sought $\n1.9\n billion in damages, as well as punitive damages, interest, costs, and fees. On June 12, 2019, Harbinger voluntarily discontinued the state action without prejudice. On June 8, 2020, Harbinger refiled its litigation in New York Supreme Court, captioned \nHarbinger Capital Partners II, LP et al. v. Apollo Global Management, LLC et al.\n (No. 652342/2020). The complaint adds \neight\n new defendants and \nthree\n new claims relating to Harbinger’s contention that the new defendants induced Harbinger to buy CCTV One Four Holdings, LLC (“CCTV”) to support SkyTerra’s network even though they allegedly knew that the network had material defects. On November 23, 2020, Defendants refiled a bankruptcy motion, and on November 24, 2020, filed in the state court a motion to stay the state court proceedings pending a ruling by the bankruptcy court on the bankruptcy motion. On February 1, 2021, the bankruptcy court denied the bankruptcy motion. Defendants filed their motions to dismiss the New York Supreme Court action on March 31, 2021, which were granted in part and denied in part on May 23, 2023. The court granted in full the Defendants’ motion to dismiss Harbinger’s complaint as time-barred and denied as moot the Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Plaintiffs have appealed the court’s decision. Apollo believes the claims in this action are without merit. No reasonable estimate of possible loss, if any, can be made at this time.\nIn \nMarch 2020, Frank Funds, which claims to be a former shareholder of MPM Holdings, Inc. (“MPM”), commenced an action in the Delaware Court of Chancery, captioned \nFrank Funds v. Apollo Global Management, Inc., et al.\n, C.A. No. 2020-0130, against AAM, certain former MPM directors (including \nthree\n Apollo officers and employees), and members of the consortium that acquired MPM in a May 2019 merger. The complaint asserted, on behalf of a putative class of former MPM shareholders, a claim against Apollo for breach of its fiduciary duties as MPM’s alleged controlling shareholder in connection with the May 2019 merger. Frank Funds seeks unspecified compensatory damages. On July 23, 2019, a group of former MPM shareholders filed an appraisal petition in Delaware Chancery Court seeking the fair value of their MPM shares that were purchased through MPM’s May 15, 2019 merger, in an action captioned \nIn re Appraisal of MPM Holdings, Inc.\n, C.A. No. 2019-0519 (Del. Ch.). On June 3, 2020, petitioners moved for leave to file a verified amended appraisal petition and class-action complaint that included claims for breach of fiduciary duty and/or aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty against AAM, the Apollo-affiliated fund that owned MPM’s shares before the merger, certain former MPM directors (including \nthree\n Apollo employees), and members of the consortium that acquired MPM, based on alleged actions related to the May 2019 merger. The petitioners also sought to consolidate their appraisal proceeding with the Frank Funds action. On November 13, 2020, the Chancery Court granted the parties’ stipulated order to consolidate the two matters, and on December 21, 2020, the Chancery Court granted petitioners’ motion for leave to file the proposed amended complaint. This new consolidated action is captioned \nIn Re MPM \nHoldings Inc. Appraisal and Stockholder Litigation\n, C.A. No. 2019-0519 (Del Ch.). On November 17, 2023, Plaintiff and Defendants filed a stipulation of settlement with the Chancery Court. On February 23, 2024, the Chancery Court held a hearing on the proposed settlement, which is now pending Court approval. \nOn August 4, 2020, a putative class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada against PlayAGS Inc. (“PlayAGS”), all of the members of PlayAGS’s board of directors (including \nthree\n directors who are affiliated with Apollo), certain underwriters of PlayAGS (including Apollo Global Securities, LLC), as well as AAM, Apollo Investment Fund VIII, L.P., Apollo Gaming Holdings, L.P., and Apollo Gaming Voteco, LLC (these last \nfour\n parties, together, the “Apollo Defendants”). The complaint asserted claims against all defendants arising under the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with certain secondary offerings of PlayAGS stock conducted in August 2018 and March 2019, alleging that the registration statements issued in connection with those offerings did not fully disclose certain business challenges facing PlayAGS. The complaint further asserted a control person claim under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the Apollo Defendants and the director defendants (including the directors affiliated with Apollo), alleging such defendants were responsible for certain misstatements and omissions by PlayAGS about its business. On December 2, 2022, the Court dismissed all claims against the underwriters (including Apollo Global Securities, LLC) and the Apollo Defendants, but allowed a claim \n243\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nagainst PlayAGS and \ntwo\n of PlayAGS’s executives to proceed. On February 13, 2024, the Court dismissed the entire case against all defendants, with prejudice, and instructed the clerk of the court to close the case. On March 14, 2024, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal, which is now fully briefed. Apollo believes the claims in this action are without merit. \nNo\n reasonable estimate of possible loss, if any, can be made at this time. \nOn August 17, 2023, a purported stockholder of AGM filed a shareholder derivative complaint (the “Original Complaint”) in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against current AGM directors Marc Rowan, Scott Kleinman, James Zelter, Alvin Krongard, Michael Ducey, and Pauline Richards, Apollo Former Managing Partners Leon Black and Joshua Harris, and, as a nominal defendant, AGM. The action is captioned Anguilla Social Security Board vs. Black et al., C.A. No. 2023-0846-JTL and challenges the $\n570\n million payments being made to the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners in connection with the elimination of the Up-C structure that was in place prior to Apollo’s merger with Athene. As previously disclosed in Apollo’s SEC filings, this purported stockholder previously had sought and received documents relating to the transaction pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The Original Complaint alleged that the challenged payments amount to corporate waste, that the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners received payments in connection with the Corporate Recapitalization that exceed fair value and therefore breached their fiduciary duties, and that the independent conflicts committee of the AAM board of directors (which then consisted of Mr. Krongard, Mr. Ducey, and Ms. Richards) that negotiated the elimination of the TRA breached their fiduciary duties. The Original Complaint alleged that pre-suit demand was futile because a majority of AGM’s board is either not independent from the Former Managing Partners or face a substantial likelihood of liability in light of the challenges to the transaction. The Original Complaint sought, among other things, declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages, interest, restitution, disgorgement, injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys’ fees. On November 16, 2023, the defendants moved to dismiss the Original Complaint on the basis that, among other things, the plaintiff failed to make a pre-suit demand on the Apollo board of directors. On February 9, 2024, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint (the “Amended Complaint”) that adds new factual allegations but names the same defendants, asserts the same causes of action, and seeks the same relief as the Original Complaint. The Amended Complaint alleges that pre-suit demand was futile for the same reasons alleged in the Original Complaint. On April 25, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the Amended Complaint. On September 20, 2024, the Court of Chancery denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss. AGM and the defendants filed answers to the Amended Complaint on November 25, 2024.  On October 28, 2024, the AGM board of directors adopted resolutions forming a Special Litigation Committee (the “SLC”) comprising directors whom the board determined to be independent and disinterested. The AGM board of directors delegated to the SLC, among other things, the full and exclusive power and authority of the board to investigate, review and evaluate the facts and circumstances asserted in the litigation and determine whether pursuing the litigation is in the best interests of AGM and its stockholders. Pursuant to an order of the court, all proceedings in the litigation are stayed until May 8, 2025, to allow the SLC to complete its investigation. \nNo\n reasonable estimate of possible loss, if any, can be made at this time.\nOn March 14, 2024, a purported stockholder of AGM filed a class action complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against AGM. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain provisions of the stockholders agreement, entered into on January 1, 2022 between AGM and the Former Managing Partners, violate Delaware law. Apollo believes the claims in this action are without merit. On July 11, 2024, defendants moved to dismiss. On August 7, 2024, the court entered an order staying the motion to dismiss pending the resolution of the appeal of the decision in \nWest Palm Beach Firefighters’ Pension Fund v. Moelis & Co.\n, 311 A.3d 809 (Del. Ch. 2024). \nNo\n reasonable estimate of possible loss, if any, can be made at this time. \nAs previously disclosed, certain of Apollo’s investment adviser subsidiaries received a request for information and documents from the SEC in connection with an industry sweep concerning compliance with record retention requirements relating to business communications sent or received via electronic messaging channels. Apollo reached a settlement with the SEC in January 2025 to resolve this matter, paying a civil monetary penalty of $\n8.5\n million, reflected in general, administrative and other in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. As the SEC acknowledged, before the investigation started, Apollo pursued and began implementing technological solutions to permit its personnel to send and receive text messages and chats in a compliant manner. \nGuaranty Association Assessments \nGuaranty associations may subject member insurers, including Athene, to assessments that require the insurers to pay funds to cover contractual obligations under insurance policies issued by insurance companies that become impaired or insolvent. The assessments are based on an insurer’s proportionate share of premiums written in that state during a specified one-year or three-year period for lines of business in which the impaired or insolvent insurer engaged, subject to prescribed limits. On December 30, 2022, the North Carolina Wake County Superior Court entered an Order of Liquidation (the “Liquidation \n244\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOrder”) against Bankers Life Insurance Company (“BLIC”) and Colorado Bankers Life Insurance Company (“CBLIC”), which was affirmed by the North Carolina Court of Appeals on March 5, 2024. On April 9, 2024, GBIG Holdings, LLC (“GBIG”), the sole shareholder of BLIC and CBLIC, filed a Petition for Discretionary Review requesting the North Carolina Supreme Court review the decision by the North Carolina Court of Appeals to affirm the Liquidation Order. On July 11, 2024, GBIG filed a Motion to Withdraw its Petition for Discretionary Review. Athene is not a party to this litigation. The North Carolina Supreme Court granted the Motion to Withdraw on August 23, 2024, which made the Liquidation Order effective on November 30, 2024. Guaranty associations began levying assessments and we expect those assessments to continue for the foreseeable future. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Athene recorded guaranty association expenses related to the BLIC and CBLIC insolvencies of $\n152\n million, which is net of $\n11\n million that Athene expects to recover through future premium tax credits. As of December 31, 2024, the consolidated statements of financial condition include a liability of $\n18\n million based on the current best estimate of assessments Athene expects to receive related to these insolvencies. The actual amount of assessments levied against Athene in connection with the BLIC and CBLIC insolvencies may vary from this estimate.\n20. Statutory Requirements\nAthene’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including Bermuda and the U.S. Certain regulations include restrictions that limit the dividends or other distributions, such as loans or cash advances, available to stockholders without prior approval of the insurance regulatory authorities. The differences between financial statements prepared for insurance regulatory authorities and U.S. GAAP financial statements vary by jurisdiction.\nBermuda Statutory Requirements\nALRe, AARe, Athene Co-Invest Reinsurance Affiliate 1A Ltd. (“ACRA 1A”) and Athene Co-Invest Reinsurance Affiliate 2A Ltd. (“ACRA 2A”) are each licensed by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the “BMA”) as long-term insurers and are subject to the Insurance Act 1978, as amended (the “Bermuda Insurance Act”) and regulations promulgated thereunder. The BMA implemented the Economic Balance Sheet (the “EBS”) framework into the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (“BSCR”), which was granted equivalence to the European Union’s Directive (2009/138/EC) (“Solvency II”). Amounts reported for Bermuda entities within these statutory disclosures exclude the impact of any deferred taxes on the EBS or statutory bases resulting from the enactment of Bermuda CIT.\nUnder the Bermuda Insurance Act, long-term insurers are required to maintain minimum statutory capital and surplus to meet the minimum margin of solvency (“MMS”) and minimum economic statutory capital and surplus (EBS capital and surplus) to meet the Enhanced Capital Requirement (“ECR”). For Athene’s Class C reinsurers, ACRA 1A and ACRA 2A, MMS is equal to the greater of $\n500,000\n, \n1.5\n% of the total statutory assets or \n25\n% of ECR. For Athene’s Class E reinsurers, ALRe and AARe, MMS is equal to the greater of $\n8\n million, \n2\n% of the first $\n500\n million of statutory assets plus \n1.5\n% of statutory assets above $\n500\n million or \n25\n% of ECR. For each class, the ECR is calculated based on a risk-based capital model where risk factor charges are applied to the EBS. The ECR is floored at the MMS. As of December 31, 2024, Athene’s Bermuda subsidiaries were in excess of the minimum levels required. For Athene’s Bermuda reinsurance subsidiaries, the ECR is the binding regulatory constraint. \nThe following represents the EBS capital and surplus and BSCR ratios:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions, except percentages)\nEBS capital & surplus\nBSCR ratio\nEBS capital & surplus\nBSCR ratio\nALRe\n$\n23,547\n \n420\n \n%\n$\n18,245\n \n233\n \n%\nAARe\n27,693\n \n238\n \n%\n26,647\n \n291\n \n%\nACRA 1A\n3,866\n \n165\n \n%\n5,296\n \n219\n \n%\nACRA 2A\n4,277\n \n176\n \n%\n3,717\n \n353\n \n%\nUnder the Bermuda statutory framework, statutory financial statements are generally equivalent to U.S. GAAP financial statements, with the exception of prudential filters and permitted practices granted by the BMA. Athene’s Bermuda subsidiaries have permission in the statutory financial statements to use amortized cost instead of fair value as the basis for certain investments. Additionally, Athene’s Bermuda subsidiaries use U.S. statutory reserving principles for the calculation of insurance reserves instead of U.S. GAAP, subject to the reserves being proved adequate based on cash flow testing. \n245\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following represents the effect of the permitted practices to the statutory financial statements:\nDecember 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nALRe\nAARe\nACRA 1A\nACRA 2A\nIncrease (decrease) to capital and surplus due to permitted practices\n$\n(\n5\n)\n$\n6,119\n \n$\n3,768\n \n$\n51\n \nIncrease (decrease) to statutory net income due to permitted practices\n973\n \n(\n2,695\n)\n54\n \n515\n \nUnder the Bermuda Insurance Act, Athene’s Bermuda subsidiaries are prohibited from paying a dividend in an amount exceeding 25% of the prior year’s statutory capital and surplus, unless at least two members of the companies’ respective board of directors and its principal representative in Bermuda sign and submit to the BMA an affidavit attesting that a dividend in excess of this amount would not cause the subsidiary to fail to meet its relevant margins. In certain instances, the Bermuda subsidiary would also be required to provide prior notice to the BMA in advance of the payment of dividends. In the event that such an affidavit is submitted to the BMA, and further subject to meeting the MMS and ECR requirements, a Bermuda subsidiary is permitted to distribute up to the sum of 100% of statutory surplus and an amount less than 15% of statutory capital. Distributions in excess of this amount require the approval of the BMA. \nThe following represents the maximum distribution Athene’s Bermuda subsidiaries would be permitted to remit to its parent without the need for prior approval:\nDecember 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\nALRe\n$\n10,112\n \n$\n7,023\n \nAARe\n10,207\n \n8,012\n \nACRA 1A\n1,044\n \n1,614\n \nACRA 2A\n877\n \n30\n \nU.S. Statutory Requirements\nAthene’s primary regulated U.S. subsidiaries and the corresponding insurance regulatory authorities are as follows:\nSubsidiary\nRegulatory Authority\nAAIA\nIowa Insurance Division \nAANY\nNew York Department of Financial Services\nAthene Re USA IV\nState of Vermont Department of Financial Regulation\nOn October 11, 2024, Athene Annuity & Life Assurance Company (“AADE”) merged with and into AAIA, with AAIA as the surviving entity following the receipt of all required regulatory approvals. Prior year amounts relating to AAIA below have been restated to reflect the effect of the merger.\nEach entity’s statutory statements are presented on the basis of accounting practices determined by the respective regulatory authority. The regulatory authority recognizes only statutory accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the corresponding state for determining and reporting the financial condition and results of operations of an insurance company and for determining its solvency under insurance law.\nThe maximum dividend these subsidiaries can pay to stockholders, without prior approval of the respective state insurance department, is subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus or net gain from operations. The maximum dividend payment over a twelve-month period may not, without prior approval, be paid from a source other than earned surplus and may not exceed the greater of (1) the prior year’s net gain from operations or (2) 10% of prior year’s policyholders’ surplus. Based on these restrictions, the maximum dividend AAIA, and its predecessor by merger AADE, could pay to its parent absent regulatory approval was $\n0\n million as of each of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Any dividends from AHL’s other U.S. statutory entities in excess of the amounts allowed for AAIA would not be able to be remitted to its parent without regulatory approval from the Iowa Insurance Division. \nAs of December 31, 2024, Athene’s U.S. subsidiaries’ solvency, liquidity and risk-based capital amounts were significantly in excess of the minimum levels required.\n246\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn some instances, the states of domicile of U.S. subsidiaries have adopted prescribed accounting practices that differ from the required accounting outlined in NAIC Statutory Accounting Principles (“SAP”). These subsidiaries also have certain accounting practices permitted by the states of domicile that differ from those found in NAIC SAP. These prescribed and permitted practices are described as follows: \nAAIA\nAmong the products issued by AAIA are indexed universal life insurance and fixed indexed annuities. These products allow a portion of the premium to earn interest based on certain indices, including the S&P 500 and other bespoke indices. Athene purchases call options, futures and variance swaps to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related index. The Iowa Insurance Division allows an insurer to elect (1) to use an amortized cost method to account for certain derivative instruments, such as call options, purchased to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer on indexed insurance products and (2) to use an indexed annuity reserve calculation methodology under which call options associated with the current index interest crediting term are valued at zero. AAIA has elected to apply this option to its over-the-counter call options and reserve liabilities. As a result, AAIA’s statutory surplus increased by $\n38\n million and decreased by $\n2\n million as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. \nAthene Re USA IV\nAAIA has ceded the AmerUs Closed Block to Athene Re USA IV on a 100% funds withheld basis. A permitted practice in the State of Vermont allows Athene Re USA IV to include as admitted assets the face amount of all issued and outstanding letters of credit used to fund its reinsurance obligations to AAIA in its statutory financial statements. If Athene Re USA IV had not followed this permitted practice, then it would not have exceeded authorized control level risk-based capital requirements. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Athene Re USA IV included as admitted assets $\n86\n million and $\n96\n million, respectively, related to the outstanding letters of credit. \nStatutory capital and surplus and net income (loss)\nThe following table presents, for each of Athene’s primary insurance subsidiaries, the statutory capital and surplus and the statutory net income (loss), based on the most recent statutory financial statements to be filed with insurance regulators:\nStatutory capital & surplus\nStatutory net income (loss)\nDecember 31,\nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nALRe\n$\n17,623\n \n$\n14,474\n \n$\n3,140\n \n$\n832\n \n$\n937\n \nAARe\n21,049\n \n17,773\n \n2,910\n \n408\n \n1,329\n \nACRA 1A\n4,521\n \n5,092\n \n841\n \n297\n \n(\n87\n)\nACRA 2A\n4,569\n \n1,952\n \n877\n \n(\n759\n)\n(\n2\n)\nAAIA\n3,899\n \n3,306\n \n949\n \n(\n79\n)\n(\n486\n)\nAANY\n318\n \n290\n \n25\n \n(\n3\n)\n(\n23\n)\n21. Segments\nThe Company conducts its business through \nthree\n reportable segments: (i) Asset Management, (ii) Retirement Services and (iii) Principal Investing. Segment information is utilized by the Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to assess performance and to allocate resources. AGM’s CEO is the CODM, who is also solely responsible for decisions related to the allocation of resources on a company-wide basis.\nFor each segment, the CODM uses the key measure of Segment Income to allocate resources (including employees, financial or capital resources) to that segment in the annual budget and forecasting process. The performance is measured by the Company’s chief operating decision maker on an unconsolidated basis because the chief operating decision maker makes operating decisions and assesses the performance of each of the Company’s business segments based on financial and operating metrics and data that exclude the effects of consolidation of any of the affiliated funds.\n247\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSegment Income\nSegment Income is the key performance measure used by management in evaluating the performance of the asset management, retirement services, and principal investing segments. Management uses Segment Income to make key operating decisions such as the following:\n•\ndecisions related to the allocation of resources such as staffing decisions, including hiring and locations for deployment of the new hires;\n•\ndecisions related to capital deployment such as providing capital to facilitate growth for the business and/or to facilitate expansion into new businesses;\n•\ndecisions related to expenses, such as determining annual discretionary bonuses and equity-based compensation awards to its employees. With respect to compensation, management seeks to align the interests of certain professionals and selected other individuals with those of the investors in the funds and those of Apollo’s stockholders by providing such individuals a profit sharing interest in the performance fees earned in relation to the funds. To achieve that objective, a certain amount of compensation is based on Apollo’s performance and growth for the year; and\n•\ndecisions related to the amount of earnings available for dividends to common stockholders and holders of equity-based awards that participate in dividends.\nSegment Income is a measure of profitability and has certain limitations in that it does not take into account certain items included under U.S. GAAP. Segment Income is the sum of (i) Fee Related Earnings, (ii) Spread Related Earnings and (iii) Principal Investing Income. Segment Income excludes the effects of the consolidation of any of the related funds and SPACs, interest and other financing costs related to AGM not attributable to any specific segment, taxes and related payables, transaction-related charges and any acquisitions. Transaction-related charges includes equity-based compensation charges, the amortization of intangible assets, contingent consideration, and certain other charges associated with acquisitions, and restructuring charges. In addition, Segment Income excludes non-cash revenue and expense related to equity awards granted by unconsolidated related parties to employees of the Company, compensation and administrative related expense reimbursements, as well as the assets, liabilities and operating results of the funds and VIEs that are included in the consolidated financial statements.\nSegment Income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use Segment Income as a measure of operating performance, not as a measure of liquidity. Segment Income should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income or other income data prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The use of Segment Income without consideration of related U.S. GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described above. Management compensates for these limitations by using Segment Income as a supplemental measure to U.S. GAAP results, to provide a more complete understanding of our performance as management measures it. A reconciliation of Segment Income to its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure of income (loss) before income tax provision can be found in this footnote.\nFee Related Earnings\nFee Related Earnings (“FRE”) is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Asset Management segment. FRE is the sum of (i) management fees, (ii) capital solutions and other related fees, (iii) fee-related performance fees from indefinite term vehicles, that are measured and received on a recurring basis and not dependent on realization events of the underlying investments, excluding performance fees from Athene and performance fees from origination platforms dependent on capital appreciation, and (iv) other income, net, less (a) fee-related compensation, excluding equity-based compensation, (b) non-compensation expenses incurred in the normal course of business, (c) placement fees and (d) non-controlling interests in the management companies of certain funds the Company manages.\nSpread Related Earnings\nSpread Related Earnings (“SRE”) is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Retirement Services segment, excluding certain market volatility, which consists of investment gains (losses), net of offsets, and non-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives, and certain expenses related to integration, restructuring, equity-based compensation, and other expenses. For the Retirement Services segment, SRE equals the sum of (i) the net \n248\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ninvestment earnings on Athene’s net invested assets and (ii) management fees received on business managed for others, less (x) cost of funds, (y) operating expenses excluding equity-based compensation and (z) financing costs, including interest expense and preferred dividends, if any, paid to Athene preferred stockholders. \nPrincipal Investing Income\nPrincipal Investing Income (“PII”) is a component of Segment Income that is used to assess the performance of the Principal Investing segment. For the Principal Investing segment, PII is the sum of (i) realized performance fees, including certain realizations received in the form of equity, and (ii) realized investment income, less (x) realized principal investing compensation expense, excluding expense related to equity-based compensation, and (y) certain corporate compensation and non-compensation expenses.\nThe following presents financial data for the Company’s reportable segments.\nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAsset Management\nManagement fees\n1\n$\n2,776\n \n$\n2,480\n \n$\n2,134\n \nCapital solutions fees and other, net\n668\n \n538\n \n414\n \nFee-related performance fee\n208\n \n146\n \n72\n \nFee-related compensation \n(\n925\n)\n(\n835\n)\n(\n754\n)\nOther operating expenses\n(\n664\n)\n(\n561\n)\n(\n456\n)\nFee Related Earnings\n2,063\n \n1,768\n \n1,410\n \nRetirement Services\nFixed income and other net investment income\n10,805\n \n8,739\n \n5,706\n \nAlternative net investment income\n939\n \n864\n \n1,206\n \nStrategic capital management fees\n105\n \n72\n \n53\n \nCost of funds\n(\n7,702\n)\n(\n5,650\n)\n(\n3,755\n)\nOther operating expenses\n(\n458\n)\n(\n481\n)\n(\n462\n)\nInterest and other financing costs\n(\n465\n)\n(\n436\n)\n(\n279\n)\nSpread Related Earnings \n3,224\n \n3,108\n \n2,469\n \nPrincipal Investing\nRealized performance fees\n2\n921\n \n742\n \n595\n \nRealized investment income\n74\n \n(\n2\n)\n330\n \nPrincipal investing compensation\n(\n664\n)\n(\n601\n)\n(\n585\n)\nOther operating expenses\n(\n60\n)\n(\n56\n)\n(\n56\n)\nPrincipal Investing Income \n271\n \n83\n \n284\n \nSegment Income\n$\n5,558\n \n$\n4,959\n \n$\n4,163\n \nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSegment Revenue\nAsset Management\n1\n$\n3,652\n \n$\n3,164\n \n$\n2,620\n \nRetirement Services\n11,849\n \n9,675\n \n6,965\n \nPrincipal Investing\n2\n995\n \n740\n \n925\n \nTotal Segment Revenue\n$\n16,496\n \n$\n13,579\n \n$\n10,510\n \n249\nTable of Contents\nAPOLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSegment Assets\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAsset Management\n$\n2,286\n \n$\n1,938\n \nRetirement Services\n355,683\n \n294,730\n \nPrincipal Investing\n10,473\n \n9,573\n \nTotal Assets\n$\n368,442\n \n$\n306,241\n \n1\n Includes intersegment management fees from Retirement Services of $\n1,223\n million, $\n955\n million and $\n764\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n2 \nIncludes intersegment realized performance fees from Retirement Services of $\n30\n million and $\n20\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe following presents the reconciliation of Segment Income and Segment Revenue to income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit and total revenues reported in the consolidated statements of operations:\nYears ended December 31,\n(In millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSegment Income\n$\n5,558\n \n$\n4,959\n \n$\n4,163\n \nAsset Management Adjustments:\nEquity-based profit sharing expense and other\n1,6\n(\n321\n)\n(\n239\n)\n(\n276\n)\nEquity-based compensation\n(\n308\n)\n(\n236\n)\n(\n185\n)\nSpecial equity-based compensation and other charges\n—\n \n(\n438\n)\n—\n \nTransaction-related charges\n2\n(\n180\n)\n(\n32\n)\n42\n \nMerger-related transaction and integration costs\n3\n(\n30\n)\n(\n27\n)\n(\n70\n)\nGains (losses) from change in tax receivable agreement liability\n42\n \n(\n13\n)\n(\n26\n)\nNet income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated entities\n1,840\n \n1,556\n \n(\n1,499\n)\nUnrealized performance fees\n6\n264\n \n127\n \n2\n \nUnrealized profit sharing expense\n6\n(\n145\n)\n(\n179\n)\n(\n20\n)\nHoldCo interest and other financing costs\n4\n(\n80\n)\n(\n88\n)\n(\n122\n)\nUnrealized principal investment (income) loss\n6\n(\n9\n)\n88\n \n(\n176\n)\nUnrealized net gains (losses) from investment activities and other\n6\n30\n \n(\n26\n)\n144\n \nRetirement Services Adjustments:\nInvestment gains (losses), net of offsets\n217\n \n170\n \n(\n7,467\n)\nNon-operating change in insurance liabilities and related derivatives\n5\n846\n \n182\n \n1,433\n \nIntegration, restructuring and other non-operating expenses\n(\n239\n)\n(\n130\n)\n(\n133\n)\nEquity-based compensation\n(\n50\n)\n(\n88\n)\n(\n56\n)\nIncome (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit\n$\n7,435\n \n$\n5,586\n \n$\n(\n4,246\n)\n1 \nEquity-based profit sharing expense and other includes certain profit sharing arrangements in which a portion of performance fees distributed to the general partner are required to be used by employees of Apollo to purchase restricted shares of common stock or is delivered in the form of RSUs, which are granted under the Equity Plan.

ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES\nNone.\nITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nWe maintain “disclosure controls and procedures”, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are effective at the reasonable assurance level to accomplish their objectives of ensuring that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\nNo changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during our most recent quarter, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of Apollo is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Apollo’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of its principal executive and principal financial officers to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nApollo’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets, provide reasonable assurances that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors, and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Apollo’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of Apollo’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the framework established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that Apollo’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 was effective.\n257\nTable of Contents\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited Apollo’s financial statements included in this report and issued its report on the effectiveness of Apollo’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which is included herein.\nITEM 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, no director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of AGM \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9C.    DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\n258\nTable of Contents\nPART III\nItem 10.
