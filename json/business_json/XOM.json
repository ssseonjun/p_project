Net debt to capital ratio is net debt divided by net debt plus total equity. Total debt is the sum of notes and loans payable and long-term debt, as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(3) \nRegular employees are defined as active executive, management, professional, technical, administrative, and wage employees who work full time or part time for the Corporation and are covered by the Corporation’s benefit plans and programs.\n \n33\nFREQUENTLY USED TERMS\nListed below are definitions of several of ExxonMobil’s key business and financial performance measures. These definitions are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms and their calculations.\nCash Flow from Operations and Asset Sales \n(Non-GAAP)\nCash flow from operations and asset sales is the sum of the net cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from asset sales and returns of investments from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. This cash flow reflects the total sources of cash both from operating the Corporation’s assets and from the divesting of assets. The Corporation employs a long-standing and regular disciplined review process to ensure that assets are contributing to the Corporation’s strategic objectives. Assets are divested when they are no longer meeting these objectives or are worth considerably more to others. Because of the regular nature of this activity, we believe it is useful for investors to consider proceeds associated with asset sales together with cash provided by operating activities when evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing activities, including shareholder distributions.\nCash Flow from Operations and Asset Sales\n(millions of dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n55,022 \n55,369 \n76,797 \nProceeds associated with sales of subsidiaries, property, plant and equipment, and sales and returns of investments\n4,987 \n4,078 \n5,247 \nCash flow from operations and asset sales\n \n(Non-GAAP)\n60,009\n \n59,447\n \n82,044\n \n \nCapital Employed \n(Non-GAAP)\nCapital employed is a measure of net investment. When viewed from the perspective of how the capital is used by the businesses, it includes ExxonMobil’s net share of property, plant and equipment and other assets less liabilities, excluding both short-term and long-term debt. When viewed from the perspective of the sources of capital employed in total for the Corporation, it includes ExxonMobil’s share of total debt and equity. Both of these views include ExxonMobil’s share of amounts applicable to equity companies, which the Corporation believes should be included to provide a more comprehensive measure of capital employed.\nCapital Employed\n(millions of dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBusiness uses: asset and liability perspective\n \n \n \nTotal assets\n453,475 \n376,317 \n369,067 \nLess liabilities and noncontrolling interests share of assets and liabilities\nTotal current liabilities excluding notes and loans payable\n(65,352)\n(61,226)\n(68,411)\nTotal long-term liabilities excluding long-term debt\n(75,807)\n(60,980)\n(56,990)\nNoncontrolling interests share of assets and liabilities\n(8,069)\n(8,878)\n(9,205)\nAdd ExxonMobil share of debt-financed equity company net assets\n3,242 \n3,481 \n3,705 \nTotal capital employed\n (Non-GAAP)\n307,489\n \n248,714\n \n238,166\n \nTotal corporate sources: debt and equity perspective\nNotes and loans payable\n4,955 \n4,090 \n634 \nLong-term debt\n36,755 \n37,483 \n40,559 \nExxonMobil share of equity\n263,705 \n204,802 \n195,049 \nLess noncontrolling interests share of total debt\n(1,168)\n(1,142)\n(1,781)\nAdd ExxonMobil share of equity company debt\n3,242 \n3,481 \n3,705 \nTotal capital employed \n(Non-GAAP)\n307,489\n \n248,714\n \n238,166\n \n34\nFREQUENTLY USED TERMS\nReturn on Average Capital Employed \n(Non-GAAP)\nReturn on average capital employed (ROCE) is a performance measure ratio. From the perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and end-of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil’s share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation’s total ROCE is net income attributable to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as one of the best measures of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry. Additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make investment decisions.\nReturn on Average Capital Employed\n(millions of dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income (loss) attributable to ExxonMobil\n33,680 \n36,010 \n55,740 \nFinancing costs (after-tax)\nGross third-party debt\n(1,106)\n(1,175)\n(1,213)\nExxonMobil share of equity companies\n(196)\n(307)\n(198)\nAll other financing costs – net\n(252)\n931 \n276 \nTotal financing costs\n(1,554)\n(551)\n(1,135)\nEarnings (loss) excluding financing costs\n (Non-GAAP)\n35,234\n \n36,561\n \n56,875\n \nAverage capital employed (Non-GAAP)\n278,102 \n243,440 \n228,404 \nReturn on average capital employed – corporate total \n(Non-GAAP)\n12.7%\n15.0%\n24.9%\nSelected Earnings Driver Definitions\nThe updated earnings drivers introduced in the first quarter of 2024 provide additional visibility into our business results. The Company evaluates these drivers periodically to determine if any enhancements may provide helpful insights to the market. Listed below are descriptions of the earnings drivers:\nAdvantaged Volume Growth.\n Represents earnings impacts from change in volume/mix from advantaged assets, advantaged projects, and high-value products. \n•\nAdvantaged Assets (Advantaged growth projects)\n. Includes Permian (heritage Permian \n(1)\n and Pioneer), Guyana and LNG.\n•\nAdvantaged Projects.\n Includes capital projects and programs of work that contribute to Energy, Chemical, and/or Specialty Products segments that drive integration of segments/businesses, increase yield of higher value products, or deliver higher than average returns. \n•\nHigh-Value Products.\n Includes performance products and lower-emission fuels. Performance products (performance chemicals, performance lubricants) refers to products that provide differentiated performance for multiple applications through enhanced properties versus commodity alternatives and bring significant additional value to customers and end-users. \nLower-emission fuels refers to fuels with lower life cycle emissions than conventional transportation fuels for gasoline, diesel and jet transport.\nBase Volume. \nRepresents all volume/mix drivers not included in Advantaged Volume Growth defined above.\nStructural Cost Savings. \nRepresents after-tax earnings effects of Structural Cost Savings as defined on the next page, including cash operating expenses related to divestments that were previously in the volume/mix driver.\nExpenses.\n Represents all expenses otherwise not included in other earnings drivers.\nTiming Effects.\n Represents timing effects that are primarily related to unsettled derivatives (mark-to-market) and other earnings impacts driven by timing differences between the settlement of derivatives and their offsetting physical commodity realizations (due to LIFO inventory accounting).\n(1)\n \nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.\n35\nFREQUENTLY USED TERMS\nStructural Cost Savings \n(Non-GAAP)\nStructural cost savings describes decreases in cash opex excluding energy and production taxes as a result of operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment-related reductions, and other cost-savings measures that are expected to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Relative to 2019, estimated cumulative structural cost savings totaled $12.1 billion. The total change between periods in expenses below will reflect both structural cost savings and other changes in spend, including market factors, such as inflation and foreign exchange impacts, as well as changes in activity levels and costs associated with new operations, mergers and acquisitions, new business venture development, and early-stage projects. Estimates of cumulative annual structural cost savings may be revised depending on whether cost reductions realized in prior periods are determined to be sustainable compared to 2019 levels. Structural cost savings are stewarded internally to support management’s oversight of spending over time. This measure is useful for investors to understand the Corporation’s efforts to optimize spending through disciplined expense management.\nCalculation of Structural Cost Savings\n(billions of dollars) \n2019\n2024\nComponents of Operating Costs\nFrom ExxonMobil’s Consolidated Statement of Income\n(U.S. GAAP)\nProduction and manufacturing expenses\n36.8 \n39.6 \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n11.4 \n10.0 \nDepreciation and depletion (includes impairments)\n19.0 \n23.4 \nExploration expenses, including dry holes\n1.3 \n0.8 \nNon-service pension and postretirement benefit expense\n1.2 \n0.1 \nSubtotal\n69.7\n \n74.0\n \nExxonMobil's share of equity company expenses (Non-GAAP)\n9.1 \n9.6 \nTotal Adjusted Operating Costs\n (Non-GAAP)\n78.8\n \n83.6\n \nTotal Adjusted Operating Costs\n (Non-GAAP)\n78.8\n \n83.6\n \nLess:\nDepreciation and depletion (includes impairments)\n19.0 \n23.4 \nNon-service pension and postretirement benefit expense\n1.2 \n0.1 \nOther adjustments (includes equity company depreciation \nand depletion)\n3.6 \n3.7 \nTotal Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex)\n (Non-GAAP)\n55.0\n \n56.4\n \nEnergy and production taxes (Non-GAAP)\n11.0 \n13.9 \nMarket\nActivity /\nOther\nStructural\n Savings\nTotal Cash Operating Expenses (Cash Opex) excluding Energy and Production Taxes\n (Non-GAAP)\n44.0\n \n+4.0\n+6.6\n-12.1\n42.5\n \nDue to rounding, numbers presented may not add up precisely to the totals indicated.\n36\nFREQUENTLY USED TERMS\nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items \n(Non-GAAP)\nEarnings (loss) excluding Identified Items are earnings (loss) excluding individually significant non-operational events with, typically, an absolute corporate total earnings impact of at least $250 million in a given quarter. The earnings (loss) impact of an Identified Item for an individual segment in a given quarter may be less than $250 million when the item impacts several segments or several periods. Management uses these figures to improve comparability of the underlying business across multiple periods by isolating and removing significant non-operational events from business results. The Corporation believes this view provides investors increased transparency into business results and trends, and provides investors with a view of the business as seen through the eyes of management.

Similarly, discussion of roadmaps or future plans related to carbon capture, transportation and storage, lower-emission fuels, hydrogen, ammonia, direct air capture, Proxxima\nTM\n systems, carbon materials, lithium and other future plans to reduce emissions and emission intensity of ExxonMobil, its affiliates, and third parties are dependent on future market factors, such as continued technological progress, stable policy support and timely rule-making and permitting, and represent forward-looking statements. \nActual future results, including financial and operating performance; earnings power; potential earnings, cash flow, dividends or shareholder returns, including the timing and amounts of share repurchases; total capital expenditures and mix, including allocations of capital to low carbon and other new investments; realization and maintenance of structural cost reductions and efficiency gains, including the ability to offset inflationary pressure; plans to reduce future emissions and emissions intensity, including ambitions to reach Scope 1 and Scope 2 net zero from operated assets by 2050, to reach Scope 1 and 2 net zero in heritage Permian Basin\n \n(1)\n \nunconventional operated assets by 2030, and in Pioneer Permian assets by 2035, to eliminate routine flaring in-line with World Bank Zero Routine Flaring, and to reach near-zero methane emissions from operated assets and other methane initiatives to meet ExxonMobil’s emission reduction plans and goals, divestment and start-up plans, and associated project plans as well as technology advances, including the timing and outcome of projects to capture, transport and store CO2, produce hydrogen and ammonia, produce lower-emission fuels, produce Proxxima\nTM\n systems, produce carbon materials, produce lithium, and use plastic waste as feedstock for advanced recycling; timely granting of governmental permits and certifications; future debt levels and credit ratings; business and project plans, timing, costs, capacities and profitability; resource recoveries and production rates; and planned Denbury Inc. (Denbury) and Pioneer integrated benefits, could differ materially due to a number of factors. \nThese include global or regional changes in the supply and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market factors; economic conditions and seasonal fluctuations that impact prices and differentials for our products; developments or changes in local, national, or international laws, regulations, taxes, trade sanctions, trade tariffs, or policies affecting our business, such as government policies supporting lower carbon and new market investment opportunities, the punitive European taxes on the oil and gas sector and unequal support for different technological methods of emissions reduction or evolving, ambiguous and unharmonized standards imposed by various jurisdictions related to sustainability and GHG reporting; variable impacts of trading activities on our margins and results each quarter; actions of co-venturers, competitors and commercial counterparties; the outcome of commercial negotiations, including final agreed terms and conditions; the outcome of competitive bidding and project awards; the ability to access \ndebt markets on favorable terms or at all; the occurrence, pace, rate of recovery and effects of public health crises; adoption of regulatory incentives consistent with law; reservoir performance, including variability and timing factors applicable to unconventional resources and the success of new unconventional technologie\ns; the level, outcome, and timing of exploration and development projects and decisions to invest in future reserves and resources; timely completion of construction projects; final management approval of future projects and any changes in the scope, terms, costs or assumptions of such projects as approved; the actions of government or other actors against our core business activities and acquisitions, divestitures or financing opportunities; war, civil unrest, attacks against the Company or industry, and other geopolitical or security disturbances, including disruption of land or sea transportation routes; decoupling of economies, and disruptions in trade alliances and military alliances; expropriations, seizure, or capacity, insurance, shipping, import or export limitations imposed by governments or laws; opportunities for potential acquisitions, investments or divestments and satisfaction of applicable conditions to closing, including timely regulatory approvals; the capture of efficiencies within and between business lines and the ability to maintain near-term cost reductions as ongoing efficiencies without impairing our competitive positioning; unforeseen technical or operating difficulties and unplanned maintenance; the development and competitiveness of alternative energy and emission reduction technologies; consumer preferences including willingness and ability to pay for reduced emission products; the results of research programs and the ability to bring new technologies to commercial scale on a cost-competitive basis; and other factors discussed under",
    "item1a": "Item 1A\n for a more complete discussion of risks.\nThe Corporation’s financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures. Cash Capex in 2024 was $25.6 billion, reflecting the Corporation’s continued active investment program, and includes plans to invest in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion in 2025 (see the \nCash Capital Expenditures\n section for more details).\nActual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions. The Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development projects and exploration opportunities, which helps mitigate the overall political and technical risks of the Corporation’s Upstream segment and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation’s liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fixed commitments.\n61\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Corporation, as part of its ongoing asset management program, continues to evaluate its mix of assets for potential upgrade. Because of the ongoing nature of this program, dispositions will continue to be made from time to time which will result in either gains or losses. Additionally, the Corporation continues to evaluate opportunities to enhance its business portfolio through acquisitions of assets or companies, and enters into such transactions from time to time. Key criteria for evaluating acquisitions include strategic fit, cost and other synergies, potential for future growth, low cost of supply, and attractive valuations. Acquisitions may be made with cash, shares of the Corporation’s common stock, or both.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\n2024\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $55.0 billion in 2024, $0.3 billion lower than 2023. The major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $35.1 billion, a decrease of $2.3 billion. The noncash provision for depreciation and depletion was $23.4 billion, up $2.8 billion from the prior year. The adjustment for the net gain on asset sales was $1.2 billion, an increase of $0.7 billion. The adjustment for dividends received less than equity in current earnings of equity companies was an increase of $0.2 billion, compared to an increase of $0.5 billion in 2023. Changes in operational working capital, excluding cash and debt, decreased cash in 2024 by $1.8 billion.\n2023\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $55.4 billion in 2023, $21.4 billion lower than 2022. The major source of funds was net income including noncontrolling interests of $37.4 billion, a decrease of $20.2 billion. The noncash provision for depreciation and depletion was $20.6 billion, down $3.4 billion from the prior year. The adjustment for the net gain on asset sales was $0.5 billion, a decrease of $0.5 billion. The adjustment for dividends received less than equity in current earnings of equity companies was an increase of $0.5 billion, compared to a reduction of $2.4 billion in 2022. Changes in operational working capital, excluding cash and debt, decreased cash in 2023 by $4.3 billion.\n \nCash Flow from Investing Activities\n2024\nCash used in investing activities netted to $19.9 billion in 2024, $0.7 billion higher than 2023. Spending for property, plant and equipment of $24.3 billion increased $2.4 billion from 2023. Proceeds from asset sales and returns of investments of $5.0 billion compared to $4.1 billion in 2023. Additional investments and advances were $0.3 billion higher in 2024, while proceeds from other investing activities including collection of advances increased by $0.4 billion. \n2023\nCash used in investing activities netted to $19.3 billion in 2023, $4.5 billion higher than 2022. Spending for property, plant and equipment of $21.9 billion increased $3.5 billion from 2022. Proceeds from asset sales and returns of investments of $4.1 billion compared to $5.2 billion in 2022. Additional investments and advances were $0.1 billion lower in 2023, while proceeds from other investing activities including collection of advances increased by $0.1 billion. \n62\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\n2024\nCash used in financing activities was $42.8 billion in 2024, $8.5 billion higher than 2023. Dividend payments on common shares increased to $3.84 per share from $3.68 per share and totaled $16.7 billion.\n During 2024, the Corporation utilized cash to repay debt of $5.9 billion.\nDuring 2024, the Corporation continued its share repurchase program, including the purchase of 167 million shares at a book value of $19.1 billion in 2024. \nIn its 2024 Corporate Plan Update released December 11, 2024, the Corporation stated that it is expected to continue its share repurchase program with a $20 billion repurchase pace per year through 2026, assuming reasonable market conditions. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be discontinued or resumed at any time. The timing and amount of shares actually purchased in the future will depend on market, business, and other factors.\n2023\nCash used in financing activities was $34.3 billion in 2023, $4.8 billion lower than 2022. Dividend payments on common shares increased to $3.68 per share from $3.55 per share and totaled $14.9 billion. \nDuring 2023, the Corporation continued its share repurchase program for up to $50 billion in shares through 2024, including the purchase of 162 million shares at a book value of $17.5 billion in 2023.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Corporation has contractual obligations involving commitments to third parties that impact its liquidity and capital resource needs. These contractual obligations are primarily for leases, debt, asset retirement obligations, pension and other postretirement benefits, take-or-pay and unconditional purchase obligations, and firm capital commitments. See Notes \n9\n, \n11\n, \n14\n and \n17\n for information related to asset retirement obligations, leases, long-term debt and pensions, respectively.\nIn addition, the Corporation also enters into commodity purchase obligations (volumetric commitments but no fixed or minimum price) which are resold shortly after purchase, either in an active, highly liquid market or under long-term, unconditional sales contracts with similar pricing terms. Examples include long-term, noncancelable LNG and natural gas purchase commitments and commitments to purchase refinery products at market prices. These commitments are not meaningful in assessing liquidity and cash flow, because the purchases will be offset in the same periods by cash received from the related sales transactions.\nTake-or-pay obligations are noncancelable, long-term commitments for goods and services. Unconditional purchase obligations are those long-term commitments that are noncancelable or cancelable only under certain conditions, and that third parties have used to secure financing for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or services. These obligations mainly pertain to pipeline, manufacturing supply and terminal agreements. The total obligation at year-end 2024 for take-or-pay and unconditional purchase obligations was $49.9 billion. Cash payments expected in 2025 and 2026 are $5.5 billion and $6.3 billion, respectively.\nGuarantees\nThe Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries were contingently liable at December 31, 2024 for guarantees relating to notes, loans and performance under contracts (\nNote 16\n). Where guarantees for environmental remediation and other similar matters do not include a stated cap, the amounts reflect management’s estimate of the maximum potential exposure. Where it is not possible to make a reasonable estimation of the maximum potential amount of future payments, future performance is expected to be either immaterial or have only a remote chance of occurrence. Guarantees are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on the Corporation’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\n63\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFinancial Strength\nOn December 31, 2024, the Corporation had total unused short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion (\nNote 6\n) and total unused long-term committed lines of credit of $1.3 billion (\nNote 14\n). The table below shows the Corporation’s consolidated debt to capital ratios.\n (percent)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDebt to capital\n13.4\n16.4\n16.9\nNet debt to capital \n(1)\n6.5\n4.5\n5.4\n(1)\n Net debt is total debt less cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash. Net debt to capital ratio is net debt divided by net debt plus total equity. Total debt is the sum of notes and loans payable and long-term debt, as reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nManagement views the Corporation’s financial strength to be a competitive advantage of strategic importance. The Corporation’s financial position gives it the opportunity to access the world’s capital markets across a range of market conditions, and enables the Corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value.\nThe Corporation's total debt level remained relatively flat in 2024, ending the year at $41.7 billion.\nLitigation and Other Contingencies\nAs discussed in \nNote 16\n, a variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation’s operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. There are no events or uncertainties beyond those already included in reported financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating results or financial condition. Refer to \nNote 16\n for additional information on legal proceedings and other contingencies.\nCAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES\nCapital and exploration expenditures (Capex) represents the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant and equipment, and exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the Consolidated Statement of Income. ExxonMobil’s Capex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges, the value of ExxonMobil shares used to acquire assets, and depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment when acquired. While ExxonMobil’s management is responsible for all investments and elements of net income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.\n(millions of dollars)\n2024\n2023\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nTotal\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nTotal\nUpstream (including exploration expenses)\n11,252 \n10,596 \n21,848 \n8,813 \n10,948 \n19,761 \nEnergy Products\n756 \n1,610 \n2,366 \n1,195 \n1,580 \n2,775 \nChemical Products\n739 \n1,332 \n2,071 \n751 \n1,962 \n2,713 \nSpecialty Products\n145 \n270 \n415 \n63 \n391 \n454 \nOther\n851 \n— \n851 \n622 \n— \n622 \nTotal Capex\n13,743\n \n13,808\n \n27,551\n \n11,444\n \n14,881\n \n26,325\n \nCapex in 2024 was $27.6 billion, as the Corporation continued to pursue opportunities to find and produce new supplies of oil and natural gas to meet global demand for energy. \nUpstream spending of $21.8 billion in 2024 was up $2.1 billion from 2023,\n \nreflecting higher spend in the U.S. Permian Basin following the Pioneer acquisition. Development projects typically take several years from the time of recording proved undeveloped reserves to the start of production and can exceed five years for large and complex projects. The percentage of proved developed reserves was 63 percent of total proved reserves at year-end 2024, and has been over 60 percent for the last ten years.\nCapital investments in the three Product Solutions businesses totaled $4.9 billion in 2024, a decrease of $1.1 billion from 2023, reflecting lower global project spending. Key investments in 2024 included the China petrochemical complex and Singapore Resid Upgrade project. Other spend of $0.9 billion primarily reflects investments in the Low Carbon Solutions business to advance carbon capture and storage, lithium, and virtually carbon-free hydrogen (with approximately 98% of the carbon captured and stored) projects and technologies.\n64\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCASH CAPITAL EXPENDITURES \n(Non-GAAP)\nThe Corporation has transitioned to providing forward investment guidance on a cash capital expenditures (Cash Capex) basis instead of the historical capital and exploration expense (Capex) basis. This approach is a useful measure for investors to understand the cash impact of investments in the business and is more aligned with standard industry practice.\nCash Capex is the sum of Additions to property, plant and equipment; Additional investments and advances; and Other investing activities including collection of advances; reduced by Inflows from noncontrolling interests for major projects, each from the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \nThe components of Cash Capex and a reconciliation to the previous Capex metric are presented in the following table:\n(millions of dollars)\n2024\n2023\nCapital and Exploration Expenditures (Capex)\n27,551\n \n26,325\n \nExxonMobil’s share of Capex for equity companies \n(2,546)\n(2,741)\nExploration expenses excluding prior year dry holes\n(755)\n(567)\nOther activities including finance leases\n56 \n(1,098)\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment\n24,306\n \n21,919\n \nAdditional investments and advances\n3,299 \n2,995 \nOther investing activities including collection of advances\n(1,926)\n(1,562)\nInflows from noncontrolling interests for major projects\n(32)\n(124)\nTotal Cash Capex \n(Non-GAAP)\n25,647\n \n23,228\n \n(millions of dollars)\n2024\n2023\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nTotal\nU.S.\nNon-U.S.\nTotal\nUpstream\n11,276 \n8,985 \n20,261 \n8,783 \n8,122 \n16,905 \nEnergy Products\n705 \n1,513 \n2,218 \n1,284 \n1,547 \n2,831 \nChemical Products\n671 \n1,212 \n1,883 \n718 \n1,702 \n2,420 \nSpecialty Products\n145 \n263 \n408 \n63 \n391 \n454 \nOther\n877 \n— \n877 \n618 \n— \n618 \nTotal Cash Capex \n(Non-GAAP)\n13,674\n \n11,973\n \n25,647\n \n11,466\n \n11,762\n \n23,228\n \nCash Capex in 2024 was $25.6 billion.

This was flat compared to 2022, with higher effective rates from various jurisdictions offset by a lower impact from additional European taxes on the energy sector. Total other taxes and duties of $32.2 billion in 2023 increased $0.7 billion from 2022.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nEnvironmental Expenditures\n(millions of dollars)\n2024\n2023\nCapital expenditures\n3,607 \n2,799 \nOther expenditures\n5,348 \n4,336 \nTotal\n8,955\n \n7,135\n \nThroughout ExxonMobil’s businesses, new and ongoing measures are taken to prevent and minimize the impact of our operations on air, water, and ground. These include significant investments in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels; projects to monitor and reduce air, water, and waste emissions, both from the Company’s operations and from other companies; and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. Using definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil’s 2024 worldwide environmental expenditures for all such preventative and remediation steps, including ExxonMobil’s share of equity company expenditures, were $9.0 billion, of which $5.3 billion were included in expenses with the remainder in capital expenditures. As the Corporation progresses its emission-reduction plans, worldwide environmental expenditures are expected to increase to approximately $12 billion annually in 2025 and 2026, with capital expenditures expected to account for approximately 55 percent of the total in each year. \nEnvironmental Liabilities\nThe Corporation accrues environmental liabilities when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed. ExxonMobil has accrued liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has identified ExxonMobil as one of the potentially responsible parties. The involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could mitigate ExxonMobil’s actual joint and several liability exposure. At present, no individual site is expected to have losses material to ExxonMobil’s operations or financial condition. Consolidated company provisions made in 2024 for environmental liabilities were $277 million ($208 million in 2023), and the balance sheet reflects liabilities of $734 million as of December 31, 2024, and $701 million as of December 31, 2023. \n66\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nMARKET RISKS\nMarker \n(1)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBrent ($ per barrel)\n80.76 \n82.62 \n101.19 \nHenry Hub ($ per metric million British thermal unit)\n2.27 \n2.74 \n6.65 \nTTF ($ per metric million British thermal unit)\n10.77 \n15.15 \n40.22 \n(1)\n Markers reflect the average prices from the year.\nCrude oil, natural gas, petroleum product, and chemical prices have fluctuated in response to changing market forces. The impacts of these price fluctuations on earnings have varied across the Corporation's operating segments. For the year 2025, a $1 per barrel change in the Brent price would have an approximately $650 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. This Brent sensitivity includes oil-linked LNG sales which make up approximately 10 percent of the sensitivity. A $0.10 per million metric British thermal unit change in the Henry Hub price would have an approximately $75 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. Similarly, a $0.10 per million metric British thermal unit change in the Title Transfer Facility (TTF) price would have an approximately $20 million annual after-tax effect on Upstream consolidated plus equity company earnings, excluding the impact of derivatives. This TTF sensitivity primarily represents LNG sales. These price markers have a direct impact on our realized prices. For any given period, the extent of actual benefit or detriment will be dependent on the price movements of individual types of crude oil, results of trading activities, taxes and other government take impacts, price adjustment lags in long-term gas contracts, and crude and gas production volumes. Accordingly, changes in benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas only provide broad indicators of changes in the earnings experienced in any particular period.\nIn the very competitive petroleum and petrochemical environment, earnings are primarily determined by margin capture rather than absolute price levels of products sold. Refining margins are a function of the difference between what a refiner pays for its raw materials (primarily crude oil) and the market prices for the range of products produced. These prices in turn depend on global and regional supply/demand balances, inventory levels, refinery operations, import/export balances and weather.\nThe global energy markets can give rise to extended periods in which market conditions are adverse to one or more of the Corporation’s businesses. Such conditions, along with the capital-intensive nature of the industry and very long lead times associated with many of our projects, underscore the importance of maintaining a strong financial position. Management views the Corporation’s financial strength as a competitive advantage.\nIn general, segment results are not dependent on the ability to sell and/or purchase products to/from other segments. Instead, where such sales take place, they are the result of efficiencies and competitive advantages of integrated refinery and chemical complexes. Additionally, intersegment sales are at market-based prices. The products bought and sold between segments can also be acquired in worldwide markets that have substantial liquidity, capacity, and transportation capabilities. Refer to \nNote 18\n for additional information on intersegment revenue.\nAlthough price levels of crude oil and natural gas may rise or fall significantly over the short to medium term due to global economic conditions, political events, decisions by OPEC or OPEC+ and other major government resource owners and other factors, industry economics over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand. The Corporation evaluates investments over a range of prices, including estimated greenhouse gas emission costs even in jurisdictions without a current greenhouse gas pricing policy.\nThe Corporation has an active asset management program in which nonstrategic assets are considered for divestment. The asset management program includes a disciplined, regular review to ensure assets are contributing to the Corporation’s strategic objectives.\nRisk Management\nThe Corporation’s size, strong capital structure, geographic diversity, and the complementary nature of its business segments reduce the Corporation’s enterprise-wide risk from changes in commodity prices, currency rates, and interest rates. In addition, the Corporation uses commodity-based contracts, including derivatives, to manage commodity price risk and to generate returns from trading. The Corporation’s commodity derivatives are not accounted for under hedge accounting. At times, the Corporation also enters into currency and interest rate derivatives, none of which are material to the Corporation’s financial position as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, or results of operations for the years ended 2024, 2023, and 2022. Credit risk associated with the Corporation’s derivative position is mitigated by several factors, including the use of derivative clearing exchanges and the quality of and financial limits placed on derivative counterparties. No material market or credit risks to the Corporation’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity exist as a result of the derivatives described in \nNote 13\n. The Corporation maintains a system of controls that includes the authorization, reporting and monitoring of derivative activity.\n67\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Corporation is exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on its short-term debt and the portion of long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. The impact of a 100-basis-point change in interest rates affecting the Corporation’s debt would not be material to earnings or cash flow. The Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are generally expected to cover financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt as required. Commercial paper is used to balance short-term liquidity requirements. Some joint-venture partners are dependent on the credit markets, and their funding ability may impact the development pace of joint-venture projects.\nThe Corporation conducts business in many foreign currencies and is subject to exchange rate risk on cash flows related to sales, expenses, financing, and investment transactions. Fluctuations in exchange rates are often offsetting and the impacts on ExxonMobil’s geographically and functionally diverse operations are varied. The Corporation makes limited use of currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency values, and exposures related to the Corporation’s use of these contracts are not material.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe Corporation’s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals, and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission and other new business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, Proxxima\nTM\n systems, carbon materials, and lithium. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The Corporation’s accounting policies are summarized in \nNote 1\n.\nOil and Natural Gas Reserves\nThe estimation of proved oil and natural gas reserve volumes is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, and detailed analysis of reservoir and well performance, development and production costs, and other factors. The estimation of proved reserves is controlled by the Corporation through long-standing approval guidelines. Reserve changes are made within a well-established, disciplined process driven by senior level geoscience and engineering professionals, assisted by the Global Reserves and Resources Group which has significant technical experience, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management. Notably, the Corporation does not use specific quantitative reserve targets to determine compensation. Key features of the reserve estimation process are covered in Disclosure of Reserves in"
