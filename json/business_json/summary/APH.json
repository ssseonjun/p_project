  "item1_summary": " The Company’s business, operations, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and stock price can be negatively affected by many risk factors . The Company is exposed to political, economic, military and other risks related to operating in countries outside the United States . Changes in general economic conditions, geopolitical conditions, U.S. and other countries’ trade policies and other factors beyond the Company's control may adversely impact its business and operating results .\n There is significant uncertainty about the future of trade relationships around the world, including potential changes to trade laws and regulations, trade policies, and tariffs . We cannot predict what additional actions may ultimately be taken by the U.S. or other governments with respect to tariffs or trade relations . The imposition of additional tariffs or other trade barriers could increase our costs in certain markets .\n We cannot predict the impact to our business of any future changes to the U.S.’s or other countries’ trading relationships . Failure to comply with the terms of such programs could increase our manufacturing costs and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition . A global or regional economic slowdown or recession could negatively affect the financial condition of our customers and result in reduced demand .\n The Company may be negatively impacted by adverse public health developments, including epidemics and pandemics . The company also faces challenges in collecting accounts receivable, credit risks and other challenges . The Company also faces higher taxes, foreign currency fluctuations, significant income tax changes and inflationary pressures . The firm’s global manufacturing facilities around the world, as well as manufacturing facilities in the Middle East, are located in the U.S.\n The Company uses basic materials like aluminum, steel, copper, titanium, metal alloys, gold, silver, palladium and plastic resins in its manufacturing processes . The Company does not currently anticipate significant, broad-based difficulties in obtaining raw materials or components necessary for production . Inflationary pressures and increased commodity prices may impact the cost and availability of certain raw materials .\n We depend on a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be served by a limited number of suppliers . Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of factors affecting our suppliers, and any delay could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers . Cybersecurity incidents affecting our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential information .\n Cyberattacks continue to expand and evolve, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the Company . Globally, there continues to be an elevated volume of cyber threats, exploitation of previously unknown software vulnerabilities, ransomware attempts and social engineering attacks, such as phishing and impersonation . The proliferation of Internet of Things devices and Operational Technology systems has expanded the potential points of entry for an unauthorized user to access a system or network .\n Ransomware attacks have become easier to execute, and with the rise of ransomware as a service, it has become an increasingly popular business model to lease or sell ransomware variants to anyone willing to pay the fee . Future cybersecurity incidents could lead to unauthorized access to and potentially impair the Company’s information technology systems, products, customers, suppliers and third-party service providers .\n Cybersecurity incidents, ransomware attacks, security breaches, computer viruses, security vulnerabilities or “bugs” in software or hardware, outages, systems failures, natural disasters, adverse public health developments, or other catastrophic events . We cannot guarantee that any costs and liabilities incurred in relation to an attack or incident will be covered by our existing insurance policies .\n The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements . Privacy laws and regulations around the world including, for example, in the EU, People’s Republic of China, the state of California, and several other U.S. states, impose significant obligations for companies on how they collect, store, protect, process and transfer personal information . Extreme weather conditions and natural disasters have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, portions of our operations .\n Climate change may exacerbate certain such events and may also contribute to other changes that could also adversely impact our operations . These events could cause some of the Company’s operations to suffer from supply chain disruptions and potential delays in fulfilling customer orders or order cancellations altogether . Our international operations require us to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions .\n Our international operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended . Violations of these legal requirements could subject us to criminal fines and imprisonment, civil penalties, disgorgement of profits, injunctions, debarment from government contracts and other remedial measures .\n A significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . There can be no assurance that any or all actions taken by the Company to mitigate currency risk will be fully effective in successfully managing currency risk .\n There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against existing or new competition, and the inability to do so may result in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share . Periodic downturns in any of our customers’ end markets can significantly reduce demand for certain of our products, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations .\n The Company anticipates that it will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities as part of its growth strategy . From time to time, the Company experiences difficulty and unanticipated expenses associated with purchasing and integrating acquisitions, and acquisitions do not always perform and deliver the financial benefits expected . The Company may not be able to close acquisitions as anticipated, or at all .\n The Company’s credit agreement and senior notes contain certain requirements, which if breached, could have a material adverse effect on the Company . The Company could incur a material non-cash charge to its income statement for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets . We cannot provide assurance that impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur .\n The ability to meet the financial covenants can be affected by events beyond the Company’s control, and the Company cannot provide assurance that it will meet those . A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Revolving Credit Facility . The Company relies on the global capital markets, and an inability to access those markets on favorable terms could adversely affect the Company .\n The Company has used the global capital markets to raise capital to invest in its business and make strategic acquisitions . The Company monitors its mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt . As of December 31, 2024, less than 1% of the Company’s outstanding borrowings were subject to floating interest rates .\n Our business and financial results may be adversely affected by government contracting risks . We are subject to increased risks of governmental investigations, civil fraud actions, criminal prosecutions, whistleblower lawsuits and other enforcement actions . Failure, or the perceived failure, to comply with applicable requirements also could harm our reputation and our ability to compete for future government contracts or sell commercial equivalent products .\n The Company must comply with complex export and import controls as well as economic sanctions and trade embargoes imposed by the United States government and other countries . U.S. government contracts are subject to modification, curtailment or termination by the government without prior written notice, either for convenience or for default as a result of our failure to perform under the applicable contract . The Company could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source .\n In 2019, the U.S. government added certain companies based in China to the “Entity List” maintained by the Department of Commerce . Since 2022, numerous other related related rules and regulations have been implemented by BIS . In response to these regulations, the Chinese government has implemented its own set of import and export rules . To date, none of such restrictions have had a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations .\n The Company is subject to tax in all jurisdictions in which it operates, including the Company’s two largest markets, the U.S. and China . The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), a tax and spending package that introduced several tax-related provisions, including a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on certain large corporations, was enacted into law in 2022 .\n The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework, known as Pillar Two, provides guidance for a global minimum tax . The full impact of these provisions in the future depends on several factors, including interpretive regulatory guidance, which has not yet been released . We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement .\n We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors . Changes in laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share . Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries .\n The Company is subject to customer claims, litigation and other regulatory or legal proceedings . Such matters expose the Company to risks that could be material, including, but not limited to, risks related to employment disputes, tax controversies, government investigations, intellectual property infringement, compliance with environmental laws, unfair sales practices, product safety and liability .\n Rduct liability claims will likely have to be paid from Company funds and not by insurance . Environmental liabilities can result from the use of hazardous materials in production, the disposal of products, damages associated with use of any of our products or other related matters . Failure to comply with local environmental laws and regulations could result in fines or other punitive damages .\n The Company may also be subject to larger, global climate change initiatives, laws, regulations or orders which seek to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions . Failure, or perceived failure, to comply with these requirements may result in reduced demand for our products, reputational harm, or other adverse impacts to our business .\n In March 2024, in the U.S., the SEC issued a new rule (Final Rule 33-11275: The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors) The Company’s adoption of and compliance with this new rule could result in additional costs to the Company or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition or results of operations .\n Any future regulatory changes in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate, in addition to those already enacted, could result in transition risks to the Company . The nature and timing of any requirement to lower GHG emissions and adopt more energy-efficient energy use could be a factor . The Company has developed an information security and cybersecurity risk management program (“Program”)\n Our Program takes a risk-based approach and is integrated into our overall enterprise risk management program . We use the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (the NIST CSF) as a benchmark to ensure that our Program is maintained in line with industry best practices . The Company maintains a decentralized information technology infrastructure, where each business unit utilizes a separate and distinct information technology system .\n Cybersecurity incidents affecting our information technology systems could disrupt business operations or cause the release of highly sensitive confidential or personal information, resulting in adverse impacts to our business . We face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if realized, are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations or financial condition .\n Part I: “Our reputation and operating results and potentially leading to litigation and/or governmental investigations, fines and other penalties” in Part I, “potentially leading’ttingting’s reputation and . operating results,’ in part I, in part II: ‘Our reputation, operating results are at risk of litigation, fines, other penalties and other . penalties’ In Part II, ‘We’ll be looking to find a way to improve our reputation and our operating results’"
