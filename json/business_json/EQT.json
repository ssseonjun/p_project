    "item1": "Item 1., \"Business\" for a description of our properties. Our corporate headquarters is located in leased office space in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. We also own or lease office space in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio and Texas.\nItem 3.        Legal Proceedings\n \nIn the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against us. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, we are unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. We accrue legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. We have established reserves in amounts that we believe to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of any pending matter involving us will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nEnvironmental Proceedings\nPratt Storage Field Matter, Morgan Township, Pennsylvania\n. On October 31, 2018, a gas explosion occurred in Morgan Township, Greene County, Pennsylvania (the Pratt Incident), close in proximity to Equitrans, L.P.'s (one of our subsidiaries) Pratt Storage Field assets. Following the explosion, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP), the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission and the PHMSA began investigating the Pratt Incident. The PADEP issued a final report and closed its investigation in August 2022, and we do not expect further inquiry from the PADEP on this matter; however, the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission and PHMSA investigations are still pending. \nOn October 23, 2023, Equitrans, L.P. received permission from the FERC to plug and abandon the AH Hupp 3660 storage well (Hupp Well) in the Pratt Storage Field that was the subject of the PADEP's investigation of the Pratt Incident. On October 22, 2024, Equitrans, L.P. received from the FERC an extension until January 31, 2025 to complete plugging and abandonment of the Hupp Well. On January 24, 2025, Equitrans, L.P. requested an additional extension of time, until July 31, 2025, to complete the plugging and abandonment of the Hupp Well.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOn October 30, 2023, Equitrans, L.P. received a criminal complaint from the State Attorney General's Office charging Equitrans, L.P. with violations of Pennsylvania's Clean Streams Law (the Pratt Complaint), and generally alleging that: (i) natural gas leaked from the Hupp Well and into a water well and (ii) Equitrans, L.P. failed to conduct a stray gas investigation of the Pratt Incident. The Pratt Complaint carries the possibility of a monetary sanction, that if imposed could result in a fine in excess of $300,000; however, we expect that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. \nRager Mountain Storage Field Venting, Jackson Township, Pennsylvania.\n On November 6, 2022, Equitrans Midstream became aware of natural gas venting from one of the storage wells, well 2244, at Equitrans, L.P.'s Rager Mountain natural gas storage facility (the Rager Mountain Facility), located in Jackson Township, a remote section of Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Venting at the Rager Mountain Facility was halted on November 19, 2022. Since the time of the incident, the PADEP has concluded its investigation and the PHMSA and other investigators are continuing to conduct civil and criminal investigations of the incident, and we are cooperating in such investigations. \nOn December 29, 2022, the PHMSA issued Equitrans Midstream a Notice of Proposed Safety Order that included proposed remedial requirements related to the Rager Mountain Facility incident, including, but not limited to, completing a root cause analysis, and subsequently, on May 26, 2023, the PHMSA issued a consent order to Equitrans Midstream requiring the completion of a root cause analysis and a remedial work plan and providing that Equitrans Midstream may not resume injection operations at the Rager Mountain Facility until authorized by the PHMSA. In August 2023, Equitrans Midstream submitted a root cause analysis to the PHMSA and later submitted a remedial work plan and injection plan seeking authority to resume injections at the Rager Mountain Facility using all wells in the facility except three, which remained disconnected from the storage field. On October 2, 2023, the PHMSA approved Equitrans Midstream's injection plan and Equitrans Midstream restarted injections at the Rager Mountain Facility on October 5, 2023, subject to certain pressure restrictions and other requirements in the PHMSA consent agreement. On November 16, 2023, the PHMSA issued a letter to Equitrans Midstream approving Equitrans Midstream's request to remove all pressure restrictions at the Rager Mountain Facility. On May 30, 2024, the PHMSA approved resuming operations for one of the three remaining wells excluded from the injection plan.\nWe plan to continue working with the PHMSA, pursuant to the consent order between PHSMA and Equitrans Midstream, regarding the remaining two disconnected wells at the Rager Mountain Facility. If additional penalties are pursued and ultimately imposed related to the Rager Mountain Facility incident, the penalties, individually and/or in the aggregate, may exceed $300,000; however, we expect that the resolution of this matter will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nPlugging and Abandoning of Wells at the Holbrook Storage Reservoir, Center Township, Pennsylvania.\n One of our wholly owned subsidiaries, EQT Gathering, LLC, is the owner of fifteen inactive storage wells within the Holbrook storage reservoir located in Center Township, Pennsylvania. The wells have been inactive since 2021. On June 10, 2024, we were notified by the PADEP of alleged violations of the 2012 Oil and Gas Act, which requires wells located in Pennsylvania which are inactive for a period of twelve months to be reported to the PADEP as \"inactive\" and plugged. We are actively working with the PADEP to plug the inactive wells in accordance with the 2012 Oil and Gas Act and resolve this matter, and in connection therewith, we may be assessed a monetary penalty in excess of $300,000. W\ne expect that the resolution of this matter will not have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nItem 4.        Mine Safety Disclosures\n \nNot Applicable.\n60\nTable of Contents\nInformation about our Executive Officers (as of February 19, 2025)\nName and Age\nCurrent Title (Year Initially Elected an Executive Officer)\nBusiness Experience\nJ.E.B.

Our Board of Directors has the discretion to change the dividend rate at any time for any reason.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nWe did not repurchase any equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act during the three months ended December 31, 2024.\nOn December 13, 2021, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program) authorizing us to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $1 billion, excluding fees, commissions and expenses. On September 6, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a $1 billion increase to the Share Repurchase Program, pursuant to which approval we are authorized to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $2 billion, excluding fees, commissions and expenses. The Share Repurchase Program was originally scheduled to expire on December 31, 2023; however, on April 26, 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a one-year extension of the Share Repurchase Program. Further, on December 18, 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an additional two-year extension of the Share Repurchase Program. As a result of the most recent extension, the Share Repurchase Program will expire on December 31, 2026, but it may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice. Repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program may be made from time to time in amounts at prices we deem appropriate and will be subject to a variety of factors, including the market price of our common stock, general market and economic conditions, applicable legal requirements and other considerations. As of December 31, 2024, we had purchased shares for an aggregate purchase price of $622.1 million, excluding fees, commissions and expenses, under the Share Repurchase Program since its inception, and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the Share Repurchase Program is $1.4 billion.\nStock Performance Graph\n \nThe following graph compares the most recent cumulative five-year total return provided to shareholders of our common stock relative to the cumulative five-year total returns of the S&P 500 Index, the S&P MidCap 400 Index and two customized peer groups, the 2023 Self-Constructed Peer Group and the 2024 Self-Constructed Peer Group, whose company composition is discussed in footnotes (a) and (b), respectively, below. Our common stock was included in the S&P MidCap 400 index until October 2022, at which time our common stock was added to the S&P 500 Index. Accordingly, we have presented both indices for comparison in the following graph. An investment of $100, with reinvestment of all dividends, is assumed to have been made in our common stock, in the S&P 500 Index, the S&P MidCap 400 Index and in each of the peer groups on December 31, 2019 and its relative performance is tracked through December 31, 2024.

We used the proceeds from the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction to repay outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Facility (defined in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) and the Term Loan Facility and a portion of outstanding borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the Bridge Credit Facility were used to fund the redemption and repurchase of certain of EQM's senior notes, including pursuant to the EQM Tender Offer (defined in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nNEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestitures and NEPA Gathering System Acquisition\nResults of operations for 2024 include the results of our operation of assets received as consideration for the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, which closed on May 31, 2024. Such assets received included the remaining 16.25% equity interest in the NEPA Gathering System (defined in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) (which was the sole remaining minority interest following our acquisition of a 33.75% equity interest in the NEPA Gathering System Acquisition (defined in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) on April 11, 2024), resulting in our 100% ownership of the NEPA Gathering System. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn addition, on December 31, 2024, we completed the Second NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We used the proceeds from the Second NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture of $1.25 billion, subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments and transaction costs, to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility.\nEquitrans Midstream Merger\nResults of operations for 2024 include the results of our operation of assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger, which closed on July 22, 2024. Following the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we own a gathering system with 1,975 miles of gathering lines (including gathering lines owned prior to the Equitrans Midstream Merger) and a transmission and storage system with approximately 950 miles of FERC-regulated, interstate pipelines. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor the period from July 22, 2024 through December 31, 2024, our consolidated gathering expense decreased due to our ownership of the gathering and transmission assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger. Our ownership of such assets will continue to positively impact our Production segment's gathering expense, with a corresponding increase to our Production segment's affiliate transportation and processing expense, which is eliminated in consolidation. This relationship will be prominent for full year 2025 results and beyond.\nTug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition\nResults of operations for 2024 and the second half of 2023 include the results of our operation of assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition (defined in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which closed on August 22, 2023.\n65\nTable of Contents\nTrends and Uncertainties\nOn March 4, 2024, we announced our decision to strategically curtail approximately 1.0 Bcfe per day of gross production (the Strategic Curtailment) beginning on February 24, 2024 in response to the low natural gas price environment resulting from warm winter weather and elevated storage inventories. The Strategic Curtailment resulted in total decreased sales volume of 107 Bcfe for 2024. In addition, certain operators of wells in which we have a non-operating working interest also curtailed production in 2024. For 2024, we estimate that our total expected sales volume was negatively impacted by approximately 130 to 140 Bcfe of curtailments, including our Strategic Curtailment of 107 Bcfe and curtailments by certain operators of wells in which we have a non-operating working interest.\nLow natural gas prices or volatility in the natural gas market may result in adjustments to our 2025 planned development schedule or the development schedule of non-operated wells in which we have a working interest. Further, we cannot control or otherwise influence the development schedule of non-operated wells in which we have a working interest. Adjustments to our 2025 planned development schedule or the development schedule of non-operated wells in which we have a working interest, including due to declines in natural gas prices, the pace of well completions, access to sand and water to conduct drilling operations, access to sufficient pipeline takeaway capacity, unscheduled downtime at processing facilities or otherwise, could impact our future sales volume, operating revenues and expenses, per unit metrics and capital expenditures.\nIn connection with the recent U.S. election and corresponding inauguration of President Trump on January 20, 2025, the President executed several executive orders, some of which impact the oil and gas industry, and he and others in Congress have indicated the potential for further changes to regulations, many of which could impact the oil and gas industry, as well as the institution of tariffs on foreign goods and services. It is uncertain at this time to what extent such changes in regulations and tariffs will impact our business. A changing regulatory environment could increase our costs to comply with such regulations or make us susceptible to lawsuits or fines for failure to comply with such regulations. Further, tariffs on foreign goods and services could result in other countries instituting tariffs on U.S. goods and services, which could impact the price of natural gas, increase the price of supplies and raw materials that we rely on to conduct our business, and could impact interest rates. A changing regulatory environment and domestic or foreign tariffs could ultimately impact our future sales volume, operating revenues and expenses, per unit metrics and capital expenditures. \nLastly, we expect commodity prices to be volatile through 2025 due to macroeconomic uncertainty, changes to the regulatory environment and geopolitical tensions, including developments pertaining to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East and potential further imposition of domestic and foreign tariffs. Our revenue, profitability, liquidity and financial position will continue to be impacted in the future by the market prices for natural gas and, to a lesser extent, NGLs and oil.\nConsolidated Results of Operations \n \nNet income attributable to EQT Corporation for 2024 was $231 million, $0.45 per diluted share, compared to $1,735 million, $4.22 per diluted share, for 2023. The decrease was attributable primarily to a lower gain on derivatives, increased depreciation, depletion and amortization, increased other operating expenses and increased net interest expense, partly offset by the gains on the NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestitures, decreased income tax expense, increased pipeline revenues and decreased transportation and processing expense.\nSee Item 7., \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" included in our Annual Report on \nForm 10-K\n for the year ended December 31, 2023, which is incorporated herein by reference, for discussion and analysis of consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nWe did not recast our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 for our change in reportable segments as such change does not materially change our historic comparative discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 included within the 2023 Annual Report. Prior to the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we operated our business as a single segment and did not generate material third-party gathering operating income. Further, in our judgment, we do not believe such a recast is necessary to an understanding of our business, financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information by business segment, including our profit and loss metric and capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2022 and segment assets as of December 31, 2022.\n66\nTable of Contents\nSee \"Average Realized Price Reconciliation\" for a discussion and calculation of our average realized price, which is based on our Production segment's adjusted operating revenues (Production adjusted operating revenues), a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure that has been reconciled from total Production operating revenues in \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reconciliation.\" See \"Business Segment Results of Operations\" for a discussion of segment operating revenues and expenses and \"Other Income Statement Items\" for a discussion of other income statement items. See \"Investing Activities\" under \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" for a discussion of capital expenditures, including by business segment.\nAverage Realized Price Reconciliation\nThe following table presents detailed natural gas and liquids operational information to assist in the understanding of our consolidated operations, including the calculation of our average realized price ($/Mcfe), which is based on Production adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP supplemental financial measure. Production adjusted operating revenues is presented because it is an important measure we use to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. Production adjusted operating revenues should not be considered as an alternative to total Production operating revenues.

See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a reconciliation of total Production operating revenues to EQT Corporation operating revenues as reported in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nProduction adjusted operating revenues (also referred to in this report as total natural gas and liquids sales, including cash settled derivatives) is presented because it is an important measure we use to evaluate period-to-period comparisons of earnings trends. Production adjusted operating revenues is defined as total Production operating revenues, less the revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement and Production net marketing services and other revenues. We believe that Production adjusted operating revenues provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it helps facilitate comparisons of operating performance and earnings trends across periods. Production adjusted operating revenues reflects only the impact of settled derivative contracts; thus, the measure excludes the often-volatile revenue impact of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments prior to settlement. The measure also excludes Production net marketing services and other revenues, which consists of costs of, and recoveries on, pipeline capacity releases and other revenues.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n(Thousands, unless otherwise noted)\nTotal Production operating revenues\n$\n5,009,833 \n$\n6,896,358 \n(Deduct) add:\nProduction gain on derivatives\n(67,880)\n(1,838,941)\nNet cash settlements received on derivatives (a)\n1,217,895 \n900,650 \nPremiums paid for derivatives that settled during the period\n(45,454)\n(322,869)\nProduction net marketing services and other\n(7,587)\n(12,649)\nProduction adjusted operating revenues, a non-GAAP financial measure\n$\n6,106,807 \n$\n5,622,549 \nTotal sales volume (MMcfe)\n2,228,159 \n2,016,273 \nAverage sales price ($/Mcfe)\n$\n2.21 \n$\n2.50 \nAverage realized price ($/Mcfe)\n$\n2.74 \n$\n2.79 \n(a)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, composed of net cash settlements received on NYMEX natural gas hedge positions of approximately $1,374 million and $976 million , respectively, and net cash settlements paid on basis and liquids hedge positions of $157 million and $76 million, respectively. Net cash settlements received on derivatives are included in average realized price but may not be included in operating revenues.\nBusiness Segment Results of Operations\nOperating segments are revenue-producing components of an entity for which separate financial information is produced internally and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to measure financial performance and allocate resources.\nPrior to the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, we reported our results of operations as a single consolidated segment. Thereafter, and as a result thereof, we adjusted our internal reporting structure and our chief operating decision maker changed the manner in which he measures financial performance and allocates resources to incorporate the gathering and transmission assets we acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger. Hence, our operations expanded to comprise three discrete segments reflective of our three lines of business of Production, Gathering and Transmission. Accordingly, the manner in which we report our operations has been changed retrospectively, with certain prior period amounts recast between our Production segment and Gathering segment.\nThe following sections summarize operating income and certain operational measures by our three reportable segments. We believe this information is useful to investors for evaluating our financial condition, results of operations and trends and uncertainties of our segments. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information by business segment.\n69\nTable of Contents\nCertain amounts, including cash and cash equivalents, debt, income taxes and other amounts related to our headquarters function as well as amounts related to our energy transition initiatives are managed on a consolidated basis and, as such, have not been allocated to our reportable segments.

The average sales price decreased for 2024 compared to 2023 due to a lower NYMEX price, partly offset by lower basis spreads and higher NGLs price. Sales volume increased for 2024 compared to 2023 primarily as a result of sales volume increases of 164 Bcfe from the assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition as well as increases from wells turned-in-line, partly offset by sales volume decreases of 107 Bcfe from the Strategic Curtailment and net decreases of 21 Bcfe due to the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture. The increase in sales volume had a favorable impact on per unit costs for 2024 compared to 2023.\nProduction gain on derivatives.\n For 2024, we recognized a gain on derivatives of approximately $68 million related primarily to increases in the fair market value of our NYMEX swaps and options of approximately $377 million due to decreases in NYMEX forward prices, partly offset by decreases in the fair market value of our basis swaps of approximately $309 million. For 2023, we recognized a gain on derivatives of approximately $1,839 million related primarily to increases in the fair market value of our NYMEX swaps and options of approximately $1,830 million due to decreases in NYMEX forward prices as well as increases in the fair market value of our basis swaps of approximately $9 million.\nTransportation and processing\nGathering.\n Gathering expense decreased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to our Gathering segment's ownership of the gathering assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger, our Transmission segment's ownership of the transmission and storage assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger and our Gathering segment's ownership of the additional interest in the NEPA Gathering System acquired in the NEPA Gathering System Acquisition and as consideration for the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture.\nTransmission.\n \nTransmission expense increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to capacity charges related to the in service of the MVP (which commenced long-term firm capacity obligations on July 1, 2024) of approximately $165 million, additional contracted capacity on the Columbia Gas and Transco pipelines of an aggregate approximate $47 million and credits received in 2023 from pipeline credits of approximately $14 million. We record our equity earnings from our investment in the MVP Joint Venture in income from investments in our Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nProcessing.\n Processing expense increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to increased processing expense from the liquids-rich properties acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition of approximately $40 million and increased volumes of gas requiring processing from wells that we turned-in-line in 2024.\nTransportation and processing to affiliate.\n Affiliate transportation and processing expense increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to our Gathering segment's ownership of the gathering assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger, our Transmission segment's ownership of the transmission and storage assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger and our Gathering segment's ownership of the additional interest in the NEPA Gathering System acquired in the NEPA Gathering System Acquisition and as consideration for the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture. In addition, affiliate transportation and processing expense increased on a per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due to our Gathering segment's ownership of the gathering assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition during the third quarter of 2023.\nLOE. \nLOE increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to increased LOE from the operation and maintenance of our assets, including assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition and the Equitrans Midstream Merger and water assets internally-developed in the prior year, as well as increased salt water disposal costs.\nProduction taxes.\n Production tax expense increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due to increased property tax expense of approximately $63 million primarily from the assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition and higher price as well as increased severance tax expense of approximately $24 million from increased sales volume in West Virginia.\n71\nTable of Contents\nSelling, general and administrative. \nSelling, general and administrative expense increased on an absolute basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to higher legal and professional services costs as well as higher personnel costs due to increased workforce headcount. In addition, we did not recast selling, general and administrative expense for periods prior to the Equitrans Midstream Merger closing date and, upon the Equitrans Midstream Merger closing date, we adjusted our basis for selling, general and administrative expense allocation for multi-segment reporting.\nDepreciation and depletion.\n Production depletion expense increased on an absolute and per Mcfe basis for 2024 compared to 2023 due to increased sales volume and higher annual depletion rate.\n(Gain) loss on sale/exchange of long-lived assets\n. During 2024, we recognized a gain on the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture of approximately $299 million and a gain on the Second NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture of approximately $463 million. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. During 2023, we recognized a loss on sale/exchange of long-lived assets of approximately $17 million related to acreage trade agreements where the carrying value of the acres traded exceeded the fair value of the acres received.\nImpairment and expiration of leases.\n During 2024 and 2023, we recognized impairment and expiration of leases related to leases that we no longer expect to extend or develop prior to their expiration based on our development plan.\nOther operating expenses\n. We recognized approximately $13 million and $9 million of other operating expenses for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Other operating expenses increased for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to increased rig release expense and increased legal and environmental reserves, including from settlements, partly offset by proceeds received in 2024 from business interruption insurance claim recoveries. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of consolidated other operating expenses.\nGATHERING\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange\n% Change\n(Thousands, unless otherwise noted)\nGathered volume (BBtu/d):\nFirm capacity\n5,277 \n— \n5,277 \n100 \nVolumetric-based services\n4,234 \n976 \n3,258 \n334 \nTotal gathered volume\n9,511 \n976 \n8,535 \n874 \nOperating revenues:\nLoss on derivatives\n$\n(16,763)\n$\n— \n$\n(16,763)\n100 \nFirm reservation fee revenue\n313,987 \n— \n313,987 \n100 \nVolumetric-based fee revenue (a)\n452,476 \n161,395 \n291,081 \n180 \nTotal operating revenues\n749,700 \n161,395 \n588,305 \n365 \nOperating expenses:\nOperating and maintenance\n89,897 \n15,699 \n74,198 \n473 \nSelling, general and administrative (b)\n38,837 \n— \n38,837 \n100 \nDepreciation\n89,513 \n17,066 \n72,447 \n425 \nGain on sale/exchange of long-lived assets\n(22)\n— \n(22)\n100 \nTotal operating expenses\n218,225 \n32,765 \n185,460 \n566 \nOperating income\n$\n531,475 \n$\n128,630 \n$\n402,845 \n313 \n(a)\nFor agreements structured with MVCs, includes volumes up to the contractual MVC; volumes in excess of the contractual MVC are reported under volumetric-based services.\n(b)\nSelling, general and administrative expense incurred prior to the Equitrans Midstream Merger closing date was not recast as the necessary information is not available and the cost to develop such information would be excessive.\n72\nTable of Contents\nGathering revenues and expenses increased for 2024 compared to 2023 primarily from the gathering assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger during the third quarter of 2024 and in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition during the third quarter of 2023.

We recognized $337.2 million and $74.9 million of corporate other operating expenses for 2024 and 2023, respectively. Corporate other operating expenses increased for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to transaction costs related to the Equitrans Midstream Merger of $304.8 million and higher legal reserves, partly offset by lower transaction costs related to the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of consolidated other operating expenses.\nTotal transaction costs related to the Equitrans Midstream Merger recognized during 2024 included severance and other termination benefits and stock-based compensation costs of $165.4 million, of which $60.8 million was cash and $104.6 million was non-cash.\nIncome from investments.\n Income from investments increased for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to equity earnings from our investment in the MVP Joint Venture of $78.8 million, partly offset by a decrease in the fair value of our investment in the Investment Fund (defined in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\n73\nTable of Contents\nOther income. \nOther income increased for 2024 compared to 2023 due to proceeds received from insurance claim recoveries of $19.1 million related to the assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition and dividends received from our investment in the Investment Fund.\nLoss on debt extinguishment.\n During 2024, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $68.3 million due primarily to premiums and financing costs paid on our redemption and repurchase of certain of EQM's senior notes, including pursuant to the EQM Tender Offer, and non-cash losses related to our write off of the unamortized fair value adjustments of those redeemed and repurchased EQM senior notes and unamortized deferred issuance costs of the Term Loan Facility. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest expense, net.\n Net interest expense increased for 2024 compared to 2023 due primarily to interest expense on EQM's senior notes, increased interest expense on our borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility, interest expense on EQT's 5.750% senior notes issued in January 2024, lower interest income earned on cash on hand and interest expense on Eureka Midstream, LLC's (Eureka) borrowings under its revolving credit facility, partly offset by decreased interest expense from our repayment and repurchase of certain of EQT's senior notes as well as higher capitalized interest from the assets acquired in the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome tax expense. \nSee Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n. During 2024, we recognized $11.4 million of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of Eureka Midstream Holdings, a consolidated joint venture in which we acquired an equity interest as a result of the Equitrans Midstream Merger. Sees Note 1 and 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\n \nAlthough we cannot provide any assurance, we believe cash flows from operating activities and availability under EQT's revolving credit facility should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements, including, but not limited to, normal operating needs, debt service obligations, planned capital expenditures and commitments for at least the next twelve months and, based on current expectations, for the long term.\nPurchase Obligations\nWe have commitments to pay demand charges under long-term contracts and binding precedent agreements with various pipelines as well as charges for processing capacity to extract heavier liquid hydrocarbons from the natural gas stream. In addition, we have commitments to pay for services related to our operations, including electric hydraulic fracturing services and purchase equipment, materials and sand. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of aggregated future payments for these commitments.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a total reserve for unrecognized tax benefits of $9.0 million and an additional reserve of $60.4 million that was offset against deferred tax assets for general business tax credit carryforwards and net operating losses (NOLs). We settled our consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability with the IRS through 2019 in September 2024. We are currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement of these potential liabilities with taxing authorities. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nPlanned Capital Expenditures and Sales Volume\nIn 2025, we expect to spend approximately $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion on total capital expenditures. We expect to fund our capital expenditures with cash generated from operations and, if required, borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility. Because we are the operator of a high percentage of our developed acreage, the amount and timing of certain of our capital expenditures is largely discretionary. We could choose to defer a portion of our planned 2025 capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil; the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital; the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals; and drilling, completion and acquisition costs. In addition, our gathering and transmission businesses are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to develop new facilities and maintain and upgrade existing operations. In 2025, we expect our sales volume to be 2,175 Bcfe to 2,275 Bcfe.\n74\nTable of Contents\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe have contractual commitments under our debt agreements, including interest payments and principal repayments. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of such contractual commitments, including maturity dates.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $2,827 million and $3,179 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease was due primarily to changes in working capital from movements in the market price for natural gas and timing of payments as well as higher cash operating expenses (including from transaction costs related to the Equitrans Midstream Merger), higher net interest expense and higher share-based compensation expense. Such decreases were partly offset by higher net cash settlements received on derivatives, lower net premiums paid on derivatives, higher cash operating revenues (including from pipeline revenues on assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger) and higher distributions from equity method investments (including approximately $53 million from our investment in the MVP Joint Venture).\nOur cash flows from operating activities, including changes in working capital, are affected by movements in the market price for commodities. We are unable to predict such movements outside of the current market view as reflected in forward strip pricing. For a discussion of potential commodity market risks, refer to",
    "item1a": "Item 1A., \"Risk Factors – Our operations have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms.\" Changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our debt and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of fair value measurements, including the fair value measurement of our debt. \nOther Market Risks. \nWe are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to our derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value, which may change as market prices change. Our OTC derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and, thus, are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as the financial industry as a whole. We use various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate our credit risk exposures, including monitoring current market conditions and counterparty credit fundamentals. Credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals. To manage the level of credit risk, we enter into transactions primarily with financial counterparties that are of investment grade, enter into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security. \nApproximately 20%, or $93 million, of our OTC derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2024 had a positive fair value. Approximately 86%, or $912 million, of our OTC derivative contracts outstanding at December 31, 2023 had a positive fair value.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, we were not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to our derivative contracts. During 2024, we made no adjustments to the fair value of our derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal non-performance risk adjustment included in our established fair value procedure. We monitor market conditions that may impact the fair value of our derivative contracts.\n \nWe are exposed to the risk of nonperformance by credit customers on physical sales of natural gas, NGLs and oil. Revenues and related accounts receivable from our operations are generated primarily from the sale of our produced natural gas, NGLs and oil to marketers, utilities and industrial customers located in the Appalachian Basin and in markets that are accessible through our transportation portfolio, which includes markets in the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast United States and Canada. We also contract with certain processors to market a portion of our NGLs on our behalf. \nAs of December 31, 2024, no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate for EQT's revolving credit facility held more than 10% of the financial commitments thereunder. In addition, as of December 31, 2024, no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate for Eureka's revolving credit facility held more than 13% of the financial commitments thereunder. The large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender are expected to limit our exposure to disruption or consolidation in the banking industry.\n82\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.        Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n \n \n \nPage Reference\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm (PCAOB ID: \n42\n)\n \n84\nStatements of Consolidated Operations\n \n90\nStatements of Consolidated Comprehensive Incom\ne\n \n91\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n \n92\nStatements of Consolidated Cash Flows\n \n93\nStatements of Consolidated Equity\n \n94\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n95\n83\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of EQT Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of EQT Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n84\nTable of Contents\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization ('DD&A') of proved oil and natural gas properties\nDescription of the Matter\nAt December 31, 2024, the net book value of the Company's proved oil and natural gas properties was $19,497 million, and depreciation and depletion (DD&A) expense of the Company's Production segment was $2,017 million for the year then ended. As described in Note 1, under the successful efforts method of accounting, DD&A is recorded on a cost center basis using the units-of-production method. Proved developed reserves, as estimated by the Company’s internal engineers, are used to calculate depreciation of wells and related equipment and facilities and amortization of intangible drilling costs. Total proved reserves, also estimated by the Company's engineers, are used to calculate depletion on property acquisitions. Proved natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and oil reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering evaluations of in-place hydrocarbon volumes. Significant judgment is required by the Company’s engineers in evaluating geological and engineering data when estimating proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves. Estimating reserves also requires the selection of inputs, including natural gas, NGLs and oil price assumptions and future operating and capital costs assumptions, among others. Because of the complexity involved in estimating natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves, management used independent engineers to audit the estimates prepared by the Company's internal engineers as of December 31, 2024.\nAuditing the Company's DD&A calculation is especially complex because of the use of the work of the internal engineers and the independent engineers and the evaluation of management's determination of the inputs described above used by those engineers in estimating proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over its process to calculate DD&A, including management’s controls over the completeness and accuracy of the financial data provided to the internal and external engineers for use in estimating the proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company engineer primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of the reserve estimates by the internal engineering staff and the independent engineers used to audit the estimates. In addition, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the financial data and inputs described above used by the internal and external engineers in estimating proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves by agreeing them to source documentation and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. For proved undeveloped reserves, we evaluated management's development plan for compliance with the SEC rule that undrilled locations are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time, by assessing consistency of the development projections with the Company's drill plan and the availability of capital relative to the drill plan. We also tested the mathematical accuracy of the DD&A calculations, including comparing the proved natural gas, NGLs, and oil reserves amounts used to the Company's reserve report.\n85\nTable of Contents\nValuation of Acquired property, plant and equipment and the investment in the MVP Joint Venture related to the Equitrans Midstream Merger\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, on July 22, 2024, the Company completed the Equitrans Midstream Merger. The Company's accounting for the Equitrans Midstream Merger included determining the fair value of the acquired property, plant and equipment (PP&E) and the investment in the MVP Joint Venture. The determination of fair value of the PP&E and investment in the MVP Joint Venture included significant judgment and assumptions by management, including future revenue, future operating costs, and a market-based discount rate.\n   \nAuditing the Company's valuation of PP&E and the investment in the MVP Joint Venture involved a high degree of subjectivity as the determination of fair value was based on assumptions as described above which include future market and economic conditions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's process to estimate fair value for the acquired natural gas and oil properties. For example, we tested controls over management's assessment of the appropriateness of the significant assumptions that are inputs to the fair value calculation and management’s review of the valuation model.\nOur audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the professional qualifications and objectivity of the external valuation advisors used to assist with the determination of the fair value of certain acquired assets. Our testing of the Company's estimate of fair value of the PP&E and investment in the MVP Joint Venture included, among other procedures, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. The audit procedures involved the use of our valuation specialists to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the methodology used in the cash flow model, as well as testing the significant market-related assumptions described above used to develop the fair value estimate. We assessed the reasonableness of management's assumptions by comparing the key market-related assumptions, such as the market-based discount rate used to develop the fair value estimates.\n86\nTable of Contents\nAccounting for the new Midstream Joint Venture\nDescription of the Matter\nAs more fully described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, on November 22, 2024, the Company entered into a contribution agreement (the Contribution Agreement) with an affiliate of Blackstone Credit & Insurance (the BXCI Affiliate) to form a new midstream joint venture (the Midstream Joint Venture). On December 30, 2024, the transactions contemplated by the Contribution Agreement were consummated and, among other things, (i) EQM and certain of its subsidiaries contributed certain midstream assets (through the contribution of certain entities and equity interests) to the Midstream Joint Venture in exchange for 364,285,715 Class A Units in the Midstream Joint Venture and (ii) the BXCI Affiliate contributed $3.5 billion of cash (net of certain transaction fees and expenses) to the Midstream Joint Venture in exchange for 350,000,000 Class B Units in the Midstream Joint Venture (the Class B units). The Company determined the Class B units should be classified as noncontrolling interests within permanent equity.\nWe identified management's evaluation of whether the Class B units should be classified as noncontrolling interests within permanent equity as a critical audit matter. Management applied judgment in assessing relevant terms, provisions, and other conditions, relative to the applicable accounting guidance, to determine the appropriate classification of the Class B units noncontrolling interests. Auditing these assessments made by management involved challenging auditor judgment due to the extent of specialized skills or knowledge required.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company's accounting for the Midstream Joint Venture. For example, we tested controls over the initial recognition and measurement of the Midstream Joint Venture, including the recording of the noncontrolling interest.\n \nTo test the initial accounting for the Midstream Joint Venture, our audit procedures included, among others, inspection of the underlying agreements and testing management's application of the relevant accounting guidance, including the determination of the balance sheet classification of the noncontrolling interest. We involved professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting for the Midstream Joint Venture, including conclusions reached with respect to the recognition of the noncontrolling interest.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1950.\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 19, 2025\n87\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of EQT Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited EQT Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, EQT Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Managements’ Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Equitrans Midstream which are included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 25% of total assets as of December 31, 2024 and approximately 5% of total operating revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Equitrans Midstream. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a), and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included\n \nin the accompanying\n \nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n. \nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the\n \nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n88\nTable of Contents\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania \nFebruary 19, 2025\n89\nTable of Contents\nEQT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSTATEMENTS OF

Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company records noncontrolling interest in its Consolidated Financial Statements for any non-wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary. \nUpon the completion of the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction (defined in Note 8) and as of December 31, 2024, the Company consolidates its controlling interest in the Midstream Joint Venture (defined in Note 8) under the voting interest entity model. See Note 8 for discussion of the formation of the Midstream Joint Venture, the completion of the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction and the method of allocation used in accounting for the portion of Midstream Joint Venture that is not owned by the Company.\nIn addition, upon the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger (defined in Note 6) and as of December 31, 2024, the Company consolidates its \n60\n% interest in Eureka Midstream Holdings, LLC (Eureka Midstream Holdings), a joint venture that owns a gathering header pipeline system that is operated by a subsidiary of EQT, under the voting interest entity model. See Note 10 for discussion of the revolving credit facility of Eureka Midstream, LLC (Eureka), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eureka Midstream Holdings.\nIn 2020, the Company entered into a partnership with a third-party investor (the Investor) to form a joint venture, The Mineral Company LLC, for the purpose of purchasing certain mineral rights in the Appalachian Basin. During 2023, The Mineral Company LLC's assets were distributed pro rata to the Company and the Investor, and The Mineral Company LLC was dissolved. Prior to The Mineral Company LLC's dissolution, the Company consolidated The Mineral Company LLC as management had determined that The Mineral Company LLC was a variable interest entity, and the Company was the primary beneficiary of The Mineral Company LLC.\nPrior to the NEPA Gathering System Acquisition (defined in Note 6) and the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture (defined in Note 7), the Company recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements its pro rata share of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities of the NEPA Gathering System (defined in Note 6). Following the completion of the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, the Company owns \n100\n% of the NEPA Gathering System.\nSegments. \nThe Company has \nthree\n reportable segments reflective of its \nthree\n lines of business consisting of Production, Gathering and Transmission. See Note 2.\nReclassification. \nCertain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In addition, as discussed further in Note 2, certain prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the Company's change in reportable segments from \none\n reportable segment to \nthree\n reportable segments consisting of Production, Gathering and Transmission.\nUse of Estimates. \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported herein. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. \nThe Company considers all highly-liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents and accounts for such investments at cost. Interest earned on cash equivalents is included as a reduction of interest expense, net.\n95\nTable of Contents\nAccounts Receivable, Net of Allowance for Credit Losses.\n The Company's accounts receivable relates primarily to the sales of natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and oil and amounts due from joint interest partners. See Note 3 for a discussion of amounts due from contracts with customers. Reserves for uncollectible accounts are recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. Judgment is required to assess the ultimate realization of the Company's accounts receivable. Reserves are based on historical experience, current and expected economic trends and specific information about customer accounts, such as the customer's creditworthiness.\nDerivative Instruments.\n See Note 4 for a discussion of the Company's derivative instruments and Note 5 \nfor a description of the fair value hierarchy and a \ndiscussion of the Company's fair value measurements.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other.\n \nThe following table summarizes the Company's prepaid expenses and other current assets.\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(Thousands)\nMargin requirements with counterparties (see Note 4)\n$\n86,975\n \n$\n13,017\n \nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n52,044\n \n25,238\n \nTotal prepaid expenses and other\n$\n139,019\n \n$\n38,255\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment. \nThe following table summarizes the Company's property, plant and equipment.\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(Thousands)\nOil and gas producing properties\n$\n33,549,913\n \n$\n32,510,595\n \nLess: Accumulated depletion\n12,489,317\n \n10,734,099\n \nNet oil and gas producing properties\n21,060,596\n \n21,776,496\n \nOther production assets, at cost less accumulated depreciation\n20,434\n \n21,679\n \nNet production assets\n21,081,030\n \n21,798,175\n \nGathering assets\n8,067,556\n \n1,153,049\n \nLess: Accumulated depreciation\n131,546\n \n41,793\n \nNet gathering assets\n7,936,010\n \n1,111,256\n \nTransmission and storage assets\n2,667,352\n \n—\n \nLess: Accumulated depreciation\n30,027\n \n—\n \nNet transmission and storage assets\n2,637,325\n \n—\n \nOther property, plant and equipment, at cost less accumulated depreciation\n93,453\n \n40,739\n \nNet property, plant and equipment\n$\n31,747,818\n \n$\n22,950,170\n \nThe Company uses the successful efforts method of accounting for gas, NGLs and oil producing activities. Under this method, the cost of productive wells and related equipment, development dry holes and productive acreage, including productive mineral interests, are capitalized and depleted using the unit-of-production method. These costs include salaries, benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to production activities. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company capitalized internal costs of approximately $\n69\n million, $\n57\n million and $\n48\n million, respectively, to its oil and gas producing properties. In addition, in 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company capitalized interest expense related to well development of approximately $\n54\n million, $\n41\n million and $\n28\n million, respectively. Depletion expense is calculated based on actual produced sales volume multiplied by the applicable depletion rate per unit. Depletion rates for leases and wells are each calculated by dividing net capitalized costs by the number of units expected to be produced over the life of the reserves separately. Costs for exploratory dry holes, exploratory geological and geophysical activities and delay rentals as well as other property carrying costs are charged to exploration expense. The Company's producing oil and gas properties had an overall average depletion rate of $\n0.90\n, $\n0.84\n and $\n0.85\n per Mcfe for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n96\nTable of Contents\nThere were \nno\n exploratory wells drilled during 2024, 2023 and 2022, and there were \nno\n capitalized exploratory well costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company's gathering, transmission and storage property, plant and equipment is carried at cost. Maintenance projects that do not increase the overall life of the related assets are expensed as incurred. Expenditures that extend the useful life of the asset are capitalized. In 2024, the Company capitalized internal costs of approximately $\n25\n million and $\n4\n million to its gathering assets and transmission and storage assets, respectively. The Company's gathering, transmission and storage property, plant and equipment are depreciated using composite rates on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. The average depreciation rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 was \n3.1\n%. Depreciation rates for the Company's regulated property, plant and equipment are reviewed when the Company files a change in transmission and storage rates with the FERC.\nImpairment of Property, Plant and Equipment\nImpairment of Proved Oil and Gas Properties.\n \nThe carrying values of the Company's proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the remaining carrying value may not be recoverable. To determine whether impairment of the Company's oil and gas properties has occurred, the Company compares the estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying values of those properties. Estimated future cash flows are based on proved and, if determined reasonable by management, risk-adjusted probable reserves and assumptions generally consistent with the assumptions used by the Company for internal planning and budgeting purposes, including, among other things, the intended use of the asset, anticipated production from reserves, future market prices for natural gas, NGLs and oil adjusted for basis differentials, future operating costs and inflation. Proved oil and gas properties that have carrying amounts in excess of estimated future undiscounted cash flows are written down to fair value, which is estimated by discounting the estimated future cash flows using discount rates and other assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their fair value estimates. There were no indicators of impairment to the Company's material asset groups identified during 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nImpairment and Expiration of Leases.\n Capitalized costs of unproved oil and gas properties are evaluated for recoverability on a prospective basis at least annually. Indicators of potential impairment include changes due to economic factors, potential shifts in business strategy and historical experience. The likelihood of an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties increases as the expiration of a lease term approaches and drilling activity has not commenced. The Company recognizes impairment if the Company does not have the intent to drill on the leased property prior to expiration of the lease or does not have the intent and ability to extend, renew, trade or sell the lease prior to expiration. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded $\n97.4\n million, $\n109.4\n million and $\n176.6\n million, respectively, for impairment and expiration of leases. The Company's unproved properties had a net book value of approximately $\n1,563\n million and $\n2,039\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nImpairment of Other Property, Plant and Equipment.\n The Company evaluates its other property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. There were no indicators of impairment to the Company's asset groups identified during 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nImpairment of Contract Asset. \nIn 2020, the Company recorded a contract asset representing rate relief that the Company was entitled to pursuant to a consolidated gas gathering and compression agreement (the Consolidated GGA) entered into between the Company and an affiliate of EQM Midstream Partners, LP (EQM), which became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of EQT upon the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger. During 2022, the Company identified indicators that the carrying amount of its contract asset might not be fully recoverable, including increased uncertainty of the estimated timing of completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline (the MVP) due to court rulings and public statements from Equitrans Midstream Corporation (Equitrans Midstream), the former parent of EQM, with respect to the completion of the MVP\n. As a result of the Company's impairment evaluation, the Company recognized impairment of the contract asset of $\n214\n million in the Statement of Consolidated Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, decreasing the contract asset's value to \nzero\n.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities. \nSee Note 11 for a discussion of the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities, which include EQT's equity method investments and investments in equity securities. The Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated entities for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the investment's fair value is less than its carrying amount. The recognition of an impairment loss is required if the impairment is considered other than temporary.\n There were no indicators of impairment to the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities identified during 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n97\nTable of Contents\nNet Intangible Assets. \nAs part of the Equitrans Midstream Merger preliminary purchase price allocation, the Company identified intangible assets related to certain of Equitrans Midstream's transmission services contracts. See Note 6. The Company evaluates its intangible assets for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. There were no indicators of impairment to the Company's net intangible assets identified during 2024.\nGoodwill. \nGoodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is allocated among, and evaluated for impairment at, the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment.\nThe Company evaluates its goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill is tested for impairment by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount or by performing a quantitative assessment. If the qualitative assessment indicates a possible impairment, then a quantitative impairment test is performed to determine the fair value of the reporting unit using a combination of an income and market approach. Otherwise, no further analysis is required.\nUnder the quantitative assessment, the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. In the event that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company would recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill applicable to that reporting unit.\nThe Company evaluated its goodwill for impairment as of October 1, 2024 and determined there were no indicators of impairment.\nOther Current Liabilities.\n \nThe following table summarizes the Company's other current liabilities.\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(Thousands)\nAccrued taxes other than income\n$\n114,700\n \n62,391\n \nAccrued incentive compensation\n53,138\n \n24,542\n \nCurrent portion of long-term capacity contracts\n43,697\n \n43,233\n \nCurrent portion of lease liabilities\n41,878\n \n46,380\n \nDeferred revenue\n24,187\n \n2,890\n \nAccrued payroll\n12,115\n \n8,870\n \nOther accrued liabilities\n59,702\n \n16,697\n \nTotal other current liabilities\n$\n349,417\n \n$\n205,003\n \n \nUnamortized Debt Discount and Issuance Costs. \nDiscounts and costs incurred with the issuance of debt are amortized over the life of the debt. These amounts are presented as a reduction of debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n See Note 10.\nLeases. \nSee Note 14 for a discussion of the Company's leases.\nIncome Taxes. \nThe Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. The provision for income taxes represents amounts paid or estimated to be payable net of amounts refunded or estimated to be refunded for the current year and the change in deferred taxes exclusive of amounts recorded in other comprehensive loss. Any refinements to prior year taxes made in the current year due to new information are reflected as adjustments in the current period. Separate income taxes are calculated for items charged or credited directly to shareholders' equity.\nEQM, Eureka Midstream Holdings and the Midstream Joint Venture are treated as partnerships for U.S. federal and applicable state income tax purposes and are not separately subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes. EQM's, Eureka Midstream Holdings' and the Midstream Joint Venture's income is included in the Company's pre-tax income; however, the Company does not record income tax expense on income attributable to noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream Holdings and the Midstream Joint Venture, which reduces the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax income and increases the effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax losses.\n98\nTable of Contents\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities and are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of such temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. When evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance should be established, the Company exercises judgment on whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. To determine whether a valuation allowance is needed, the Company considers all available evidence, both positive and negative, including carrybacks, tax planning strategies, reversals of deferred tax assets and liabilities and forecasted future taxable income.\n \nIn accounting for uncertainty of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, the Company uses a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement. The recognition threshold requires the Company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. If it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained, the Company measures and recognizes the tax position at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than \n50\n% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. To determine the amount of financial statement benefit recorded for uncertain tax positions, the Company considers the amounts and probabilities of outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\n See Note 9.\nInsurance.\n The Company maintains insurance to cover traditional insurable risks such as general liability, workers compensation, auto liability, environmental liability, property damage, business interruption, fiduciary liability, director and officers' liability and other risks. These policies may be subject to deductible or retention amounts, coverage limitations and exclusions. The Company was previously self-insured for certain material losses related to general liability, workers compensation and environmental liability; however, the Company now maintains insurance for such losses arising on or after November 12, 2020. In addition, in conjunction with the Equitrans Midstream Merger, the Company assumed a self-insured retention reserve for certain material losses related to excess liability and environmental liability for losses arising before December 20, 2024. The Company also assumed with the Equitrans Midstream Merger a \n10\n% co-insurance related to material losses on property insurance coverage. Prospectively, coverage is included in the Company's insurance programs that do not have high self-insured and co-insurance amounts. Reserves are recorded on an undiscounted basis using analyses of historical data and, where applicable, actuarial estimates, which represent estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date. The reserves are reviewed by the Company quarterly and, where applicable, by independent actuaries annually.\nAsset Retirement Obligations. \nThe Company accrues a liability for asset retirement obligations based on an estimate of the amount and timing of settlement. For oil and gas wells, the fair value of the Company's plugging and abandonment obligations is recorded at the time the obligation is incurred, which is typically at the time the well is spud. Upon initial recognition of an asset retirement obligation, the Company increases the carrying amount of the long-lived asset by the same amount as the liability. Over time, the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value through charges to depreciation and depletion expense. The initial capitalized costs are depleted over the useful lives of the related assets.\nThe Company's asset retirement obligations related to the abandonment of oil and gas producing facilities include reclaiming well pads, reclaiming water impoundments, plugging wells and dismantling related structures. In addition, the Company records asset retirement obligations on its storage wells with known plugging timelines. Estimates are based on historical experience of plugging and abandoning wells and reclaiming or disposing other assets and estimated remaining lives of the wells and assets.\nThe Company is under no legal or contractual obligation to restore or dismantle its gathering and transmission pipeline assets upon abandonment. In addition, the Company is responsible for the operation and maintenance of its gathering and transmission assets and intends to continue such operation and maintenance so long as supply and demand for natural gas exists. As the Company expects supply and demand for natural gas to exist into the foreseeable future, the Company has not recorded asset retirement obligations for its gathering and transmission pipeline assets.\n99\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending carrying amounts of the Company's asset retirement obligations included in other liabilities and credits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(Thousands)\nBalance at January 1\n$\n911,057\n \n$\n732,803\n \nAccretion expense\n68,501\n \n47,700\n \nLiabilities incurred\n21,587\n \n10,515\n \nLiabilities settled\n(\n66,729\n)\n(\n33,938\n)\nLiabilities assumed in acquisitions\n45,847\n \n64,424\n \nLiabilities removed in divestitures\n(\n28,701\n)\n(\n6,480\n)\nChange in estimates (a)\n52,008\n \n96,033\n \nBalance at December 31\n$\n1,003,570\n \n$\n911,057\n \n(a)\nDuring 2024, the Company recorded changes in estimates attributable primarily to increased plugging costs. During 2023, the Company recorded changes in estimates attributable primarily to inflation on estimated plugging costs.\nThe Company does not have assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling its asset retirement obligations. The Company operates in several states that have implemented expanded requirements for settling asset retirement obligations. This has resulted in the Company's use of additional materials during the plugging process, which has increased the estimated cost for plugging horizontal and conventional wells.\nRegulatory Accounting. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company consolidates the Midstream Joint Venture, which holds Equitrans, L.P., which owns and operates the Midstream Joint Venture's wholly-owned FERC-regulated transmission and storage assets.\nThrough the rate-setting process, rate regulation allows recovery of costs to provide regulated services plus an allowed return on invested capital. Regulatory accounting allows deferral of costs and income as regulated assets and liabilities when it is probable that such costs and income is subject to recovery in future periods. Such deferred amounts are then recognized in Equitrans, L.P.'s Statement of Operations in the period in which the underlying costs and income are reflected in the rates charged by Equitrans, L.P. to shippers and operators. Equitrans, L.P. expects to continue to be subject to rate regulation.\nThe following table presents Equitrans, L.P.'s regulated operating revenues and expenses included in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations for the period from July 22, 2024 to December 31, 2024.\n \nJuly 22, 2024 to December 31, 2024\n \n(Thousands)\nOperating revenues\n$\n218,569\n \nOperating expenses\n$\n78,908\n \nThe following table presents Equitrans, L.P.'s regulated property, plant and equipment included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024.\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \n(Thousands)\nProperty, plant and equipment\n$\n2,667,352\n \nLess: Accumulated depreciation\n30,027\n \nNet property, plant and equipment\n$\n2,637,325\n \n100\nTable of Contents\nThe Company includes Equitrans, L.P.'s regulated assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Equitrans, L.P.'s regulated assets are reported in other assets, and Equitrans, L.P.'s regulated liabilities are reported in other liabilities and credits. \nThe following table summarizes Equitrans, L.P.'s regulated assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024.\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \n(Thousands)\nRegulated assets:\nDeferred taxes (a)\n$\n142,757\n \nOther recoverable costs (b)\n23,182\n \nTotal regulated assets\n$\n165,939\n \nRegulated liabilities:\nDeferred taxes (a)\n$\n8,534\n \nOngoing postretirement benefits other than pension and other reimbursable costs (c)\n20,158\n \nTotal regulated liabilities\n$\n28,692\n \n(a)\nThe regulated asset from deferred taxes is related primarily to a historical deferred income tax position as well as taxes on the equity component of allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC). The regulated liability from deferred taxes is related to the revaluation of a historical difference between the regulatory and tax bases of regulated property, plant and equipment. Equitrans, L.P. expects to recover the amortization of the deferred income tax positions ratably over the depreciable lives of the underlying assets. In addition, Equitrans, L.P. expects to recover the taxes on the equity component of AFUDC through future rates over the depreciable lives of the underlying long-lived assets.\n(b)\nThe regulated asset from other recoverable costs is related primarily to costs associated with Equitrans, L.P.'s asset retirement obligations, which Equitrans, L.P. expects to continue to recover over the next \n9.5\n years, and costs associated with a legacy postretirement benefits plan, which Equitrans, L.P. expects to continue to recover over the next \n7.5\n years.\n(c)\nEquitrans, L.P. defers costs for other postretirement benefits plans, which are subject to recovery in approved rates. The related regulated liability reflects lower cumulative actuarial expenses than the amounts recovered through rates. Equitrans, L.P. expects to continue to recover costs as long as the existing recourse rates provide for recovery.\nRevenue Recognition. \nFor information on revenue recognition from contracts with customers, see Note 3. For information on gains and losses on derivative commodity instruments, see Note 4.\n \nTransportation and Processing. \nCosts incurred to gather, process and transport gas produced by the Company to market sales points are recorded as transportation and processing costs in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. The Company markets some transportation for resale. These costs, which are not incurred to transport gas produced by the Company, are reflected as a deduction from net marketing services and other revenues.\nShare-based Compensation. \nSee Note 13 for a discussion of the Company's share-based compensation plans.\nOther Operating Expenses. \nThe following table summarizes the Company's other operating expenses.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Thousands)\nTransaction costs\n$\n309,419\n \n$\n56,263\n \n$\n14,185\n \nChanges in legal and environmental reserves, including settlements\n16,271\n \n9,342\n \n$\n30,394\n \nOther\n24,174\n \n18,438\n \n12,752\n \nTotal other operating expenses\n$\n349,864\n \n$\n84,043\n \n$\n57,331\n \nDefined Contribution Plan and Other Postretirement Benefits Plan. \nThe Company recognized expense related to its defined contribution plan of $\n14.5\n million, $\n9.0\n million and $\n7.8\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

In addition, this ASU enhances interim disclosure requirements, clarifies circumstances in which an entity can disclose multiple segment measures of profit or loss and provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 in the fourth quarter of 2024. See Note 2 for segments disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,\n to improve income tax disclosure requirements. Under this ASU, public business entities must annually (1) disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and (2) provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\n, to improve the disclosures about a public business entity's expenses and address requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses (including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, amortization and depletion) in commonly presented expense captions (such as cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expense; and research and development). This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The requirements should be applied prospectively with the option for retrospective application. The Company is evaluating the impact ASU 2024-03 will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.\nSubsequent Events.\n The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date of the financial statement issuance.\n \n102\nTable of Contents\n2.    \nFinancial Information by Business Segment\nPrior to the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, the Company's operations consisted of \none\n reportable segment. Historically, the Company administered all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments and measured financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area-by-area basis.\nAs a result of the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, the Company adjusted its internal reporting structure and the Company's chief operating decision maker, Toby Rice, President and Chief Executive Officer, changed the manner in which he measures financial performance and allocates resources to incorporate the gathering and transmission assets acquired by the Company in the Equitrans Midstream Merger. Hence, the Company's operations expanded to comprise \nthree\n discrete operating segments reflective of its \nthree\n lines of business consisting of Production, Gathering and Transmission. \nThe Company's Production segment comprises the Company's natural gas, NGLs and oil extraction, development and production business and supporting ventures, such as water operations. The Company's Gathering segment owns and operates the Company's gathering system, which has extensive overlap with the Company's Production segment operations, and processing facility. The Company's Transmission segment operates the Company's FERC-regulated, interstate transmission and storage system, which has multiple interconnect points to other interstate pipelines and local distribution companies. In addition, the Transmission segment holds the Company's investment in the MVP Joint Venture (defined in Note 11). Certain amounts, including cash and cash equivalents, debt, income taxes and other amounts related to the Company's headquarters function as well as amounts related to the Company's energy transition initiatives are managed on a consolidated basis and, as such, have not been allocated to the Company's segments and have been presented as \"Other.\"\nAs a result of the Company's change in reportable segments from \none\n reportable segment to \nthree\n reportable segments, certain prior period amounts have been recast.\nThe accounting policies of the Company's segments are the same as those described in Note 1.\nFor all of the Company's segments, the chief operating decision maker uses operating income as the profitability metric to measure financial performance and allocate resources. The chief operating decision maker considers actual-to-forecast variances for operating income when allocating capital and personnel to the Company's segments and compares operating income and return on assets of each segment to assess segment performance. In addition to operating income, the chief operating decision maker reviews equity earnings recognized from, and the carrying value of the Company's investment in, the MVP Joint Venture when measuring the financial performance of, and allocating resources to, the Company's Transmission segment.\nSubstantially all of the Company's operating revenues and assets are generated and located in the United States.\n103\nTable of Contents\nTotal segment operating income. \nThe follow tables present the Company's profit and loss metric of operating income by segment.\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nProduction\nGathering\nTransmission\nTotal Segment\nIntersegment eliminations and other\nEQT Corporation\n(Thousands)\nOperating revenues:\nSales of natural gas, natural gas liquids and oil\n$\n4,934,366\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4,934,366\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4,934,366\n \nGain (loss) on derivatives\n67,880\n \n(\n16,763\n)\n—\n \n51,117\n \n—\n \n51,117\n \nPipeline, net marketing services and other\n7,587\n \n766,463\n \n218,293\n \n992,343\n \n(\n704,517\n)\n287,826\n \nTotal operating revenues\n5,009,833\n \n749,700\n \n218,293\n \n5,977,826\n \n(\n704,517\n)\n5,273,309\n \nOperating expenses (a):\nTransportation and processing\n2,619,710\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,619,710\n \n(\n704,094\n)\n1,915,616\n \nProduction\n377,007\n \n—\n \n—\n \n377,007\n \n—\n \n377,007\n \nOperating and maintenance\n—\n \n89,897\n \n20,496\n \n110,393\n \n—\n \n110,393\n \nExploration\n2,735\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,735\n \n—\n \n2,735\n \nSelling, general and administrative (b)\n244,450\n \n38,837\n \n17,183\n \n300,470\n \n36,254\n \n336,724\n \nDepreciation, depletion and amortization\n2,016,670\n \n89,513\n \n39,406\n \n2,145,589\n \n16,761\n \n2,162,350\n \n(Gain) loss on sale/exchange of long-lived assets\n(\n764,431\n)\n(\n22\n)\n409\n \n(\n764,044\n)\n—\n \n(\n764,044\n)\nImpairment and expiration of leases\n97,368\n \n—\n \n—\n \n97,368\n \n—\n \n97,368\n \nOther operating expenses (c)\n12,696\n \n—\n \n—\n \n12,696\n \n337,168\n \n349,864\n \nTotal operating expenses\n4,606,205\n \n218,225\n \n77,494\n \n4,901,924\n \n(\n313,911\n)\n4,588,013\n \nOperating income (loss)\n$\n403,628\n \n$\n531,475\n \n$\n140,799\n \n$\n1,075,902\n \n$\n(\n390,606\n)\n$\n685,296\n \n(a)\nThe significant expense categories and amounts presented align with information that is regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker.\n(b)\nSelling, general and administrative expense incurred prior to the Equitrans Midstream Merger closing date was not recast as the necessary information is not available and the cost to develop such information would be excessive.\n(c)\nCorporate other operating expenses consisted primarily of transaction costs related to the Equitrans Midstream Merger.

The Consolidated GGA is effective through December 31, 2035 and will renew annually thereafter unless terminated by the parties thereto.\nThe Consolidated GGA provided for cash bonus payments (the Henry Hub Cash Bonus) conditioned upon the quarterly average of the NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas settlement price exceeding certain price thresholds to be payable by the EQT Party to the EQM Affiliate during each quarter beginning with the first day of the quarter in which the MVP In-Service Date (as defined in the Consolidated GGA) occurs and ending on the earlier of \n36\n months thereafter or December 31, 2024. Upon commencement of long-term firm capacity obligations, the MVP In-Service Date occurred on July 1, 2024.\nThe Company's Production and Gathering segments recorded their respective derivative liability and asset and any gain or loss related to the Henry Hub Cash Bonus. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the EQT Party paid $\n4.2\n million to the EQM Affiliate, and, as of December 31, 2024, the derivative related to the Henry Hub Cash Bonus was settled. As of December 31, 2023, the derivative related to the Henry Hub Cash Bonus had a fair value of approximately $\n48\n million. The fair value of the derivative asset and liability related to the Henry Hub Cash Bonus was based on significant inputs that are interpolated from observable market data and, as such, was a Level 2 fair value measurement. See Note 5 for a description of the fair value hierarchy.\n108\nTable of Contents\n3.    \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nSales of natural gas, NGLs and oil. \nUnder the Company's natural gas, NGLs and oil sales contracts, the Company generally considers the delivery of each unit (MMBtu or Bbl) to be a separate performance obligation that is satisfied upon delivery. These contracts typically require payment within \n25\n days of the end of the calendar month in which the commodity is delivered. A significant number of these contracts contain variable consideration because the payment terms refer to market prices at future delivery dates. In these situations, the Company has not identified a standalone selling price because the terms of the variable payments relate specifically to the Company's efforts to satisfy the performance obligations. Other contracts, such as fixed price contracts or contracts with a fixed differential to New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) or index prices, contain fixed consideration. The Company allocates the fixed consideration to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, which requires judgment from management. For these contracts, the Company generally concludes that the fixed price or fixed differentials in the contracts are representative of the standalone selling price.\nBased on management's judgment, the performance obligations for the sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil are satisfied at a point in time because the customer obtains control and legal title of the asset when the natural gas, NGLs or oil is delivered to the designated sales point.\nThe sales of natural gas, NGLs and oil presented in the Statements of Consolidated Operations represent the Company's share of revenues net of royalties and exclude revenue interests owned by others. When selling natural gas, NGLs and oil on behalf of royalty or working interest owners, the Company acts as an agent and, thus, reports the revenue on a net basis.\nPipeline revenue. \nThe Company provides gathering, transmission and storage services under firm and interruptible service contracts.\nFirm service contracts generally require the customer to pay a firm reservation fee, which is a fixed, monthly charge to reserve an agreed upon amount of pipeline or storage capacity regardless of whether the customer uses the capacity. Under its firm service contracts, the Company has a stand-ready obligation to provide the firm service over the life of the contract. The performance obligation for revenue from firm reservation fees is satisfied over time as the pipeline capacity is made available to the customer. As such, the Company recognizes firm reservation fee revenue evenly over the contract period using a time-elapsed output method to measure progress.\nVolumetric-based fees, which are charges based on the volume of gas gathered, transported or stored, can also be charged under firm service contracts for each firm contracted volume gathered, transported or stored as well as for volumes gathered, transported or stored in excess of the firm contracted volume so long as capacity exists.\nInterruptible service contracts require the customer to pay volumetric-based fees and generally do not guarantee access to the pipeline or storage facility.\nThe performance obligation for revenue from volumetric-based fees is generally satisfied upon the Company's monthly invoicing to the customer for volumes gathered, transported or stored during the month. The amount invoiced generally corresponds directly to the value of the Company's performance to date as the customer obtains value as each volume is gathered, transported or stored. Gathering service contracts are invoiced on a \none-month\n lag, with payment typically due within \n21\n days of the invoice date. Revenue for gathering services provided but not yet invoiced is estimated based on contract data, preliminary throughput and allocation measurements on a monthly basis. Transmission and storage service contracts are invoiced at the end of each calendar month, with payment typically due within \n10\n days of the invoice date. \nFor both firm reservation and volumetric-based fee revenues, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price. Any excess of consideration received over revenue recognized results in the deferral of those amounts until future periods based on a units-of-production or straight-line methodology as these methods align with the consumption of services provided to the customer. The units-of-production methodology requires the use of judgment to estimate future production volumes.\nCertain of the Company's gathering service agreements are structured with MVCs, which specify minimum quantities that the customer will be charged regardless of whether such quantities are gathered. Revenue is recognized for MVCs when the performance obligation has been met, which is the earlier of when the gas is gathered or when the likelihood that the customer will be able to meet its MVC is remote. If a customer fails to meet its MVC for a specified period (thus not exercising all the contractual rights to gathering services within the specified period), the customer is obligated to pay a contractually-determined fee based on the shortfall between actual volume gathered and the MVC.\n109\nTable of Contents\nDisaggregated revenue information.\n The table below provides disaggregated information on the Company's revenues.

The Company uses derivative commodity instruments to hedge its cash flows from sales of produced natural gas and NGLs. The overall objective of the Company's hedging program is to protect cash flows from undue exposure to the risk of changing commodity prices.\nThe derivative commodity instruments used by the Company are primarily swap, collar and option agreements. These agreements may result in payments to, or receipt of payments from, counterparties based on the differential between two prices for the commodity. The Company uses these agreements to hedge its NYMEX and basis exposure. The Company may also use other contractual agreements when executing its commodity hedging strategy. The Company typically enters into over the counter (OTC) derivative commodity instruments with financial institutions, and the creditworthiness of all counterparties is regularly monitored.\nThe Company does not designate any of its derivative instruments as cash flow hedges; therefore, all changes in fair value of the Company's derivative instruments are recognized in operating revenues in gain (loss) on derivatives in the Statements of Consolidated Operations. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value on a gross basis. These derivative instruments are reported as either current assets or current liabilities due to their highly liquid nature. The Company can net settle its derivative instruments at any time.\n111\nTable of Contents\nContracts that result in physical delivery of a commodity expected to be sold by the Company in the normal course of business are generally designated as normal sales and are exempt from derivative accounting. Contracts that result in the physical receipt or delivery of a commodity but are not designated or do not meet all of the criteria to qualify for the normal purchase and normal sale scope exception are subject to derivative accounting.\nThe Company's OTC derivative instruments generally require settlement in cash. The Company also enters into exchange traded derivative commodity instruments that are generally settled with offsetting positions. Settlements of derivative commodity instruments are reported as a component of cash flows from operating activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.\nWith respect to the derivative commodity instruments held by the Company, the Company hedged portions of its expected sales of production and portions of its basis exposure covering approximately \n2,189\n billion cubic feet (Bcf) of natural gas and \n2,562\n thousand barrels (Mbbl) of NGLs as of December 31, 2024 and \n2,045\n Bcf of natural gas and \n1,049\n Mbbl of NGLs as of December 31, 2023. The open positions at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 had maturities extending through December 2027.\nCertain of the Company's OTC derivative instrument contracts provide that, if EQT's credit rating assigned by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. (Moody's), S&P Global Ratings (S&P) or Fitch Ratings Service (Fitch) is below the agreed-upon credit rating threshold (typically, below investment grade) and if the associated derivative liability exceeds the agreed-upon dollar threshold for such credit rating, the counterparty to such contract can require the Company to deposit collateral. Similarly, if such counterparty's credit rating assigned by Moody's, S&P or Fitch is below the agreed-upon credit rating threshold and if the associated derivative liability exceeds the agreed-upon dollar threshold for such credit rating, the Company can require the counterparty to deposit collateral with the Company. Such collateral can be up to \n100\n% of the derivative liability. Investment grade refers to the quality of a company's credit as assessed by one or more credit rating agencies. To be considered investment grade, a company must be rated \"Baa3\" or higher by Moody's, \"BBB–\" or higher by S&P and \"BBB–\" or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings is considered non-investment grade. As of December 31, 2024, EQT's senior notes were rated \"Baa3\" by Moody's, \"BBB–\" by S&P and \"BBB–\" by Fitch.\nWhen the net fair value of any of the Company's OTC derivative instrument contracts represents a liability to the Company that is in excess of the agreed-upon dollar threshold for the Company's then-applicable credit rating, the counterparty has the right to require the Company to remit funds as a margin deposit in an amount equal to the portion of the derivative liability that is in excess of the dollar threshold amount. The Company records these deposits as a current asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate fair value of the Company's OTC derivative instruments with credit rating risk-related contingent features in a net liability position was $\n61.9\n million and $\n6.4\n million, respectively, for which \nno\n deposits were required or recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWhen the net fair value of any of the Company's OTC derivative instrument contracts represents an asset to the Company that is in excess of the agreed-upon dollar threshold for the counterparty's then-applicable credit rating, the Company has the right to require the counterparty to remit funds as a margin deposit in an amount equal to the portion of the derivative asset that is in excess of the dollar threshold amount. The Company records these deposits as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were \nno\n such deposits recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWhen the Company enters into exchange traded natural gas contracts, exchanges may require the Company to remit funds to the corresponding broker as good faith deposits to guard against the risks associated with changing market conditions. The Company is required to make such deposits based on an established initial margin requirement and the net liability position, if any, of the fair value of the associated contracts. The Company records these deposits as a current asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When the fair value of such contracts is in a net asset position, the broker may remit funds to the Company. The Company records these deposits as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The initial margin requirements are established by the exchanges based on the price, volatility and the time to expiration of the contract. The margin requirements are subject to change at the exchanges' discretion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were $\n87.0\n million and $\n13.0\n million, respectively, of such deposits recorded as a current asset in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n112\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has netting agreements with financial institutions and its brokers that permit net settlement of gross commodity derivative assets against gross commodity derivative liabilities. \nThe table below summarizes the impact of netting agreements and margin deposits on gross derivative assets and liabilities.\nGross derivative instruments recorded in the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nDerivative instruments\nsubject to master\nnetting agreements\nMargin requirements with\ncounterparties\nNet derivative\ninstruments\nDecember 31, 2024\n(Thousands)\nAsset derivative instruments, at fair value\n$\n143,581\n \n$\n(\n117,350\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n26,231\n \nLiability derivative instruments, at fair value\n446,519\n \n(\n117,350\n)\n(\n86,975\n)\n242,194\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nAsset derivative instruments, at fair value\n$\n978,634\n \n$\n(\n112,203\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n866,431\n \nLiability derivative instruments, at fair value\n186,363\n \n(\n112,203\n)\n(\n13,017\n)\n61,143\n \n5.    \nFair Value Measurements\n \nThe Company records its financial instruments, which are principally derivative instruments, at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company estimates the fair value of its financial instruments using quoted market prices when available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is based on models that use market-based parameters, including forward curves, discount rates, volatilities and nonperformance risk, as inputs. Nonperformance risk considers the effect of the Company's credit standing on the fair value of liabilities and the effect of the counterparty's credit standing on the fair value of assets. The Company estimates nonperformance risk by analyzing publicly available market information, including a comparison of the yield on debt instruments with credit ratings similar to EQT's or the counterparty's credit rating and the yield on a risk-free instrument. \nThe Company has categorized its assets and liabilities recorded at fair value into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). Assets and liabilities that use Level 2 inputs primarily include the Company's swap, collar and option agreements.\nExchange traded commodity swaps have Level 1 inputs. The fair value of the commodity swaps with Level 2 inputs is based on standard industry income approach models that use significant observable inputs, including, but not limited to, NYMEX natural gas forward curves, SOFR-based discount rates, basis forward curves and NGLs forward curves. The Company's collars and options are valued using standard industry income approach option models. The significant observable inputs used by the option pricing models include NYMEX forward curves, natural gas volatilities and SOFR-based discount rates.\nThe table below summarizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n \n \nFair value measurements at reporting date using:\nGross derivative instruments recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nQuoted prices in active markets \nfor identical assets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant other \nobservable inputs\n(Level 2)\nSignificant unobservable inputs\n(Level 3)\nDecember 31, 2024\n(Thousands)\nAsset derivative instruments, at fair value\n$\n143,581\n \n$\n50,300\n \n$\n93,281\n \n$\n—\n \nLiability derivative instruments, at fair value\n446,519\n \n81,074\n \n365,445\n \n—\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nAsset derivative instruments, at fair value\n$\n978,634\n \n$\n66,302\n \n$\n912,332\n \n$\n—\n \nLiability derivative instruments, at fair value\n186,363\n \n42,218\n \n144,145\n \n—\n \n113\nTable of Contents\nThe carrying value of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. The carrying value of borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility, Eureka's revolving credit facility and (prior to its redemption) the Term Loan Facility (defined in Note 10) approximates fair value as each facility's interest rate is based on prevailing market rates. The Company considers all of these fair values to be Level 1 fair value measurements.\nThe Company estimates the fair value of its senior notes using established fair value methodology. Because not all of the Company's senior notes are actively traded, their fair value is a Level 2 fair value measurement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company's senior notes had a fair value of approximately $\n8.8\n billion and $\n4.9\n billion, respectively, and a carrying value of approximately $\n8.9\n billion and $\n4.5\n billion, respectively, inclusive of any current portion. See Note 10 for further discussion of the Company's debt.\nUpon the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, EQT's note payable to EQM became an intercompany transaction on a consolidated basis and, as such, was effectively settled on July 22, 2024. See Note 6. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of EQT's note payable to EQM was estimated using an income approach model with a market-based discount rate and was considered a Level 3 fair value measurement. As of December 31, 2023, EQT's note payable to EQM had a fair value and carrying value of approximately $\n91\n million and $\n88\n million, respectively, inclusive of any current portion.\nThe Company recognizes transfers between Levels as of the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer. There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during the periods presented.\nSee Note 1 for a discussion of the fair value measurement and impairment of the Company's property, plant equipment. In addition, see Note 1 for a discussion of impairment of the Company's contract asset, investments in unconsolidated entities, net intangible assets and goodwill. See Note 1 for a discussion of the fair value measurement of the Company's asset retirement obligations. See Note 2 for a discussion of the fair value measurement of the Henry Hub Cash Bonus.

In addition, in connection with the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, the Company paid an aggregate of $\n79.5\n million of equity consideration to employees of Equitrans Midstream who did not continue with the Company upon the Equitrans Midstream Merger closing date.\n114\nTable of Contents\nImmediately prior to the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, on July 22, 2024, using borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility, the Company paid $\n685.3\n million to effect the purchase and redemption of all of the issued and outstanding Series A Perpetual Convertible Preferred Shares, no par value, of Equitrans Midstream (the Equitrans Midstream preferred stock).\nImmediately following the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, on July 22, 2024, EQM repaid all of its outstanding obligations under EQM's revolving credit facility using cash on hand and cash contributions from EQT, and, thereafter, EQM terminated its revolving credit facility. See Note 10.\nUpon completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, the pre-existing contractual relationships between the Company, as producer, and Equitrans Midstream, as gathering and transmission services provider, are treated as intercompany transactions on a consolidated basis and, as such, were effectively settled on July 22, 2024. Likewise, upon completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, EQT's note payable to EQM became an intercompany transaction on a consolidated basis and, as such, was effectively settled on July 22, 2024.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized $\n304.8\n million of transaction costs related to the Equitrans Midstream Merger in \nother operating expenses in the Statement of Consolidated Operations\n. Included in such transaction costs was severance and other termination benefits and stock-based compensation costs of $\n165.4\n million, of which $\n60.8\n million was cash and $\n104.6\n million was non-cash.\n115\nTable of Contents\nAllocation of Purchase Price\n. The Equitrans Midstream Merger was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method. The table below summarizes the preliminary purchase price and estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of July 22, 2024 with the excess of purchase price over estimated fair value of the identified net assets recognized as goodwill. Certain information necessary to complete the purchase price allocation is not yet available, including, but not limited to, final appraisals of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and final income tax computations. \nThe Company expects to complete the purchase price allocation once it has received all necessary information, at which time the value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be revised if necessary.\nPreliminary Purchase Price Allocation\n(Thousands)\nConsideration:\nEquity\n$\n5,548,608\n \nCash (paid in lieu of fractional shares)\n29\n \nRedemption of Equitrans Midstream preferred stock\n685,337\n \nSettlement of pre-existing relationships\n(\n239,741\n)\nTotal consideration\n$\n5,994,233\n \nFair value of assets acquired:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n58,767\n \nAccounts receivable, net\n82,072\n \nIncome tax receivable\n2,142\n \nPrepaid expenses and other\n22,048\n \nProperty, plant and equipment\n9,379,642\n \nInvestments in unconsolidated entities\n3,363,336\n \nNet intangible assets\n200,000\n \nOther assets\n249,846\n \nNoncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries\n(\n162,993\n)\nAmount attributable to assets acquired\n$\n13,194,860\n \nFair value of liabilities assumed:\nCurrent portion of debt\n$\n699,837\n \nAccounts payable\n65,006\n \nAccrued interest\n47,996\n \nOther current liabilities\n70,951\n \nRevolving credit facility borrowings\n1,035,000\n \nSenior notes\n6,273,941\n \nDeferred income taxes\n935,106\n \nOther liabilities and credits\n152,271\n \nAmount attributable to liabilities assumed\n$\n9,280,108\n \nGoodwill\n$\n2,079,481\n \n116\nTable of Contents\nThe fair value of Equitrans Midstream's property, plant and equipment, which primarily includes gathering, transmission and storage systems and water infrastructure assets, and Equitrans Midstream's equity method investment in the MVP Joint Venture was measured using a combination of a cost and income approach based on inputs that are not observable in the market and, as such, are Level 3 fair value measurements. Significant inputs to the valuation of Equitrans Midstream's property, plant and equipment and investment in the MVP Joint Venture include replacement costs for similar assets, relative age of the assets, any potential economic or functional obsolescence associated with the assets, future revenue estimates and future operating cost assumptions and estimated weighted average costs of capital.\nThe fair value of the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream Holdings was calculated using the noncontrolling interest ownership percentage and the enterprise value of Eureka Midstream Holdings, which was measured using a combination of a cost and income approach based on inputs that are not observable in the market and, as such, is a Level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs to the valuation of the noncontrolling interest in Eureka Midstream Holdings include replacement costs for similar assets, relative age of the assets, any potential economic or functional obsolescence associated with the assets, future revenue estimates, future operating cost assumptions and estimated weighted average cost of capital.\nAs part of the preliminary purchase price allocation, the Company identified intangible assets related to certain of Equitrans Midstream's transmission services contracts. The fair value of the identified intangible assets was determined using the income approach based on inputs that are not observable in the market and, as such, is a Level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs to the valuation of the identified intangible assets include future revenue estimates, future cost assumptions, estimated contract renewals, a discount rate assumption and an estimated required rate of return on the assets. The identified intangible assets are amortized over their useful life of \n15\n years on a straight-line basis, which reflects the pattern in which the Company expects to consume the economic benefits of the assets. The estimated annual amortization expense for the intangible assets is $\n13.3\n million for each of the next \n5\n years.\nThe fair value of EQM's senior notes was measured using established fair value methodology. Because not all of EQM's senior notes are actively traded, their fair value is a Level 2 fair value measurement. The difference between the fair value and principal amount of the assumed senior notes is amortized over the remaining life of the debt. The unamortized amount is presented as a reduction of debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Because the carrying value of borrowings under EQM's revolving credit facility and Eureka's revolving credit facility approximated their respective fair value (as each facility's interest rate is based on prevailing market rates), the Company considers their fair values to be Level 1 fair value measurements.\nGoodwill is attributable to the Company's qualitative assumptions of long-term value that the Equitrans Midstream Merger creates for EQT shareholders. Of the total goodwill, the Company attributed $\n1.2\n billion to the vertical integration of the business, including from the elimination of contracted transportation costs with Equitrans Midstream as the Company is unable to recognize intangible assets related to its significant long-term customer contracts with Equitrans Midstream as such contracts became intercompany transactions upon the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger. The Company allocated this amount of total goodwill to its Transmission segment. In addition, the Company attributed $\n0.9\n billion of total goodwill to additional deferred tax liabilities that arose from the differences between the fair value and tax bases of preliminary purchase price allocation that carried over from Equitrans Midstream to the Company. Given the income tax characteristics of EQM (the entity that holds the gathering and transmission operations acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger) the Company presents this amount of total goodwill as \"Other\" for segments reporting. See Note 2. Differences between the preliminary purchase price allocation and the final purchase price allocation may change the amount of goodwill recognized.\nIn conjunction with the Equitrans Midstream Merger, as of the Equitrans Midstream Merger closing date, the Company had unamortized carryover tax basis of $\n647.2\n million of tax deductible goodwill.\nSee Note 5 for a description of the fair value hierarchy.\n117\nTable of Contents\nPost-Acquisition Operating Results\n. \nThe table below summarizes amounts contributed by the assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger, inclusive of intercompany eliminations, to the Company's consolidated results for the period beginning on July 22, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2024.\nJuly 22, 2024 through December 31, 2024\n(Thousands)\nLoss on derivatives\n$\n(\n16,763\n)\nPipeline, net marketing services and other\n274,646\n \nTotal operating revenues\n$\n257,883\n \nNet loss (a)\n$\n(\n136,946\n)\nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n12,879\n \nNet loss attributable to EQT Corporation\n$\n(\n149,825\n)\n(a)\nNet loss includes $\n280.6\n million of transaction costs related to the Equitrans Midstream Merger. \nUnaudited Pro Forma Information\n.

The NEPA Gathering System Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition, and, as such, its purchase price was allocated to property, plant and equipment.\n118\nTable of Contents\nTug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition\nOn August 22, 2023, the Company completed its acquisition (the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition) of the upstream assets from THQ Appalachia I, LLC and the gathering and processing assets from THQ-XcL Holdings I, LLC through the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of each of THQ Appalachia I Midco, LLC and THQ-XcL Holdings I Midco, LLC. The purchase price for the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition consisted of \n49,599,796\n shares of EQT common stock and approximately $\n2.4\n billion in cash, subject to customary post-closing adjustments.\nThe Company accounted for the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition as a business combination using the acquisition method. The Company completed the purchase price allocation for the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition during the first quarter of 2024. The purchase accounting adjustments recorded in 2024 were not material.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized $\n4.4\n million and $\n56.3\n million, respectively, of transaction costs related to the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition in other operating expenses in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\n2022 Asset Acquisition\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company completed its acquisition (the 2022 Asset Acquisition) of approximately \n4,600\n net Marcellus acres in Northeast Pennsylvania for a total purchase price of approximately $\n56\n million. The 2022 Asset Acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition, and, as such, the purchase price was allocated to property, plant and equipment.\n7.    \nNEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestitures\nFirst NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture\n. On May 31, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture (the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture) of an undivided \n40\n% interest in the Company's non-operated natural gas assets in Northeast Pennsylvania with a carrying amount of approximately $\n523\n million to Equinor USA Onshore Properties Inc. and its affiliates (collectively, the Equinor Parties). The carrying value was composed of approximately $\n549\n million of property, plant and equipment, approximately $\n6\n million of other current liabilities and approximately $\n20\n million of other liabilities and credits. In exchange, as consideration, the Company received from the Equinor Parties cash of $\n500\n million, subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments, certain upstream assets and the remaining \n16.25\n% equity interest in the NEPA Gathering System. The total fair value of consideration received, net of liabilities assumed, was approximately $\n832\n million, subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments, and included $\n413\n million of property, plant and equipment.\nAs a result of the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $\n299\n million in \n(gain) loss on sale/exchange of long-lived assets\n in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The gain was calculated as the carrying value of the divested assets less the fair value of consideration received, net of liabilities assumed, and approximately $\n10\n million of divestiture costs incurred. The long-lived assets divested and received and resulting gain are reported in the Company's Production segment. The Company used cash proceeds from the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture to partly fund EQT's redemption of its \n6.125\n% senior notes.\nThe fair values of the developed and undeveloped natural gas properties received as consideration for the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture were measured using discounted cash flow valuation techniques based on inputs that are not observable in the market and, as such, is a Level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs include future commodity prices, projections of estimated quantities of reserves, estimated future rates of production, projected reserve recovery factors, timing and amount of future development operating costs and a weighted average cost of capital as well as future development plans from a market participant perspective with respect to undeveloped properties.\nThe fair value of the interest in the NEPA Gathering System received as consideration for the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture was measured using the cost approach based on inputs that are not observable in the market and, as such, is a Level 3 fair value measurement. Significant inputs include replacement cost for similar assets, relative age of the assets and potential economic or functional obsolescence.\nSee Note 5 for a description of the fair value hierarchy.\n119\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, subsequent to the completion of the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, the Company and the Equinor Parties entered into a gas buy-back agreement with respect to the assets received by the Company as consideration for the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, whereby the Equinor Parties agreed to purchase a specified amount of natural gas from the Company through the first quarter of 2028.\nSecond NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture\n. On December 31, 2024, the Company completed the divestiture (the Second NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, and, together with the First NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, the NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestitures) of the remaining undivided \n60\n% interest in the Company's non-operated natural gas assets in Northeast Pennsylvania with a carrying amount of approximately $\n772\n million to the Equinor Parties. The carrying value was composed of approximately $\n812\n million of property, plant and equipment, approximately $\n9\n million of other current liabilities and approximately $\n31\n million of other liabilities and credits. In exchange, as consideration, the Company received from the Equinor Parties cash of $\n1.25\n billion, subject to customary post-closing purchase price adjustments and transaction costs.\nAs a result of the Second NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture, the Company recognized a gain of approximately $\n463\n million in \n(gain) loss on sale/exchange of long-lived assets\n in the Statement of Consolidated Operations. The gain was calculated as the carrying value of the divested assets less the consideration received and approximately $\n7\n million of divestiture costs incurred. The long-lived assets divested and resulting gain are reported in the Company's Production segment. The Company used cash proceeds from the Second NEPA Non-Operated Asset Divestiture to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility.\n8.    \nThe Midstream Joint Venture Transaction\nOn September 24, 2024, the Company formed PipeBox LLC (the Midstream Joint Venture) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of EQM. On November 22, 2024, EQM entered into a contribution agreement (the Contribution Agreement) with an affiliate of Blackstone Credit & Insurance (the BXCI Affiliate).\nOn December 30, 2024, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, EQM and certain of its affiliates contributed to the Midstream Joint Venture the following assets in exchange for \n364,285,715\n Class A Units in the Midstream Joint Venture: (i) EQM's ownership interest in the MVP (via EQM's Series A ownership interest in the MVP Joint Venture), (ii) EQM's regulated transmission and storage assets (including those owned by Equitrans, L.P.), and (iii) EQM's Hammerhead Pipeline System (a \n1.6\n Bcf per day gathering header pipeline designed to connect natural gas produced in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to the MVP, Texas Eastern Transmission and Eastern Gas Transmission). In addition, pursuant to the Contribution Agreement, on December 30, 2024, the BXCI Affiliate contributed to the Midstream Joint Venture $\n3.5\n billion of cash, net of certain transaction fees and expenses, in exchange for a noncontrolling equity interest of \n350,000,000\n Class B Units in the Midstream Joint Venture (such contributions by EQM and the BXCI Affiliate, collectively, the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction).\nThe Midstream Joint Venture Transaction was accounted for as a sale of interest in a subsidiary without a loss of control. The Company recorded a $\n3.5\n billion increase in noncontrolling interest in consolidated subsidiaries and a $\n77.5\n million decrease to common shareholders' equity, inclusive of transaction-related expenses incurred by the Company and a $\n13.3\n million deferred tax asset. \nIn addition, on December 30, 2024, EQT (solely for the limited purposes set forth therein), EQM, the BXCI Affiliate and the Midstream Joint Venture entered into an amended and restated limited liability company agreement of the Midstream Joint Venture (the JV Agreement). The JV Agreement provides for, among other things, quarterly distributions of available cash flow to the Midstream Joint Venture's unitholders, of which EQM, as Class A Unitholder, will receive \n40\n% and the BXCI Affiliate, as Class B Unitholder, will receive \n60\n% until the Base Return (as defined in the JV Agreement) has been achieved. After the Base Return has been achieved and until the 8th anniversary of the closing of the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction of December 30, 2024, \n100\n% of the Midstream Joint Venture's distributions, including in a liquidation or sale of the Midstream Joint Venture, will be distributed to EQM as Class A Unitholder and \nzero percent\n will be distributed to the BXCI Affiliate as Class B Unitholder; after the Base Return has been achieved and from the 8th anniversary of December 30, 2024 and thereafter, no less than \n95\n% of the Midstream Joint Venture's distributions, including in a liquidation or sale of the Midstream Joint Venture, will be distributed to EQM as Class A Unitholder, and up to \n5\n% of the Midstream Joint Venture's distributions will be distributed to the BXCI Affiliate as Class B Unitholder (with specific distribution percentages determined based on the BXCI Affiliate's ownership of Class B Units as of the time of such distribution).\n120\nTable of Contents\nBased on the governing provisions of the JV Agreement, EQT's management determined that the allocation of income between the Company and the BXCI Affiliate should be based on the change in the investors claim on the Midstream Joint Venture's book value. Under this method, the Company recognizes net income/loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest based on changes to the amount that each member would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the JV Agreement's liquidation provisions, assuming that the net assets of the Midstream Joint Venture were liquidated at the recorded amounts, after taking into account any capital transactions between the Company and the BXCI Affiliate.\nThe Company used the proceeds from the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction to repay outstanding borrowings, and interest thereon, under the Bridge Credit Facility (defined in Note 10) and the Term Loan Facility and a portion of outstanding borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility as well as to pay certain transaction fees and expenses related to the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction and other related transactions. See Note 10.\n \n9.    \nIncome Taxes\n \nThe following table summarizes the Company's income tax expense.\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(Thousands)\nCurrent:\n \n \n \nFederal\n$\n1,222\n \n$\n(\n10,894\n)\n$\n651\n \nState\n6,125\n \n(\n4,818\n)\n18,457\n \nSubtotal\n7,347\n \n(\n15,712\n)\n19,108\n \nDeferred:\nFederal\n(\n21,463\n)\n450,091\n \n527,539\n \nState\n36,195\n \n(\n65,425\n)\n7,073\n \nSubtotal\n14,732\n \n384,666\n \n534,612\n \nTotal income tax expense\n$\n22,079\n \n$\n368,954\n \n$\n553,720\n \n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, current income tax expense is composed of state and federal income tax liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2023, current income tax benefit related primarily to 2014 through 2017 audit settlement interest and reduction in prior year state income tax liabilities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, current income tax expense related primarily to state income tax liabilities.\nOn August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The IRA establishes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax for certain corporations and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases made by publicly traded U.S. corporations. The IRA also includes new and renewed options for energy credits. These changes are effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. The impact of these changes did not have a material impact on the Company's financial statements and disclosures. \n121\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes the reasons for income tax expense differences from amounts computed at the federal statutory rate of 21% on pre-tax income.\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmount \nRate\nAmount\nRate\nAmount\nRate\n \n(Thousands)\n(Thousands)\n(Thousands)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n264,194\n \n$\n2,103,498\n \n$\n2,334,662\n \nTax at statutory rate\n$\n55,481\n \n21.0\n%\n$\n441,735\n \n21.0\n%\n$\n490,279\n \n21.0\n%\nState income taxes\n5,440\n \n2.1\n%\n50,263\n \n2.4\n%\n48,970\n \n2.1\n%\nValuation allowance\n(\n9,601\n)\n(\n3.6\n)%\n(\n81,483\n)\n(\n3.9\n)%\n12,685\n \n0.5\n%\nConvertible Notes repurchase premium\n—\n \n—\n%\n—\n \n—\n%\n35,957\n \n1.5\n%\nUncertain tax positions\n(\n16,977\n)\n(\n6.4\n)%\n(\n7,015\n)\n(\n0.3\n)%\n11,135\n \n0.5\n%\nState law change\n(\n11,315\n)\n(\n4.3\n)%\n(\n21,670\n)\n(\n1.0\n)%\n(\n49,511\n)\n(\n2.1\n)%\nFederal and state tax credits\n(\n6,537\n)\n(\n2.5\n)%\n(\n4,715\n)\n(\n0.2\n)%\n(\n4,319\n)\n(\n0.2\n)%\nTransaction costs\n6,041\n \n2.3\n%\n—\n \n—\n%\n—\n \n—\n%\nOther\n(\n453\n)\n(\n0.2\n)%\n(\n8,161\n)\n(\n0.4\n)%\n8,524\n \n0.4\n%\nIncome tax expense\n$\n22,079\n \n8.4\n%\n$\n368,954\n \n17.5\n%\n$\n553,720\n \n23.7\n%\n \nThe Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 was lower compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to the release of valuation allowances related to capital loss carryforward utilization, expiration of a statute of limitations related to uncertain tax positions, inclusive of interest, and net state deferred tax benefit related to a rate reduction from a Pennsylvania tax law change enacted on July 8, 2022 (the Pennsylvania Tax Legislation). The Pennsylvania Tax Legislation lowered the corporate net income tax rate from 8.99% to 8.49% in 2024 and continues to lower the corporate net income tax rate by 0.5% annually thereafter until the corporate net income tax rate reaches 4.99% in 2031. The rate reductions were partly offset by valuation allowances limiting certain state income tax benefits and non-deductible transaction costs incurred with the Equitrans Midstream Merger.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was lower compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to the release of valuation allowances limiting certain state deferred tax assets and net state deferred tax benefit related to a rate reduction from the Pennsylvania Tax Legislation and the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition. The Pennsylvania Tax Legislation lowered the corporate net income tax rate from 9.99% to 8.99% in 2023.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2022 was higher compared to the U.S. federal statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes, including valuation allowances limiting certain state income tax benefits and nondeductible repurchase premiums on the Convertible Notes (defined in Note 10), partly offset by state income tax benefits related to the Pennsylvania Tax Legislation. Included in the state law change was a decrease in state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards of $\n214.1\n million and a decrease in state valuation allowance on NOL carryforwards of $\n198.5\n million.\n122\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the source and tax effects of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(Thousands)\nDeferred tax assets:\nNOL carryforwards\n$\n708,518\n \n$\n740,802\n \nInterest disallowance limitation\n106,622\n \n59,668\n \nFederal tax credits\n89,644\n \n92,730\n \nNet unrealized losses\n80,723\n \n—\n \nState capital loss carryforward\n44,496\n \n99,632\n \nIncentive compensation and deferred compensation plans\n18,032\n \n16,854\n \nOther\n2,433\n \n1,156\n \nDeferred tax assets\n1,050,468\n \n1,010,842\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n257,218\n)\n(\n290,812\n)\nNet deferred tax asset\n793,250\n \n720,030\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nProperty, plant and equipment\n(\n2,516,074\n)\n(\n2,457,946\n)\nInvestment in partnerships\n(\n1,128,279\n)\n—\n \nNet unrealized gains\n—\n \n(\n166,905\n)\nDeferred tax liability\n(\n3,644,353\n)\n(\n2,624,851\n)\nNet deferred tax liability\n$\n(\n2,851,103\n)\n$\n(\n1,904,821\n)\n \nDuring 2024, the net deferred tax liability increased by $\n946.3\n million compared to 2023 due primarily to the additional deferred tax liability related to the Company's investment in EQM (treated as a partnership for tax purposes) and the additional deferred tax liabilities that arose from the fair value accounting of net assets acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger, partly offset by an increase in net unrealized losses.\nThe following table presents the expiration periods of the NOL carryforward deferred tax assets and associated valuation allowance by jurisdiction.\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(Thousands)\nNOL carryforwards:\nFederal (expires between 2032 and 2037)\n$\n14,644\n \n$\n67,958\n \nFederal (indefinite expiration)\n322,258\n \n323,598\n \nState (expires between 2025 and 2037)\n347,279\n \n332,153\n \nState (indefinite expiration)\n24,337\n \n17,093\n \nTotal NOL carryforwards\n$\n708,518\n \n$\n740,802\n \nValuation allowance on NOL carryforwards:\nFederal\n$\n(\n14,263\n)\n$\n(\n24,927\n)\nState\n(\n187,321\n)\n(\n156,700\n)\nTotal valuation allowance on NOL carryforwards\n$\n(\n201,584\n)\n$\n(\n181,627\n)\nThe Company recognizes a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered when determining the need for a valuation allowance. To determine whether a valuation allowance is required, the Company uses judgement to estimate future taxable income and considers the tax consequences in the jurisdiction where such taxable income is generated as well as evidence including the Company's current financial position, actual and forecasted results of operations, the reversal of deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies in addition to the current and forecasted business economics of the oil and gas industry. \n123\nTable of Contents\nFor 2024 and 2023, positive evidence considered included the reversals of financial-to-tax temporary differences, the implementation of and/or ability to employ various tax planning strategies and the Company's estimation of future taxable income. Negative evidence considered included historical pre-tax book losses of the Company and the uncertainty of future commodity prices and inability to generate capital gains. A review of positive and negative evidence regarding these tax benefits resulted in the conclusion that valuation allowances for certain NOLs and state capital loss carryforwards were warranted as it was more likely than not that the Company would not use them prior to expiration.\nThe remaining valuation allowance (which is not included in the NOL table above) is related primarily to the state capital loss carryforward realized with the sales of the Company's equity investment in Equitrans Midstream occurring between February 2020 and April 2022, which was a capital asset for tax purposes. Any capital losses from the sale of the investment can only be utilized to offset capital gains and are limited to being carried back 3 years and forward 5 years for potential utilization. In April 2022, the Company sold the remaining portion of its equity investment in Equitrans Midstream, which generated a capital loss that can only be carried forward for potential future utilization. During 2024, the Company recognized capital gains from the NEPA Non-operated Asset Divestitures that allowed the Company to recognize in the Statement of Consolidated Operations a federal and state income tax benefit of $\n52.8\n million and $\n2.3\n million, respectively, related to its valuation allowances for its capital loss carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had a valuation allowance related to the capital loss carryforward of $\n44.5\n million for state income tax purposes due to the limitations on future potential utilization. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had a valuation allowance related to the capital loss carryforward of $\n52.8\n million for federal income tax purposes and $\n46.8\n million for state income tax purposes due to the limitations on future potential utilization.\nThe following table reconciles the beginning and ending amount of reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding interest and penalties.\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(Thousands)\nBalance at January 1\n$\n89,197\n \n$\n204,035\n \n$\n182,032\n \nAdditions for tax positions taken in current year\n11,720\n \n11,986\n \n9,612\n \nAdditions (reductions) for tax positions taken in prior years\n15,177\n \n(\n883\n)\n12,391\n \nReductions for tax positions settled with tax authorities\n(\n29,645\n)\n(\n125,941\n)\n—\n \nReductions for lapse in statute of limitations\n(\n13,706\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nBalance at December 31\n$\n72,743\n \n$\n89,197\n \n$\n204,035\n \nThe following table presents specific line items that were included in the reserve for uncertain tax positions.\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Thousands)\nIf recognized, effect to the effective tax rate\n$\n67,105\n \n$\n83,669\n \n$\n117,341\n \nReduction of related deferred tax asset for general business credit carryforwards and NOLs\n$\n60,415\n \n$\n77,013\n \n$\n110,744\n \nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company recorded interest and penalties expense (income) of approximately $\n0.6\n million, $(\n19.8\n) million and $\n6.7\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Interest and penalties of $\n2.9\n million, $\n2.3\n million, and $\n22.2\n million were included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company believed that, as a result of potential settlements with relevant taxing authorities, it is reasonably possible that a decrease of $\n14.6\n million in unrecognized tax benefits related to state income tax positions may be necessary within twelve months.\n124\nTable of Contents\nIn September 2024, the Company settled its consolidated U.S. federal income tax liability with the IRS through 2019 for amounts included in the reserve for uncertain tax positions with minimal impact to the effective tax rate. The settlement resulted in forgone research and development tax credits of $\n29.6\n million, which are reflected in the table above.

For all other debt, the principal value less the unamortized debt issuance costs and debt discounts and, for EQM's senior notes, the unamortized fair value adjustments recorded with Equitrans Midstream Merger purchase price accounting represents carrying value.\n125\nTable of Contents\n(b)\nThe carrying value of borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility, Eureka's revolving credit facility and, as of December 31, 2023, the Term Loan Facility approximates fair value as their interest rates are based on prevailing market rates; therefore, the Company considers the fair value of EQT's revolving credit facility, Eureka's revolving credit facility and the Term Loan Facility to be Level 1 fair value measurements. As of December 31, 2023, the Company measured the fair value of EQT's note payable to EQM using Level 3 inputs. For all other debt, fair value is measured using Level 2 inputs. See Note 5 for the fair value hierarchy.\n(c)\nInterest rates for \nEQT's \n7.000\n% senior notes fluctuate based on changes to the credit ratings assigned to EQT's senior notes by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. Prior to their redemption, interest rates for \nEQT's \n6.125\n%\n senior notes \nfluctuated based on changes to the credit ratings assigned to EQT's senior notes by Moody's, S&P and Fitch. Interest rates for the Company's other senior notes do not fluctuate.\n(d)\nAs of December 31, 2024, the current portion of debt included borrowings outstanding under Eureka's revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2023, the current portion of debt included EQT's \n1.75\n% convertible notes and a portion of EQT's note payable to EQM. Upon the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, EQT's note payable to EQM became an intercompany transaction on a consolidated basis and, as such, was effectively settled on July 22, 2024.\n \nDebt Repayments\n. \nThe Company repaid, redeemed or repurchased the following debt during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nDebt Tranche\nPrincipal\nPremiums/(Discounts)\nAccrued but Unpaid Interest\nTotal Cost\n(Thousands)\nEQM's \n6.000\n% notes due July 1, 2025 (a)\n$\n400,000\n \n$\n1,284\n \n$\n11,933\n \n$\n413,217\n \nEQM's \n4.125\n% notes due December 1, 2026 (a)\n500,000\n \n—\n \n1,662\n \n501,662\n \nEQM's \n5.500\n% notes due July 15, 2028 (a)\n731,317\n \n15,541\n \n18,435\n \n765,293\n \nEQM's \n4.50\n% notes due January 15, 2029 (a)\n57,077\n \n(\n713\n)\n1,177\n \n57,541\n \nEQM's \n6.500\n% notes due July 15, 2048 (a)\n469,767\n \n27,012\n \n13,995\n \n510,774\n \nEQM's \n4.00\n% notes due August 1, 2024\n300,000\n \n—\n \n6,000\n \n306,000\n \nEQT's \n6.125\n% notes due February 1, 2025\n601,521\n \n1,178\n \n13,612\n \n616,311\n \nTerm Loan Facility due June 30, 2026\n1,250,000\n \n15\n \n6,136\n \n1,256,151\n \nEQT's \n1.75\n% convertible notes due May 1, 2026\n583\n \n—\n \n—\n \n583\n \nTotal\n$\n4,310,265\n \n$\n44,317\n \n$\n72,950\n \n$\n4,427,532\n \n(a)\nIn addition to call premiums (discounts) disclosed, EQM paid $\n7.8\n million in third-party advisory costs and fees to dealer managers and brokers for the redemption of its \n6.000\n% senior notes, redemption of its \n4.125\n% senior notes and repayment of certain of its senior notes in the EQM Tender Offer (defined below).\nEQT's Revolving Credit Facility. \nEQT has a $\n3.5\n billion revolving credit facility. On July 22, 2024, EQT entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (as amended from time to time, the EQT Credit Agreement) with PNC Bank National Association, as administrative agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, and the other lenders party thereto, amending and restating the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated June 28, 2022 (the Third A&R Credit Agreement), under which such lenders agreed to make to EQT unsecured revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n3.5\n billion. The EQT Credit Agreement, among other things, (i) extended the maturity date of the commitments and loans under the Third A&R Credit Agreement to July 23, 2029 and provides, at EQT's option, \ntwo\n \none-year\n extensions thereafter, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, and (ii) allows for additional commitment increases up to $\n1\n billion, subject to the agreement of EQT and new or existing lenders. EQT can obtain Base Rate Loans (as defined in the EQT Credit Agreement) or Term SOFR Rate Loans (as defined in the EQT Credit Agreement). Base Rate Loans are denominated in dollars and bear interest at a Base Rate (as defined in the EQT Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from \n12.5\n basis points to \n100\n basis points determined on the basis of EQT's credit ratings. Term SOFR Rate Loans bear interest at a Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the EQT Credit Agreement) plus an additional \n10\n basis point credit spread adjustment plus a margin ranging from \n112.5\n basis points to \n200\n basis points determined on the basis of EQT's credit ratings.\nEQT's revolving credit facility may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, share repurchases and any other lawful corporate purposes. EQT's revolving credit facility is underwritten by a syndicate of a large group of financial institutions, each of which is obligated to fund its pro-rata portion of any borrowings by EQT. As of December 31, 2024, no one lender of the large group of financial institutions in the syndicate for EQT's revolving credit facility holds more than \n10\n% of the financial commitments under such facility. The large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender are expected to limit the Company's exposure to disruption or consolidation in the banking industry.\n \n126\nTable of Contents\nEQT is not required to maintain compensating bank balances. EQT's debt issuer credit ratings, as determined by Moody's, S&P or Fitch on its non-credit-enhanced, senior unsecured long-term debt, determine the level of fees associated with EQT's revolving credit facility in addition to the interest rate charged by the lenders on any amounts borrowed against EQT's revolving credit facility; the lower EQT's debt credit rating, the higher the level of fees and borrowing rate.\nEQT's revolving credit facility contains various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of EQT's revolving credit facility, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The most significant covenants and events of default under EQT's revolving credit facility are the maintenance of a debt-to-total capitalization ratio and limitations on transactions with affiliates. EQT's revolving credit facility contains financial covenants that require a total debt-to-total capitalization ratio of no greater than \n65\n%. As of December 31, 2024, EQT was in compliance with all provisions and covenants of the EQT Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had approximately $\n1\n million and $\n15\n million, respectively, of letters of credit outstanding under EQT's revolving credit facility. \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, under EQT's revolving credit facility, the maximum amount of outstanding borrowings was $\n2,357\n million, $\n269\n million and $\n1,300\n million, respectively, the average daily balance was approximately $\n936\n million, $\n40\n million and $\n466\n million, respectively, and interest was incurred at a weighted average annual interest rate of \n6.6\n%, \n6.9\n% and \n2.8\n%, respectively. For all years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company incurred commitment fees of approximately \n20\n basis points on the undrawn portion of EQT's revolving credit facility to maintain credit availability.\nEureka's Revolving Credit Facility.\n Upon the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, the Company acquired a controlling interest in Eureka Midstream Holdings. See Notes 1 and 6. Eureka, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eureka Midstream Holdings, has a $\n400\n million senior secured revolving credit facility pursuant to that certain Credit Agreement, dated May 13, 2021, among Eureka, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, as administrative agent, the lenders party thereto from time to time and any other persons party thereto from time to time (as amended from time to time, the Eureka Credit Agreement). Eureka can obtain Base Rate Loans (as defined in the Eureka Credit Agreement) or Term SOFR Rate Loans (as defined in the Eureka Credit Agreement), each plus a margin based on Eureka's consolidated leverage ratio. Base Rate Loans are denominated in dollars and bear interest at a Base Rate (as defined in the Eureka Credit Agreement) plus a margin ranging from \n100\n basis points to \n225\n basis points determined on the basis of Eureka's consolidated leverage ratio. Term SOFR Rate Loans bear interest at a Term SOFR Rate (as defined in the Eureka Credit Agreement) plus an additional \n10\n basis point credit spread adjustment plus a margin ranging from \n200\n basis points to \n325\n basis points determined on the basis of Eureka's consolidated leverage ratio. \nEureka's revolving credit facility contains negative covenants that, among other things, limit restricted payments, incurrence of debt, dispositions, mergers and other fundamental changes and transactions with affiliates, in each case and as applicable, subject to certain specified exceptions. In addition, Eureka's revolving credit facility contains certain specified events of default, including insolvency, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest obligations, loss and failure to replace certain material contracts, change of control and cross-default provisions related to the acceleration or default of certain other financial obligations. As of December 31, 2024, Eureka was in compliance with all provisions and covenants of the Eureka Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Eureka had \nno\n letters of credit outstanding under its revolving credit facility. \nFor the period beginning on July 22, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2024, under Eureka's revolving credit facility, the maximum amount of outstanding borrowings was $\n330\n million, the average daily balance was $\n328\n million and interest was incurred at a weighted average annual interest rate of \n7.8\n%. For the period beginning on July 22, 2024 and ending on December 31, 2024, the Company incurred commitment fees of approximately \n50\n basis points on the undrawn portion of Eureka's revolving credit facility to maintain credit availability.\n127\nTable of Contents\nEQM's Bridge Credit Facility. \nIn connection with its entry into the Contribution Agreement, on November 22, 2024, EQM entered into a debt commitment letter with Royal Bank of Canada (EQM Debt Commitment Letter), pursuant to which Royal Bank of Canada committed, subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, to provide EQM with a senior unsecured bridge term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n2.3\n billion (the Bridge Credit Facility). On December 27, 2024, EQM entered into the Bridge Credit Facility and borrowed $\n2.23\n billion thereunder to fund (with cash on hand) the redemption and repurchase of certain of EQM's senior notes. See \"Debt Repayments\" table and \"EQM's Senior Notes.\" Upon the closing of the Midstream Joint Venture discussed in Note 8, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction to repay outstanding borrowings, and interest thereon, under the Bridge Credit Facility, and, thereafter, EQM terminated the Bridge Credit Facility.\nEQM's Revolving Credit Facility. \nImmediately following the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, on July 22, 2024, EQM repaid outstanding obligations under that certain Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated October 31, 2018, by and among EQM, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, swing line lender and L/C issuer, and the other financial institutions from time to time party thereto for principal of $\n705\n million and interest and fees of $\n4.5\n million using cash on hand and cash contributions from EQT funded by borrowings under EQT's revolving credit facility, and, thereafter, EQM terminated its revolving credit facility.\nTerm Loan Facility\n. On November 9, 2022, EQT entered into a Credit Agreement (as amended from time to time, the Term Loan Agreement) with PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto, under which such lenders agreed to make to EQT unsecured term loans in a single draw in an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n1.25\n billion (the Term Loan Facility) to partly fund the Tug Hill and XcL Midstream Acquisition. On August 21, 2023, EQT borrowed $\n1.25\n billion under the Term Loan Facility, receiving net proceeds of $\n1,242.9\n million. Prior to its draw on the Term Loan Facility, the Company incurred commitment fees of approximately \n20\n basis points on the undrawn portion of the Term Loan Facility to maintain credit availability.\nOn January 16, 2024, EQT entered into a third amendment to the Term Loan Agreement to, among other things, extend the maturity date of the Term Loan Agreement from June 30, 2025 to June 30, 2026. The third amendment to the Term Loan Agreement became effective on January 19, 2024 upon EQT's prepayment of $\n750\n million principal amount of the term loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility (funded with the net proceeds from the issuance of EQT's \n5.750\n% senior notes and cash on hand) and the satisfaction of other closing conditions. On July 22, 2024, EQT entered into a fourth amendment to the Term Loan Agreement to, among other things, make certain conforming changes to the Term Loan Agreement in alignment with the EQT Credit Agreement.\nUpon the closing of the Midstream Joint Venture, the Company used a portion of the proceeds from the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction to repay the remaining $\n500\n million of outstanding borrowings, and interest thereon, under the Term Loan Facility, and, thereafter, EQT terminated the Term Loan Facility. Refer to \"Debt Repayments\" for details.\nPrior to their prepayment, the term loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility bore interest at either (at EQT's election) a Term SOFR Rate plus the SOFR Adjustment or Base Rate (both terms defined in the Term Loan Agreement), each plus a margin based on EQT's credit ratings. For the period beginning on January 1, 2024 and ending on December 30, 2024, interest under the Term Loan Facility was incurred at a weighted average annual interest rate of \n6.8\n%. For the period beginning on August 21, 2023 and ending on December 31, 2023, interest under the Term Loan Facility was incurred at a weighted average annual interest rate of \n6.9\n%.\nEQM's Senior Notes. \nUpon the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, EQM became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of EQT, and EQM's outstanding senior notes were consolidated by the Company.\nThe indentures governing EQM's senior notes contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict, among other things, EQM's ability to incur, as applicable, indebtedness, incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, complete acquisitions, merge, sell assets and perform certain other corporate actions. Certain of EQM's senior notes also include an offer to repurchase provision applicable upon the occurrence of certain change of control events specified in the applicable indentures.\n128\nTable of Contents\nOn November 25, 2024, the Company announced EQM's commencement of a tender offer (the EQM Tender Offer) to purchase certain of EQM's senior notes, subject to a maximum aggregate purchase price, excluding accrued and unpaid interest, of up to $\n1.275\n billion, in accordance with acceptance priority levels correlating to the order in which the notes are listed as follows: EQM's \n6.500\n%\n senior notes due 2048, EQM's \n5.500\n%\n senior notes due 2028, EQM's \n4.50\n%\n senior notes due 2029 and EQM's \n7.500\n%\n senior notes due 2030. On December 10, 2024, the Company announced the early results of the EQM Tender Offer, including an increase of the maximum aggregate purchase price to $\n1.3\n billion. On December 27, 2024, EQM used borrowings under the Bridge Credit Facility and cash on hand to fund the EQM Tender Offer. Refer to \"Debt Repayments\" for details. In accordance with the established acceptance priority levels, none of EQM's \n7.500\n% \nsenior notes due 2030 were purchased.\nIn conjunction with the EQM Tender Offer, EQM solicited consents from holders of its \n6.500\n%\n senior notes due 2048 and \n5.500\n%\n senior notes due 2028 (such notes, together, the Affected Notes) to amend that certain Indenture, dated as of August 1, 2014, solely with respect to the Affected Notes, by modifying the reporting covenant contained therein such that EQT would provide the financial statements and other information required thereby in lieu of EQM (the Proposed Amendment). Each holder who validly tendered Affected Notes pursuant to the EQM Tender Offer was deemed to have validly delivered its related consent to the Proposed Amendment, and, therefore, EQM received the requisite consents to effect the Proposed Amendment. On December 30, 2024, EQM and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee for the Affected Notes, entered into that certain Sixth Supplemental Indenture containing the Proposed Amendment, which immediately became effective and operative upon such entry and applies to all holders of Affected Notes that remain outstanding.\nOn December 30, 2024, EQM used borrowings under the Bridge Credit Facility and cash on hand to redeem its \n6.000\n% senior notes due 2025 and \n4.125\n% senior notes due 2026.

The indentures governing EQT's long-term indebtedness contain certain restrictive financial and operating covenants, including covenants that restrict, among other things, EQT's ability to incur, as applicable, indebtedness, incur liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, complete acquisitions, merge, sell assets and perform certain other corporate actions. Certain of EQT's senior notes also include an offer to repurchase provision applicable upon the occurrence of certain change of control events specified in the applicable indentures.\nOn January 19, 2024, EQT issued $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.750\n%\n senior notes due 2034. \nThe Company used net proceeds of $\n742.0\n million from the sale and issuance of such notes and cash on hand to prepay \n$\n750\n million\n principal amount of the term loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility.\nAs of December 31, \n2024\n, aggregate maturities for EQT's senior notes were \nzero\n in 2025, \n$\n508\n million\n in 2026, \n$\n1,170\n million\n in 2027, \n$\n500\n million\n in 2028,\n $\n318\n million\n in 2029 and\n $\n1,860\n million\n thereafter.\nEQT's \n1.75\n% Convertible Notes.\n In April 2020, EQT issued $\n500\n million aggregate principal amount of \n1.75\n% convertible senior notes (the Convertible Notes). \nThe effective interest rate for the Convertible Notes was \n2.4\n%.\nOn January 2, 2024, in accordance with the indenture governing the Convertible Notes (the Convertible Notes Indenture), EQT issued an irrevocable notice of redemption for all of the outstanding Convertible Notes and announced that EQT would redeem any of the Convertible Notes outstanding on January 17, 2024 in cash for \n100\n% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Convertible Notes to, but excluding, such redemption date (the Redemption Price).\nPursuant to the Convertible Notes Indenture, between January 2, 2024 and the conversion deadline of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on January 12, 2024, certain holders of the Convertible Notes exercised their right to convert their Convertible Notes prior to the redemption and validly surrendered an aggregate principal amount of $\n289.6\n million of Convertible Notes. Based on a conversion rate of 69.0364 shares of EQT common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, EQT issued to such holders an aggregate \n19,992,482\n shares of EQT common stock. Settlement of such Convertible Note conversion right exercises net of unamortized deferred issuance costs increased shareholder's equity by $\n285.6\n million. The remaining $\n0.6\n million in outstanding principal amount of Convertible Notes was redeemed on January 17, 2024 in cash for the Redemption Price.\n129\nTable of Contents\nInclusive of January 2024 settlements of Convertible Notes conversion right exercises that were exercised in December 2023, during January 2024, EQT settled $\n290.2\n million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes conversion right exercises by issuing an aggregate \n20,036,639\n shares of EQT common stock to the converting holders at an average conversion price of $\n38.03\n.\nSettlement and Termination of Capped Call Transactions. \nIn connection with, but separate from, the issuance of the Convertible Notes, in 2020, EQT entered into capped call transactions (the Capped Call Transactions) with certain financial institutions (the Capped Call Counterparties) to reduce the potential dilution to EQT common stock upon any conversion of Convertible Notes at maturity and/or offset any cash payments that the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of such converted notes. The Capped Call Transactions had an initial strike price of $\n15.00\n per share of EQT common stock and an initial cap price of $\n18.75\n per share of EQT common stock, each of which were subject to certain customary adjustments, including adjustments as a result of EQT paying dividends on its common stock, and were set to expire in April 2026. The Company recorded the cost to purchase the Capped Call Transactions of $\n32.5\n million as a reduction to shareholders' equity.\nOn January 18, 2024, EQT entered into separate termination agreements with each of the Capped Call Counterparties, pursuant to which the Capped Call Counterparties paid EQT an aggregate $\n93.3\n million (the Termination Payments), and the Capped Call Transactions were terminated. EQT received the Termination Payments on January 22, 2024. The Termination Payments were recorded as an increase to shareholders' equity.\n11.    \nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nEquity Method Investments\nThe Company applies the equity method of accounting to its investments in entities that the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect those entities' economic performance but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over.

Following receipt of authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the FERC), the MVP entered into service on June 14, 2024 and became available for interruptible or short-term firm transportation service. On July 1, 2024, the MVP commenced long-term firm capacity obligations. A wholly-owned subsidiary of EQM is the operator of the MVP.\nEstimated total project cost of the MVP is approximately $\n8.1\n billion, including contingency and excluding AFUDC during construction. Of this amount, $\n142.8\n million was contributed by the Company following the completion of the Equitrans Midstream Merger.\nThe Company has a negative basis difference between the carrying value of its equity method investment in the MVP and its proportionate share of the MVP's net assets (composed of fixed assets). The basis difference is accreted over the useful life of the fixed assets, with accretion expense presented in (income) loss from investments in the Company's Statement of Consolidated Operations. As of December 31, 2024, the basis difference, net of accretion, was $\n1.3\n billion. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company's Series A ownership interest (with respect to the MVP) in the MVP Joint Venture was significant as defined by the SEC's Regulation S-X Rule 1-02(w). Accordingly, pursuant to Regulation S-X Rule 4-08(g), the following table presents summarized financial information of the MVP Joint Venture in relation to the MVP for the period beginning on July 22, 2024 and ending December 31, 2024 and as of December 31, 2024.\n \nJuly 22, 2024 to \nDecember 31, 2024\n(Thousands)\nOperating revenues\n$\n247,360\n \nOperating income\n$\n126,202\n \nNet income\n$\n129,773\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n(Thousands)\nCurrent assets\n$\n204,028\n \nNoncurrent assets\n9,535,975\n \nTotal assets\n$\n9,740,003\n \nCurrent liabilities\n$\n69,303\n \nNoncurrent liabilities\n1,514\n \nTotal liabilities\n70,817\n \nMembers' equity\n9,669,186\n \nTotal liabilities and members' equity\n$\n9,740,003\n \nMVP Southgate. \nMVP Southgate is a contemplated interstate pipeline that was approved by the FERC. The pipeline was initially designed to extend approximately \n75\n miles from the MVP in Pittsylvania County, Virginia to new delivery points in Rockingham and Alamance Counties, North Carolina using \n24\n-inch and \n16\n-inch diameter pipe.\nIn December 2023, the MVP Joint Venture entered into precedent agreements with Public Service Company of North Carolina, Inc. and Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC. The precedent agreements contemplate a modified project and, among other things, describe certain conditions precedent to the parties' respective obligations regarding MVP Southgate. As modified, the natural gas interstate pipeline would extend approximately \n31\n miles from the terminus of the MVP in Pittsylvania County, Virginia to planned new delivery points in Rockingham County, North Carolina using \n30\n-inch diameter pipe and have a targeted capacity of \n550,000\n dekatherms per day. The proposed \n31\n-mile route passes through a portion of the Southern Virginia Mega Site at Berry Hill, which is one of the largest business parks on the East Coast.\n131\nTable of Contents\nOn February 3, 2025, the MVP Joint Venture filed an application with the FERC seeking to amend its existing Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity to reflect the amended project. The Company expects a wholly-owned subsidiary of EQM to operate MVP Southgate upon its completion, which is targeted for June 2028. MVP Southgate is estimated to have a total cost of approximately $\n370\n million to $\n430\n million, excluding AFUDC and certain costs incurred for purposes of the originally certificated project, of which the Company will fund its proportionate share through capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture.\nPursuant to the MVP Joint Venture's limited liability company agreement and upon the closing of the Equitrans Midstream Merger, the Company is obligated to provide performance assurances with respect to MVP Southgate that may take the form of a guarantee from EQM (provided that, in accordance with the requirements of the MVP Joint Venture's limited liability company agreement, EQM's debt is assigned an investment grade credit rating), a letter of credit or cash collateral. Upon receipt of the FERC's initial release to begin construction of MVP Southgate, the Company will be obligated to provide performance assurance in an amount equal to \n33\n% of its share of MVP Southgate's remaining capital commitments under the applicable construction budget.\nInvestments in Equity Securities\nThe Company accounts for its investments in entities that the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over as an investment in equity security. Changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities are recorded in (income) loss from investments and dividends received on the Company's investments in equity securities are recorded in other income in the Statements of Consolidated Operations.\nThe Investment Fund. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company held an investment in a fund (the Investment Fund) that invests in companies that develop technology and operating solutions for exploration and production companies. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of the Company's investment in the Investment Fund was $\n33.2\n million and $\n36.1\n million, respectively, and was presented in investments in unconsolidated entities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company computes the fair value of the Company's investment in the Investment Fund using, as a practical expedient, the net asset value provided in the financial statements received from fund managers.\nEquitrans Midstream. \nPrior to the Company's sale of all of its then-owned shares of Equitrans Midstream common stock in 2022, the Company accounted for its investment in Equitrans Midstream as an investment in equity security.\n12.    \nCommon Stock and Income Per Share\n \nOn July 18, 2024, following approval by its shareholders, EQT amended its Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized number of shares of EQT common stock from \n640,000,000\n shares to \n1,280,000,000\n shares.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had reserved \n19.3\n million shares of authorized and unissued EQT common stock for stock compensation plans.\nOn December 13, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program (the Share Repurchase Program) authorizing the Company to repurchase shares of outstanding EQT common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $\n1\n billion, excluding fees, commissions and expenses. On September 6, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a $\n1\n billion increase to the Share Repurchase Program, pursuant to which approval the Company is authorized to repurchase shares of outstanding EQT common stock for an aggregate purchase price of up to $\n2\n billion, excluding fees, commissions and expenses. The Share Repurchase Program was originally scheduled to expire on December 31, 2023; however, on April 26, 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a \none-year\n extension of the Share Repurchase Program, and, on December 18, 2024, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an additional \ntwo-year\n extension of the Share Repurchase Program. As a result of such extension, the Share Repurchase Program will expire on December 31, 2026, but it may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time without prior notice.\n132\nTable of Contents\nFrom the Share Repurchase Program's inception and through December 31, 2024, the Company has purchased shares  under the Share Repurchase Program for an aggregate purchase price of $\n622.1\n million, excluding fees, commissions and expenses. \nThe table below summarizes the Company's share repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.

Purchases of treasury shares are calculated using the average share price of EQT common stock during the period. Prior to their redemption, the Company used the if-converted method to calculate the impact of the Convertible Notes on diluted income per share.\nThe table below provides the computation for basic and diluted income per share.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Thousands, except per share amounts)\nNet income attributable to EQT Corporation – Basic income available to shareholders\n$\n230,577\n \n$\n1,735,232\n \n$\n1,770,965\n \nAdd back: Interest expense on Convertible Notes, net of tax\n86\n \n7,551\n \n8,019\n \nDiluted income available to shareholders\n$\n230,663\n \n$\n1,742,783\n \n$\n1,778,984\n \nWeighted average common stock outstanding – Basic\n509,597\n \n380,902\n \n370,048\n \nOptions, restricted stock, performance awards and stock appreciation rights\n4,625\n \n5,232\n \n5,731\n \nConvertible Notes\n371\n \n27,090\n \n30,716\n \nWeighted average common stock outstanding – Diluted\n514,593\n \n413,224\n \n406,495\n \nIncome per share of common stock attributable to EQT Corporation:\nBasic\n$\n0.45\n \n$\n4.56\n \n$\n4.79\n \nDiluted\n$\n0.45\n \n$\n4.22\n \n$\n4.38\n \n133\nTable of Contents\n13.    \nShare-Based Compensation Plans\nThe following table summarizes the Company's share-based compensation expense.\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(Thousands)\nIncentive Performance Share Unit Programs\n$\n20,919\n \n$\n23,915\n \n$\n23,443\n \nRestricted stock awards\n25,473\n \n20,119\n \n23,028\n \nStock appreciation rights\n—\n \n4,056\n \n17,406\n \nOther programs, including non-employee director awards\n3,596\n \n3,110\n \n3,534\n \nTotal share-based compensation expense (a)\n$\n49,988\n \n$\n51,200\n \n$\n67,411\n \n         \n(a)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, share-based compensation expense of $\n105.4\n million and $\n3.6\n million, respectively, was included in other operating expenses.

The 2021 Incentive PSU Program, 2023 Incentive PSU Program and 2024 Incentive PSU Program have a payout factor that ranges from \nzero\n to \n200\n% and the 2022 Incentive PSU Program has a payout factor that ranges from \nzero\n to \n220\n% (which includes the Company's performance in achieving its 2025 net zero Scopes 1 and 2 emissions target). The Company recorded the 2020 Incentive PSU Program, the 2021 Incentive PSU Program, the 2022 Incentive PSU Program, the 2023 Incentive PSU Program and the 2024 Incentive PSU Program as equity awards using a grant date fair value determined through a Monte Carlo simulation, which projected the share price for the Company and its peers at the end point of the performance period. \nThe expected share prices were generated using each company's annual volatility for the expected term and the commensurate \nthree-year\n risk-free rate shown in the chart below. \nAs the Incentive PSU Programs include a performance condition that affects the number of shares that will ultimately vest, the Monte Carlo simulation computed the grant date fair value for each possible performance condition outcome on the grant date. The Company reevaluates the then-probable outcome at the end of each reporting period to record expense at the probable outcome grant date fair value as applicable. Vesting of the units under each Incentive PSU Program occurs upon payment after the end of the performance period. \nThe following table summarizes Incentive PSU Programs to be settled in stock and classified as equity awards.\nIncentive PSU Programs – Equity Settled\nNonvested Shares\nWeighted Average\nFair Value\nAggregate Fair Value\nOutstanding at December 31, 2021\n2,754,648\n \n$\n16.08\n \n$\n44,281,509\n \nGranted in Period\n575,120\n \n29.73\n \n(a)\n17,098,318\n \nGranted from Multiplier\n162,183\n \n29.45\n \n4,776,289\n \nVested\n(\n625,563\n)\n29.45\n \n(\n18,422,830\n)\nForfeited\n(\n4,398\n)\n13.28\n \n(\n58,405\n)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022\n2,861,990\n \n16.66\n \n47,674,881\n \nGranted in Period\n404,790\n \n38.79\n \n15,701,804\n \nGranted from Multiplier\n409,383\n \n6.56\n \n2,685,552\n \nVested\n(\n1,773,994\n)\n6.56\n \n(\n11,637,401\n)\nForfeited\n(\n70,616\n)\n37.59\n \n(\n2,654,455\n)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n1,831,553\n \n28.27\n \n51,770,381\n \nGranted in Period\n371,500\n \n40.08\n \n14,889,720\n \nGranted from Multiplier\n451,805\n \n23.55\n \n10,640,008\n \nVested\n(\n1,355,415\n)\n23.55\n \n(\n31,920,023\n)\nForfeited\n(\n7,092\n)\n45.94\n \n(\n325,806\n)\nOutstanding at December 31, \n2024\n1,292,351\n \n$\n34.86\n \n$\n45,054,280\n \n(a)\nThe 2022 Incentive PSU Program was granted as a liability award and converted to an equity award in April 2022.

Awards are subject to a \nthree-year\n graded vesting schedule commencing with the date of grant, assuming continued service through each vesting date. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the weighted average fair value of these restricted stock unit grants, based on the grant date fair value of EQT common stock, was approximately $\n34.54\n, $\n31.88\n and $\n21.65\n, respectively.\nIn conjunction with the Equitrans Midstream Merger, the Company assumed all outstanding and unvested share-based compensation awards of Equitrans Midstream and converted those assumed awards into \n5,175,814\n restricted stock unit equity awards. Employees who were terminated on the closing date were immediately vested in their Company awards. Company awards of those employees who continued employment with the Company under a transition agreement will vest upon the earlier of (i) the end of the vesting period set forth in the original award agreement or (ii) the end of such employee's employment period set forth in their transition agreement, in both cases subject to continued service through such date. Company awards of those employees who continued employment with the Company on an at will basis will vest in accordance with the vesting period set forth in the original award agreement, assuming continued service through such date. The fair value of these converted restricted stock awards was approximately $\n106.3\n million of post-combination expense as of December 31, 2024.\nThe total fair value of restricted stock unit equity awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n155.5\n million, $\n23.5\n million and $\n16.6\n million, respectively. Total capitalized compensation costs related to the restricted stock unit equity awards was $\n9.6\n million, $\n5.7\n million and $\n6.6\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n44.1\n million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock unit equity awards was expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted average vesting term of approximately \n1.0\n year.\n136\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock unit equity award activity as of December 31, 2024.\nRestricted Stock – Equity Settled\nNonvested Shares\nWeighted Average\nFair Value\nAggregate Fair Value\nOutstanding at January 1, 2022\n3,104,281\n \n$\n12.58\n \n$\n39,056,435\n \nGranted\n1,288,430\n \n21.65\n \n27,893,331\n \nVested\n(\n1,368,577\n)\n12.16\n \n(\n16,644,859\n)\nForfeited\n(\n97,189\n)\n15.56\n \n(\n1,512,333\n)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2022\n2,926,945\n \n16.67\n \n48,792,574\n \nGranted\n953,270\n \n31.88\n \n30,389,954\n \nVested\n(\n1,544,968\n)\n15.20\n \n(\n23,482,927\n)\nForfeited\n(\n117,445\n)\n24.52\n \n(\n2,879,751\n)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2023\n2,217,802\n \n23.82\n \n52,819,850\n \nGranted\n982,990\n \n34.54\n \n33,950,507\n \nVested\n(\n4,861,796\n)\n31.98\n \n(\n155,480,899\n)\nConversion of Equitrans Midstream awards\n5,175,814\n \n35.88\n \n185,708,206\n \nForfeited\n(\n90,641\n)\n31.92\n \n(\n2,893,279\n)\nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n3,424,169\n \n$\n33.32\n \n$\n114,104,385\n \nNon-Qualified Stock Options\n \nThe fair value of the Company's option grants was estimated at the grant date using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the assumptions indicated in the table below for the year ended December 31, 2020. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the date of grant.

The participant was entitled to receive, upon exercise, a number of shares of EQT common stock, cash or a combination of the two, based upon the excess of the fair market value as of the date of exercise over a base price of $\n10.00\n.\nThe awards were accounted for as liability awards and, as such, compensation expense was recorded based on the fair value of the awards as remeasured at the end of each reporting period. Assumptions at grant date are indicated in the table below. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the reporting date. The dividend yield was based on the dividend yield of EQT common stock at the reporting date.

The restricted stock unit awards are settled in EQT common stock on the vesting date or, if elected by the director, following a director's termination of service on the Company's Board of Directors. \nAwards granted prior to 2020 that are to be paid in cash are accounted for as liability awards and, as such, compensation expense is recorded based on the fair value of the awards as remeasured at the end of each reporting period. Awards to be settled in EQT common stock are accounted for as equity awards and, as such, compensation expense is recorded based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date fair value. A total of \n564,968\n non-employee director share-based awards, including accrued dividends, were outstanding as of December 31, 2024. A total of \n70,930\n, \n66,300\n and \n44,800\n share-based awards were granted to non-employee directors during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted average fair value of these grants, based on the closing price of EQT common stock on the business day prior to the grant date, was $\n36.14\n, $\n33.31\n and $\n43.97\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n2025 Awards\nEffective in 2025, the Compensation Committee adopted the 2025 Incentive Performance Share Unit Program (2025 Incentive PSU Program) under the 2020 LTIP. The 2025 Incentive PSU Program was established to align the interests of executives and key employees with the interests of shareholders and the strategic objectives of the Company. A total of \n374,800\n share units were granted under the 2025 Incentive PSU Program. The payout of the share units will vary between \nzero\n and \n200\n% of the number of outstanding units contingent upon the Company's absolute total shareholder return and total shareholder return relative to a predefined peer group over the period of January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2027.\nEffective in 2025, the Compensation Committee granted \n1,111,480\n restricted stock unit equity awards that follow a \nthree-year\n graded vesting schedule commencing with the date of grant, assuming continued employment through each vesting date. The share total includes the Company's \"equity-for-all\" program, instituted in 2021, pursuant to which the Company grants equity awards to all permanent employees.\n138\nTable of Contents\n14.    \nLeases\nThe Company leases drilling rigs, facilities (including a water storage facility), vehicles and drilling and compression equipment.\nTo determine the present value of its right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, the Company calculates a discount rate per lease contract based on an estimate of the rate of interest that the Company would pay to borrow (on a collateralized basis, over a similar term) an amount equal to the lease payment obligation.\nThe Company has elected a practical expedient to forgo application of the recognition requirements under ASU 2016-02, \nLeases\n, to short-term leases; as such, short-term leases are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company has elected a practical expedient to account for lease and nonlease components together as a lease.\nCertain of the Company's lease contracts include variable lease payments, such as payments for property taxes and other operating and maintenance expenses and payments based on asset use, which are not included in the lease cost or the present value of the right-of-use asset or lease liability. Certain of the Company's lease contracts provide renewal periods at the Company's option; if a renewal period option is reasonably assured to be exercised, the associated lease payment obligation is included in the present value of the right-of-use asset and lease liability.\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company was not a lessor.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's lease costs.\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Thousands)\nOperating lease costs\n$\n41,991\n \n$\n26,755\n \n$\n19,922\n \nFinance lease costs\n5,546\n \n2,414\n \n1,716\n \nVariable and short-term lease costs\n33,475\n \n24,151\n \n13,726\n \nTotal lease costs (a)\n$\n81,012\n \n$\n53,320\n \n$\n35,364\n \n(a)\nIncludes drilling rig lease costs capitalized to property, plant and equipment of $\n50.5\n million, $\n40.8\n million and $\n25.4\n million, respectively, of which $\n33.1\n million, $\n24.5\n million and $\n17.7\n million, respectively, were operating lease costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, cash paid for operating lease liabilities and reported in net cash provided by operating activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows was $\n13.6\n million, $\n10.1\n million and $\n10.3\n million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, cash paid for finance lease liabilities and reported in net cash used in financing activities in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows was $\n4.2\n million, $\n2.3\n million and $\n1.8\n million, respectively.\nFor the Company's operating leases, as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the weighted average remaining term was \n3.4\n years, \n1.6\n years and \n1.8\n years, respectively, and the weighted average discount rate was \n5.3\n%, \n4.7\n% and \n4.5\n%, respectively.

Aggregate future payments for such commitments as of December 31, 2024 were $\n13.6\n billion, composed of $\n1.1\n billion in 2025, $\n1.1\n billion in 2026, $\n1.0\n billion in 2027, $\n0.9\n billion in 2028, $\n0.9\n billion in 2029 and $\n8.6\n billion thereafter.\nIn addition, the Company has commitments to pay for services related to its operations, including electric hydraulic fracturing services, and purchase equipment, materials and sand. Aggregate future payments for such commitments as of December 31, 2024 were $\n494.3\n million, composed of $\n219.9\n million in 2025, $\n148.4\n million in 2026, $\n88.1\n million in 2027 and $\n37.9\n million in 2028.\nSee Note 14 for a summary of undiscounted future cash flows owed to lessors by the Company as lessee pursuant to contractual agreements in effect as of December 31, 2024.\nLegal and Regulatory Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings.\nThe Company evaluates its legal proceedings, including litigation and regulatory and governmental investigations and inquiries, on a regular basis and accrues a liability for such matters when the Company believes that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changed circumstances. In the event the Company determines that (i) a loss to the Company is probable but the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated, or (ii) a loss to the Company is less likely than probable but is reasonably possible, then the Company is required to disclose the matter herein, although the Company is not required to accrue such loss.\nWhen able, the Company determines an estimate of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses, whether in excess of any related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, for legal proceedings. In instances where such estimates can be made, any such estimates are based on the Company's analysis of currently available information and are subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties and may change as new information is obtained. The ultimate outcome of the matters described below, such as whether the likelihood of loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable, or if and when the range of loss is reasonably estimable, is inherently uncertain. Furthermore, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, any amounts accrued or estimated as possible losses may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question and the Company's exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or estimated.\nSecurities Class Action Litigation\n. On December 6, 2019, an amended putative class action complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania by Cambridge Retirement System, Government of Guam Retirement Fund, Northeast Carpenters Annuity Fund, and Northeast Carpenters Pension Fund, on behalf of themselves and all those similarly situated, against EQT, and certain former executives and current and former board members of EQT (the Securities Class Action). The complaint alleges that certain statements made by EQT regarding its merger with Rice Energy Inc. in 2017 (the Rice Merger) were materially false and violated various federal securities laws. Pursuant to the complaint, the plaintiffs seek compensatory or rescissory damages in an unspecified amount for all damages allegedly sustained by the class as a result of alleged negative impacts to EQT stock price in 2018 and 2019.\nAdditionally, following the filing of the Securities Class Action complaint, several other lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania and the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania by certain shareholders of EQT against EQT and certain former executives and current and former board members of EQT asserting substantially the same allegations as those raised in the Securities Class Action. These matters are currently pending, the majority of which have been stayed pending a ruling on dispositive motions in the Securities Class Action.\n141\nTable of Contents\nFollowing the commencement of the Securities Class Action, the parties engaged in fact and expert discovery. In June 2024, the discovery phase of the Securities Class Action was completed. On June 27, 2024, the parties to the Securities Class Action participated in a mediation (the Mediation), which did not result in resolution. A trial date for the Securities Class Action has not been determined.\nIn the second quarter of 2024, the Company recorded an accrual for estimated loss contingencies associated with the Securities Class Action in an amount equal to the settlement offer the Company tendered at the Mediation. Due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of outcomes of legal proceedings, the amount accrued for estimated losses associated with the Securities Class Action may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company, and the Company's exposure and ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued or estimated. The amount accrued for such estimated losses is based on the Company's analysis of currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and uncertainties and may change as new information is obtained. While the parties have completed discovery, various motions, including dispositive motions, have not yet been decided, the matters present meaningful legal uncertainties, and predicting the outcome depends on making assumptions about future decisions of courts and the behavior of other parties for which the Company does not currently have sufficient information. Given these uncertainties, the Company is unable at this time to reasonably estimate the range of possible additional losses above the amount accrued. The Company disputes the claims asserted in the Securities Class Action\n \nand related litigation and believes it has meritorious defenses, but unpredictability is inherent in litigation and the Company cannot predict the outcomes with any certainty.\nWith respect to the matters described above, the Company is unable at this time to estimate the losses that are reasonably possible to be incurred or a range of such losses due to various factors, including that the proceedings are still in their early stages and discovery is not complete; the matters present meaningful legal uncertainties; and predicting the outcome depends on making assumptions about future decisions of courts and the behavior of other parties for which the Company does not currently have sufficient information. The matters described above contain certain information related to claims against the Company as alleged in pleadings. While information of this type may provide insight into the potential magnitude of a matter, it does not necessarily represent the Company’s estimate of a probable or reasonably possible loss or the Company's judgment as to any currently appropriate accrual.\nRegulatory and Environmental Matters\n. The Company is subject to various federal, state and local environmental and environmentally-related laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, which are constantly changing, can require expenditures for remediation and may result in the assessment of fines. The Company has established procedures for ongoing evaluation of its operations to identify potential environmental exposures and to assure compliance with regulatory policies and procedures. The estimated costs associated with identified situations that require remedial action are accrued. Ongoing expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including investments in plant and facilities to meet environmental requirements, have not been material. Management believes that any such required expenditures will not be significantly different in either their nature or amount in the future and does not know of any environmental liabilities that will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The Company has identified situations that require remedial action for which approximately $\n10.3\n million was recorded in \nother liabilities and credits\n in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024.\nOther Matters\n. In addition to the matters described above, the Company, in the normal course of business, is subject to various other pending and threatened legal proceedings in which claims for monetary damages or other relief are asserted. The Company does not anticipate, at the present time, that the ultimate aggregate liability, if any, arising out of such other legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\n16.    \nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nRevenues and related accounts receivable from the Company's Production segment operations are generated primarily from the sale of produced natural gas, NGLs and oil to marketers, utilities and industrial customers located in the Appalachian Basin and in markets that are accessible through the Company's transportation portfolio, including markets in the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast United States and Canada. The Company also contracts with certain processors to market a portion of NGLs on behalf of the Company. The Company is not dependent on any single customer and believes that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to sell its natural gas, NGLs and oil.\n142\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately \n96\n% and \n93\n%, respectively, of the Company's sales of natural gas, NGLs and oil accounts receivable balances represented amounts due from non-end users. The Company manages the credit risk of sales to non-end users by limiting its dealings with only non-end users that meet the Company's criteria for credit and liquidity strength and by regularly monitoring these accounts. The Company may require letters of credit, guarantees, performance bonds or other credit enhancements from a non-end user for that non-end user to meet the Company's credit criteria. The Company did not experience any significant defaults on sales of natural gas to non-end users during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative contracts. This credit exposure is limited to derivative contracts with a positive fair value, which may change as market prices change. The Company's OTC derivative instruments are primarily with financial institutions and, thus, are subject to events that would impact those companies individually as well as the financial industry as a whole. The Company uses various processes and analyses to monitor and evaluate its credit risk exposures, including monitoring current market conditions and counterparty credit fundamentals. Credit exposure is controlled through credit approvals and limits based on counterparty credit fundamentals. To manage the level of credit risk, the Company enters into transactions primarily with financial counterparties that are of investment grade, enters into netting agreements whenever possible and may obtain collateral or other security. \n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company was not in default under any derivative contracts and had no knowledge of default by any counterparty to its derivative contracts. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company made \nno\n adjustments to the fair value of its derivative contracts due to credit related concerns outside of the normal non-performance risk adjustment included in the Company's established fair value procedure. The Company monitors market conditions that may impact the fair value of its derivative contracts. \nRevenues and related accounts receivable from the Company's Gathering and Transmission segments operations are generated predominantly from the transportation of natural gas in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The Company is not dependent on any single third-party customer and believes that the loss of any one customer would not have an adverse effect on the Company's ability to generate revenues through its gathering, transmission and storage services.\n17.    \nNatural Gas Producing Activities (Unaudited)\nThe following supplementary information presents a summary of the results of natural gas and oil activities in accordance with the successful efforts method of accounting for production activities.\nProduction Costs\n \nThe following tables present total aggregate capitalized costs and costs incurred related to natural gas, NGLs and oil production activities.\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(Thousands)\nCapitalized costs\nProved properties\n$\n31,986,473\n \n$\n30,471,164\n \nUnproved properties\n1,563,440\n \n2,039,431\n \nTotal capitalized costs\n33,549,913\n \n32,510,595\n \nLess: Accumulated depreciation and depletion\n12,489,317\n \n10,734,099\n \nNet capitalized costs\n$\n21,060,596\n \n$\n21,776,496\n \n143\nTable of Contents\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Thousands)\nCosts incurred (a)\nProperty acquisition:\n \n \n \nProved properties (b)\n$\n410,805\n \n$\n4,142,621\n \n$\n82,276\n \nUnproved properties (c)\n98,007\n \n575,130\n \n113,523\n \nExploration\n2,735\n \n3,330\n \n3,438\n \nDevelopment\n1,848,000\n \n1,782,428\n \n1,298,665\n \n(a)\nAmounts for all years presented exclude costs for facilities, information technology and other corporate items.

To support the accurate and timely preparation and disclosure of its reserve estimates, the Company established internal controls over its reserve estimation processes and procedures, including the following: the price, heat content conversion rate and cost assumptions used in the economic model to determine the reserves are reviewed by management; division of interest and production volume are reconciled between the system used to calculate the reserves and other accounting/measurement systems; the reserves reconciliation between prior year reserves and current year reserves is reviewed by senior management; and the estimates of proved natural gas, NGLs and oil reserves are audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI), an independent consulting firm hired by management. Since 1961, NSAI has evaluated oil and gas properties and independently certified petroleum reserves quantities in the United States and internationally.\nIn the course of its audit, NSAI conducted a detailed review of \n100\n% of the total net natural gas, NGLs and oil proved reserves attributable to the Company's interests as of December 31, 2024. NSAI conducted a detailed, well-by-well audit of all the Company's properties. The estimates prepared by the Company and audited by NSAI were within the recommended 10% tolerance threshold set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE Standards). Standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methods, including performance analysis, volumetric analysis, analogy and material balance were utilized in the evaluation of reserves. All of the Company's proved reserves are located in the United States.\nThe Company utilizes reliable technologies in the calculation of its proved undeveloped reserves. The technologies used in the estimation of the Company's proved undeveloped reserves include, but are not limited to, empirical evidence through drilling results and well performance, production data, decline curve analysis, well logs, geologic maps, core data, seismic data, demonstrated relationship between geologic parameters and performance, and the implementation and application of statistical analysis.\nFor all tables presented, NGLs and oil were converted at a rate of one Mbbl to approximately \nsix\n million cubic feet (MMcf).\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(MMcfe)\nNatural gas, NGLs and oil\n \n \n \nProved developed and undeveloped reserves:\n \n \n \nBalance at January 1\n27,596,694\n \n25,002,589\n \n24,961,499\n \nRevision of previous estimates\n(\n1,079,677\n)\n(\n1,402,039\n)\n(\n654,618\n)\nPurchase of hydrocarbons in place\n413,040\n \n2,600,667\n \n141,038\n \nSale of natural gas in place\n(\n1,562,849\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nExtensions, discoveries and other additions\n3,125,620\n \n3,411,750\n \n2,494,713\n \nProduction\n(\n2,228,159\n)\n(\n2,016,273\n)\n(\n1,940,043\n)\nBalance at December 31\n26,264,669\n \n27,596,694\n \n25,002,589\n \nProved developed reserves:\nBalance at January 1\n19,558,176\n \n17,513,645\n \n17,218,655\n \nBalance at December 31\n18,804,929\n \n19,558,176\n \n17,513,645\n \nProved undeveloped reserves:\nBalance at January 1\n8,038,518\n \n7,488,944\n \n7,742,844\n \nBalance at December 31\n7,459,740\n \n8,038,518\n \n7,488,944\n \n145\nTable of Contents\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(MMcf)\nNatural gas\n \n \n \nProved developed and undeveloped reserves:\n \n \n \nBalance at January 1\n25,795,134\n \n23,824,887\n \n23,523,665\n \nRevision of previous estimates\n(\n917,676\n)\n(\n1,461,305\n)\n(\n432,315\n)\nPurchase of natural gas in place\n395,423\n \n2,012,159\n \n141,038\n \nSale of natural gas in place\n(\n1,562,849\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nExtensions, discoveries and other additions\n2,921,638\n \n3,326,736\n \n2,434,543\n \nProduction\n(\n2,086,441\n)\n(\n1,907,343\n)\n(\n1,842,044\n)\nBalance at December 31\n24,545,229\n \n25,795,134\n \n23,824,887\n \nProved developed reserves:\n \n \n \nBalance at January 1\n18,186,432\n \n16,541,017\n \n16,152,083\n \nBalance at December 31\n17,440,191\n \n18,186,432\n \n16,541,017\n \nProved undeveloped reserves:\nBalance at January 1\n7,608,702\n \n7,283,870\n \n7,371,582\n \nBalance at December 31\n7,105,038\n \n7,608,702\n \n7,283,870\n \n \nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Mbbl)\nNGLs\n \n \n \nProved developed and undeveloped reserves:\n \n \n \nBalance at January 1\n285,345\n \n186,141\n \n225,792\n \nRevision of previous estimates\n(\n24,332\n)\n11,558\n \n(\n33,955\n)\nPurchase of NGLs in place\n2,529\n \n90,604\n \n—\n \nExtensions, discoveries and other additions\n30,391\n \n13,592\n \n9,610\n \nProduction\n(\n22,025\n)\n(\n16,550\n)\n(\n15,306\n)\nBalance at December 31\n271,908\n \n285,345\n \n186,141\n \nProved developed reserves:\n \n \nBalance at January 1\n218,523\n \n154,921\n \n169,781\n \nBalance at December 31\n217,786\n \n218,523\n \n154,921\n \nProved undeveloped reserves:\nBalance at January 1\n66,822\n \n31,220\n \n56,011\n \nBalance at December 31\n54,122\n \n66,822\n \n31,220\n \n146\nTable of Contents\n \nYears Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(Mbbl)\nOil\n \n \n \nProved developed and undeveloped reserves:\n \n \n \nBalance at January 1\n14,915\n \n10,142\n \n13,846\n \nRevision of previous estimates\n(\n2,669\n)\n(\n1,680\n)\n(\n3,095\n)\nPurchase of oil in place\n407\n \n7,481\n \n—\n \nExtensions, discoveries and other additions\n3,606\n \n577\n \n418\n \nProduction\n(\n1,595\n)\n(\n1,605\n)\n(\n1,027\n)\nBalance at December 31\n14,664\n \n14,915\n \n10,142\n \nProved developed reserves:\n \n \n \nBalance at January 1\n10,101\n \n7,183\n \n7,981\n \nBalance at December 31\n9,669\n \n10,101\n \n7,183\n \nProved undeveloped reserves:\nBalance at January 1\n4,814\n \n2,959\n \n5,865\n \nBalance at December 31\n4,995\n \n4,814\n \n2,959\n \nThe change in reserves during the year ended December 31, 2024 resulted from the following:\n•\nConversions of \n2,637\n billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves.\n•\nExtensions, discoveries and other additions of \n3,126\n Bcfe, which exceeded 2024 production of \n2,228\n Bcfe.

Similarly, the Company updated certain of its future cost assumptions to include the additional expenses required to build and maintain the acquired midstream assets, which are needed to transport the Company's produced gas to the first liquid sales point. Lastly, following the completion of the Midstream Joint Venture Transaction as discussed in Note\n \n8, the Company updated certain of its future cost assumptions to account for changes in the noncontrolling interest ownership of the assets owned by the Midstream Joint Venture.

All internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Accordingly, even effective controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\n \n150\nTable of Contents\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, our management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management's assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the entities acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger on July 22, 2024. Equitrans Midstream's total assets represented approximately 25% of our total assets at December 31, 2024, and Equitrans Midstream's total operating revenues represented approximately 5% of our total operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nErnst & Young LLP (Ernst & Young), the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our Consolidated Financial Statements, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. Ernst & Young's attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting appears in Part II, Item 8., of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs noted under \"Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting,\" our management's assessment of, and conclusion on, the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the entities acquired in the Equitrans Midstream Merger on July 22, 2024.\n \nUnder guidelines established by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an acquisition while integrating the acquired company. We are in the process of integrating our and Equitrans Midstream's internal controls over financial reporting. As a result of these integration activities, certain controls will be evaluated and may be changed. \nExcept as noted above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.    Other Information\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, none of our directors or \"officers\" (as such term is defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n a \"Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\" or \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\" (as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K).\nItem 9C.    Disclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\nNot Applicable.\n151\nTable of Contents\nPART III\n \nItem 10.        Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nThe following information is incorporated herein by reference from our definitive proxy statement relating to the 2025 annual meeting of shareholders, which proxy statement is expected to be filed with the SEC within 120 days after the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2024:\n•\nInformation required by Item 401 of Regulation S-K with respect to directors;\n•\nInformation required by Item 405 of Regulation S-K with respect to our compliance with Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, if any;\n•\nInformation required by Item 407(d)(4) of Regulation S-K with respect to disclosure of the existence of our separately-designated standing Audit Committee and the identification of the members of the Audit Committee;
