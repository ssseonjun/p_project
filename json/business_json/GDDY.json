    "item1": "Item 1. Business\nOverview\nGoDaddy is a global leader serving a large market of entrepreneurs, developing and delivering easy-to-use solutions as a one-stop shop provider, alongside personalized guidance. We serve small businesses, individuals, organizations, developers, designers and domain investors. Our vision is to radically shift the global economy toward life-fulfilling entrepreneurial ventures. Our mission is to empower entrepreneurs everywhere, making opportunity more inclusive for all. We are passionate about our mission and honored that entrepreneurs trust their ideas with us. Our 20.5 million customers are passionate and determined to transform their ideas into something meaningful. Our ability to evolve and build products to meet our customers' needs uniquely positions us to help our customers navigate their journey as small business owners.\nOur customers' journeys tend to be non-linear and each phase can be iterative in nature. We design our solutions to help across all aspects of our customers’ businesses and to assist them in improving and growing across what we call the \"Entrepreneur's Wheel.\" The Entrepreneur's Wheel represents our customers' needs within three key focuses areas: Identity, Presence and Commerce.\nOur customers often start with the most intimate of brand considerations, their Identity, which includes their company name, domain name, logo and email address. The domain name continues to be an important initial step for customers as they start and grow their business. We provide products to support their brand through our domain services that blend seamlessly into their connected social identities and online presence. In addition, with the help of GoDaddy Airo\n® \n(Airo), entrepreneurs can more easily establish their identity through AI-powered domain name searches and logo creation. \nWe also help our customers manage and grow their Presence while connecting with their customers through our expanded service offerings and access to relevant third-party products and platforms. We offer a suite of Presence-based solutions, most of which are enhanced by Airo, including website building and hosting, marketplace syndication, social media, search engine visibility, security, business products and email and other services. \nFinally, we have built a suite of Commerce solutions that enable our customers to sell directly online, in-person and across multiple channels, such as marketplaces and social platforms, and to integrate dynamic information everywhere they engage with current and potential customers. These solutions include GoDaddy Payments, point-of-sale systems that unify transaction management for both in-person and online sales, and an inventory and order dashboard for easier management of our customers' businesses.\n5\nTable of Contents\nAt GoDaddy, we believe our customers should have both great technology and great support at every point on the Entrepreneur's Wheel. With AI-powered experiences such as Airo and customer centric assistance such as our GoDaddy Guides, we can provide intelligent, proactive experiences within our GoDaddy solutions. For example, Airo can help small businesses build and grow with domain searches, logo and image creation, website and social media posts, ad design and email marketing campaigns. In addition, we help set our customers up for success with personalized guidance from our GoDaddy Guides via phone and digital experiences, thousands of daily conversations and our gathering of valuable feedback to enable us to continually evolve our products and solutions and respond to our customers' changing needs.\nOur people and unique culture have been integral to our success. We live by the same principles that enable our customers' ideas to survive and thrive, including owning outcomes, building value, joining forces, working courageously and living passionately. We take pride in delivering successful outcomes based on data-driven decisions, which we believe is a key factor driving our financial performance.\nOur Customers and Solutions\nGoDaddy is built to serve the needs of customers by providing easy-to-use products on an integrated technology platform wrapped with personalized guidance.\nOur Customers\nWe serve several customer populations: (i) Independents, (ii) WebPros, (iii) Domain Investors, and (iv) Domain Registrars, Third Party Registrars and Corporate Domain Portfolio owners. While these customer populations tend to utilize many of the same GoDaddy product offerings, there are meaningful differences in their journeys, what they value, their goals and how they communicate with their current and potential customers. We aim to establish and provide solutions that address these differences.\nOur largest customer population, Independents, consists mostly of microbusinesses and non-commercial endeavors. Microbusiness owners have an entrepreneurial spirit, strong work ethic and, above all, passion for their ideas, yet their specific needs vary depending on the type of their idea and the phase of their journey. Independents range from individuals who have an initial business idea and those thinking about starting a business, to established ventures that need help attracting customers, growing their sales, processing payments, managing their online presence or expanding their operations. Most Independents have fewer than five employees, and most self-identify as having little to no technology or design skills. These customers need our help to create a unique and secure identity, especially with the more technical aspects of their online presence. Although our customers have differing degrees of resources and technical capabilities, they all share a desire to find tools to help them bring their ideas to life, enhance connections with their audience, sell their products and services and provide a seamless experience for both existing and new customers. \nOur second largest customer population, WebPros, are website designers and developers who build websites on behalf of businesses and noncommercial organizations. We estimate that half of all global website builds occur through a third party, such as our WebPros, on a do-it-for-you basis. WebPros are often freelancers, moonlighters or teams within website design agencies that often have website design as one of multiple streams of income. WebPros generally have more technical acumen and look for tools that provide greater amounts of flexibility, such as the WordPress content management system (CMS). Although WebPros have a need for technical depth and flexibility, they also benefit from our simplicity and guidance as tools to increase their throughput and maximize the use of their time. We help our WebPros customers in a number of ways beyond our product suite and services, including providing tools to help them save time, make money and exceed client expectations. These client management applications aim to make it easier for WebPros to manage their clients' websites at any host, or on GoDaddy products such as Managed WordPress. Our solutions are built to assist WebPros in more easily managing their overall business with capabilities such as client billing, administrative access and shopping features, making it easier for them to buy and manage multiple products for their clients, as well as make use of enhanced technical support and discounts for reselling GoDaddy products. We support a variety of third-party control panels and content management tools favored by WebPros including cPanel, Plesk, Drupal, Joomla and more. \nOur third largest customer population is Domain Investors. Domain Investors are individuals or organizations who manage a portfolio of registered domains for the purpose of selling via secondary markets. These investors bring a unique and valuable resource to our business in the form of liquidity and the ability to help our other populations (Independents and WebPros) successfully find a domain name they prefer.\n6\nTable of Contents\nWe also serve Domain Registrars, Third Party Registrars and Corporate Domain Portfolio owners. Domain Registrars are organizations that have their own domain registration offerings, but who use our domain registration and management platform. These commercial arrangements provide for strategic relationships with many key platforms and enable further scale of our domain registration technology and insights. Third party registrars are served through GoDaddy Registry which provides wholesale generic top-level domains (gTLDs) and country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs) for registrars to sell to the end customer. These top-level domains (TLDs) provide alternatives to the .com domain that more closely represent the names of our customers' ideas, businesses and brands. For registry operators, we provide a fully managed registry platform, including managing the full registry technology and operating stack at scale, with approximately 180 TLDs including some of the largest brands in the world. We also serve corporate domain portfolio owners, which are organizations that maintain and manage a large portfolio of domain names, including general and international domains. These customers are looking for the most powerful, secure and intuitive technology to streamline their processes, unparalleled industry experience and expertise to navigate the complexities of managing a corporate portfolio, and a focused and dedicated team that can provide committed support with the highest levels of security, service and domain management.\nOur Solutions and Experiences\nWe designed and developed an extensive set of easy-to-use technology solutions and seamless experiences to enable our customers' journeys along the Entrepreneur's Wheel across multiple platforms and online marketplaces. We understand that no matter what our customers' needs are, or what stage of their idea they are focusing on, our customers want a \"one-stop-shop\" solution. We offer our customers products and services to meet them at every stage of their journey.\nOur domain name registration products enable us to engage customers at a common starting place for establishing an exclusive, uniquely branded identity and are often an on-ramp for our other products. Domains are a part of our Core Platform business, and we believe our Applications and Commerce products are a natural adjacency to our domain registration products. Applications and Commerce products, including our proprietary website building and commerce products as well as our productivity solutions, significantly improve our value proposition to customers, thereby improving our financial performance, growth opportunities and customer retention. \nIn addition, we have built customer experiences that provide our solutions in a seamless one-stop-shop environment. Airo helps small businesses establish an online presence and grow through AI-powered tools that assist customers with domain searches, logo and image creation, website and social media posts, ad design and email marketing campaigns. And, our GoDaddy Guides are readily available and provide care to customers who have different levels of technical sophistication.\nWe manage and report our business in the following two segments: \n•\nApplications and Commerce (A&C)\n, which primarily consists of sales of products containing proprietary software, notably our website building products, as well as our proprietary commerce solutions and third-party email and productivity solutions and sales of certain products when they are included in bundled offerings of our proprietary software products.\n•\nCore Platform (Core)\n, which primarily consists of sales of domain registrations and renewals, aftermarket domain sales, domain protection, website hosting products and website security products when not included in bundled offerings of our proprietary software products as well as sales of products not containing a software component. \nApplications and Commerce\nBringing an idea to life online, establishing and maintaining a presence and continuing to grow requires the right tools and products. Website building solutions, e-commerce tools, digital marketing capabilities and other GoDaddy solutions are designed to help our customers start, grow and scale their presence and ultimately their businesses. Our customers come to \n7\nTable of Contents\nGoDaddy to build a professional website, attract customers, sell their products and services and accept payments online and in person by engaging with our easy-to-use tools, managed in one place.\nApplications Products\nOur primary applications products include:\nWebsites + Marketing\n. Websites + Marketing is an easy-to-use, do-it-yourself, mobile-optimized online tool that enables our customers to build effective websites and e-commerce enabled online stores with minimal technical skill. We offer a variety of plans, with pricing dependent on business and marketing features. With each of these plans, customers gain access to industry-targeted professional design templates, which can be further customized using our editor by adding intent-driven sections, photos, videos or text. Our design templates cover a wide range of categories with professionally written content for small businesses, organizations, families, weddings and other ideas. We design our websites and tools to work seamlessly on mobile devices, with a focus on performance, to enable websites to appear in search engine rankings.\nManaged WordPress and Managed WooCommerce Stores.\n Managed WordPress is our streamlined, optimized website building experience that allows our customers to easily build and manage a faster WordPress site that offers more flexibility and power than our Websites + Marketing solution. With our Managed WordPress site, we manage the administrative tasks for our customers, allowing them to spend more time on building or growing their business. We offer a variety of plans, with pricing based on various features. Our Managed WordPress sites are built with automatic, regular backups and core updates, enhanced security, integrated Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), one-click migration tools, pre-installed extensions, plugins and themes, business email and backups and a staging site. We also offer Managed WooCommerce Stores, giving our customers the freedom to sell anything, anywhere online, from physical products to digital downloads, services and subscriptions.\nDigital Marketing\n. We offer a range of marketing tools and services designed to help businesses acquire and engage customers and create content. These capabilities are available in an integrated offering with our website and commerce tools, or as a stand-alone offering for customers using other website content-management systems. The tools are designed for busy customers who may lack experience with online marketing, focusing on ease of use, mobile experience and delivering business results. For example, Airo, an AI-powered experience, allows our customers to quickly create a powerful marketing campaign, including recommended, customized social media posts, better site traffic with the Airo SEO wizard, a step-by-step guide to optimizing each website page with suggested keywords and descriptions that can lead to better traffic results, and a Customer Insights dashboard that provides insights on site traffic, sales and orders and digital marketing. Our mobile application, GoDaddy Studio, helps our customers to grow their brands by easily creating impactful visual content for almost any online platform. Search Engine Optimization helps our customers get their websites found on major search sites using a simple step-by-step wizard with targeted recommendations on which search phrases are most likely to drive traffic to a customer's site. Business listings capabilities bring business information to where customers are looking, including Meta and Google My Business. Email marketing lets customers build targeted campaigns, either from scratch or using website or commerce content. Social Media Marketing helps customers create ads and boost brand awareness through a complete \"do-it-for-me\" service for managing engagement on the most popular social networks. This service combines dedicated teams of branding experts – photographers, writers, designers, marketers – with proprietary technology to manage activity on Meta, X and Yelp, among others, to help our customers acquire new customers and build stronger relationships with their existing customers.\nCommerce\nWe\n aim to lead the small business commerce market by enabling GoDaddy customers of all sizes, from those just starting out to established businesses looking to scale and grow, to sell everywhere their customers shop. We design our commerce products to help our customers sell online, in person and on leading marketplaces, while being able to manage their sales from one place. In addition to robust commerce capabilities, we offer the lowest card transaction fees in the industry when compared to similar plans from other leading providers, which allows our customers to keep more of what they make.\n \nOur primary commerce products and services include:\nOnline Store.\n Our Websites + Marketing product includes online store capabilities, which allows our customers to transact business directly on their websites. Online store capability is easy to use and offers powerful commerce features with templates for websites that are optimized for mobile shopping, integrations with GoDaddy Payments and our Smart Terminal Point-of-Sale (POS) system, inventory and product catalog management, and growth tools for marketing. It also allows customers to sell on marketplaces such as Amazon, Etsy, eBay, Walmart and Google and social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, with all channels managed from our centralized dashboard. As part of the GoDaddy Commerce ecosystem, Managed \n8\nTable of Contents\nWooCommerce Stores, our WordPress-based online store solutions, provide our customers with everything they need to sell online, in person, and across popular marketplaces and social media platforms from one built-in experience. Similar to our Websites + Marketing product, Managed WooCommerce Stores include our centralized dashboard, allow for marketplace selling and are integrated with GoDaddy Payments and our Smart Terminal POS system. \nPoint-of-Sale (POS) Systems.\n We offer a line of smart POS terminals for businesses with in-store operations, including our flagship countertop, Smart Terminal, and our compact Smart Terminal Flex. Our Smart Terminal devices are modern, dual screen all-in-one POS systems that allow our customers to manage in-store inventory and product catalogs and accept payments. In addition, the Smart Terminal line seamlessly integrates with both our Websites + Marketing Online Store and Managed WooCommerce Stores to unify in-person and online sales so businesses can offer “Buy online pick up in-store” experiences to their customers. The Smart Terminal line also offers access to third-party applications that meet merchants' needs that we do not address directly. \nIn addition to our Smart Terminal line of POS systems, we offer payment acceptance solutions that allow our customers to accept payments their way while seamlessly interacting with their customers wherever they may be. For example, we include Payable Domains, a default payments system that is designed to create a frictionless, out-of-the-box experience for our customers. Our Card Reader and Tap-to-Pay on the GoDaddy Mobile App (iPhone and Android) allow customers to accept payments and sell on the go. Our Virtual Terminal allows customers to accept payments from their smartphone, tablet or computer with Internet connection with no hardware needed. Our customers also have the ability to accept online payments without needing to create a website through our Online Pay Links. Customers can brand and personalize these shareable pay links with their domain, giving them another opportunity to build their brand. Pay links can be sent through text or email or shared on social media sites. We also provide merchants with QR code-based payments, allowing their customers to scan and pay through the GoDaddy Mobile App. \nGoDaddy Payments.\n As a \"payment facilitator,\" GoDaddy Payments enables our customers in both the U.S. and Canada to accept all major forms of payment, including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and contactless payments including Apple Pay and Google Pay, with no long-term contracts or monthly minimums. This service enables our customers to start accepting payments in minutes with a simple setup and get paid, in many cases, as early as the next business day, all with the lowest fees in the industry when compared to similar plans from other leading providers. In addition, GoDaddy Payments is built-in as a payments acceptance method in all our U.S. and Canada commerce products for easy enablement\n.\nEmail and Productivity Solutions \nOur customers want to spend their time on what matters most to them, selling their products and services or helping their customers do the same. We provide them with productivity tools such as domain-specific email, telephony and online storage to help run their ventures. We offer a variety of products designed to make the business of business easier for our customers. The products we offer include those developed in-house as well as third-party applications which we distribute and support, such as Microsoft 365.\nOur primary email and productivity solutions products include:\nEmail Accounts\n. We offer a range of email service plans with a multi-feature web interface that connects to our customers' domains. The pricing of these plans depends on the customer's desire for additional features, including HIPAA- compliant email, advanced email security, archiving, and additional business applications such as Microsoft Teams. All our email accounts are ad-free and we offer added security functionality designed to protect from spam, viruses and other forms of online fraud, such as phishing.\nMicrosoft 365\n. We offer fully-supported Microsoft 365 accounts that are easy to set up and use with our customers' domains. We offer Microsoft 365 through multiple plans, ranging from email with calendar and contacts connected to a full suite of productivity tools, including file sharing and full desktop versions of Microsoft productivity applications, such as Outlook, Word, Excel and PowerPoint. For customers wanting to protect their email data, we provide an email backup service, and for customers needing to comply with regulatory requirements, we provide email add-on services such as HIPAA-enabled email, encryption services (in partnership with ProofPoint), archiving services (in partnership with Barracuda) and advanced e-mail security. Our customers can also make use of Microsoft Copilot through chat enabled features, or can purchase Microsoft 365 Copilot as an integrated solution for Microsoft Office apps. We help make Microsoft 365 and Microsoft 365 Copilot installation easy, allowing customers to be up and running in minutes, including \"do-it-for-me\" migration services to move customers' existing email data to Microsoft 365 accounts.\n9\nTable of Contents\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, we derived approximately 36%, 34% and 31% of our total revenue, respectively, from sales of our A&C products.\nCore Platform\nDomains\nEvery great idea needs a great name and GoDaddy is the leading global domain naming service. Staking a claim on an identity with a domain name is an integral part of establishing a concept and presence online. When inspiration strikes, we provide our customers with the broadest selection of domains and high-quality search, discovery and recommendation tools to help them find the right name for their idea. Securing a domain is a key component to creating a complete identity and our domain products often serve as the starting point in our customer relationships. We are a global leader in domain name registration, with approximately 81 million domains under management as of December 31, 2024. Based on information reported in VeriSign's most recent Domain Name Industry Brief, this represented approximately 22%\n \nof the approximately\n \n362 million\n \ndomain names registered worldwide as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 93% of our customers purchased a domain from us. In addition, GoDaddy Registry provides a high-performance back-end registry technology platform with a portfolio of TLDs including .biz, .co, .nyc, and .us.\nOur primary domains product offerings include:\nPrimary Registrations\n. Using our website or mobile application, we offer customers the ability to search for and register available domain names with the applicable registry. Our inventory for primary registrations is defined by the number of TLDs we offer. As of December 31, 2024, 458 different generic TLDs, such as .com, .net and .biz, and 58 different country code TLDs, such as .co, .ca, .in and .jp., were available for purchase through GoDaddy. Since 2013, hundreds of new gTLDs were launched through ICANN's \"new gTLD program\" initiated in 2012 (the Expansion Program), making it easier for companies and individuals to find and register new, easy-to-remember domain names tailored to their ideas, industry or interests. ccTLDs are important to our international expansion efforts as we found international customers often prefer the ccTLD for the country or geographic market in which they operate. Our primary registration offering relies heavily on our search, discovery and recommendation tools which enable our customers to find a domain name that matches their business needs and goals. We also sell domain registrations through relationships with third-party resellers and we provide back-end registry services supporting approximately 180 TLDs.\nAftermarket\n. We operate a large domain aftermarket platform, which processes aftermarket, or secondary, domain name sales and we maintain a portfolio of more than 1.0 million domain names. We designed our aftermarket platform to enable the seamless purchase and sale of previously registered domain names through an online auction, an offer and counter offer transaction, a \"buy now\" transaction and automation and lease to own options for our customers. In addition, we allow our customers to \"List for Sale\" names under their registration, and we provide functionality for the entire registrar network to list expiring domains from their platforms and \"List for Sale\" functionality to registrar partners allowing their currently registered customers to list domain names within GoDaddy's aftermarket. These various channels provide a diverse inventory available to meet the demand from our customers. In addition, our GoDaddy Investor mobile application helps investors watch and bid on domains at auction and stay on top of their current bids from their mobile devices. We operate a cross-registrar network that automates transaction execution across registrars, thereby reducing the time required to complete a transaction.\nRegistry\n. GoDaddy Registry is a world-leading provider of domain name registry services. GoDaddy Registry operates or provides back-end registry services to approximately 180 registry TLDs including ccTLDs, such as \n.\nus, .tv and .co, city TLDs such as .nyc and .sydney, gTLDs such as .club, .health and .design, and branded TLDs such as .chase and .godaddy. Our integrated registry solutions provide policy and operational support, and domain marketing, sales and strategic planning.\nDomain Name Add-ons\n. Domain name add-ons are features that are offered for purchase concurrently with domain name registrations and have low costs associated with their delivery. For example, in addition to privacy features included at no cost with every domain registered with GoDaddy, we offer more advanced full domain and ultimate domain protection products exclusively focused on protecting our customers' domains against bad actors and online risks, as well as domain ownership products, to prevent the accidental loss of a domain name.\n10\nTable of Contents\nHosting and Security\nFor more technically sophisticated WebPros and other customers, we provide high-performance, flexible hosting and security products that can be used with a variety of open source design tools, including WordPress. We design these solutions to be easy to use, effective, reliable, flexible and provide great value. We offer a variety of hosting and security products enabling our customers to create and manage their identity, or in the case of WebPros, the identities of their end-customers. \nOur primary hosting and security products include:\nShared Website Hosting\n. The term \"shared hosting\" refers to the housing of multiple websites on the same server. Shared hosting is our most popular hosting product. We operate, maintain and support shared website hosting in our owned and operated data centers and our leased co-located data centers using either Linux or Windows operating systems. We currently offer several tiers of website hosting plans to suit the needs and resources of our customers, a majority of which use industry standard cPanel or Parallels Plesk control panels. We also bundle our hosting plans with a variety of applications and products such as web analytics and SSL certificates. WordPress is the most used CMS on our shared hosting platform.\nVirtual Private Servers\n. Our broad range of virtual private server (VPS) offerings allow our customers to select the server configuration best suited for their applications, requirements and growth. Our VPS solutions provide our customers with a single virtual machine which runs multiple other virtual machines for other customers. Our VPS is designed for customers who need greater control, more advanced technical capabilities and higher performance than offered by our shared hosting plans. Our customers can tailor their VPS plans based on a range of performance, storage, bandwidth and operating system needs.\nSecurity\n. Our security product portfolio is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to help our customers secure their online presence. The portfolio includes (i) SSL certificates to help ensure information is secure between browsers and servers through encryption; (ii) the use of a content delivery network to improve a website's performance; (iii) a proprietary web application firewall to help keep customers' websites safe from hackers; (iv) managed security with malware scanning and site cleanups; and (v) a skilled team of security professionals working to secure our services or to provide support in the event of a disruption to our solutions. \nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, we derived approximately 64%, 66% and 69% of our total revenue, respectively, from sales of our Core Platform products.\nExperiences\nGoDaddy Airo\n®\nAiro is an intelligent experience that can help proactively build and grow our customers' businesses with the power of AI. Airo operates across the GoDaddy ecosystem and is built to activate intelligent, proactive experiences within other GoDaddy solutions. Airo aims to help our customers by anticipating their needs and providing solutions through informed interactions across the GoDaddy suite of products and services, small business industry expertise, knowledge queries and best practices. Airo can help our customers build their identity with domain searching, personalized logos, email inboxes and email templates. It also aims to help our customers grow their business with proactive email and text messages, proposed product descriptions and social media posts, conversational UI landing pages and auto-generated product catalogs.\nGoDaddy Guides\nOur GoDaddy Guides consist of approximately 5,900 specialists worldwide who are readily available to provide care to and build strong relationships with our customers throughout their lifetime. Our customers deeply value expertise and know-how that is individualized and unique to their ventures and our Guides are trained and supported to provide the high-quality, responsive and personalized guidance that our customers need. In addition, our GoDaddy Guides market our brand through their recommendations of our solutions to specifically meet the needs of our customers to support their growth. \nOur Opportunity and Advantages\nOur Opportunity—Empowering Entrepreneurs\nOur mission is to empower entrepreneurs everywhere, making opportunity more inclusive for all. Our customers represent a large and diverse market that we believe is fundamentally underserved by other companies. According to the U.S. \n11\nTable of Contents\nSmall Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, 99.9% of all firms in the U.S. are small businesses, of which there were approximately 34.8 million, based on the Census Bureau's 2021 Statistics of U.S. Businesses. These small businesses are estimated to represent approximately 43.5% of total U.S. gross domestic product (GDP). We believe a significant market exists for our products and services, and we believe our addressable market extends beyond small businesses and includes individuals and organizations, such as universities, community organizations, charities and hobbyists.\nOur customers are consumers themselves, which makes them keenly aware of the need to have an impactful online presence. While our customers' needs change depending on where they are in their journey, the most common customer needs we serve include:\n•\nIdentity\n. Our customers want to develop an identity by finding a name that distinctly identifies their business, hobby or passion. We believe their identity includes not just a simple, mobile-enabled website, but the ability to get found across various search engines, social media platforms and vertical marketplaces. And while our customers' online identities start with creating and managing these points of presence, their identities are amplified through content generation and the ability to engage and transact online with their customers and audience.\n•\nPresence\n. Presence represents the need of our customers to present themselves to their customers, which they do through an ever-expanding set of options across social media, marketing channels, email, marketplaces and through their website. Being able to seamlessly create and post content quickly is imperative. What it means for our customers to be online continues to evolve. Today, having an effective online presence often means having a combination of: (i) a secure and content-rich website viewable from any device; (ii) a presence on multiple social media channels (e.g., Meta, TikTok, Snapchat, X and WeChat); (iii) getting found by search engines (e.g., Google); and (iv) establishing a presence on: (a) an increasing number of horizontal marketplaces (e.g., Yelp and Eventbrite); (b) vertical marketplaces (e.g., Zillow, OpenTable and HomeAdvisor); and (c) e-commerce platforms (e.g., Amazon, eBay and Etsy).\n•\nCommerce\n. Commerce recognizes that our customers need commerce to work seamlessly for them both offline and online. Our customers' customer expectations are set by how they engage with enterprise-grade experiences, which means they expect to be able to buy online and pick up in the store in a matter of minutes. A customer in the store expects to be recognized online seamlessly, while a customer online expects to transition to a store experience seamlessly. For service commerce entrepreneurs, their customers expect to find products and services online, engage through online messaging, book appointments digitally and complete transactions in-person.\n•\nInteracting with customers as they grow their business.\n Our customers need to effectively communicate with existing customers and potential customers across a communication landscape that is fragmented in both form and function. This landscape includes (i) branded email communication, originating with domain registration and email creation through an email client; (ii) online marketing in a variety of content types and channels; (iii) online commerce with reservation and scheduling, product catalogs and e-commerce and payment processing capabilities, including in-person point-of-sale payment processing; (iv) messaging capabilities across SMS, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and other platforms; (v) email marketing for audience engagement; and (vi) telephony, for inbound and outbound voice communication. Surrounding these channels and tactics, our customers also need easy-to-use tools to run their businesses.\n•\nTechnology that is easy-to-use, reliable, secure, efficient, performance enhancing and evolves with their needs.\n Our customers vary significantly, but they remain the same in their need for an integrated platform and set of tools that enable their domain, website, marketing and commerce solutions to easily work together as their ideas grow and become more complex. Our customers expect reliable products and want to be confident that their digital presence is secure, even when customized. Our customers work on their ideas whenever and however they can and need solutions fitting their lifestyle and schedule. Our products and services provide a platform that can meet the range of needs, demands and levels of sophistication of our customers, from those that may not be technologically savvy to more sophisticated customers such as WebPros. In addition to our standalone products, Airo helps small businesses establish their online presence and grow through AI-powered tools that assist with domain searches, logo and image creation, website and social media posts, ad design and email marketing campaigns.\n•\nConnecting with a real person when they need help.\n Depending on their journey, a customer may seek guidance on setting up a website, launching new features or trying a new product or service and they need that guidance on their time. Our customers need real people who are readily available and can provide care to customers at all levels of technical sophistication. In addition to guiding our customers along their journey, we also provide support by handling the most difficult and arduous tasks for them through a collection of managed service offerings, and \n12\nTable of Contents\ncustomers who utilize Airo-enabled solutions get access to personalized support for website content, logos, ready-to-use social media posts and more.\n•\nAffordable solutions\n. Our customers often have limited financial resources and may be unable to make large, upfront investments in the latest technology. Our customers need affordable solutions that deliver impactful results to level the playing field with the tools that allow them to appear and act as bigger ventures. We aim to provide affordable products and services for our customers at every level to support their businesses. \nServing our customers’ needs creates deep relationships, where we are viewed as not just a solution provider, but also a guide and partner to their journey on the Entrepreneur's Wheel. This makes for a favorable business and economic model, aligning the interests of GoDaddy and our customers.\nOur stable and durable business model is driven by strong brand recognition, efficient customer acquisition, high customer retention rates, increasing lifetime spend of our customers and our ability to attract high intent customers. In 2024, we generated $4,573 million of revenue, up 7.5% from $4,254 million in 2023, and we generated $5,039 million in total bookings, up 9.5% from $4,603 million in 2023. We believe the breadth and depth of our product offerings, seamless ease-of-use in a one-stop shop and the high-quality, personalized guidance and responsiveness from GoDaddy Guides continues to build strong customer relationships leading to our high customer retention rates. For the year ended December 31, 2024, our customer retention rate was approximately 84%, a slight reduction from the approximate 85% in each of the four years prior, due to divestitures, migrations and the end of life of certain products as part of our efforts to streamline brands outside the GoDaddy platform. For the year ended December 31, 2024, retention for customers within the GoDaddy platform, which represents the vast majority of our customers, was approximately 87%. The retention rate for our customers who had been with us for over three years as of December 31, 2024 was approximately 90%. Greater than 89% of our total revenue was generated by customers who were also customers in the prior year. In addition, in 2024, we had over 1.8 million customers who each spent more than $500 a year on our product offerings.\nOur Advantages\nOur customers serve many roles in their business; they simultaneously run marketing, accounting, service delivery operations, customer service, people operations and many other tasks. Time is their most valuable resource and complexity is their hindrance; our customers want an impactful online presence, but may not have the time and skills to make that happen. Our goal is to be a trusted partner to these entrepreneurs, bringing together the technology, ease of use and guidance necessary to bring their ideas to life online. We believe the following strengths provide us with competitive advantages in serving these needs:\nGlobal Brand Awareness. \nOur global brand benefits from high awareness as a leading domain name provider, with approximately 81 million domains under management as of December 31, 2024. Based on information reported in VeriSign's most recent Domain Name Industry Brief, this represented approximately 22%\n \nof the approximately\n \n362 million\n \ndomain names registered worldwide as of December 31, 2024. Our global presence gives us the ability to leverage our brand — a competitive advantage when customers search for products and solutions. We have 20.5 million paying customers and a customer retention rate of approximately 84% for the year ended December 31, 2024. We market and sell to customers in over 200 markets around the world and in 2024, 49% of our customer base and approximately a third of our revenue was derived from our international presence. \nSeamlessly Intuitive Experiences. \nOur customers often self-identify as non-technical and inexperienced in areas such as marketing, content creation and customer management. Because they may lack the expertise to take full advantage of powerful tools, customers may be overwhelmed as they attempt to build and maintain their business. Our solutions aim to simplify this complexity with seamlessly intuitive experiences. \nFor example, with Managed WordPress, we help reduce the complexity of launching and managing WordPress sites so our customers can stay focused on growing their business, not managing complex WordPress hosting tasks. We provide this on a fully managed platform that delivers fast performance and AI-powered site creation. With Websites + Marketing, our proprietary CMS, we incorporate seamlessly intuitive experiences by uniting marketing, content, commerce and customer management tools into a single experience.\nAdditionally, with Airo, an experience that can help proactively build and grow our customers' businesses with AI, we aim to reduce complexities for our customers through an experience that can anticipate their needs and provide solutions through informed interactions, small business industry expertise, knowledge queries and best practices. Airo can help our customers build their identity with domain searching, personalized logos, email inboxes and email templates and aims to help our customers grow \n13\nTable of Contents\ntheir business with proactive email and text messages, proposed product descriptions and social media posts, conversational UI landing pages and auto-generated product catalogs.\nWe also seek to leverage data and insights to personalize the products and experiences of our customers as well as tailor our solutions and marketing efforts to each of our customer groups. The automation and content creation abilities inherent in these tools elevate the discoverability of and engagement with our products, creating a true one-stop-shop experience. This further enhances our customers' capacity to market their products, sell online, manage their businesses and grow, all in a seamless, low-friction manner. We constantly seek to improve our website, marketing programs and customer care to intelligently respond to each stage of our customers' lifecycles and identify their specific product needs based on experimentation. This allows us to interact more frequently with our customers and understand what products work well for them. We intend to continue investing in our technology and data platforms to harness the power of generative AI to further enable our personalization efforts and make our products even more intuitive for our customers.\nPersonalized Guidance.\n Our customers deeply value expertise and know-how, which has been part of the GoDaddy DNA since our founding. Our customers' needs are highly individualized and unique to their ventures, which we believe makes operating a guidance experience – at scale – a competitive advantage.\nIn recent years, we extended this competency into several new interfaces and subject matters. These interfaces allow us to take learnings and insights gained from customer interactions to build and grow our product and service offerings and drive more thoughtful engagements for our customers. For example, within our Websites + Marketing platform, we are now creating customized action plans for our customers as they seek to market their businesses in a number of different channels based on the type of their venture and their geography. We have also significantly increased the training and engagement content available to our customers, through a number of different content forums and across platforms like YouTube and Instagram. In addition, customers who utilizeAiro-enabled solutions get access to personalized support for website content, logos, ready-to-use social media posts and more. \nGoDaddy Venture Forward Research Initiative.\n Established in 2018, GoDaddy's Venture Forward research initiative quantifies the impact that more than 20 million online businesses (measured by a unique domain and an active website) have on their economies. Most of these businesses employ fewer than ten people, categorizing each as a microbusiness. While these microbusinesses may be small, their impact on economies is outsized even though they are often too informal or too new to show up in traditional government statistics. Venture Forward’s data helps those studying, reporting on or advocating for entrepreneurs understand developing themes and insights into microbusiness/digital entrepreneurship. The data also helps us better understand our customers' mindsets, the requirements and challenges they face from start-up through more substantial developments, their aspirations as well as their current circumstances. We can also tailor topics covered by our survey to reflect current events, providing real time updates that can inform on key insights and themes from the populations surveyed. We update this information quarterly and share it to download for free.\nOperations\nHuman Capital\nOur people embody the same grit and determination as our customers. Our world-class engineers, designers, marketers and GoDaddy Guides share a passion for technology and its ability to change our customers' lives. We live by the same principles that enable our customers' ideas to survive and thrive, including owning outcomes, building value, joining forces, working courageously and living passionately. Our relentless pursuit of building value and doing right for our customers has been a crucial ingredient of our growth.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we employed 5,518 people worldwide, made up of 2,131 in care and services (who comprise a portion of our GoDaddy Guides), 2,247 in technology and development, 367 in marketing and advertising and 773 in general and administrative functions. In addition, GoDaddy partners with various third-party providers and vendors to provide contracted care and support services to our customers; approximately 3,700 individuals are employed with or engaged by our external partners. These third-party providers are primarily located in international markets, most significantly in India, the Philippines, and Malaysia. A majority of our employees are based in the U.S. and Europe. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union or are party to any collective bargaining agreement in connection with his, her or their employment with us. Certain of our employees in Germany are represented by employee works councils and some other internationally based employees are represented by worker representatives in accordance with local regulations.\n14\nTable of Contents\nAt GoDaddy, we strive for a workplace culture where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. We support this goal by focusing on key human capital initiatives including: \n•\nCompensation, Pay Parity and Benefits.\n We actively work to attract a diverse employee population and are committed to providing equitable opportunity in all aspects of employment. In line with this, our compensation programs and practices are designed to compensate our employees fairly based on the work that they perform. Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee aims to design compensation programs that align our pay for performance philosophy at each stage at which compensation decisions are made, including at hire, promotion and throughout the annual compensation cycle. Since 2015, we have published an annual diversity and pay parity report and, according to our analysis, we continue to compensate our male and female employees substantially the same for performing similar jobs across the company for all entities included in our analysis. In 2017, we began reporting on our pay practices across U.S.-based employee populations and reported each year that, according to our analysis of such data, we have paid employees of color and white employees substantially the same for performing similar jobs across the company. In addition to these pay practices, we continue to offer employees a range of comprehensive and competitive benefits and well being offerings that support our human-centered approach and that allow us to attract and retain top talent.\n•\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging.\n At GoDaddy, we are committed to attracting, hiring, and retaining the best talent from around the world. We strive to foster a diverse, inclusive and equitable workplace where all employees have the opportunity to learn, grow, and succeed. Our employee resource groups (ERGs) play an important role in supporting these goals. ERGs are voluntary, employee-led groups open to all employees that focus on the common topics, identities, affinities, and interests that matter to our people. Aligning with our values of joining forces and respecting one another, our ERGs help employees connect with one another, feel a sense of belonging at GoDaddy, support one another’s professional development and come together.  We also continuously work to have hiring, development, and retention practices that enable GoDaddy to be an employer of choice for top talent globally. To do so, we leverage the expertise of organizations like the Human Rights Campaign, PulseLearning and VMware Women’s Leadership Innovation Lab at Stanford University to understand best practices in these areas. As we work to make opportunity more inclusive for all, we remain committed to cultivating a workplace where our employees can thrive.\n•\nTalent and Career Development.\n We commit to providing fulfilling career development opportunities for our employees. Through our learning and development initiatives, we aim to achieve three goals: (i) align employees to our company strategy and goals; (ii) connect employees through experiential learning; and (iii) grow employee skill sets for the future. We offer extensive learning opportunities to our employees spanning leadership, sales, service and technology and compliance training through e-learning, instructor-led content, video-based and blended platforms. We offer several leadership development opportunities including new manager onboarding, a leadership development program for managers and above, and a multi-month management program for our care and services managers. In addition, for our GoDaddy Guides, we offer continuing education and training programs that are immersive with environments, technology, and tools that enable active learning. We are also supporting our employees with the latest technologies to enhance and assist in productivity and learning, including AI solutions and software, such as our Guide Assist Bot, GABI, which supports our GoDaddy Guides as they provide care to our customers. \n•\nEmployee Engagement.\n We aim to create a working environment and culture in which our employees feel respected and supported to do their best work. To that end, we ensure that we are engaging, listening and responding to employee concerns through our annual anonymous employee engagement survey known as GoDaddy Voice. Approximately 84% of our employees participated in the survey in 2024. We monitor employee responses to identify areas of opportunity and set goals and expectations for improvement to ensure employees feel connected and engaged with GoDaddy's mission, our customers and their own teams. Following a comprehensive review, the key results, areas of progress and opportunity, and plans for improvement are shared with all employees. \n•\nCommunity Engagement.\n Our social impact work, overseen by our Corporate Sustainability & ESG team, is an extension of our company vision and mission. Through our global volunteer and matching programs, we enable our employees to volunteer in their communities with paid time off, and we match employee donations to qualifying nonprofits of choice up to $1,500 per employee per year or country equivalent. In addition, our employees can earn funds for qualifying nonprofits they volunteer with through our volunteer rewards program. \nOur Board and the Compensation and Human Capital Committee oversee our human capital management programs, practices and strategies. Additional information on these matters and their oversight can be found in our annual proxy statement. \n15\nTable of Contents\nOur most recently published pay parity practices and Company-wide gender and racial/ethnic representation are published in our annual sustainability report, which is available on our website along with our recent EEO-1 Report.\nTechnology and Infrastructure\nOur products, customer experiences and business systems are enabled by our technology and infrastructure to provide scalability, security and flexibility. Technology and development expenses, including those expenses related to our technology platform, were $814 million, $840 million and $794 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The growth in our technology and development expenses has been driven primarily by our focus on enhancing customer experiences through the use of software-driven products. Additionally, we offer Domain Registry and Corporate Domains solutions to our customers. We built a scalable infrastructure platform allowing us to optimize for economies of scale and enable next-generation hosting architecture for our customers, while investing in faster, denser and more efficient data centers, improved network connectivity and improved resiliency, both domestically and internationally. \nWe aim to provide a reliable and secure global platform and infrastructure. Our investments in technology, including engineers, patents, online security, customer privacy, reliable infrastructure and data science capabilities, enable us to innovate and deliver personalized solutions to our customers. Our API-driven technology platform is built on state-of-the-art, open source technologies like OpenStack and other large-scale, distributed systems. Additionally, our platform allows our developers to create new and enhanced products or product features assembled from common building blocks leading to faster deployment cycles. We believe our products work well together and are more valuable and easier to use together than if our customers purchased them individually from other companies and tried to integrate them. As of December 31, 2024, we had 2,247 employees in technology and development and 368 issued patents in the U.S. and other countries covering various aspects of our product offerings. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, we had 11 pending U.S. and international patent applications and intend to file additional patent applications in the future.\nPhysical Infrastructure and Management\nOur physical technology infrastructure supports our products, experiences and business systems through servers located in data centers around the world. As a leading website hosting platform, we invest significantly in our peering architecture and underlying infrastructure management to handle significant Internet traffic at low bandwidth costs. We invest in the automation of common physical data center components like servers, load balancers, switches and storage, and we use open source solutions when possible to automate manual processes and thereby reduce the risk of human error and lower costs. Additionally, we leverage a common automated infrastructure based on OpenStack and Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) to enable next-generation services. We continue to migrate many of our non-hosting products and internal systems to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and an optimized company owned cloud infrastructure. These and other efforts have reduced our managed physical footprint by approximately 80% over the last three years, and have accelerated our ability to provide speed and reliability in both our product and customer experiences. These efforts and our technology infrastructure footprint allow us to scale and provide our customers with valuable products at affordable prices.\nCustomer Experience and Business Systems\nOur platforms provide our global customers easy-to-use products, by allowing us to experiment and quickly deploy improvements incorporating our data insights. Our investments in our platform capabilities include the following:\nE-commerce Platform and Application Services. \nWe invest in the architecture and capabilities of our e-commerce platform to create an ecosystem where we can rapidly scale up or down and integrate with third-party offerings. The platform broadens our distribution channels by being extensible and allowing resellers to easily sell our products. We seek to continuously launch new and relevant applications and streamline our existing offerings to provide the best user experience to our customers.\nData Platform. \nOur horizontal data platform helps us be a trusted source of data about our customers and their online ideas through accurate, meaningful and easily consumable data insights, which allows us to build best-in-class, personalized experiences for our customers. Our data platform is key to helping us deepen our customer and business insights, which enable innovation through instrumentation, experimentation and analysis.\nContent and Marketing Platform. \nOur content and marketing platforms leverage the latest technology, operational and production models that enable us to deliver customer-centric digital experiences at an accelerated pace through multiple touchpoints and channels. Our content platform and content creation processes help us realize efficiencies and scalability, which \n16\nTable of Contents\nenhance our ability to drive new, high-quality products and customer experiences to market faster. We focus on driving advancements in experimentation, the speed and volume of content creation, localization and content self-service, while ensuring platform availability and performance. We also deliver new engagement marketing capabilities that improve business effectiveness and customer experiences.\nProduct Development\nWe continue to expand the ways we serve our customers to adjust to their changing needs from primarily domain name registration and hosting to a broader spectrum of offerings. Our primary website building products (Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress), website security suite, email offerings (Microsoft 365), commerce products and domain aftermarket each represent significant need states that are complementary to our long-standing offerings and benefit from our strengths as a company in human-infused technology. Our key product development initiatives include:\nPowering a Simple and Effortless Presence\n. We offer a range of solutions that help our customers publish their ideas online, including Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. These solutions combine mobile-optimized website builders with an integrated set of marketing and e-commerce tools, all of which is enhanced with AI. We continue to invest in Websites + Marketing and other tools, templates and technology to make building, maintaining and updating a professional looking mobile or desktop presence simple and easy. We harnessed the foundational expertise we cultivated with respect to AI to introduce multiple customer-facing capabilities in generative AI across our suite of products, including Airo to deliver personalized website content, logos, domains, ready-to-use social media posts, marketing calendars, email communications and more. The automation and content creation abilities inherent in these tools elevate the discoverability of and engagement with our products, creating a true one-stop-shop experience. This further enhances our customers' capacity to market their products, sell online, manage their businesses and grow, all in a seamless, low-friction manner.\nMaking the Business of Business Easy\n. Our business applications range from domain-specific email and email marketing to telephony services and payment tools to help our customers communicate with their customers and grow their ideas. For example, GoDaddy Conversations is a communications platform that helps small businesses support, engage and convert customers through email, text, online chat, social media, voice and video conversations. GoDaddy Conversations is also integrated with Google's Business Messages, allowing customers with Websites + Marketing plans to receive messages from their customers using Google Search and Google Maps. We intend to continue investing in the breadth of our product offerings to help our customers connect with their customers and run their ventures.\nThe Next Generation of Naming\n. We are a global leader in domain name registration, with approximately 81 million domains under management. We offer easy and efficient domain name search tools through our website and mobile application, including search using business descriptions, which enables GoDaddy to better understand intent and suggest a wide variety of creative domain and business name recommendations that suit a customer's needs. Customers can now also use Airo to generate unique domain name suggestions. In addition, through GoDaddy Registry, we operate or provide back-end registry services to approximately 180 TLDs. We also offer an expanded secondary market to help match buyers to sellers who already own domains. With GoDaddy Auctions, customers can find the perfect domain or invest in an inventory of domain listings and exclusive expired auctions, and they can even watch and bid on domains at auction and stay on top of current bids with our GoDaddy Investor mobile application. We continue to invest in search, discovery and recommendation tools and transfer protocols for both primary and secondary domains. In 2024 we started preparations for and work on an approach towards our participation in the next ICANN gTLD round. These efforts will continue throughout 2025. In addition, GoDaddy Registry now provides domain name blocking that is designed to help rights holders to take control of their online identity. \nPartnering Up.\n Our flexible platform enables us to form strategic partnerships and quickly launch new products and offerings for our customers, including through partnerships such as Microsoft 365 for productivity solutions. Additionally, we have built a robust pipeline of future partnership opportunities to continue identifying value-added product and service offerings.\nHarnessing the power of generative AI for our customers. \nWe design our generative AI-powered tools and experiences to enhance our customers' discoverability of and engagement with the full suite of our product offerings and reduce the friction inherent in establishing their online presence and growing their businesses. With such tools, our customers can go from idea to domain to fully published website and content creation abilities in just minutes. In 2023, we introduced Airo, an AI-powered experience designed to build and help grow businesses online, implemented powerful generative AI tools into Websites + Marketing and brought AI-powered solutions to GoDaddy Pros with GoDaddy's AI Assistant in the Pro Hub. In 2024, we continued to build our AI-powered solutions and capabilities with the following:\n17\nTable of Contents\n•\nGoDaddy Airo\n: Continued to build Airo with increased investments in marketing initiatives to support a broader rollout to our customers, and now include Airo for customers that start with a website purchase. Airo also now provides advanced logos and imagery, as well as marketing tools to help our customers grow their businesses. \n•\nSite Optimizer: \nIntroduced our Site Optimizer tool, which can inspect any website and provide actionable recommendations to improve performance.\n•\nManaged WordPress\n: Expanded AI generated content in Managed WordPress, including optimized and enhanced models to generate content for multiple pages of our customers' websites making it easier for customers to build and publish websites.  \nHelping customers sell anything anywhere. \nOur commerce solutions are designed to grow with our customers' businesses by enabling them to seamlessly sell both offline and online, from online marketplaces and social platforms, while easily managing their sales in one place\n. \nIn 2024, we launched and upgraded the following commerce products and services: \n•\nGoDaddy Payments Canada:\n Launched our first international market for GoDaddy Payments with the expansion into the Canadian market, offering Canadian merchants the lowest pricing compared to leading Canadian providers, and similar processing and payment acceptance solutions our U.S. merchants enjoy.\n•\nTap to Pay on GoDaddy App:\n Launched Tap-to-Pay capability in the GoDaddy Mobile App for Android phones, lowering the barrier for millions of small businesses to start accepting in-person, contactless payments in a seamless, low-friction sign-up experience.\n•\nSmart Terminal Flex\n: Launched the new GoDaddy Smart Terminal Flex, a powerful and compact POS device in the GoDaddy Smart Terminal line that is powered by GoDaddy Payments.\n•\nGoDaddy Payments' Subscription Plans\n: Launched two new subscription plans for GoDaddy Payments customers that combine lower transaction fees with advanced commerce features like customized invoices and Pay Links, online ordering, inventory management capabilities, and access to GoDaddy Payments' credit card surcharge program and rate saver.\nIn the future we will continue to innovate in commerce solutions that are easy-to-use, allow our customers to sell anywhere and at industry-low card transaction pricing.\nMarketing\nWe believe GoDaddy is one of the most recognized Internet brands in the U.S. with high brand awareness globally. We established this high level of brand awareness primarily through our advertising campaigns across various platforms including television commercials, print, online and billboards and supplemented these advertising campaigns with our own entrepreneurial customers and social media influencers. Our strong brand helped us attract and retain 20.5 million customers as of December 31, 2024. We intend to continue investing in our brand as we seek to further grow our total customers. \nWe complement our brand marketing efforts with focused and metric-driven direct response marketing to acquire new customers. We use a variety of targeted online marketing programs for lead generation, including search engine marketing, search engine optimization and targeted email and social media marketing campaigns, as well as more traditional direct marketing and indirect channel partner marketing programs, to drive interest in our products and traffic to our websites. As part of this effort, we regularly run campaigns simultaneously and constantly refine our media mix across our channels.\nCentral to our international strategy is a philosophy of scaling our product offerings and customer experience and deploying them through our global infrastructure. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 10.0 million customers outside of the U.S. and derived approximately 32%, 32% and 33% of our total revenue from international sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We built a dedicated team responsible for ensuring scaling and, when necessary, the localization of our core product offerings as well as our customer care and marketing efforts. Our historical international investments have enabled us to successfully launch and expand our business outside the U.S. and as of December 31, 2024, we market and sell to customers in over 200 markets around the world. We take a rigorous approach to managing the level of investment we make and expect to make in each geographic market where we have a presence or expect to have a presence based on a market tier approach. \n18\nTable of Contents\nCompetition\nWe provide cloud-based solutions enabling individuals, businesses and organizations to establish an online presence, connect with customers and manage their ventures. The market for our products and services is highly fragmented and competitive. These types of products and solutions continue to evolve, creating opportunity for new competitors to enter the market with point-solution products or address specific segments of the market. In some instances, we use commercial partnerships with companies with which we also compete. We consider the following to be a representative list of competitors we face in some of the major areas we operate in:\n•\nWith respect to our Core Platform products and services: Newfold Digital, Namecheap, Tucows, Dynadot, GMO, Cloudflare, Let's Encrypt, SEDO, Comodo, Hostinger and Identity Digital;\n•\nWith respect to our A&C products and services: Shopify, Block, BigCommerce, Stripe, PayPal, Liquid Web, SiteGround, WP Engine, Zoho, Mindbody, Toast, Yelp, OpenTable, TikTok, Meta and WeChat; and\n•\nWith respect to both our Core Platform and A&C products and services: Wix, Squarespace, Automattic, Ionos, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Alibaba and Tencent.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors include product capabilities meeting customer requirements, a secure, reliable and integrated technology platform, cost-effective customer acquisition, brand awareness and reputation, customer service and support and overall customer satisfaction. We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors. For additional information, see \"Risk Factors.\"\nRegulation\nOur business is subject to regulation by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), federal and state laws in the U.S. and the laws of other jurisdictions in which we do business.\nICANN\n. The registration of domain names is governed by ICANN, a multi-stakeholder private sector, not-for-profit corporation formed in 1998 for the express purposes of overseeing a number of Internet related tasks, including management of the Domain Name System (DNS), allocation of IP addresses, accreditation of domain name registrars and registries and the definition and coordination of policy development for all of these functions. We are accredited by ICANN as a domain name registrar and registry and thus our ability to offer domain name registration products is subject to our ongoing relationship with, and accreditation by, ICANN. The regulation of Internet domain names in the U.S. and in foreign countries is subject to change. \nccTLD Authorities\n. The regulation of ccTLDs is governed by national regulatory agencies of the country underlying the specific ccTLDs, such as the U.S. (.us), Colombia (.co), China (.cn), Canada (.ca) and the UK (.uk). Our ability to sell ccTLDs is dependent on our and our partners' abilities to maintain accreditation in good standing with these various international authorities.\nAdvertising and promotional information presented on our websites and in our products, and our other marketing and promotional activities, are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws regulating unfair and deceptive practices. U.S. federal, state and foreign legislatures have also adopted laws, rules and regulations regulating numerous other aspects of our business. Regulations relating to the Internet, including laws governing online content, user privacy and data protection, automatic renewal laws, taxation, and liability for third-party activities, are particularly relevant to our business. A sample of such laws, rules and regulations is discussed below.\nCommunications Decency Act (CDA)\n. The CDA regulates content of material on the Internet, and provides immunity to Internet service providers and providers of interactive computer services for certain claims based on content posted by third parties. The CDA and the case law interpreting it generally provide that domain name registrars and website hosting providers cannot be liable for defamatory or obscene content posted by customers on registrars' servers unless they participate in creating or developing the content. The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act and Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act of 2017, which became effective in April 2018, amend certain portions of the CDA, which may limit the immunity previously available to us under the CDA.\nDigital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)\n. The DMCA provides domain name registrars and website hosting providers a safe harbor from liability for third-party copyright infringement. To qualify for the safe harbor, however, registrars and website hosting providers must satisfy numerous requirements, including adopting a user policy providing for termination of service access of users who are repeat infringers, informing users of this policy and implementing the policy in a reasonable manner. In addition, registrars and website hosting providers must expeditiously remove or disable access to content upon receiving a proper \n19\nTable of Contents\nnotice from a copyright owner alleging infringement of its protected works. A registrar or website hosting provider failing to comply with these safe harbor requirements may be found liable for copyright infringement.\nAnti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA)\n. The ACPA was enacted to address piracy on the Internet by curtailing a practice known as \"cybersquatting,\" or the bad-faith registration of a domain name identical or similar to another party's trademark, or to the name of another living person, in order to profit from that name or mark. The ACPA provides that registrars may not be held liable for damages for registration or maintenance of a domain name for another person absent a showing of the registrar's bad faith intent to profit. Registrars may, however, be held liable if their activities are deemed outside the scope of basic registrar functions.\nLanham Act\n. The Lanham Act governs trademarks and false advertising. Case law interpreting the Lanham Act has limited liability for many Internet service providers such as search engines and domain name registrars. Nevertheless, there is no statutory safe harbor for trademark violations comparable to the provisions of the DMCA, and we may be subject to a variety of trademark claims in the future.\nPrivacy and Data Protection\n. In the areas of personal privacy and data protection, the U.S. federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on, and requirements associated with, the collection, distribution, use, storage and security of personal information of individuals. In addition, in several jurisdictions in which we operate, data protection is more highly regulated and rigidly enforced. For example, the European Union (E.U.) has enacted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which includes stringent operational requirements for processors and controllers of E.U. personal data with broad extra-territorial effect and imposes significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act in 2018, effective January 1, 2020, which was further modified by the passage of the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA, and collectively, CCPA). The CCPA and its associated regulations require covered companies to provide specific disclosures to California consumers and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales and sharing of personal information for advertising and other purposes. Numerous other U.S. states have adopted or are considering laws, rules and regulations relating to processing of personal information that apply to our business. We expect compliance with the increasing number of these laws, rules and regulations to be more burdensome and costly for us. \nPayments Regulation\n. Various U.S. federal, state and international laws, rules and regulations govern the payments industry, including the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and state money transmitter licensing laws. Our payments services may become subject to regulation by authorities, which would subject us to, among other things, (i) record-keeping, reporting and bonding requirements, (ii) limitations on the investment of customer funds and (iii) inspection by state and federal regulatory agencies. In order to offer retail point-of-sale solutions that connect to payment networks, retail point-of-sale providers must certify their products and services with the payment card networks, financial institutions and payment processors, as well as comply with government and telecommunications company regulations including those imposed by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and similar telecommunications authorities worldwide.\nArtificial Intelligence\n. AI is the subject of evolving review by various governmental and regulatory agencies around the globe. For example, the E.U. has enacted the EU AI Act, which regulates the development, deployment and use of AI systems with broad extra-territorial effect. In the U.S., various laws, regulations, rules, orders and directives have been proposed or implemented relating to the development, deployment, and use of AI. The regulatory and legal requirements relating to AI are evolving rapidly. Similarly, intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, surrounding AI technologies have not been fully addressed by U.S. courts or other federal or state laws, rules or regulations. We are continually monitoring developments in global AI laws, rules and regulations to evaluate and comply with requirements applicable to our business.\nLaws, rules and regulations relating to our activities are unsettled in many jurisdictions and may prove difficult or impossible to comply with in some jurisdictions. Additionally, federal, state, local and foreign governments are also considering legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet and our activities in more and different ways than exist today. Laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions may be applied in new or different manners in pending or future litigation. Further, other existing bodies of law, including the criminal laws of various jurisdictions, may be deemed to apply to our activities, or new statutes or regulations may be adopted in the future. It is also impossible to predict whether new taxes will be imposed on our services, and depending upon the type of such taxes, whether and how we would be affected. \nIntellectual Property and Proprietary Rights\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret laws, confidentiality and access-related procedures and safeguards and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technologies, confidential information, brands and other intellectual property.\n20\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 368 issued patents in the U.S. and other countries covering various aspects of our product offerings. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, we had 11 pending U.S. and international patent applications and intend to file additional patent applications in the future. As of December 31, 2024, we had 588 registered and 55 pending trademarks in jurisdictions including the U.S., E.U., UK, China and Germany.\nWe have non-disclosure, confidentiality and license agreements with employees, contractors, customers and other third parties, which limit access to and use of our proprietary information. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, as well as various procedural safeguards, we believe the skill and ingenuity of our employees, the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions and our ability to introduce new products and features meeting the needs of our customers are more important to maintaining our competitive position in the marketplace.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines and logos in the U.S. and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. We also have common law rights in some unregistered trademarks that were established over years of use. In addition, we have a trademark and service mark enforcement program pursuant to which we monitor applications filed by third parties to register trademarks and service marks that may be confusingly similar to ours, as well as the use of our major brand names in social media, domain names and other Internet sites.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated in Delaware on May 28, 2014. Our principal executive offices are located at 100 S. Mill Ave, Suite 1600, Tempe, Arizona 85281, and our telephone number is (480) 505-8800.\nAvailable Information\nOur website is located at www.godaddy.com and our investor relations website is located at investors.godaddy.net.

    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision in our common stock. Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below and the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our other public filings. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition, reputation, operating results and growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, reputation and growth prospects.\nRisk Factor Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and growth prospects.\n•\nIf we are unable to attract and retain customers and increase sales to new and existing customers, our business and operating results would be harmed.\n•\nIf we do not successfully develop and market products that anticipate or respond timely to the needs of our customers, our business and operating results may suffer.\n•\nThe use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability.\n•\nWe face significant competition for our products, which we expect will continue to intensify, and we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position or market share.\n•\nOur pricing decisions may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers. \n•\nThe future growth of our business depends in part on our international revenue. Our continued international presence could subject us to additional risks.\n•\nWe have taken significant actions to support profitable growth. These actions may not succeed. If we do not effectively manage future growth, our operating results will be adversely affected.\n•\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions, including investments or entries into new businesses, joint ventures, divestitures or other transactions, could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results.\n•\nWe are exposed to the risk of system failures and capacity constraints.\n•\nWe rely on information technology systems, including third-party cloud computing systems, and data centers to deliver many of our products and services. These information technology systems and data centers may experience outages, disruptions or degradations, and we may otherwise lose access to the services third-party service providers provide to us, any of which could impact our services, products and technology infrastructure.\n•\nAn actual or perceived cybersecurity incident could impair our ability to conduct business, provide our products or services, protect data, and comply with contractual or legal obligations, and may cause us to incur substantial costs, or subject us to significant liability.\n•\nWe rely on our marketing efforts and channels to maintain awareness of our brand and acquire new customers. These efforts may require significant expense and may not be successful or cost-effective.\n•\nOur ability to increase sales of our products is highly dependent on the quality of our customer care. Our failure to provide high-quality customer care would have an adverse effect on our business, brand and operating results.\n•\nOur failure to properly register or maintain our customers' domain names or comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to domain name registration and maintenance could subject us to additional liability, regulatory action, expenses, claims of loss or negative publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n•\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor or analyst expectations.\n•\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business and our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, as well as divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\n22\nTable of Contents\n•\nLaws, regulations, policies or claims concerning the domain name registration system and the Internet in general, and industry reactions to those policies or claims, may cause instability in the industry and disrupt our business.\n•\nWe are subject to local and international laws, rules, regulations and orders relating to the operation and security of our computer network and the processing of data, including personal data.\n•\nOur business depends on our customers' continued and unimpeded access to the Internet and the development and maintenance of Internet infrastructure. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade or charge for access to certain of our products, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of customers.\n•\nOur business could be affected by new governmental regulations regarding the Internet.\n•\nWe may face liability or become involved in disputes over registration and transfer of domain names and control over websites.\n•\nOur payments-related operations, including GoDaddy Payments, are subject to various laws, regulations, and restrictions. Our failure to comply with such rules, regulations, and restrictions regarding our payments-related operations or properly manage the risks inherent to such operations could materially harm our business. \n•\nOur share price may be volatile, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nStrategic Risks\nIf we are unable to attract and retain customers and increase sales to new and existing customers, our business and operating results would be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers and increase sales to new and existing customers. Although our total customers and revenue have grown rapidly in the past, in recent periods our growth rates have slowed or declined, reflecting the larger size, scale and maturity of parts of our business. We cannot be assured that we will achieve increasing growth rates in future periods as our total customers and revenue could decline or grow slower than we expect as a result of a number of factors, such as lower demand or satisfaction with our solutions, the timeliness and success of new products or product enhancements, pricing of our solutions compared to our competitors, competitive conditions, customer spending levels, changes in the type and size of our customer base, the reliability and availability of our customer support, general economic and global market conditions,  or other factors that are not known to us at this time.\nWe have experienced growth in recent years, due in large part to sustained subscription growth and strong levels of subscription renewals, including customers who expand their use of our integrated platform over time. Our costs associated with renewals are lower than costs associated with acquiring new customers and selling additional products to existing customers. Therefore, our inability to attract new customers, or a reduction in renewals, even if offset by an increase in other revenue could reduce our operating margins in the near term and could have a material adverse effect on our business, growth prospects and operating results.\nMoreover, we focus our operations on entrepreneurs, customers with new ventures and those with established small and medium-sized businesses. We aim to grow our revenues by adding new customers, selling additional business solutions to these customers and encouraging them to continue to use and purchase our products and services. However, these customers often have limited budgets and may choose not to allocate resources to our solutions, especially in times of economic uncertainty or recessions. In addition, varying economic conditions could result in decreases or increases in business formations or failures of businesses we serve. If this market fails to be as lucrative as we project or we are unable to market and sell our services to these businesses effectively, or we are unable to increase sales of our products to all customer segments we target, or may target in the future, our ability to grow our revenues and maintain profitability will be harmed.\nIf we do not successfully develop and market products that anticipate or respond timely to the needs of our customers, our business and operating results may suffer.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by constant change and innovation, frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards. We expect these markets to continue to rapidly evolve. Our historical success has been based on our ability to identify and anticipate customer needs and design products that provide our customers with the tools they need to grow their businesses. For example, in 2023 we launched Airo, an AI-powered, customizable experience designed to automatically build the interconnected pieces of what we call the \"Entrepreneur's Wheel,\" to save our customers time and effort. We also continue to expand our commerce offerings, for example, by rolling out GoDaddy Payments in Canada, launching new SaaS plans offering premium commerce features and discounted fees, introducing a new point-of-sale \n23\nTable of Contents\ndevice to our line of GoDaddy Smart Terminals and providing on-the-go solutions such as Tap-to-Pay in the GoDaddy Mobile App, Pay Links and Virtual Terminal.\nWe must continue to identify our customers' needs and develop new and enhanced technology to maintain our competitive position. The process of developing new solutions and enhancements is complex, uncertain and can be costly. Our new products or product enhancements could fail to attain meaningful customer acceptance for many reasons, including:\n•\nfailure to accurately predict market demand or customer preferences;\n•\nfailure to bring products to market on a timely or cost effective basis; \n•\ndefects, errors or failures in product design or performance;\n•\nnegative publicity about product performance or effectiveness, including negative comments on social media;\n•\nthe perceived value of our products or product enhancements relative to their cost;\n•\nscalability of products or product enhancements;\n•\ngeneral satisfaction of our customers;\n•\nchanging regulatory requirements adversely affecting the products we offer; and\n•\npoor business conditions for our customers or poor general macroeconomic conditions.\nIf our new products or enhancements do not achieve adequate acceptance by our customers, or if our new products do not result in increased sales or subsequent renewals, our competitive position will be impaired, our anticipated revenue growth may not be achieved and the negative impact on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the upfront technology and development, marketing and advertising and other expenses we may incur in connection with new products or enhancements.\nThe use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability.\nWe are increasingly using new and rapidly evolving technologies, such as AI, to, among other things, develop new tools and products, and additional features in our existing products, including ongoing deployment and improvement of existing AI, and the development of new product technologies, such as generative AI. For example, in 2023 we launched Airo, an AI-powered, customizable experience designed to automatically build the interconnected pieces of what we call the \"Entrepreneur's Wheel,\" to save our customers time and effort. There are significant risks involved in the development, adoption, use, deployment and maintenance of AI, such as an increase in intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, confidentiality, operational and technological risks, as well as risks associated with harmful content, accuracy, bias and discrimination, any of which could affect our further development, adoption, use, deployment and maintenance of AI, and may cause us to incur additional research and development costs to resolve any issues arising from such risks. In addition to the foregoing risks, the introduction of AI technologies into new or existing products may result in new or enhanced governmental or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, ethical concerns or other complications that could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial results. \nLegal and regulatory frameworks related to the use of AI are rapidly evolving, as regulation of the use of AI continues to be considered and adopted by various U.S. and international governmental and regulatory entities, including the E.U., the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Several jurisdictions have also passed, or are considering, new laws, rules and regulations relating to the use of AI or its outputs. For example, in 2024, the E.U. adopted the E.U. AI Act and U.S. states, including Colorado and California, have adopted laws, rules and regulations directly relating to the use of AI or extending the application of existing laws, rules and regulations to AI systems and outputs. Any failure by us to comply with any AI-related laws, rules and regulations could result in fines and negative publicity, which could result in reputational harm and damage to our business. In addition, the future impact of these or other new laws, rules or regulations on us is uncertain. We may not be able to adequately anticipate or respond to new laws, rules and regulations, and we may need to expend additional resources to adjust our offerings in certain jurisdictions if applicable legal frameworks are inconsistent across jurisdictions. The costs of complying with such laws, rules or regulations could be significant and would increase our operating expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, many existing laws, rules and regulations apply to certain aspects of AI, such as automated decision making affecting fundamental data subject rights. Similarly, the intellectual property ownership and license rights, including as related to copyright, surrounding AI technologies has not been fully addressed by international and U.S. courts or the laws, rules or regulations of the U.S., including U.S. states, and foreign jurisdictions. Any content created by us using generative AI tools may \n24\nTable of Contents\nnot be subject to intellectual property protection which may affect our ability to commercialize such content. The use or adoption of AI technologies in our products and services may subject us to copyright infringement or other intellectual property claims. If we, or third-party developers whose AI we rely on, do not have sufficient rights to use the data or other material used or processed by such AI technology, we also may incur liability through the actual or alleged violation of applicable laws, rules and regulations, third-party intellectual property, privacy, or other rights or contractual obligations. We may not always be able to anticipate how to comply with these legal and regulatory frameworks and we may have to expend resources to adjust our tools, products or other offerings to meet standards set by such frameworks, which may vary by jurisdiction if AI-related legal and regulatory frameworks are not consistent across jurisdictions. Any inability to appropriately comply with the evolving AI regulatory landscape could result in legal liability, regulatory action or brand and reputational harm. \nOur reliance on the use of AI could also pose ethical concerns and lead to a lack of human oversight and control. If we enable or offer solutions that draw controversy, or these new offerings do not work as we describe them, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm or legal liability. Further, generative AI may create content that appears correct but is factually inaccurate, incomplete, insufficient, biased or otherwise flawed or contains copyrighted or other protected material, which may not be easily detectable despite internal policies and diligence efforts we may have in place which are designed to mitigate such deficiencies. To the extent we or our customers rely on such results, we could incur operational inefficiencies, competitive harm, brand or reputational harm, or other adverse impacts on our business and results of operations. Additionally, if any of our employees, contractors, vendors or service providers use any third-party AI-powered software in connection with our business or the services they provide to us, it may lead to the inadvertent disclosure of our personal, sensitive, proprietary or confidential information into publicly available third-party training sets, which may impact our ability to realize the benefit of, or adequately maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property or our personal, sensitive, proprietary or confidential information, harming our competitive position and business. The rapid evolution of the use of AI requires and will continue to require resources to develop, test and maintain our products and services to help ensure that AI is implemented appropriately in order to minimize unintended and harmful impacts. \nIt is not possible to predict all of the risks related to the use of AI, and changes in laws, rules, directives and regulations governing AI may adversely affect our development, adoption, use, deployment and maintenance of AI or subject us to legal liability, regulatory action or brand and reputational harm.\nEvolving technologies and administration of the Internet, and the resulting changes in customer behavior and customer practices may impact the value of and demand for our products, including domain names and our websites.\nThe domain name registration market continues to evolve and adapt to changing technology. This evolution has and may in the future include changes in the administration or operation of the Internet, including the creation and institution of alternate systems for directing Internet traffic without using the existing domain name registration system, or fundamental changes in the domain name resolution protocol used by web browsers and other Internet applications. The widespread acceptance of any alternative system, such as mobile applications or closed networks, could eliminate the need to register a domain name to establish an online presence and could materially and adversely affect our business.\nIn addition, businesses rely heavily on social media channels, such as Meta, TikTok, Snapchat, X and WeChat, to reach their customers, and consumers are accessing the Internet more frequently through applications on mobile devices. As reliance on these applications increases, domain names may become less prominent and their value may decline. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with these applications and mobile devices. If we are unable to effectively integrate our products within these applications or on these devices, we may lose market share. These evolving technologies and changes in customer behavior may have an adverse effect on our business and growth prospects.\nWe face significant competition for our products, which we expect will continue to intensify, and we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position or market share.\nThe market for our products and services is highly competitive and we expect this competition to continue in the future as existing and new competitors introduce new solutions or enhance existing solutions. In addition, given our broad product portfolio, we compete with niche point-solution products as well as broader solution providers. These types of products and solutions continue to evolve, creating opportunities for new competitors to enter the market with point-solution products or address specific segments of the market. Our competitors include providers of domain registration services, web-hosting solutions, website creation and management solutions, e-commerce enablement providers, payment facilitation providers, cloud computing service and online security providers, alternative web presence and marketing solutions providers and providers of productivity tools such as business-class email.\n25\nTable of Contents\nWe and our competitors continue to invest in AI, including generative AI and integration of AI capabilities into products and services. AI technology and services are highly competitive, rapidly evolving, and at times require significant investment, including with respect to development and operational costs, to meet the changing needs and expectations of our existing and potential customers. Further, other companies may develop AI products and technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies or more cost-effective to deploy. Any failure to successfully develop, adopt, use and maintain AI products and services, or effectively manage the related operational risks, could harm our reputation. Refer to our risk factor \"The use of new and evolving technologies, such as AI, in our offerings may result in reputational harm and liability\" for further information concerning the legal and other risks arising from the development, adoption, use, deployment and maintenance of AI.\nSome of our current and potential competitors could have greater resources, more brand recognition and consumer awareness, more diversified product offerings, greater international scope and larger customer bases than we do, and we may therefore not be able to effectively compete with them. In addition, some of our competitors may seek to disrupt the market by offering their services and products at low or no cost. If our competitors decide to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of products in the markets in which we compete, or if the products offered by these companies are more attractive to or better meet the evolving needs of our customers, our market share, growth prospects and operating results may be adversely affected. \nIncreased competition in our industry could result in lower sales, price reductions, reduced margins, loss of market share and increased marketing expenses. Further, conditions in our market could rapidly and significantly change as a result of technological advancements, partnering by our competitors, market consolidation, the invention of similar or superior products and technologies or solution enhancements, which compete with our products and technologies. Our ability to continue to compete will depend upon our ability to provide better solutions than our competitors at more competitive prices. For additional information regarding our competitors, see the section titled \"Competition,\" contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report. \nOur pricing decisions may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nFrom time to time, we have changed our overall pricing model or the various price points of our products and services and we expect to do so in the future. However, no assurance can be given that any new pricing model or price points will be optimal and changes in our price points or pricing model could result in a loss of customers or bookings. In addition, our competitors have in the past implemented, and may in the future implement, various pricing and bundling strategies, including discounts and reductions in price, which may be similar to or more attractive than our own. Individuals as well as small and medium sized businesses have been and could be sensitive to price increases or swayed by different price points offered by competitors. If changes in our pricing model or price points are unsuccessful, or the strategies of our competitors are more successful than our own, we may be unable to attract new customers or retain our existing customers and we may be required to reduce prices or make other changes to our pricing model to remain competitive. Any of these developments could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe future growth of our business depends in part on increasing our international revenue. Our continued international presence could subject us to additional risks.\nInternational revenue represented approximately 32%, 32% and 33% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We continue to review and add systems as necessary to accept payments in forms common outside of the U.S., optimize our marketing efforts in numerous non-U.S. geographies, equip our customer care team with the knowledge to serve these markets and maintain or establish, as needed, customer care operations in overseas locations. Conducting and expanding international business subjects us to risks we generally do not face in the U.S., including:\n•\nmanagement, communication and integration problems resulting from language barriers, cultural differences and geographic dispersion of our customers and personnel;\n•\nlanguage translation of, and associated customer care guidance for, our products;\n•\ncompliance with international laws, rules and regulations, including laws, rules and regulations regarding consumer protection, the Internet and e-commerce or mobile commerce, intellectual property, online disclaimers and advertising, liability of Internet service providers for activities of customers especially with respect to hosted content, competition, anti-bribery, privacy, data protection and cybersecurity;\n•\naccreditation and other regulatory requirements to do business and to provide domain name registration and registry services, web-hosting and other products in foreign jurisdictions;\n26\nTable of Contents\n•\ngreater difficulty in enforcing contracts, including our universal terms of service and other agreements due to differences in local legal regimes and court systems;\n•\nincreased expenses incurred in establishing and maintaining office space and equipment for our international business;\n•\ngreater costs and expenses associated with international marketing and operations;\n•\ngreater risk of unexpected changes in regulatory practices, tariffs, trade disputes and tax laws and treaties;\n•\nincreased exposure to foreign currency risks;\n•\nheightened risk of unfair or corrupt business practices in certain geographies, and compliance with anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; \n•\ncompliance with market access regulations, tariffs and import, export and general trade regulations, including economic sanctions and embargoes; \n•\nthe potential for political, social or economic unrest, terrorism, hostilities or war; and\n•\nmultiple and possibly overlapping tax regimes.\nMaintaining business in international markets has required and will continue to require management attention and financial resources. These additional costs may increase our costs of acquiring international customers, which may impair our ability to maintain profitability in the future. We may also face pressure to lower our prices in order to compete in emerging markets, which could adversely affect revenue derived from our international business. \nGeopolitical changes could impair our growth prospects and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, such as geopolitical events involving China, Ukraine/Russia and the Middle East. Certain of our operations and business are in higher risk regions such as China, India and Ukraine. We do not have material operations in China or Ukraine but our operations have grown, and we may continue to grow in India. Although we have not seen a material impact, these and other factors associated with our international business could impair our growth prospects and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S., UK and E.U. governments, among others, developed coordinated financial and economic sanctions targeting Russia. As such, we opted to shut down our GoDaddy website in Russia and removed support for the Ruble. Our business has not been materially impacted to date by the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East. However, it is impossible to predict the extent to which our operations will be impacted or the ways in which geopolitical changes may impact our business in the long term.\nWe have taken significant actions to support profitable growth. These actions may not succeed. If we do not effectively manage future growth, our operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe continue to work to increase the breadth and scope of our business, operations and our product offerings. To support future growth, we must continue to improve our information technology and financial infrastructure, operating and administrative systems and our ability to effectively manage headcount, capital and processes. We are likely to recognize the costs associated with these actions earlier than some of the anticipated benefits, and the return on these actions may be lower or may develop more slowly than we expect. If we do not achieve the benefits anticipated from these actions, or if the achievement of these benefits is delayed, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, expenses relating to our investments in international business and infrastructure, such as: (i) our offerings and marketing presence in India, Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, and Asia; (ii) our marketing spend to attract new customers, such as WebPros and Independents in non-U.S. markets; and (iii) investments in software systems and additional data center resources to keep pace with the growth of our cloud infrastructure and cloud-based product offerings. We have made, and may make in the future, significant investments in product development, corporate infrastructure, technology and development, marketing and our GoDaddy Guides.\nAs we continue to grow, our management, administrative, operational and financial infrastructure may be strained. The scalability and flexibility of our infrastructure depends on the functionality and bandwidth of our data centers, peering sites and servers. The number of total customers over the years and the increase in the number of transactions we process have increased the amount of our stored customer data. Any loss of data or disruption in our ability to provide our product offerings due to disruptions in our infrastructure, services or third parties we rely on could result in harm to our brand or reputation. Moreover, as our customer base continues to grow and uses our integrated platform for more complicated tasks, we will need to devote \n27\nTable of Contents\nadditional resources to improve our infrastructure and to enhance its scalability and security. If we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could harm our operating and business results.\nAcquisitions and other strategic transactions, including investments or entries into new businesses, joint ventures, divestitures or other transactions, could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results. \nAs part of our business strategy, we routinely evaluate opportunities that we believe could complement or supplement our business and address the needs of our customers, including possible acquisitions or investments in companies, talent, products, intangible assets or technologies, and for potential joint ventures, new lines of business, or other strategic investments. Such transactions could result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, and could involve a number of risks, such as: \n•\ndiversion of management’s attention, available cash and other resources from our existing business;  \n•\nincurrence of substantial debt or requirements to issue equity securities; \n•\ndifficulty integrating and managing the acquired products, talent, technology and security infrastructures, new brands and acquired customers; \n•\nexposure to litigation or other claims, including related to intellectual property, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, AI, regulatory compliance practices or employment; \n•\nunforeseen costs or liabilities;  \n•\nadverse tax consequences;  \n•\nretention and integration of employees from an acquired company, including potential risks and challenges to our company's culture, and ability to maintain and integrate systems and operations if such employees are geographically dispersed or choose not to work with us once acquired;  \n•\ncompliance with new or increased regulatory requirements;  \n•\nadverse effects to our existing business relationships, lack of customer acceptance, or inability to attract new customers; and \n•\ninability to compete effectively in a new line of business due to lack of experience or knowledge, or other external factors, such as competitive alternatives, potential conflicts of interest, or shifting market preferences.\nIn addition, we may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions, each of which could adversely affect our financial condition or the value of our Class A common stock. Equity issuances in connection with potential future acquisitions may also result in dilution to our stockholders.  \nIf we fail to properly evaluate, execute or integrate acquisitions or investments, or are unable to effectively compete in a new line of business, the anticipated benefits may not be realized, we may be exposed to unknown or unanticipated liabilities and our business and growth prospects could be harmed. In addition, any future acquisitions, investments or other strategic transactions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers, investors or industry analysts. Any inability to integrate completed acquisitions in an efficient and timely manner could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur company's culture has contributed to our success, and if we cannot maintain this culture as we grow, we could lose the innovation, creativity, passion and teamwork that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed.\nWe believe a critical contributor to our success has been our company's culture, which we rely on to foster innovation, creativity, a customer-centric focus, passion, teamwork, collaboration and loyalty. \nWe have invested substantial time and resources to build and maintain this \nculture. Any failure to preserve these aspects of our company's culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to ensure employees effectively focus on and pursue our company objectives. Our company's culture is central to our devoted GoDaddy Guides, who are a key component of the value we offer our customers. As we continue to evolve our business, expand our global footprint and product portfolio and rely more on remote, foreign and third-party workers, we may need to expend additional efforts and focus to maintain these important aspects of our culture, which could limit our ability to innovate and operate effectively. If we are not successful in these efforts, our growth and operations could be adversely affected.\n28\nTable of Contents\nCurrently none of our employees in the U.S. are subject to collective bargaining agreements, however, if areas of our workforce were to organize, we may find it difficult to maintain our culture, cost structure and control over the delivery of our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations. Certain of our employees in Germany are represented by employee works councils and elsewhere some international employees are represented by worker representatives in accordance with local regulations.\nOperational Risks\nWe are exposed to the risk of system failures and capacity constraints.\nWe have experienced, and may in the future experience, system failures and outages disrupting the operation of our websites or our products such as web-hosting and email, or the availability of our customer care operations. Our revenue depends in large part on the volume of traffic to our websites, the number of customers whose websites we host on our servers and the availability of our customer care operations. Accordingly, the performance, reliability and availability of our websites and servers for our corporate operations and infrastructure, as well as in the delivery of products to customers, are critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers. Any such system failure or outage could generate negative publicity, which could negatively impact our reputation and financial results. As we continue to transition many of our services to Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host our products, we have become, and may further become, more dependent on third-parties to accommodate the traffic to our websites and those of our customers.\nWe continually work to expand and enhance our website features, technology and network infrastructure and other technologies to accommodate current levels of and potential increases in (i) the volume of traffic on our godaddy.com and affiliated websites, (ii) the number of customer websites we host and (iii) our total customers. We may be unable to project accurately the rate or timing of these increases or to successfully allocate resources to address such increases, which could have a negative impact on customer experience and our financial results. In the future, we may be required to allocate additional resources, including spending substantial amounts to build, purchase or lease data centers and equipment and upgrade our technology and network infrastructure to handle increased customer traffic, as well as increased traffic to customer websites we host. We also expect to increasingly rely on third-party cloud computing and hosting providers such as AWS as we transition to the public cloud. We cannot predict whether we will be able to continue to add network capacity from third-party suppliers as we require it. In addition, our network or our suppliers' networks might be unable to achieve or maintain data transmission capacity high enough to process orders or download data effectively or in a timely manner. Our failure, or our suppliers' failure, to achieve or maintain high data transmission capacity could significantly reduce consumer demand for our products. The property and business interruption insurance coverage we carry may be subject to fact-dependent and incident-specific exclusions or may not be adequate to compensate us fully for losses that may occur.\nWe rely on information technology systems, including third-party cloud computing systems, and data centers to deliver many of our products and services. These information technology systems and data centers may experience outages, disruptions or degradations, and we may otherwise lose access to the services third-party service providers provide to us, any of which could impact our services, products and technological infrastructure.\nTo deliver our products and services, we rely on data centers and third-party service providers, including providers of cloud computing services, to perform certain technology, processing, servicing and support functions on our behalf. We own one data center in Arizona and lease our remaining data center capacity from wholesale providers. The reliable performance of our products and services depends on the continuing operation and availability of our information technology systems, including our data centers, and those of our external service providers, including third-party “cloud” computing services. The reliable delivery and stability of our products and services could be adversely impacted by security incidents, outages, disruptions, failures, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, human error, or degradations of our network and related infrastructure, including in the online platforms or services of key business partners that offer, support or host our products and services, or by other events outside or within our control, such as the migration of data among data centers and to third-party hosted environments, the performance of upgrades and maintenance on our systems, and effectively scaling our technological infrastructure, which we have undertaken in the past.\nIf we or our external business partners were to experience an event that caused a system outage, disruption or degradation, or if a transition among data centers or service providers or an upgrade or maintenance session encountered unexpected interruptions, unforeseen complexity or unplanned disruptions, our products and services may not be available to consumers or may not be delivered reliably and stably. In addition, if our agreements for our data centers and with our service providers are terminated, if we are unable to renew such agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if the service \n29\nTable of Contents\nproviders close the facilities or cease providing the services on which we rely, we may be required to transfer to a new service provider, and our agreements may not provide us with adequate time to transfer operations to a new facility in the event of a termination. As a result, our reputation and brand may be harmed, consumer engagement with our products and services may be reduced, and our revenue and profitability could be negatively impacted. We do not have redundancy for all our systems, many of our critical applications reside in only one of our data centers, and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. In addition, we may have limited remedies against these third parties in the event of service disruptions. If third parties are unable to perform these functions on our behalf because of service interruptions or extended outages, or because those services are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms, our expenses could increase and our customers' use of our products could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented, all of which could adversely affect our business.\nEnhancements or migration of information and data to new technology platforms, systems or applications may disrupt our operations or could expose us to a cyber attack or other cybersecurity incident which could delay or interrupt service to our customers, harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to significant liability. \nWe maintain information and data (including personal data) on various platforms, systems and applications. From time to time, to support our growth, we review and make enhancements to our existing platforms or migrate information and data to new platforms, systems and applications. While we are engaged in this work, we may experience difficulties in managing our existing platforms, systems and applications, which could disrupt our operations, the provision of our products and services to our customers, the management of our finances and the reporting of our financial results. If we determine new platforms, systems or applications or updates to existing platforms, systems or applications are necessary, we may need to rely on legacy platforms, systems or applications while we plan for implementation of such new or updated platforms, systems or applications and such legacy platforms, systems or applications may not be able to scale efficiently as our business grows, which may delay future product or service launches or enhancements. In addition, any new platforms, systems or applications may operate differently than anticipated when introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released, or there may be unforeseen consequences as a result of these migrations that may cause disruptions to the availability of our products and services due to service outages, downtime or other similar issues that could harm our business. Further, our transition could involve significant time and expense. Our failure to improve our platforms, systems or applications, complete such implementations, enhancements or migrations on a timely basis, or a failure of such platforms, systems or applications to operate in the intended manner, may result in our inability to manage the growth of our business, successfully integrate our acquisitions and to accurately forecast and report our results, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the migration of information and data could subject us to additional risks of cyber attacks and other cybersecurity incidents, including improper access to our or our customers' data (including personal data) which could delay or interrupt service to our customers, cause us to not be in compliance with applicable local or international laws, rules or regulations or harm our reputation, any of which could cause us to incur substantial costs or subject us to significant liabilities. Refer to our risk factor \"An actual or perceived cybersecurity incident could impair our ability to conduct business, provide our products and services, protect data, and comply with contractual or legal obligations, and may cause us to incur substantial costs, or subject us to significant liability\" for further information. \nWe substantially rely upon AWS to operate our integrated platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of AWS would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nA substantial portion of our cloud infrastructure is provisioned through AWS, which hosts some of our products and platforms. Our customers need to be able to access our platform at any time, without interruption or degradation of performance. AWS runs its own platform that we access, and we are, therefore, vulnerable to service interruptions at AWS. We may experience interruptions, delays and outages in service and availability of AWS services due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions and capacity constraints due to any number of potential causes, including technical failures, natural disasters, pandemics, fraud or cybersecurity attacks, all of which could impact our service to our customers. In addition, if the security of AWS is compromised, or our products or platform are unavailable or our users are unable to use our products within a reasonable amount of time or at all, then our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In some instances, AWS or we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within a period of time acceptable to our customers. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our platform performance, especially during peak usage times, as our products become more complex and the usage of our products increases. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, either through AWS or alternative providers of cloud infrastructure, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. In addition, any changes in service levels from AWS may adversely affect our ability to meet our customers’ requirements, result in negative publicity which could harm our reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our platform.\n30\nTable of Contents\nWe use AWS primarily for cloud-based server capacity and, to a lesser extent, storage and other optimization offerings. AWS enables us to order and reserve server capacity in varying amounts and sizes distributed across multiple regions. We access AWS infrastructure through standard IP connectivity. AWS provides us with computing and storage capacity pursuant to an agreement that continues until terminated by either party. AWS may terminate the agreement for cause upon notice and upon our failure to cure a breach within 45 days from the date of such notification and may, in some cases, suspend the agreement immediately for cause upon notice. Although we expect that we could receive similar services from other third parties, if any of our arrangements with AWS are terminated, we could experience interruptions on our platform and in our ability to make our products available to customers, as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging alternative cloud infrastructure services. Any of the above circumstances or events may harm our reputation, erode customer trust, cause customers to stop using our products, impair our ability to increase revenue from existing customers, impair our ability to grow our customer base, subject us to financial penalties and liabilities under our service level agreements and otherwise harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAn actual or perceived cybersecurity incident could impair our ability to conduct business, provide our products and services, protect data, and comply with contractual or legal obligations, and may cause us to incur substantial costs, or subject us to significant liability.\nOur operations depend on our ability to protect our information systems against interruption, a breach of confidentiality, or other damage from cybersecurity threats and incidents.\n \nOur large size and global computer network expose us to a wide variety of cybersecurity threats that include cyber attacks from individuals, organized crime groups, nation-state sponsored organizations, and others (collectively, threat actors). These cyberattacks can take many different forms, including but not limited to deploying malicious software, exploiting hardware and software vulnerabilities, social engineering, or other actions to gain access to our systems and data or disrupt our operations. In addition, cyberattacks are constantly evolving as threat actors discover new vulnerabilities and leverage new techniques and technologies, including through the use of AI. For example, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, an increase in social engineering attacks to conduct sophisticated phishing campaigns. Although we have made investments in cybersecurity defenses, we cannot guarantee that our defenses (or those of our third-party service providers) will be sufficient to prevent disruption or unauthorized access to our systems. \nIn addition to threats from external threat actors, we face internal cybersecurity threats related to our own operations. These threats may include human error, intentional misconduct, or accidental failures. Although we have made investments in cybersecurity defenses designed to guard against insider threats, we cannot guarantee that our defenses (or those of our third-party service providers) will be sufficient to prevent an insider from causing unauthorized disruption or access to our systems or data. \nIf our cybersecurity defenses (or those of our third-party service providers) are insufficient to prevent a cybersecurity incident, we may experience significant disruption of our business, substantial costs, reputational harm, and liability. Any actual or suspected cybersecurity incident may disrupt our business by, among other things, making our network, systems and services partially or totally unavailable or by destroying, corrupting, exposing, or otherwise unlawfully processing data necessary for us or our customers to conduct business. An actual or suspected cybersecurity incident also may cause us to incur a wide range of costs, including but not limited to acquiring new hardware and software to repair our systems or remediate the effects of the incident, retaining external consultants, and providing notice to affected customers, individuals, and government authorities. A cybersecurity incident also may cause reputational harm if, for example, customers believe that we are unable to protect our systems or their data (including sensitive, confidential, proprietary, and personal data). Finally, we have been and in the future may be subject to litigation or governmental investigations relating to our failure to prevent a cybersecurity incident.\n \nWe have purchased cybersecurity insurance to cover the costs and potential liability arising from cybersecurity incidents. Our coverage, however, includes significant deductibles. We also cannot ensure that our existing cybersecurity insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us, continue to be available on acceptable terms, or at all, or that the insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim.\n \nThus, we cannot guarantee that our insurance will provide coverage for a specific cybersecurity incident or will be sufficient to cover all the potential costs and liabilities of any specific cybersecurity incident.\nIf we experience fraudulent activity relating to our, or our third-party vendors’ products and services, we could suffer service interruptions or incur substantial costs.\nOur products and services, and the products and services of our third-party vendors and partners, may be subject to fraudulent usage, including, but not limited to domain name hijacking, revenue share fraud, and other fraudulent schemes (external fraudulent activity). In addition, although our customers are required to set passwords or personal identification numbers \n31\nTable of Contents\nto protect their accounts, third parties have in the past been, and may in the future be, able to access and use our customers' accounts through fraudulent means. Fraudulent activity can result in, among other things, interruption of our services to our customers, and substantial business and reputational harm to ourselves and to our customers. Although we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot be certain that our efforts to address external fraudulent activity and the use of our, or our third parties' and vendors' products and services, will be successful in eliminating these threats, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on our marketing efforts and channels to maintain awareness of our brand and acquire new customers. These efforts may require significant expense and may not be successful.\nWe use a variety of marketing channels to maintain awareness of our brand, including online keyword search, sponsorships and endorsements, television, radio and print advertising, email and social media marketing. Our GoDaddy Guides also market our brand through their recommendations of our products or solutions to specifically meet the needs of our customers. In order to maintain and grow our revenues, we need to continuously optimize and diversify our marketing campaigns and strategies and increase our efforts to expand customer awareness of our brand and portfolio of products. There can be no assurance that our marketing efforts will succeed. If we lose access to one or more of these channels, we may be unable to promote our brand effectively, which could limit our ability to grow our business. Protecting and maintaining awareness of our brand is important to our success, particularly for continued acceptance of our existing and future products and solutions, attracting new customers and increasing customer awareness of our full product portfolio. Further, if our marketing activities fail to generate traffic to our website, attract new customers or lead to new sales or renewals of our products at the levels we anticipate or our efforts to personalize our marketing efforts are not successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIn the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our marketing and advertising expenses were $356.9 million, $352.9 million and $412.3 million, respectively. If these costs or our customer acquisition costs increase or we fail to generate additional sales as a result of our marketing efforts, our business, operating results and financial performance could be adversely affected. \nOur ability to increase sales of our products is highly dependent on the quality of our customer care. Our failure to provide high-quality customer care would have an adverse effect on our business, brand and operating results.\nWe believe our focus on high-quality customer care is critical to retaining, expanding and further penetrating our customer base, as well as generating additional sales of products to our customers. Our GoDaddy Guides have historically contributed significantly to our total bookings. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately 8%, 9%, and 10% of our total bookings, respectively, were generated from the sale of product subscriptions by our GoDaddy Guides. Most of our current offerings are designed for customers who often self-identify as having limited to no technology skills. Our customers depend on our GoDaddy Guides to guide them as they create, manage and grow their identities, support their presence, both online and offline, and enable them with products to meet their commerce needs. Our GoDaddy Guides engage with customers through direct calls and/or via other communication channels, such as chat, social media and webcasts, and we continue to increase our self-serve solutions. As our customer base continues to grow, we must continue to broaden our portfolio of solutions, increase the scope of our solution deployments within our customers' IT infrastructure, and adapt our customer support organization to ensure our customers continue to receive the high level of customer service which they have come to expect. If we fail to maintain high quality customer care across our communications platforms to support our growing customers' needs, our reputation, financial results and business prospects may be materially harmed. Notwithstanding our commitment to customer care, our customers may occasionally encounter interruptions in service and other technical challenges, including those resulting from our GoDaddy Guides working remotely. An interruption in service and other challenges could negatively impact our business. \nA portion of our GoDaddy Guides is engaged through third parties and not directly by us.\nWe continue to refine our efforts in customer care so we can adequately serve our domestic and international customers. A portion of our GoDaddy Guides is engaged through third parties and not employed by us. If our agreements with such third parties are terminated for any reason, including a breach of agreement, if such third parties or the GoDaddy Guides engaged through the third parties do not perform the level of service expected of GoDaddy or our customers, or if such GoDaddy Guides engage in misconduct, our business and reputation could be harmed and we may need to find and/or train alternative providers, which could increase our costs and delay services to our customers. In addition, such a disruption could adversely impact our ability to serve our customers and to sell products to new and existing customers and we may experience a decline in our \n32\nTable of Contents\nsubscription renewal rates and in our ability to cross-sell our products and our reputation may suffer, any of which could adversely affect our business, reputation and operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain our contractual relationships with existing partners or establish new contractual relationships with potential partners, we may not be able to offer the products and related functionality our customers expect.\nWe maintain a network of different types of partners, some of whom create integrations with our products. For example, we partner with Microsoft Corporation to offer Microsoft 365 email and related productivity tools. We also work to make certain of our products interoperable with services such as Yelp, Google, Amazon, WhatsApp and Instagram. In addition, we provide payment options for customers' websites through providers such as PayPal, Stripe, Block and Mercado Libre. We have invested and will continue to invest in partner programs to provide new product offerings to our customers and help us attract additional customers. However, our relationships with our partners may not be as successful in generating new customers as we anticipate, which could adversely affect our ability to increase our total customers. Further, these integrated products could require substantial investment while providing no assurance of return or incremental revenue. We also rely on some of our partners to create integrations with third-party applications and platforms used by our customers, such as the email encryption service provided by Proofpoint, Inc., email backup and migration services provided by SkyKick and email archiving services provided by Barracuda. If our partners fail to create such integrations, or if they change the features of their applications or alter the terms governing use of their applications in an adverse manner, demand for our products could decrease, which would harm our business and operating results. If we are unable to maintain our contractual relationships with existing partners or establish new contractual relationships with potential partners, we may not be able to offer the products and related functionality our customers expect, we may experience delays and increased costs in adding customers, and we may lose existing customers. Any ineffectiveness of our partner programs could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations and may cause reputational harm. In addition, our partners may increase the fees they charge us or offer their services on terms that are less than favorable to us, including in connection with renewal negotiations. Such increased costs or less than favorable terms could result in increased costs to customers and potential loss of customers, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nOur failure to properly register or maintain our customers' domain names or comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to domain name registration and maintenance could subject us to additional liability, regulatory action, expenses, claims of loss or negative publicity that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSystem and process failures related to our domain name registration service may result in inaccurate and incomplete information in our domain name database. Despite testing, system and process failures, cybersecurity threats and other vulnerabilities may remain undetected or unknown, which could result in compromised customer data, loss of or delay in revenues, failure to achieve market acceptance, injury to our reputation, increased product costs or other negative impacts, any of which could harm our business. Furthermore, the requirements for registering and maintaining domain names vary from registry to registry and are subject to change. We cannot guarantee we will be able to readily adopt and comply with various registry requirements. For example, the E.U.'s Network Information Security 2 Directive (the NIS2 Directive) requires, among other things, that registries and entities providing domain name registration services adopt policies and procedures, including verification procedures, to ensure that such entities maintain accurate and complete domain name registration data in their domain name databases. The NIS2 Directive has yet to be fully transposed into the E.U. member states' respective national laws, and the specific obligations and expectations on registries and entities providing domain name registration services are uncertain. Our failure or inability to properly register or maintain our customers' domain names or comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations relating to domain name registration or maintenance might result in significant expenses and subject us to additional liability, regulatory action, expenses, claims of loss or negative publicity, which could harm our business, brand and operating results. \nWe are dependent on the reliability, security and performance of our internally developed systems and operations. Any difficulties in maintaining these systems may result in damage to our brand, service interruptions, decreased customer service or increased expenditures.\nThe reliability, security and continuous availability of the software, hardware and workflow processes underlying our internal systems, networks and infrastructure and the ability to deliver our products are critical to our business. Any interruptions resulting in our inability to timely deliver our products or customer care, or materially impacting the efficiency or cost with which we provide our products and customer care, would harm our brand, profitability and ability to conduct business. In addition, many of the software and other systems we currently use will need to be enhanced over time or replaced with equivalent commercial products or services, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Enhancing or replacing our systems, networks or infrastructure could entail considerable effort and expense. If we fail to develop and execute reliable policies, \n33\nTable of Contents\nprocedures and tools to operate our systems, networks or infrastructure, we could face a substantial decrease in workflow efficiency and increased costs, as well as a decline in our revenue.\nOur business is exposed to risks associated with credit card and other payment chargebacks, fraud and new payment methods.\nA significant percentage of our revenue is processed through credit cards and other online payment methods. We face the risk that we may fail to maintain an adequate level of protection against fraud or chargebacks and that one or more credit card associations or other processors may, at any time, assess penalties against us or terminate our ability to accept credit card or other forms of online payments from customers. Under our contracts with our payment processors, we are required to reimburse them for such penalties. If our refunds or chargebacks increase, our processors could require us to create reserves, increase fees or terminate their contracts with us.  In addition, as we expand our presence in commerce through our GoDaddy Payments products and services, we face additional risks in payment processing due to customer screening, customer related fraud, hardware failures and servicing, manufacturing costs, the procurement of hardware parts and materials, and risks associated with the interface of our hardware products with third-party mobile devices.\nWe could also incur significant fines or lose our ability to give customers the option of using credit cards to pay for our products if we fail to follow payment card industry data security standards, even if there is no compromise of the cardholder information covered by these standards. Although we are in compliance with payment card industry data security standards, it is possible that evolving cybersecurity threats may impact our ability to protect cardholder data which could result in fines or could otherwise impact our financial condition, or certain of our products could be suspended, which would cause us to be unable to process payments using credit cards. \nIn addition, we could be liable if there is a cybersecurity incident affecting the payment information we store. Online commerce and communications depend on the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. With the expansion of our offerings through GoDaddy Payments products and services, we face additional burdens in securing and transmitting payment information. We cannot ensure the encryption and authentication technology we rely on to secure the transmission of confidential information will adequately prevent cybersecurity incidents affecting systems. Although we maintain network security insurance, we cannot be certain our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually arising from a cybersecurity incident or insurance will continue to be available to us on reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our partners also collect or possess payment information about our customers, and we may be subject to litigation or our reputation may be harmed if our partners fail to protect our customers' payment information or if they use it in a manner inconsistent with our policies and practices. Cybersecurity incidents can also occur as a result of non-technical issues. Under our contracts with our processors, if there is unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, credit card information we store, we could be liable to the credit card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses.\nMoreover, in the future we may explore accepting various forms of payment that may have higher fees and costs than our current payment methods. If our customers utilize alternative payment methods, our payment costs could increase and our operating results could be adversely impacted.\nOur future performance depends in part on the services and performance of our senior management, as well as key employees. If we are unable to attract, motivate, and retain our employees, our business could suffer.\nOur future performance depends on the services and contributions of our senior management and key employees to execute on our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities and product innovations. The loss of any senior management or other key employees and the hiring of new senior leaders and key employees, especially in a competitive labor market, could significantly delay or prevent our achievement of strategic objectives, business plans and product development as we transition to new leaders and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. \nOur future performance and success also depends, in part, on our ability to continue to hire, retain, manage and motivate highly skilled personnel. The loss of any of our key personnel, the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel or delays in hiring required personnel, may seriously harm our business, financial condition and operating results. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to retain our employees or attract new employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. Historically, equity awards have been a key component of our employee compensation program, and as a \n34\nTable of Contents\nresult, any decline in the price of our Class A common stock (directly or relative to the stock price of other companies with which we compete for talent) may adversely impact our ability to retain employees or to attract new employees. \nIn addition, as we expand our product offerings through acquisitions, we may become dependent on the key personnel who join us through such acquisitions. If we are unable to successfully integrate and retain such personnel, our financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nCompetition for highly skilled personnel, particularly employees with technical and engineering skills, is frequently intense, particularly in U.S. tech hubs such as the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle and Austin. We are limited in our ability to recruit global talent by U.S. immigration laws, including those related to H-1B visas. The demand for H-1B visas to fill highly-skilled IT and computer science jobs is greater than the number of H-1B visas available each year. In addition, immigration laws may be modified to further limit the availability of H-1B visas. If a new or revised, more restrictive, visa program is implemented, it may impact our ability to recruit, hire and retain qualified skilled personnel, which could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition. To the extent we hire personnel from industry competitors, we may be subject to allegations that they have been improperly solicited or divulged proprietary or other confidential information.\nFinancial Risks\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may be adversely affected due to a variety of factors, which could make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below investor or analyst expectations.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results and key metrics have varied from period to period in the past, and may fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including, among other things:\n•\nour ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers;\n•\nthe timing and success of introductions of new products;\n•\nchanges in the growth rate of small businesses and ventures;\n•\nchanges in renewal rates for our subscriptions and our ability to sell additional products to existing customers;\n•\nhigher than expected refunds to our customers;\n•\nthe timing of revenue recognition relative to the recording of the related expense;\n•\nany negative publicity or other actions which harm our brand;\n•\nthe timing of our marketing expenditures;\n•\nthe mix of products sold and our use of \"freemium\" promotions and free trials for those products;\n•\nour ability to maintain a high level of personalized customer care and resulting customer satisfaction;\n•\ncompetition in the market for our products;\n•\nour ability to expand internationally;\n•\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nrapid technological change, frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards;\n•\nour ability to implement new financial and other administrative systems;\n•\nactual or perceived cyber attacks or other incidents;\n•\nsystems, data center and Internet failures, breaches and service interruptions;\n•\nactions by foreign governments that reduce access to the Internet for their citizens;\n•\nchanges in or increases to U.S. or foreign regulations or regulations by governments or multi-governmental organizations, that could impact one or more of our product offerings; \n•\nchanges to regulatory bodies, such as ICANN;\n•\na delay in the authorization of new TLDs by ICANN or our ability to secure operator rights for new TLDs, both of which would impact the breadth of our customer offerings;\n35\nTable of Contents\n•\nany changes in industry rules restricting our ability to hold domains for sale on the aftermarket;\n•\nshortcomings in, or misinterpretations of, our metrics and data which cause us to fail to anticipate or identify market trends;\n•\nterminations of, disputes with, or material changes to our relationships with third-party partners, including referral sources, product partners and payment processors;\n•\nreductions in the selling prices for our products;\n•\ncosts and integration issues associated with acquisitions we may make;\n•\nchanges in legislation affecting our collection of indirect taxes both in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions;\n•\nchanges in legislation affecting exposure to liability resulting from actions of our customers;\n•\nincreases in rates of failed sales on our aftermarket platform for transactions in which we act as the primary obligor, resulting in higher than expected domain portfolio assets;\n•\ntiming of expenses;\n•\nmacroeconomic conditions and the related impact on the worldwide economy, including the effects of inflation, deflation or a recession or other adverse economic conditions; \n•\nthreatened or actual litigation; and\n•\nloss of key employees.\nAny one of the factors above, or the cumulative effect of some of the factors referred to above, may result in significant fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results, including fluctuations in our key financial and operating metrics, our ability to forecast those results and our ability to achieve those forecasts. This variability and unpredictability could result in our failing to meet our revenue, bookings or operating results expectations or those of securities analysts or investors for any period. In addition, a portion of our operating expenses are fixed in nature and based on forecasted revenue and bookings trends. Accordingly, in the event of revenue or bookings shortfalls, we may generally be unable to mitigate with commensurate reductions in operating expenses in the short term, which could adversely impact our operating results.\nWe release guidance in our quarterly earnings conference calls, quarterly earnings releases, or otherwise, based on forecasts by management, which are necessarily speculative in nature. Our guidance may vary materially from actual results for a variety of reasons. If our revenue, bookings or other operating results, or the rate of growth of our revenue, bookings or operating results, fall below the expectations of our investors or securities analysts, or below any forecasts or guidance we may provide to the market, or if the forecasts we provide to the market are below the expectations of analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Such a stock price decline could occur even when we have met our own or other publicly stated financial forecasts. Our failure to meet our own or other publicly stated financial forecasts, or failure to meet securities analyst or investor expectations even when we meet our own forecasts, could cause our stock price to decline and expose us to lawsuits, including securities class action suits. Such litigation could impose substantial costs and divert management's attention and resources.\nWe may not be able to maintain profitability in the future.\nWe had net income of $937 million, $1,376 million and $353 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively. While we have experienced revenue growth over these periods, we may not be able to sustain or increase our growth or maintain profitability in the future or on a consistent basis. We have in the past, and may in the future, experience lower growth rates in customer demand due to factors including inflation, foreign currency headwinds and other factors that may not be known to us at this time. We have incurred substantial expenses and expended significant resources to market, promote and sell our products. We also expect to continue to invest for future growth and to expand our product offerings. In addition, as a public company, we expect to continue to incur significant accounting, legal and other expenses in the future. Furthermore, we have incurred in recent periods, and may incur in future periods, large expenses which are not recurring, but which nonetheless negatively impact our operating results.\nAs a result of our increased expenditures, we have needed and expect to continue to need to generate and sustain increased revenue to maintain future profitability. Maintaining profitability will also require that we manage our cost structure and avoid significant liabilities. In the future, our revenue growth may slow or decline, or we may incur significant losses for any reason, including deteriorating general macroeconomic conditions, increased competition, a decrease in the growth of the markets \n36\nTable of Contents\nin which we operate or have business, or if we fail for any reason to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. Additionally, we may encounter unforeseen operating expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors that may result in losses in future periods. If these losses exceed our expectations or our revenue growth expectations are not met in future periods, our financial performance will be harmed and our stock price could be volatile or decline.\nBecause we are generally required to recognize revenue for our products over the term of the applicable agreement, changes in our sales may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nAs described in Note 2 to our audited financial statements, we generally recognize revenue from our customers ratably over the respective terms of their subscriptions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP). Our subscriptions can range from monthly terms to multi-annual terms of up to ten years, depending on the product. Accordingly, increases in sales during a particular period do not translate into immediate, proportional increases in revenue during such period, and a substantial portion of the revenue we recognize during a quarter is derived from deferred revenue from customer subscriptions we entered into during previous quarters. Conversely, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any one quarter may not be reflected in our revenue for that quarter and the existence of substantial deferred revenue may prevent deteriorating sales activity from becoming immediately observable in our statements of operations. In addition, we may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall, and any significant shortfall relative to planned expenditures could negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income or other tax returns could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets (DTAs) or liabilities (DTLs) and in evaluating our tax positions worldwide. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of existing laws are issued or applied. Numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) model rules that propose a global minimum tax rate of 15% for companies with revenue above €750 million, calculated on a country-by-country basis, and E.U. member states have agreed to implement the global minimum tax. Certain countries have enacted or are expected to enact legislation to be effective in 2024, with widespread implementation of a global minimum tax expected by 2025. We are unable to predict when and how such rules will be enacted into law in these countries; however, it is possible that the implementation of relevant legislation could have a material effect on our liability for taxes. We will continue to monitor pending legislation and implementation by individual countries and evaluate the potential impact on our business in future periods.\nOur future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by several factors, including:\n•\nchanges in the valuation of our DTAs and DTLs;\n•\ntax effects of equity-based compensation;\n•\ncosts related to intercompany restructurings;\n•\nchanges in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and\n•\nfuture earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory tax rates.\nIn addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by federal and state and foreign tax authorities. Outcomes from these audits could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\n37\nTable of Contents\nOur level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, our ability to operate our business and our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, as well as divert our cash flow from operations for debt payments and prevent us from meeting our debt obligations.\nWe have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness, including our Credit Facility and Senior Notes, and may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Our level of indebtedness now and in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition, including:\n•\nrequiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations and capital expenditures and pursue future business opportunities;\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry or competitive developments;\n•\nexposing us to increased interest expense;\n•\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including restrictive covenants, which could result in a default accelerating our obligations to repay indebtedness;\n•\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions and/or redeeming or repurchasing shares of our capital stock;\n•\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future; and\n•\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who may be better positioned to take advantage of opportunities our leverage prevents us from exploiting.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries, which may prevent us from capitalizing on business opportunities and making payments on our indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness, including our Credit Facility and the Senior Notes, impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us. These restrictions limit the ability of our subsidiaries, and effectively place restrictions on our own ability to, among other things: incur or guarantee additional debt or issue disqualified equity interests; pay dividends and make other distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; prepay, redeem or repurchase certain junior debt; make certain investments; incur certain liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; merge, consolidate or make certain other fundamental changes; enter into agreements restricting the ability of restricted subsidiaries to make certain intercompany dividends, distributions, payments or transfers; and transfer or sell assets. In addition, our Credit Facility requires us to comply with a specified leverage ratio under certain circumstances. \nOur ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control, and these provisions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions, meet capital needs or otherwise conduct our business. There can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with current or additional covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the applicable lenders or holders or amend the covenants. Our failure to comply with current or future restrictive covenants or other current or future terms of indebtedness could result in a default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their due date.\nWe may need additional equity, debt or other financing in the future, which we may not be able to obtain on acceptable terms, or at all, and any additional financing may result in restrictions on our operations or substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may need to raise funds in the future to, among other things, develop new technologies, expand our business, respond to competitive pressures, refinance our existing indebtedness or make acquisitions or other strategic arrangements. We may try to raise additional funds through public or private financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements or by refinancing our existing indebtedness.\nOur ability to obtain any additional financing will depend on a number of factors, such as market conditions, our operating performance, investor interest and, in the case of debt financing, our then-current debt levels, expected debt amortization, interest rates and our credit rating. Volatility in the credit markets, including the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank's actions and implementation of varying interest rates to combat inflation in the U.S., may have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. Our credit rating may also be affected by our liquidity, financial results, economic risk or other factors, which may increase the cost of future financings. Any additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If financing is not available, we may be required to reduce expenditures, including curtailing our growth strategies, forgoing \n38\nTable of Contents\nacquisitions or reducing our product development efforts. If we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked securities, then existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, these new securities would have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our Class A common stock. In addition, any such issuance could subject us to restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital, respond to competitive pressures and pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Further, to the extent we incur additional indebtedness or other such obligations, the risks associated with our significant debt described below, including our possible inability to service our debt, would increase. Additionally, events and circumstances may occur that could cause us to not be able to satisfy applicable draw-down conditions and utilize our revolving line of credit. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on our incurrence of additional indebtedness and entry into certain types of transactions, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and we may choose to amend such agreements and the applicable restrictions from time to time (with the consent of the requisite lenders or holders), which may allow us to incur additional indebtedness that could be substantial.\nWe may be required to repurchase the Senior Notes and the maturity of our Credit Facility may be accelerated upon a change of control triggering event.\nHolders of the Senior Notes can require us to repurchase the Senior Notes upon a change of control of our company. Our ability to repurchase the Senior Notes may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our indebtedness. In addition, we may not have sufficient funds to repurchase the Senior Notes or have the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms, if at all. A change of control of our company may also constitute a default under, or result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our other then-existing indebtedness, including our Credit Facility. Our failure to repurchase the Senior Notes would result in a default under the Senior Notes, which may result in the acceleration of the Senior Notes and other then-existing indebtedness, including our Credit Facility. We may not have sufficient funds to make any payments triggered by such acceleration, which could result in foreclosure proceedings and our seeking protection under the U.S. bankruptcy code.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nLaws, regulations, policies or claims concerning the domain name registration system and the Internet in general, and industry reactions to those policies or claims, may cause instability in the industry and disrupt our business.\nICANN is a multi-stakeholder, private sector, not-for-profit corporation formed in 1998 for the express purposes of overseeing a number of Internet related tasks, including managing the DNS allocation of IP addresses, accreditation of domain name registrars and registries and the definition and coordination of policy development for these functions. We are accredited by ICANN as a domain name registrar and thus our ability to offer domain name registration products is subject to our ongoing relationship with, and accreditation by, ICANN. Further, our generic top-level domain registry business is based on contracts with ICANN, per TLD, and therefore, is subject to existing requirements and any changes to those requirements made in those contracts. ICANN has been subject to strict scrutiny by the public and governments around the world, as well as multi-governmental organizations such as the United Nations, with many of those bodies becoming increasingly interested in Internet governance. If ICANN is not seen as adequately responsive to stakeholder concerns, governments around the world may decide to implement regulatory frameworks independent of ICANN, leading to a fragmentation of the domain name registration system, which could negatively affect our operations and financial results.\nAdditionally, we continue to face the following possibilities:\n•\nthe structure and accountability mechanisms contained in the Bylaws for ICANN, as amended on November 17, 2023, are not fully tested, which may result in ICANN not being accountable to its stakeholders and unable to make, implement or enforce its policies;\n•\nthe Internet community, key commercial industry participants, the U.S. government or other governments may (i) refuse to recognize ICANN's authority or support its policies, (ii) attempt to exert pressure on ICANN, or (iii) enact laws in conflict with ICANN's policies, each of which could create instability in the domain name registration system;\n•\ngovernments, via ICANN's Governmental Advisory Committee (GAC), may seek greater influence over ICANN policies and contracts with registrars and may advocate changes that may adversely affect our business;\n•\nthe terms of the Registrar Accreditation Agreement (RAA) under which we are accredited as a registrar or the Registry Agreement (RA) under which we are accredited as a registry, could change in ways that are disadvantageous to us or under certain circumstances could be terminated by ICANN, thereby preventing us from \n39\nTable of Contents\noperating our registrar or registry service, or ICANN could adopt unilateral changes to the RAA or RA that are unfavorable to us, that are inconsistent with our current or future plans, or that affect our competitive position;\n•\ninternational regulatory or governing bodies, such as the International Telecommunication Union, a specialized agency of the United Nations, or the E.U., may gain increased influence over the management and regulation of the domain name registration system, leading to increased regulation in areas such as taxation, privacy, data protection, cybersecurity and the monitoring of our customers' hosted content;\n•\nICANN or any TLD operators may implement policy changes impacting our ability to run our current business practices throughout the various stages of the lifecycle of a domain name;\n•\nthe U.S. Congress or other legislative bodies in the U.S. could take action unfavorable to us, influencing customers to move their business from our products to those located outside the U.S.;\n•\nthe U.S. Congress or other legislative bodies in the U.S. could adopt regulations that are in direct conflict with other jurisdictions (e.g., the E.U.), which could fragment our platform and product offerings; \n•\nthe U.S. Congress or other legislative bodies in the U.S. or in other countries could adopt laws that erode the safe harbors from third-party liability in the CDA (Section 230) and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act;\n•\nICANN could fail to maintain its role, potentially resulting in instability in DNS services administration and operation;\n•\nour business as a vertically integrated operation of a registrar and registry could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny;\n•\nICANN, TLD operators, governments and governmental authorities may impose requirements for verification of domain name registrant information that are inconsistent with our current business practices or that result in inconsistency among industry participants, including but not limited to changes under the E.U. NIS2 Directive; \n•\nICANN, TLD operators, governments and governmental authorities may impose requirements for, or prohibit, the registration of domain names containing certain words or phrases;\n•\nsome governments and governmental authorities outside the U.S. have in the past disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with the actions, policies or programs of ICANN and TLD operators relating to the DNS, which could fragment the single, unitary Internet into a loosely-connected group of one or more networks, each with different rules, policies and operating protocols; \n•\nmulti-party review panels established by ICANN's bylaws may take positions unfavorable to our business; and\n•\nchanges in ICANN leadership could introduce uncertainty that could delay or postpone programs, such as the next round of new generic TLD (gTLD) applications, and that could have a material impact on our business. \nIf any of these events occur, they could create instability in the domain name registration system and may make it difficult for us to continue to offer existing products and introduce new products, or serve customers in certain international markets. These events could also disrupt or suspend portions of our domain name registration product and subject us to additional restrictions on how the registrar and registry products businesses are conducted, which would result in reduced revenue.\nIn addition, due to changes in privacy and data protection laws, rules and regulations around the world, ICANN and its stakeholders have modified their policies, procedures and contracts related to how registrars collect, store, transmit, publish or otherwise process the personal information of domain name registrants in publicly accessible WHOIS directories. We continue to work with ICANN and our industry counterparts to reconcile conflicts and inconsistencies with such laws, rules and regulations. If ICANN is unable to maintain policies, procedures and contracts consistent with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations, our efforts to comply with applicable laws may cause us to violate our existing ICANN contractual obligations. As a result, we could experience difficulties in selling domain name registrations and keeping our existing customer domain names under management, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and revenue.\nICANN periodically authorizes the introduction of new TLDs. A delay in access to new TLDs could adversely impact our business, results of operations and reputation.\nICANN has periodically authorized the introduction of new TLDs and made domain names related to them available for registration. In 2012, ICANN significantly expanded the number of gTLDs through the first application round of the Expansion \n40\nTable of Contents\nProgram. This resulted in the delegation of new gTLDs in 2014. ICANN has introduced a new gTLD program, Next Round, which is expected to open in April 2026 upon completion of the policy implementation work. \nOur competitive position depends in part on our ability to gain access to these new TLDs. A significant portion of our business relies on our ability to sell domain name registrations to our customers, and any limitations on our access to newly created TLDs could adversely impact our ability to sell domain name registrations to customers, and thus could adversely impact our business. Furthermore, GoDaddy Registry is also impacted by delays of future gTLD application rounds. Although we expect to continue to sell and pursue operator rights for new gTLDs as they are introduced, our ability to obtain these rights, gain contracts to provide backend registry services, or sell new domain name registrations to our customers may be adversely impacted if the Expansion Program does not continue, or if, when continued, we are unable to obtain these rights or gain these contracts our business and the financial and operational aspects of our business may be harmed. In addition, if the Next Round is delayed as a result of the timing of the policy implementation work, or is not opened in the future at all, the reputation of the industry and our business and the financial and operational aspects of our business may be harmed. \nThe relevant domain name registry and ICANN impose a charge upon each registrar for the administration of each domain name registration. If these fees increase, it would have a significant impact upon our operating results.\nEach registry typically imposes a fee in association with the registration of a domain name. For example, VeriSign, the registry for .com and .net, has a current annual list price of $10.26 for each .com registration, and ICANN currently annually charges $0.18 for most domain names registered in the gTLDs within its purview. In addition, VeriSign, which operates the .com and .net gTLDs under registry agreements with ICANN and, with respect to the .com gTLD, a Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Department of Commerce, has previously been given the right to annually increase prices, subject to certain limitations, and has done so in recent years, including to the current list price of $10.26. If fees continue to increase, costs to our customers could become higher, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We have no control over ICANN, VeriSign or other domain name registries and cannot predict their future fee structures.\nWhile we do not currently do so, we have the discretion to impose service fees on our customers in the future. In addition, pricing of new gTLDs is generally not set or controlled by ICANN, which in certain instances has resulted in aggressive price increases on certain particularly successful new gTLDs. The increase in these fees with respect to any new gTLD either must be included in the prices we charge to our customers, imposed as a surcharge or absorbed by us. If we absorb such cost increases or if surcharges result in decreases in domain registrations, our business, operating results and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to local and\n \ninternational laws, rules, regulations, and orders relating to the operation and security of our computer network and the processing of data, including privacy of personal data.\n \nOur operations depend on the operation of our network and processing of data internationally, including the movement of data across national boundaries. The laws, rules, regulations and orders concerning cybersecurity and processing of data are evolving and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently, and may conflict with one another, with other regulatory requirements, or with our own internal policies and procedures. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with U.S. or international laws and regulations relating to cybersecurity and processing of data (or our failure or perceived failure to comply with our own internal policies and procedures) may result in litigation, government enforcement actions, or reputational harm.\n \nWe are subject to a variety of U.S. and international privacy and data protection laws, rules, regulations, and orders (such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act) that provide our customers and other individuals with certain rights relating to the processing of their personal data. In addition, a growing and evolving body of U.S. and international laws restrict how we may process personal data for various purposes, including online advertising and targeted marketing. These evolving laws may increase our costs and limit our ability to use personal data for new products, including but not limited to products that rely on AI-related technologies.\n \nWe have entered into an agreement to settle FTC charges relating to certain of our security practices, advertising, and other related matters. The settlement agreement and related order is still pending a public notice-and-comment period and final FTC approval. If the proposed order is finalized, we will be required to comply with its terms for a period of at least 20 years, which include specific requirements relating to security of our hosting services among other things. If we fail to comply with the final order’s terms, we could be subject to FTC investigation, litigation, or reputational harm. We have invested and continue to invest in our security systems and have undertaken to begin implementing the proposed requirements contained in the proposed order.\n \nSee Note 13 to our financial statements.\n41\nTable of Contents\nExisting and new laws, rules, regulations and orders relating to the security of our networks and data processing may cause us to incur additional compliance costs or limit our ability to provide certain of our products or services in some jurisdictions. For example, we expect to incur additional costs relating to new cybersecurity requirements in the E.U. pursuant to the E.U. Network Information Security 2 Directive (NIS2), which is currently being transposed into E.U. law.\n \nWe also must comply with a growing body of laws, rules, regulations and orders governing the transfer of data, including personal data, across territorial boundaries. For example, the GDPR restricts the transfer of personal data from the E.U. to the U.S. and other countries that are not deemed to have implemented adequate data protection measures. We use a variety of legal transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data from the E.U. to the U.S., including standard contractual clauses (SCCs) and the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework. However, the use of SCCs and the E.U.-U.S. Data Privacy Framework is subject to ongoing review and litigation in the E.U., and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to rely on these or other transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data from the E.U. to the U.S.\n \nIf our cybersecurity and data processing measures fail to comply with (or are perceived to have failed to comply with) current or future laws, regulations, policies, legal obligations, industry standards or any applicable government orders, we may be subject to litigation and/or regulatory investigations and may incur fines or other liabilities, and loss of business. In addition, future laws, rules, regulations, and legal obligations may limit our customers’ ability to use our services to process data (including personal data), which could reduce demand for our products and harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. \nWe are subject to international laws, rules and regulations relating to content moderation. \nAn increasing number of laws and regulations impose requirements on us to provide content moderation and other restrictions for our products and services. For example, in 2024, the E.U.’s Digital Services Act (DSA) went into effect.\n \nThe DSA imposes new content moderation and notice obligations, advertising restrictions, and other requirements on us and certain of our services. If we are unable to comply with the DSA or similar laws in other jurisdictions, we could be subject to litigation and government investigations, which could result in fines, damages, increased costs and reputational harm.\nActivities of customers or the content of their websites could damage our reputation and brand or harm our business and financial results.\nAs a result of the products and services we offer, we may be subject to liability and negative publicity due to our customers' activities on or in connection with their domain names, their websites or the data they store on our servers. In addition, as we expand our social media management and professional web services, we may be subject to liability for content we create on behalf of our customers. Although our terms of service prohibit the illegal use of our products by our customers and permit us to take down or suspend websites or take other appropriate actions in response to illegal uses (among other reasons), customers may nonetheless engage in prohibited activities or upload or store content on our products in violation of applicable law, our agreement or policies, or the customer's own policies, which could subject us to liability. Furthermore, our reputation and brand may be negatively impacted by customer actions and website content that are deemed hostile, offensive or inappropriate. We do not proactively monitor or review the appropriateness of the domain names our customers register or the content of their websites, and we do not have control over customer activities. The safeguards we have in place may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our reputation and brand, especially if such hostile, offensive or inappropriate customer content is high profile or misinterpreted as content supported by us.\nSeveral U.S. federal statutes may apply to us with respect to various activities of our customers, including the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), which provides recourse for trademark owners against cybersquatters, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed on the Internet, and the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which addresses blocking and screening of content on the Internet. Although these and other similar laws, rules and regulations provide limited protections from liability for providers like us, those protections may not be interpreted in a way that applies to us, may be amended or removed in the future, or may not provide us with complete protection from applicable claims. If we are found not to be protected by the safe harbor provisions of these laws, rules and regulations or if we are deemed subject to laws in other countries that may not have the same protections or that may impose more onerous obligations on us, we may owe substantial damages and our brand, reputation, and financial results may be harmed.\nNotwithstanding the exculpatory language of these bodies of law, the activities of our customers have resulted in, and may in the future result in, threatened or actual litigation against us. Although the ACPA, DMCA, CDA and relevant U.S. case law have generally shielded us from liability for customer activities to date, court rulings in pending or future litigation or future \n42\nTable of Contents\nregulatory or legislative amendments may narrow the scope of protection afforded us under these laws. Additionally, neither the DMCA nor the CDA generally apply to claims of trademark violations, and thus they may be inapplicable to many of the claims asserted against our company. Furthermore, there have been, and continue to be, various Congressional and executive efforts to remove or restrict the scope of the protections available under Section 230 of the CDA, which if successful could decrease our current protections from liability for third-party content and increase our litigation costs. \nIn addition, other bodies of law, including state criminal laws, may be deemed to apply or new statutes or regulations may be adopted in the future, any of which could expose us to further liability and increase our costs of doing business. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results. For example, the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act and the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act may limit the immunity previously available to us under the CDA, which could subject us to investigations or penalties if our customers' activities are deemed illegal or inappropriate. In addition, the DSA, a package of legislation intended to update the liability and safety rules for digital platforms, products and services, could negatively impact the scope of the limited immunity provided by the E-Commerce Directive in the E.U.\nOur business depends on our customers' continued and unimpeded access to the Internet and the development and maintenance of Internet infrastructure. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade or charge for access to certain of our products, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of customers.\nOur products depend on the ability of our customers to access the Internet. Currently, this access is provided by companies having significant market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers can take measures including legal actions, which could degrade, disrupt or increase the cost of user access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support our offerings, charging increased fees to our users to provide our offerings, or regulating online speech. In some jurisdictions, such as China, our products and services may be subject to government-initiated restrictions, fees or blockages. Such interference could result in a loss of existing users, advertisers and goodwill or increased costs, or could impair our ability to attract new users, thereby harming our revenue and growth. Moreover, the adoption of any laws, rules or regulations adversely affecting the growth, popularity or use of the Internet, could decrease the demand for our products and increase our operating costs. The legislative and regulatory landscape regarding the regulation of the Internet and, in particular, Internet neutrality, in the U.S. is subject to uncertainty.\nTo the extent any laws, regulations or rulings permit Internet service providers to charge some users higher rates than others for the delivery of their content, Internet service providers could attempt to use such laws, regulations or rulings to impose higher fees or deliver our content with less speed, reliability or otherwise on a non-neutral basis as compared to other market participants, and our business could be adversely impacted. Internationally, government regulation concerning the Internet, and in particular, network neutrality, may be developing or non-existent. Within such a regulatory environment, we could experience discriminatory or anti-competitive practices impeding both our and our customers' domestic and international growth, increasing our costs or adversely affecting our business. Additional changes in the legislative and regulatory landscape regarding Internet neutrality, or otherwise regarding the regulation of the Internet, could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business could be affected by new governmental regulations regarding the Internet.\nThe legal and regulatory environment relating to the Internet is uncertain, and governments may impose additional regulation in the future. New laws may be passed, courts may issue decisions affecting the Internet, existing but previously inapplicable or unenforced laws may be deemed to apply to the Internet or regulatory agencies may begin to more rigorously enforce such formerly unenforced laws, or existing legal safe harbors may be narrowed, both by U.S. federal or state governments and by governments of foreign jurisdictions. The adoption of any new laws, rules or regulations, or the narrowing of any safe harbors, could hinder growth in the use of the Internet and online services generally, and decrease acceptance of the Internet and online services as a means of communications, e-commerce and advertising. In addition, such changes in laws could increase our costs of doing business or prevent us from delivering our services over the Internet or in specific jurisdictions, which could harm our business and our results of operations.\n43\nTable of Contents\nFrom time to time, we are involved in lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, which are expensive and time consuming and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are, and from time to time we may become, subject to litigation and various legal proceedings, including litigation and proceedings related to employment matters, intellectual property matters, commercial disputes, antitrust and privacy and consumer protection laws, as well as stockholder derivative suits, class action lawsuits, mass arbitration and other matters. For example, we have faced, and may continue to face in the future, claims related to the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act (and similar federal, state and international consumer protection statutes, including the Brazil Consumer Protection Code). We have also been involved in putative class action lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging violations of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act. Class action plaintiffs in particular often seek substantial statutory damages and attorneys' fees, and demand changes to our products, features or business practices. Although the results of any such current or future litigation, regardless of the underlying nature of the claims, cannot be predicted with certainty, the final outcome of any current or future claims or lawsuits we face could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any negative outcome from claims or litigation, including settlements, could result in payment of substantial monetary damages or fines, attorneys' fees or costly and significant and undesirable changes to our products, features, marketing efforts or business practices. As we have expanded our international business, we have experienced an increase in litigation occurring outside of the U.S., due in part to consumer-friendly laws, rules and regulations in certain countries and legal systems with limited experience with claims related to the domain industry. Defending such litigation is costly and time consuming. The outcome of such litigation may not be the same as similar litigation in the U.S., which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. \nFurther, claims or litigation brought against our customers or business partners may subject us to indemnification obligations or obligations to refund fees to, and adversely affect our relationships with, our customers or business partners. Such indemnification or refund obligations or litigation judgments or settlements that result in the payment of substantial monetary damages, fines and attorneys' fees may not be sufficiently covered by our insurance policies, if at all. We evaluate litigation claims and legal proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we may establish reserves and/or disclose the relevant litigation claims or legal proceedings, as and when required or appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on information available to management at the time of such assessment or estimation and involve a significant amount of judgment. As a result, actual outcomes or losses could differ materially from those envisioned by our current assessments and estimates. Our failure to successfully defend or settle any of these litigation claims or legal proceedings could result in liability that, to the extent not covered by our insurance, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See “Item 3—Legal Proceedings.” \nIn addition, during the course of any litigation, regardless of its nature, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, preliminary rulings or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantially adverse effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. Regardless of the merit of claims asserted against us, claims are generally time-consuming and costly to evaluate and ultimately defend, and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Further, because of the, at times, substantial amount of discovery required in connection with litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential business or other proprietary information could be compromised by disclosure.\nFailure to adequately protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nThe success of our business depends in part on our ability to protect and enforce our patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights. We attempt to protect our intellectual property under patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, and through a combination of confidentiality procedures, contractual provisions and other methods, all of which offer only limited protection.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 368 issued patents in the U.S. and other countries covering various aspects of our product offerings. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, we had 11 pending U.S. and international patent applications and intend to file additional patent applications in the future. The process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. We may choose not to seek patent protection for certain innovations or in certain jurisdictions, and may choose to abandon patents that are no longer of strategic value to us, in each case even if those innovations have financial value to us. In addition, under the laws of certain jurisdictions, patents or other intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in \n44\nTable of Contents\nscope. Furthermore, it is possible that our patent applications may not issue as granted patents, that the scope of our issued patents will be insufficient or not have the coverage originally sought, that our issued patents will not provide us with any competitive advantages, and that our patents and other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative processes or litigation. In addition, issuance of a patent does not assure that we have an absolute right to practice the patented invention, or that we have the right to exclude others from practicing the claimed invention. As a result, we may not be able to obtain adequate patent protection or to enforce our issued patents effectively.\nIn addition to patented technology, we rely on our unpatented proprietary technology and confidential proprietary information, including trade secrets and know-how. Despite our efforts to protect the proprietary and confidential nature of such technology and information, unauthorized parties may attempt to misappropriate, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain and use them. The contractual provisions in confidentiality agreements and other agreements we generally enter into with employees, consultants, partners, vendors and customers may not prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary technology or intellectual property rights. Moreover, policing unauthorized use of our technologies, products and intellectual property rights is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the U.S. and where mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be weak. To the extent we expand our international activities, our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information may increase. We may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use or infringement of our products, technologies or intellectual property rights.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 588 registered and 55 pending trademarks in jurisdictions including the U.S., E.U., UK, China and Germany; we have also filed a trademark application for Airo. We have also registered, or applied to register, the trademarks associated with several of our leading brands in the U.S. and in certain other countries, including for our logo launched in January 2020, the \"Go.\" Competitors and others may have adopted, and in the future may adopt, tag lines or service or product names similar to ours, which could impede our ability to build our brands' identities and possibly lead to confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered and common law trademarks or trademarks incorporating variations of the terms or designs of one or more of our trademarks and opposition filings made when we apply to register our trademarks.\nFrom time to time, legal action by us may be necessary to enforce our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the intellectual property rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, distract management and technical personnel and negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage. Any inability on our part to protect adequately our intellectual property may have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe are involved in intellectual property claims and litigation asserted by third parties and may be subject to additional claims and litigation in the future, which could result in significant costs and substantial harm to our business and results of operations.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation in the U.S. and abroad involving patents and other intellectual property rights. Companies providing web-based and cloud-based products are increasingly bringing, and becoming subject to, suits alleging infringement of proprietary rights, particularly patent rights. The possibility of intellectual property infringement claims also may increase to the extent we face heightened competition and become more visible. Any claims we assert against perceived infringers could provoke these parties to assert counterclaims against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights. In addition, our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may increase as a result of acquisitions we make or our use of software licensed from or hosted by third parties, as we have less visibility into the development process with respect to such technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired or licensed technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition or license. Many companies are devoting significant resources to obtaining patents that could affect many aspects of our business. This may prevent us from deterring patent infringement claims, and our competitors and others may now and in the future have larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have.\nWe have faced in the past, are currently facing, and expect to face in the future, claims and litigation by third parties that we infringe upon or misappropriate their intellectual property rights. Defending patent and other intellectual property claims and litigation is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees, and there can be no assurances that \n45\nTable of Contents\nfavorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. In addition, plaintiffs may seek, and we may become subject to, preliminary or provisional rulings in the course of any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring us to cease offering certain of our products or features. We may decide to settle such lawsuits and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us. Similarly, if any litigation to which we are a party is resolved adversely, we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversed upon appeal. The terms of such a settlement or judgment may require us to cease offering certain of our products or features or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third party's rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or discontinue offering certain products or features. The development of alternative non-infringing technology, products or features could require significant effort and expense or may not be feasible. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by intellectual property claims or litigation.\nWe may face liability or become involved in disputes over registration and transfer of domain names and control over websites.\nAs a provider of web-based and cloud-based products, including as a registrar of domain names and related products, we may become aware of disputes over ownership or control of customer accounts, websites or domain names. We could face potential liability for our failure to renew a customer's domain. We could also face potential liability for our role in the wrongful transfer of control or ownership of accounts, websites or domain names. The safeguards and procedures we have adopted may not be successful in insulating us against liability from such claims in the future. Moreover, any future amendment to Section 230 of the CDA may increase our liability and could expose us to civil or criminal liability for the actions of our customers, if we do not effectively detect and mitigate these risks. In addition, we may face potential liability for other forms of account, website or domain name hijacking, including misappropriation by third parties of our customer accounts, websites or domain names and attempts by third parties to operate accounts, websites or domain names or to extort the customer whose accounts, websites or domain names were misappropriated. Furthermore, we are exposed to potential liability as a result of our domain privacy product, whereby the identity and contact details for the domain name registrant are masked. Although our terms of service reserve our right to take certain steps when domain name disputes arise related to our privacy product, including the removal of our privacy service, the safeguards we have in place may not be sufficient to avoid liability, which could increase our costs of doing business.\nOccasionally, one of our customers may register a domain name identical, or similar, to a third party's trademark or the name of a living person. These occurrences have in the past led, and may in the future lead, to our involvement in disputes over such domain names. Disputes involving registration or control of domain names are often resolved through the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP), ICANN's administrative process for domain name dispute resolution, or less frequently through litigation under the ACPA, or under general theories of trademark infringement or dilution. The UDRP generally does not impose liability on registrars, and the ACPA provides that registrars may not be held liable for registration or maintenance of a domain name absent a showing of the registrar's bad faith intent to profit from the trademark at issue. However, we may face liability if we act in bad faith or fail to comply in a timely manner with procedural requirements under these rules, including forfeiture of domain names in connection with UDRP actions. In addition, domain name registration disputes and compliance with the procedures under the ACPA and UDRP typically require at least limited involvement by us and, therefore, increase our cost of doing business. The volume of domain name registration disputes may increase in the future as the overall number of registered domain names increases. Moreover, as the owner or acquiror of domain name portfolios containing domains we provide for resale, we may face liability if one or more domain names in our portfolios, or our resellers' portfolios, are alleged to violate another party's trademark. Although we screen the domain names we acquire to mitigate the risk of third-party infringement claims, we, or our resellers, may inadvertently register or acquire domains that infringe or allegedly infringe third-party rights. If intellectual property laws diverge internationally or are interpreted inconsistently by local courts, we may be required to devote additional time and resources to enhancing our screening program in international markets. For example, we are involved in a large number of claims in India involving the registration of domain names alleged to incorporate strings of text matching third-party trademarks. While these claims are individually and collectively immaterial, they may require additional time and resources to resolve, and as we expand internationally, we face additional intellectual property claims. Moreover, advertisements displayed on websites associated with domains registered by us may contain allegedly infringing content placed by third parties. We may face liability and increased costs as a result of such third-party infringement claims.\nOur use of open source technology could impose limitations on our ability to commercialize our products.\nWe use open source software in our business, including in our products. It is possible that some open source software is governed by licenses containing requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software, and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular \n46\nTable of Contents\nopen source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. By the terms of certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software, and to make our proprietary software available under open source licenses, if we combine our proprietary software with open source software in certain manners.\nAlthough we monitor our use of open source software in an effort to avoid subjecting our products to conditions we do not intend, we cannot be certain all open source software is reviewed prior to use in our proprietary software, that programmers working for us have not incorporated open source software into our proprietary software, or that they will not do so in the future. Any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or to make it available under an open source license could be harmful to our business, operating results and financial condition. Furthermore, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts. As a result, there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. In such an event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products, to make our proprietary code generally available in source code form, to re-engineer our products or to discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe use of open source software can also present greater risk than the use of third-party commercial software. Open source software is generally offered on an as-is basis and licensors typically do not offer warranties, controls on software origin or development, or remedies against claims. Furthermore, ongoing disputes in the open source community may heighten these risks, potentially creating uncertainty and operational challenges. Many of the inherent risks associated with open source software cannot be fully mitigated, which could materially impact our business operations and financial results.\nWe are subject to certain export controls, including economic and trade sanctions regulations that could impair our ability to compete in international markets and subject us to liability if we are not in full compliance with applicable laws.\nOur business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export controls and trade and economic sanctions laws, including the U.S. Commerce Department's Export Administration Regulations and economic and trade sanctions regulations maintained by the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). These also include U.S., UK and E.U. financial and economic sanctions targeting Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. If we fail to comply with these laws, rules and regulations, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties and reputational harm. U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions laws also prohibit certain transactions with U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments, persons and entities.\nWe employ country-specific log-in and/or cart blocks in comprehensively sanctioned jurisdictions, customer screening, and other measures designed to ensure regulatory compliance. When we screen customers against such sanctions lists, we rely on the data provided to us by our customers; if customers do not provide complete or accurate data, our screening process may fail to identify customers who are denied parties. As such, there is risk that in the future we could provide our products to denied parties despite such precautions. Changes in the list of sanctioned jurisdictions and OFAC and other sanctions lists may require us to modify these measures in order to comply with governmental regulations. Our failure to screen customers properly could result in negative consequences to us, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm.\nAny change in export or import regulations, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products or decreased ability to sell our products to existing or potential customers. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to sell our products internationally could adversely affect our growth prospects.\nIf we are found to be in violation of the export controls laws, rules and regulations or economic sanctions laws, rules and regulations, penalties may be imposed against us and our employees, including loss of export privileges and monetary penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be materially and adversely affected through penalties, reputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise if we are found to have violated these laws, rules and regulations.\n47\nTable of Contents\nDue to the global nature of our business, we could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws.\nWe face significant risks if we fail to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act 2010 (UK Bribery Act), the U.S. Travel Act of 1961 and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws prohibiting companies and their employees and third-party intermediaries from authorizing, offering or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or benefits to foreign government officials, political parties and private-sector recipients for an illegal purpose.\nWe operate and maintain business in areas of the world in which corruption by government officials exists to some degree and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We operate and maintain business in several countries and sell our products to customers around the world, which results in varied and potentially conflicting compliance obligations. In addition, changes in laws could result in increased regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we are committed to complying with, and we provide training to help our employees comply with, all applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, we cannot assure that our employees or other agents will not engage in prohibited conduct and render us responsible under the FCPA or the UK Bribery Act.\nIf we are found to be in violation of the FCPA, the UK Bribery Act or other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws (either due to acts or inadvertence of our employees, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption or anti-bribery laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and growth prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action may result in a diversion of management's attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nChanges in taxation laws, rules and regulations may discourage the registration or renewal of domain names for e-commerce.\nDue to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that any U.S. or foreign federal, state or local taxing authority might attempt to regulate our transmissions or levy transaction, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are regularly reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations may subject either us or our customers to additional sales, income and other taxes. In particular, after the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in \nSouth Dakota v. Wayfair\n, U.S. states may require an online retailer with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax on sales to such states' residents. We cannot predict the effect of current attempts to impose sales, income or other taxes on e-commerce. New or revised taxes, particularly sales and other transaction taxes, would likely increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of advertising and selling goods and services over the Internet. New taxes could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and to collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur payments-related operations, including GoDaddy Payments, are subject to various laws, regulations, and restrictions. Our failure to comply with such rules, regulations, and restrictions regarding our payments-related operations or properly manage the risks inherent to such operations could materially harm our business. \nWe are subject, and may become subject, to various restrictions with respect to our payments-related operations and payments products and services, including under U.S. federal, U.S. state and international laws, rules and regulations, as well as restrictions set forth in agreements we have with payment card networks and third-party payment service providers.\nPayments Regulations\n. The processing and acceptance of a variety of payment methods, and offering of payments related products and services may be subject to various laws, rules, regulations, legal interpretations, and regulatory guidance, including those governing cross-border and domestic money transmission and funds transfers, foreign exchange, payment services, consumer protection, information and communications security, anti-money laundering, escheatment, and sanctions and export control. If we or our GoDaddy Payments business were found to be in violation of applicable laws, rules or regulations, we could be subject to additional operating requirements and/or civil and criminal penalties or forced to cease providing certain services.\n48\nTable of Contents\nPayment Card Networks\n. We partner with payment card networks including Visa, MasterCard and American Express to conduct both our and GoDaddy Payments' payment processing. These payment card networks have adopted rules and regulations that apply to all merchants who accept their payment cards including special operating rules that apply to GoDaddy Payments as a \"payment facilitator\" providing payment processing services to our GoDaddy Payments' customers. Each payment card network has discretion to interpret its own network operating rules and may make changes to such rules at any time. Changes to such rules could include increasing the cost of, imposing restrictions on, or otherwise impacting the development of, our GoDaddy Payments' retail point-of-sale solutions, which may negatively affect their deployment and adoption and could ultimately harm our business. In addition, these payment card networks may in the future increase the interchange fees and assessments that they charge for each transaction on their networks and may impose special fees or assessments on any transactions on their networks. Our payment card networks have the right to pass any increases in interchange fees and assessments on to us, which could increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe may also be subject to fines assessed by the payment card networks resulting from any rule violations by us or our GoDaddy Payments' customers. For instance, we could be subject to penalties from payment card networks if we fail to detect that our GoDaddy Payments' customers are engaging in activities that are illegal, contrary to the payment card network operating rules, or considered \"high risk.\" Any such penalties could become material and could result in termination of our ability to accept payment cards or could require changes in our process for registering new GoDaddy Payments' customers. Any such penalties or fines could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThird-Party Payment Service Providers\n. We have agreements in place with companies that process credit and debit card transactions on our and GoDaddy Payments' behalf. These agreements allow these payment processors, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our, or in the case of GoDaddy Payments its customers' cash (referred to as a \"holdback\") or require us to otherwise post security equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company. These payment processors may be entitled to a holdback or suspension of processing services upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition. An imposition of a holdback or suspension of payment processing services by one or more of our payment processors could materially reduce our liquidity. Further, the software and services provided by payment processors may fail to meet our expectations, contain errors or vulnerabilities, be compromised, or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to process payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected. \nGoDaddy Payments' risk management efforts may not be effective, and we could be exposed to substantial losses and liability which could substantially harm our business.\nGoDaddy Payments offers payment processing and other payments products and services to our customers. We have programs to vet and monitor these customers, their GoDaddy Payments' accounts, and the transactions we process for them as part of our risk management efforts, but such programs require continuous improvement and may not be effective in detecting and preventing fraud and illegitimate transactions. When GoDaddy Payments' payments services are used to process illegitimate transactions, and we settle those funds to customers and are unable to recover them, we suffer losses and liability. As a greater number of sellers, including customers with larger sale volumes, use GoDaddy Payments' services, our exposure to material losses from a single seller, or from a small number of sellers, will increase. Illegitimate transactions can also expose us to governmental and regulatory enforcement actions and potentially prevent us from satisfying our contractual obligations to our third-party partners, which may cause us to be in breach of our obligations. Identity thieves and those committing fraud using stolen or fabricated credit card, debit card, or bank account numbers, or other deceptive or malicious practices such as account takeovers, could potentially steal significant amounts of money from us or from our customers or third parties. Our risk management policies, procedures, techniques, and processes may not be sufficient to identify every risk to which we are exposed, to enable us to prevent or mitigate the risks we have identified, or to identify additional risks to which we may become subject in the future. As our GoDaddy Payments offerings grow and our business becomes more complex, we will need to continue developing, improving, and making investments into our risk management infrastructure, techniques, and processes.\nIn addition, customers could attempt to use our payments products and services for illegal activities or improper uses. While our terms of service prohibit the use of our products by our customers for illegal or improper activities and allow us to take appropriate actions in response to such activities, any use of our payments platform for illegal or improper activities or failure by us to detect or prevent illegal or improper activity by our customers may subject us to claims, individual and class action lawsuits, and government and regulatory requests, inquiries, or investigations that could result in liability, restrict our operations, impose additional restrictions or limitations on our business or require us to change our business practices, harm our reputation, increase our costs, and negatively impact our business.\n49\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Owning our Class A Common Stock\nOur share price may be volatile, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has in the past been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and these fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our common stock. Since shares of our Class A common stock were sold in our initial public offering in April 2015 at a price of $20.00 per share, the reported high and low sales prices of our Class A common stock have ranged from $21.04 to $216.00 per share through \nFebruary 14, 2025. \nFactors that may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate include:\n•\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n•\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of technology companies in general, and of companies in our industry;\n•\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our operating results;\n•\nwhether our operating results meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors;\n•\nfailure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet the estimates or the expectations of investors;\n•\nannouncements of new products or technologies, commercial relationships, acquisitions or other events by us or our competitors;\n•\nactual or anticipated developments in our competitors' businesses or the competitive landscape generally;\n•\nactual or perceived cyber attacks or other cybersecurity incidents;\n•\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both;\n•\nregulatory developments in the U.S., foreign countries or both;\n•\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n•\nthe commencement or termination of any share repurchase program;\n•\nnew laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry standards, or any modifications to, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations, other legal obligations or industry standards applicable to our business;\n•\nnetwork or service outages, Internet disruptions, the availability of our service and vulnerabilities;\n•\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations or principles;\n•\nactions instituted by activist shareholders or others; \n•\nsales of large blocks of our stock;\n•\ndepartures of key personnel; or\n•\nmajor catastrophic events, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, outbreaks of pandemic diseases, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, if the market for technology stocks or the stock market in general experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our Class A common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, operating results or financial condition. The trading price of our Class A common stock might also decline in reaction to events affecting other companies in our industry even if these events do not directly affect us.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company's securities, securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company. If our stock price is volatile, we may become the target of securities litigation, which could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management's attention and resources.\n50\nTable of Contents\nProvisions of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could prevent a change in control of the company even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur charter and bylaws provide for, among other things:\n•\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could have the effect of impeding the success of an attempt to acquire us or otherwise effect a change in control of the company;\n•\nadvance notice for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at stockholder meetings; and\n•\ncertain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings.\nAt our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved certain amendments to our charter, including the recommendation of our board of directors to eliminate its classified structure. The declassification of the board of directors will be a phased-in approach. Beginning with the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders, each director nominated to serve on our board of directors has been nominated to serve for one-year terms. Our board of directors will be completely declassified, and all directors will be elected on an annual basis to serve one-year terms, beginning with the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders. In all cases, each director will hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified, or until his or her earlier resignation or removal. Until the board of directors is fully declassified at the 2025 annual meeting of stockholders, the classification of our board of directors prevents our stockholders from changing the membership of the entire board of directors at a single annual meeting.\nOur bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders' ability to obtain a favorable judicial form for disputes with us. \nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, employees, or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our charter, or our bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our bylaws provide that the U.S. federal district courts will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act.\nThis choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder's ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees and may discourage these types of lawsuits. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our Class A common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock, and we currently do not intend to pay dividends to the holders of our Class A common stock. Our ability to pay dividends on our Class A common stock is limited by our existing indebtedness and may be further restricted by the terms of any future debt incurred or preferred securities issued by us or our subsidiaries or by law. As a result, any capital appreciation in the price of our Class A common stock may be your only source of gain on your investment in our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot guarantee we will make any additional repurchases of our Class A common stock.\nIn the past, our board of directors has approved the repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock. In August 2023, our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to an additional $1,000.0 million of our Class A common stock. Such approval was in addition to the amount remaining available for repurchases under prior approvals of our board of directors, such that our total approved authority under the program is $4,000.0 million of shares of our Class A common stock through 2025. Under this or any other future share repurchase programs, we may make share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open market share purchases, accelerated share repurchase programs, block transactions or privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we repurchased \n51\nTable of Contents\nshares of our Class A common stock in the open market, which were retired upon repurchase, for an aggregate purchase price of $668.1 million. Of the $4,000.0 million authorized for repurchase, we have repurchased shares representing a cumulative total of $3,232.6 million and as of December 31, 2024, we had $767.4 million of remaining authorization available for repurchases. Future share repurchase programs may have no time limit, may not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. The timing and amount of any repurchases, if any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price, market and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal requirements such as Delaware surplus and solvency tests and other relevant factors. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price.\nThe existence of these share repurchase programs could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although these programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of Class A common stock and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of the programs.\nOther Risks\nEconomic conditions in the U.S. and international economies may adversely impact our business and operating results.\nGeneral macro-economic conditions, such as higher interest rates, inflation in the cost of goods and services including labor, a recession or an economic slowdown in the U.S. or internationally could adversely affect our operations as well as demand for our products and services, including our aftermarket and hosting services, which may make it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. For example, U.S. and global markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption due to interest rate and inflation increases, such as higher inflation rates in the U.S., which rose in the second half of 2021 and have remained above the Federal Reserve's inflation target, as well as the continued escalation of geopolitical tensions, including those as a result of the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East. We have experienced and continue to experience inflationary pressures in certain areas of our business. Although our business has not yet been materially negatively impacted by such inflationary pressures, we cannot be certain that neither we nor our customers will be materially impacted by continued pressures. To the extent conditions in the domestic and global economy change, our business could be harmed as current and potential customers may reduce or postpone spending or choose not to purchase or renew subscriptions to our products, or may choose not to use certain of our other services, which they may consider discretionary. If our customers face decreased consumer demand, increased regulatory burdens or more limited access to international markets, we may face a decline in the demand for our products and services, and our operating results could be adversely impacted.\nUncertain and adverse economic conditions may also lead to a decline in the ability of our customers to use or access credit, including through credit cards, as well as increased refunds and chargebacks, any of which could adversely affect our business. In addition, changing economic conditions may also adversely affect third parties with which we have entered into relationships and upon which we depend in order to grow our business. As a result, we may be unable to continue to grow in the event of future economic slowdowns.\nReporting requirements for which we must comply may continue to increase our costs, become too time-consuming or could divert management's attention, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). We expect the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources. In addition, complying with these rules and regulations may divert management's attention from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our stock.\nAs a public company, we are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and to report any material weaknesses in such internal control. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over \n52\nTable of Contents\nfinancial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Section 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to audit such internal control. As previously disclosed for the year ended December 31, 2023, we identified a material weakness in the design of our controls as of December 31, 2023 related to income taxes and related disclosures and we determined that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2023, due to this material weakness. Although this material weakness has been remediated, and our management has determined, and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested, that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024, there can be no assurance that we will not identify a material weakness in internal controls in the future or that the measures we may take to remediate any such future control deficiencies will be effective.  \nIf we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, we could be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs or pay fines or settlements, or judgments, thereby causing investor perceptions to be adversely affected and potentially resulting in restatement of our financial statements for prior periods and a decline in the market price of our stock. In addition, our current internal controls and any new controls we implement may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business or information technology systems or changes in the applicable laws, regulations and standards. We have also recently acquired, and may acquire in the future, companies that were not previously subject to Sarbanes-Oxley Act regulations and accordingly were not required to establish and maintain an internal control infrastructure compliant with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nAny failure to design or operate effective controls, any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, or any failure to implement adequate internal controls for our acquired companies could (i) harm our operating results, (ii) cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, (iii) adversely affect the results of management evaluations and independent registered public accounting firm audits of our internal control over financial reporting, which we are required to include in our periodic reports filed with the SEC, or (iv) cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, any of which could have a negative effect on our stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE in the future.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by shareholder activism. \nIn the past we have been subject to, and in the future may become subject to, shareholder activity and demands. Responding to actions by activist shareholders, such as requests for special meetings, potential nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors, requests to pursue a strategic combination or other transaction, or other special requests may disrupt our business and divert the attention of management and employees. In addition, any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could negatively impact our business. Responding to actions by activist shareholders could result in substantial costs for us. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals of our business.\nIncreased scrutiny from investors, regulators and other stakeholders relating to environmental, social and governance issues could result in additional costs for us and may adversely impact our reputation.\nInvestors, regulators, customers, employees and other stakeholders, both U.S.-based and internationally, are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters. If we fail, or are perceived to fail, to make progress or achievements, or to maintain ESG practices that meet evolving laws, regulations and stakeholder expectations, or if we revise any of our ESG commitments, initiatives or goals, our reputation and our ability to attract and retain employees could be harmed, we may receive negative media attention and we may be negatively perceived by our investors or our customers. To the extent that our required and voluntary disclosures about ESG matters increase, we could also be questioned about the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures and our reputation could be negatively impacted. We continue to monitor the development of ESG laws, regulations and other evolving disclosure requirements in the U.S. and globally.\n53\nTable of Contents\nOur business is subject to the risks of earthquakes, fire, power outages, floods and other catastrophic events, whether due to climate change or otherwise, and to interruption by man-made events such as terrorism and civil unrest.\nOur continued growth depends on the ability of our customers to access our products, services and customer support at any time and within an acceptable amount of time. In addition, our ability to access certain third-party solutions is important to our operations and the delivery of our products, services and customer support. Although we have disaster recovery plans in place, a significant natural disaster, such as an earthquake, fire or flood or other unusual or prolonged adverse weather patterns, whether due to climate change or otherwise, or acts of terrorism, civil unrest, pandemics, international conflicts, such as the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, or other similar events beyond our control could cause disruptions in our business or the business of our infrastructure vendors, data center hosting providers, partners or customers, our infrastructure vendors' abilities to provide connectivity and perform services on a timely basis or the economy as a whole. In the event our or our service providers' IT systems' are hindered by any of the events discussed above or otherwise, we could experience downtime, our products could become unavailable or our customers' websites could experience downtime or become unavailable. A prolonged service disruption for any of the foregoing reasons would negatively impact our ability to serve our customers and could damage our reputation, expose us to liability, cause us to lose customers or otherwise harm our business. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the services we use.",
