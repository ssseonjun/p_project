  "item1_summary": " The risk factors described below represent our current view of some of the most important risks facing our business and are important to its understanding . The following information includes a number of forward-looking statements and should be read in conjunction with information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk .\n The U.S. failed to offer high-quality support services, loss of key employees or inability to attract and retain highly skilled employees . The company failed to protect its intellectual property rights or any lawsuits against us for alleged infringement of third-party proprietary rights; the use of open source software in our applications; the failure to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks around the development and use of AI;  our existing and future debt obligations .\n Revenues from our Cloud solutions have grown substantially over the last few years . It is uncertain if we will continue to successfully grow those sources of revenue . The success of our growth strategies will depend upon our ability to anticipate and to adapt to changes in technology and industry standards, and to effectively develop, introduce, market, and gain broad acceptance of new product and service offerings .\n The failure to develop enhancements to our applications for, or that incorporate, technologies such as AI, machine learning, and large language models may impact our ability to win and retain customers . Our revenue may not grow as expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our market capitalization, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations .\n These types of transactions are subject to an increasingly complex series of regulations and laws that we, and/or our third-party vendors must comply with . Failure to comply with these regulations could result in consequences up to and including a regulator enjoining us from engaging in the movement of funds . The systems on which these payroll-related transactions are based are in some cases antiquated or manual .\n Some of the crucial platforms on which we host our back office and legacy systems will need to be retired, replaced or are in the process of being replaced . These technological changes are expensive and have and will continue to impact our profitability and demand attention from our senior leadership . If we fail to manage our growth effectively or if our strategy is not successful, we may be unable to execute our business plan, to maintain high levels of service, to adequately address competitive challenges, or to achieve our profitability goals .\n Such growth places substantial demands on our management, administrative, operational, technological, technological and financial infrastructure . To manage these demands effectively, we must consistently enhance and scale our systems, internal controls, reporting frameworks, and operational procedures . Failure to effectively manage growth or to achieve a profitable growth strategy could result in problems or delays in implementing customers, declines in quality or customer satisfaction, decreased profitability on new customer deals .\n Many of our current and potential competitors are larger, have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources than we do . Some of our competitors do or could offer HCM solutions bundled as part of a larger product offering . Our competitors have established marketing relationships, access to larger customer bases, and major distribution agreements with consultants,\n If our competitors’ products, services, or technologies become more accepted than our applications are today, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations . Some of our competitors may offer their products and services at a lower price compared to our products or their current pricing impacting our ability to achieve our target pricing .\n We may experience business impact if our partners do not carry out the services as committed, or at a quality level that our customers demand . Some of our business partners also have international operations and are subject to the risks described above . We could be subject to negative customer experiences, harm to our reputation or loss of customers, claims for any fines, penalties or other damages suffered by our customer .\n Our applications are inherently complex and we have, and may continue to identify material defects or errors in them that we are not yet aware of . Our reputation could be adversely affected, our market share could decline, and we could be subject to liability claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations .\n We have experienced, and may in the future experience, disruptions, outages, and other performance problems . These problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including hardware failures, infrastructure changes, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks, fraud, spikes in customer usage, denial of service attacks and Cloud interruptions run by third party service providers .\n Our growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties who provide us with services and license us software for use in or with both our applications and our internal operations . Our agreements with these third party service providers are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors . The inability to maintain these licenses could result in increased costs, or reduced service levels .\n Any undetected errors or defects in this third party software could prevent the deployment or impair the functionality of our applications . Failure to offer high-quality support services may adversely affect our relationships with our customers . Increased customer demand for these services, without corresponding revenues, could increase costs and have an adverse effect on our results of operations .\n If our customers are not satisfied with the quality and pace of the implementation and professional services provided by us or our partners, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations . A market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to sell our applications to existing and prospective customers .\n Our success depends largely upon the continued services of our senior management team . The loss of one or more of our executive officers, senior management, or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations . We have and and we expect to continue to experience, difficially,difficially .\n If our vendors or affiliates initiate payroll-related transactions on behalf of our customers and do not receive funds from the customer sufficient to cover the amounts paid on their behalf, we may suffer significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations . An erroneous payment instruction may trigger inaccurate payments .\n For our Dayforce Wallet product, we advance earned net wages and associated tax amounts on behalf of customers in connection with the “on-demand pay” payroll feature of the service . A customer may fail to satisfy its obligation to repay us for those advanced monies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation .\n The loss of these funds could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations . We are required to fund the payroll and wage funds of our customers and their employees regardless of any loss realized on those investments affecting the principal funds held . In the event of a global financial crisis, such a severe constriction of the availability of liquidity, could impact our ability to fund payrolls .\n The pursuit of potential acquisitions may divert the attention of management and cause us to incur various expenses in identifying, investigating, and pursuing suitable acquisitions, whether or not they are consummated . If an acquired business fails to meet expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations .\n The implementation of new accounting systems or other applications could interfere with our business and operations . An information security breach of our systems or the loss of, or unauthorized access to, customer information or sensitive company information could have a material adverse effect on our business, market brand, financial condition, and results of operations . If our acquisitions do not yield expected returns, we may be required to record charges based on this impairment assessment .\n Cyberattacks are expected to accelerate on a global basis in frequency and magnitude . Social engineering/phishing, malware (including ransomware), malfeasance by insiders, human, or technological error . Any information security breach in our IT Systems has the potential to impact our customer information and sensitive company information, including our financial reporting capabilities .\n Remote and hybrid working arrangements at our company (and at many third-party providers) increase the risks associated with our IT Systems . If any of the IT Systems fail to operate properly or become disabled even for a brief period, we could miss a critical filing period or lose control of customer data, either of which could result in financial loss .\n In 2009, an alleged criminal hack into a discontinued U.S. payroll application led to us becoming subject to a 20-year consent order . The FTC may take enforcement actions or other parties may initiate a lawsuit . Maintaining, updating, monitoring, and revising an information security program in an effort to ensure that it remains reasonable and appropriate in light of changes in security threats .\n We and certain of our third-party providers regularly experience cyberattacks and other incidents, and we expect such attacks and incidents to continue in varying degrees . Successful cyberattacks that disrupt or result in unauthorized access to third party IT systems can materially impact our operations and financial results . As of the date of this report, we have not experienced any material impacts as a result of the CrowdStrike software update .\n Our failure to secure, to protect, and to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations . We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws; trade secret protection; internal policies and technical controls; and confidentiality, non-disclosure or license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others .\n There is considerable intellectual property development activity in our industry . Third parties, including our competitors, may own or claim to own intellectual property relating to our service offerings or brand . As we expand our use of AI, there is uncertainty regarding intellectual property ownership and license rights, in particular with respect to AI tools that rely on large language models to generate content .\n The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market our applications . Some open source software may include AI capabilities or other software that incorporates or relies on AI, or may have been created, in whole or in part, by AI .\n Our solutions and our business are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including those regarding privacy, data protection, and information security . Failure to comply with these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations . Some of these laws require us to provide notification to affected individuals in the event of a data breach .\n The increased use of AI in our own HCM technology and by third parties whom we engage to process data on our behalf, if not properly managed and governed, could result in the unintended use, exposure, or loss of our own sensitive data . We may face significant costs to our business associated with implementing new data transfer mechanisms or we may have to amend certain of our business practices to eliminate such transfers .\n There is little if any interpretive guidance for some of the above-mentioned laws, and there are risks that regulators or courts may interpret these laws differently than us . The future enactment of more restrictive laws, rules, or regulations could have a material adverse impact on us through increased costs or restrictions on our businesses . We may be subject to future enforcement actions, investigations, or litigation, including potential future civil rights claims .\n Customers depend on our solutions to assist them to comply with applicable laws, which requires us and our third party providers to constantly monitor applicable laws and to make applicable changes to our solutions . Even the perception of noncompliance, whether or not valid, may damage our reputation . These regulatory requirements and considerations may also impose burdensome and costly requirements on our ability to leverage data .\n These risks have become exacerbated as we expand by acquisition and are most acute in the period following the acquisition as we integrate the acquired business and its systems . In the event our solutions fail to assist a customer to comply with applicable laws, we are subject to negative customer experiences, harm to our reputation or loss of customers . Changing regulatory requirements might render our services obsolete or block us from developing new products and services .\n Regulators worldwide are exercising heightened scrutiny with respect to anti-corruption, economic and trade sanctions, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations . Failure to comply with such laws could have a materially adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations or financial condition, or have other adverse consequences . We are growing our business throughout the world, including in numerous developing economies where companies and government officials are more likely to engage in business practices that are prohibited by domestic and foreign laws .\n U.S., Canada and other countries in which we operate are subject to anti-money laundering laws and regulations . Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 as amended by USA PATRIOT Act of 2000 (the BSA) requires banks and money services businesses to develop and implement risk-based anti-laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity .\n The DNTB says banks are increasingly viewing money services as a class of higher risk customers for money laundering . The company faces litigation, regulatory investigations, and other legal actions relating to breaches of contractual obligations, tortious claims, employment and labor law matters, including matters that may arise related to our Dayforce Flex Work employees .\n Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management’s attention and resources, which might materially harm our business, overall financial condition, and operating results . Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims . We may also be subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, and book and records examinations .\n We are subject to claims and investigations as a result of our predecessor, Control Data Corporation (“CDC”), Ceridian Corporation, and other former entities for whom we are successor-in-interest with respect to assumed liabilities . We cannot be certain if additional claims, investigations, or liabilities related to predecessor companies will surface .\n The legal and regulatory framework around the development and use of these technologies is rapidly evolving . Many federal, state, local, and foreign government bodies and agencies have introduced or are currently considering additional laws and regulations . Dayforce is actively monitoring the development of compulsory and voluntary frameworks that apply to developers, deployers, or users of AI in the jurisdictions in which we operate .\n Any failure to comply with evolving regulatory frameworks around the development and use of AI, machine learning, and automated decision making could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition . Our outstanding indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and our ability to operate our business . We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations .\n An event of default under our 2024 Senior Secured Credit Facility could result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable . If we are not able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our debt service obligations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, f. ll as to competitive pressures .\n In certain circumstances, noteholders may convert their Convertible Senior Notes at their option prior to the scheduled maturities . A default under the Indenture or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our future indebtedness . There is a risk that we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required .\n Our debt may be downgraded, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations . We could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Convertible Senior Notes as a current, rather than long-term, liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital .\n The Capped Calls may not operate as planned and may affect the value of the Convertible Senior Notes and our common stock . The option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock in secondary market transactions .\n This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Convertible Senior Notes . The option counterparties are financial institutions, and we are subject to the risk that they might default under the Capped Calls . If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure .\n The price of our common stock may be volatile, and investors may lose all or part of their investment . We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any option counterparty . Factors that may impact our performance and market price include those discussed elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K .\n Securities litigation against us, regardless of the merits or outcome, could result in substantial costs, damage to our reputation, and divert the time and attention of our management from our business . The issuance of additional stock, including common stock issued upon conversion of our Convertible Senior Notes, will dilute all other stockholders . We intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions or opportunities in the future .\n In July 2024, we announced that our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of up to $500 million of our issued and outstanding common stock . The authorization does not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares, there is no expiration date for the authorization .\n There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors have purchased their shares . Stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment . Anti-takeover protections in our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, or our contractual obligations, may discourage or prevent a takeover of our company .\n A change of control would cause us to be in default or could trigger dilutive or additional expenses . Certain provisions in the Convertible Senior Notes and the Indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us . Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations .\n Internal controls related to the operation of technology systems are critical to maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting . If we were to have another material weakness in our internal controls, we may not detect errors on a timely basis and our financial statements may be materially misstated . There could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our consolidated financial statements .\n Our business depends on the overall demand for HCM applications and on the economic health of our current and prospective clients . If economic conditions in the U.S., Canada, or in global markets deteriorate, clients may cease their operations, reduce headcount, delay or reduce their spending on HCM and other outsourcing services . An economic decline could result in reductions in sales of our applications, decreased revenue, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies, and increased price competition .\n There have been several instances when there has been uncertainty regarding the ability of the U.S. Congress and the President collectively to reach agreement on federal budgetary and spending matters . A prolonged government shutdown may affect such clients’ ability to make timely payments to us, which could adversely affect our operations results or financial condition . Our quarterly results of operations have and may continue to fluctuate significantly .\n Our quarterly financial results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control . The results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance . Catastrophic events may disrupt our business and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation .\n Company may endure system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in our application development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data . These catastrophic events have the potential to disrupt the business of our third-party suppliers, partners, or customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations .\n There has been a recent notable increase in current and proposed regulations at the state and federal level on publicly traded companies related to sustainability matters . Standards for tracking and reporting sustainability matters continue to evolve, and our processes and controls may not always comply with those evolving standards . We operate and are subject to tax in multiple jurisdictions .\n U.S. es tax, sales tax, and other non-income taxes is not always certain . We believe that our tax positions are reasonable and our tax reserves are adequate to cover any potential liability . If any of these tax authorities successfully challenge our positions, we may be liable for additional tax, penalties, and interest in excess of any reserves established, which may have a significant impact on our results and operations .\n Our information security program aligns with recommended practices in security standards issued by ISO, American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (SSAE18), National Institute of Standards and Technology (\"NIST\") and other industry sources . Deploying suitable security technology, which encompasses analytics and automation, and leveraging the expertise of highly skilled security and risk professionals, is crucial in our strategy .\n Management has prioritized five areas of information security program: global standards and operations, a risk-aware workforce, product security, detection and response, and data governance management . We contract with several outside cybersecurity experts to audit and test security controls on a regular basis . We also have a vendor risk assessment process consisting of the distribution and review of supplier questionnaires designed to help us evaluate cybersecurity risks .\n We cannot eliminate all risks from cybersecurity threats or provide assurances that we have detected all cybersecurity incidents . The company's business is dependent on the successful operation of its payroll, transaction, financial, accounting, and other data processing systems . Please refer to Part I,Please refer to Part I,   for more information on cybersecurity threats ."
