  "item1_summary": " Our business could be adversely affected if we fail to manage our organizational talent and capacity, including attracting and retaining qualified associates and key personnel . At our stores and distribution centers, we must recruit, develop, train, and retain qualified associates in relatively large numbers . Our ability to meet labor needs while controlling costs is subject to many external factors, including unemployment, unemployment levels, wage rates and salary levels .\n The labor market for executives and other key personnel is nationwide in scope and intensely competitive . Failure to develop an adequate succession plan for senior positions could reduce our organizational capabilities . We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk . We currently do not have any employees represented by unions. We may not be able to offset increased costs elsewhere in our business .\n If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted . Failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the company could adversely impact our operations and financial results . We have embarked on a number of strategic initiatives across the Dollar Tree and Family Dollar banners to drive productive sales growth and improve operating efficiency .\n The completion of the pending sale of the Family Dollar business is subject to various risks and uncertainties, may not be completed in a timely fashion or at all .

In fiscal 2024, the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the family Dollar business to Brigade Capital Management and Macellum Capital Management, LLC, subject to regulatory review and other closing conditions .\n If the pending sale of the Family Dollar business is completed, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction . Our company following the sale would be smaller and less diversified than exists today . Our diversification of revenues, costs and cash flows would diminish, such that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and vulnerability to changing market conditions .\n Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows . We cannot assure you that the Dollar Tree banner, as an independent company, will be successful . We have incurred losses due to impairment of goodwill and other long-lived assets . We expect to have continuing obligations to Family Dollar pursuant to transition services in connection with the sale of the Family Dollar business .\n In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, the Family Dollar business met the held for sale and discontinued operations accounting criteria and recognized an impairment of $3,438.8 million . The Family Dollar goodwill and trade name comprise a substantial portion of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets . Any reduction in or impairment of assets will result in a charge against earnings, which could have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations .\n Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable . Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates . Cybersecurity and Technology Risks could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results .\n Our ability to effectively manage our business depends significantly on the capabilities, confidentiality, integrity and availability of these systems .

We expect to continue to incur expenses to implement additional improvements and upgrades to our systems .\n We are exposed to persistent and substantial risks from cybersecurity threats . The security measures that we and/or our third-party partners put in place cannot provide absolute security to prevent harm to our systems . We are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions in which we operate, including privacy, data protection and data security .\n Our efforts to comply with consumer privacy laws and other similar privacy and data protection laws may impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to increase over time . Failure to meet and maintain compliance with PCI-DSS requirements could result in our inability to continue to accept credit cards as a form of payment, which would materially impact our ability to sell our products . We are currently in compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards .\n The unavailability of information technology systems on which we rely or the failure of those systems or software to perform as required to support our business needs could disrupt our business, decrease performance, and increase overhead costs .

Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts . The cost to defend current and future litigation or proceedings, including arbitrations, may be significant . There also may be adverse publicity associated with litigation related to product or food safety, customer information and environmental or safety requirements .\n Our failure to comply with applicable law, or to adequately respond to changes to such laws, could increase our expenses, expose us to legal risks or otherwise adversely affect us . The complexity of this regulatory environment and related compliance costs continue to increase due to additional legal and regulatory requirements, our expanding operations, and increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement efforts .\n The failure to properly manage our overall compliance program and fully comply with our obligations could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, damage our brand and reputation, and negatively impact our financial position and results of operations . New laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business . The adoption by certain jurisdictions of new or expanded environmental laws could significantly increase our operating or merchandise costs or reduce demand for our products .\n Our business faces increasing public scrutiny related to social responsibility, climate change and other ESG practices .

Shareholders who disagree with our strategy or the way we are managed may seek to effect change in the future, through various strategies that could include private engagement, publicity campaigns, proxy contests, and litigation . Responding to these actions may be costly and time-consuming .\n Certain provisions in our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws could delay or discourage a change of control transaction that may be in a shareholder’s best interest . rket in general has from time-to-time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations . These market fluctuations could reduce the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to our operating performance .\n We have measures in place to prevent, detect, and manage material risks from unauthorized access to our electronic information systems . These include various controls, technologies, and processes that protect confidential, proprietary, business and personal information . We also consider cybersecurity, along with other business risks, within our enterprise risk management framework . We use the National Institute of Standards and Technology framework along with risk-based analysis and judgment, to choose the most effective security controls .\n No material cybersecurity incidents occurred in fiscal 2024, but future incidents cannot be predicted .
