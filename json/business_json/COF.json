    "item1": "Item 1.\n \nBusiness—Forward-Looking Statements” for more information on the forward-looking statements in this Report. All statements that address operating performance, events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ materially from those included in these forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, those described in “Part I—",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors”—\n“A downgrade in our credit ratings could significantly impact our liquidity, funding costs and access to the capital markets.”\nTable 31 provides a summary of the credit ratings for the senior unsecured long-term debt of Capital One Financial Corporation and CONA as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTable 31: Senior Unsecured Long-Term Debt Credit Ratings\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCapital One\nFinancial\nCorporation\nCONA\nCapital One\nFinancial\nCorporation\nCONA\nMoody’s\nBaa1\nA3\nBaa1\nA3\nS&P\nBBB\nBBB+\nBBB\nBBB+\nFitch\nA-\nA\nA-\nA\nAs of February 11, 2025 Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) and Fitch Ratings (“Fitch”) have our credit ratings on a stable outlook. \nFollowing the Company’s February 19, 2024 announcement of its agreement to acquire Discover, Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”) placed our credit ratings on review for a downgrade. Moody’s said its review for downgrade may continue until the Transaction has been completed.\nOther Commitments\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into other contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our other contractual obligations include lending commitments, leases, purchase obligations and other contractual arrangements.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our total unfunded lending commitments were $458.1 billion and $441.3 billion, respectively, consisting of credit card lines, loan commitments to customers of both our Commercial Banking and Consumer Banking businesses, as well as standby and commercial letters of credit. We generally manage the potential risk of unfunded lending commitments by limiting the total amount of arrangements, monitoring the size and maturity structure of these portfolios and applying the same credit standards for all of our credit activities. For additional information, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 19—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” in this Report.\nOur primary involvement with leases is in the capacity as a lessee where we lease premises to support our business. The majority of our leases are operating leases of office space, retail bank branches and cafés. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2071, although some have extension or termination options, and we assess the likelihood of exercising such options. If it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the options, then we include the impact in the measurement of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $1.5 billion in aggregate operating lease obligations, of which $235 million will be due the following 12 months. We provide more information on our lease activity in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 8—Premises, Equipment and Leases.”\nWe have enforceable and legally binding purchase obligations for goods and services such as data management, media and other software and third-party services. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $4.0 billion and $789 million, respectively, in aggregate purchase obligations. This increase is mainly due to recently renewed commitments for certain long term purchase obligations for goods and services.\nWe also enter into various contractual arrangements that may require future cash payments, including short-term obligations such as trade payables, commitments to fund certain equity investments, obligations for pension and post-retirement benefit plans, and representation and warranty reserves. These arrangements are discussed in more detail in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations,” “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 15—Employee Benefit Plans” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 19—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others.”\n112\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nMARKET RISK PROFILE\nOur primary market risk exposures include interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and commodity pricing risk. We are exposed to market risk primarily from the following operations and activities:\n•\nTraditional banking activities of deposit gathering and lending;\n•\nAsset/liability management activities including the management of investment securities, short-term and long-term borrowings and derivatives;\n•\nForeign operations in the U.K. and Canada within our Credit Card business; and\n•\nCustomer accommodation activities within our Commercial Banking business.\nWe have enterprise-wide risk management policies and limits, approved by our Board of Directors, which govern our market risk management activities. Our objective is to manage our exposure to market risk in accordance with these policies and limits based on prevailing market conditions and long-term expectations. We provide additional information below about our primary sources of market risk, our market risk management strategies and the measures that we use to evaluate these exposures.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk represents exposure to financial instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. We are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the differences in the timing between the maturities or repricing of assets and liabilities. We manage our interest rate risk primarily by entering into interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments which could include caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts.\nWe use various industry standard market risk measurement techniques and analyses to measure, assess and manage the impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and our economic value of equity and changes in foreign exchange rates on our non-dollar-denominated funding and non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations.\nNet Interest Income Sensitivity\nOur net interest income sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates relative to our baseline interest rate forecast on our projected 12-month net interest income. Net interest income sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions:\n•\nAs of December 31, 2024, our metrics assume a market implied baseline interest rate projection for the upper limit of the Federal Funds Target Rate of 4.00% at both December 31, 2025 and 2026.\n•\nIn addition to our existing assets, liabilities and derivative positions, we incorporate expected future business growth assumptions. These assumptions include loan and deposit growth, pricing, plans for projected changes in our funding mix and our securities and cash position from our internal corporate outlook that is used in our financial planning process.\n•\nThe analysis assumes this forecast of expected future business growth remains unchanged between the baseline rate forecast and rate shock scenarios, including no changes to our interest rate risk management activities like securities and hedging actions. \n•\nWe incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit re-pricing, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta and mix as interest rates change, and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. In our models, \ndeposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type. In the contexts used in this section, “beta” refers to the change in deposit rate paid relative to the change in the federal funds rate.\n•\nIn instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates. In jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at \n0%. \n113\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nAt the current level of interest rates, our projected 12-month net interest income is expected to increase in higher rate scenarios and decrease in lower rate scenarios. The decrease in lower rate scenarios is driven by lower interest income from our assets, including floating rate credit card and commercial loans, being partially offset by lower interest expense from our deposits and other liabilities, net of our interest rate hedges. Our 12-month net interest income sensitivity was largely unchanged as compared to December 31, 2023. \nEconomic Value of Equity Sensitivity\nOur economic value of equity sensitivity measure estimates the impact of hypothetical instantaneous movements in interest rates on the net present value of our assets and liabilities, including derivative exposures. Economic value of equity sensitivity metrics are derived using the following key assumptions: \n•\nAs of December 31, 2024, our metrics assume a market implied baseline interest rate projection for the upper limit of the Federal Funds Target Rate of 4.00% at both December 31, 2025 and 2026.\n•\nThe analysis includes only existing assets, liabilities and derivative positions and does not incorporate business growth assumptions or projected balance sheet changes. \n•\nSimilar to our net interest income sensitivity measure, we incorporate the dynamic nature of deposit repricing and attrition, which includes pricing lags and changes in deposit beta as interest rates change and the prepayment sensitivity of our mortgage securities to the level of interest rates. In our models, deposit betas and mortgage security prepayments vary dynamically based on the level of interest rates and by product type. \n•\nBalance attrition assumptions for loans, including credit card, auto and commercial loans, remain unchanged between the baseline interest rate forecast and interest rate shock scenarios as those loans are mainly floating rate or shorter duration fixed rate loans and hence paydowns have a low sensitivity to the level of interest rates.\n•\nFor assets and liabilities with embedded optionality, such as mortgage securities and deposit balances, we utilize Monte Carlo simulations to assess economic value with industry-standard term structure modeling of interest rates.\n•\nOur calculations of net present value apply appropriate spreads over the benchmark yield curve for select assets and liabilities to capture the inherent risks (including credit risk) to discount expected interest and principal cash flows.\n•\nIn instances where an interest rate scenario would result in a rate less than 0%, we assume a rate of 0% for that scenario. This assumption applies only to jurisdictions that do not have a practice of employing negative policy rates. \nIn jurisdictions that have negative policy rates, we do not floor interest rates at 0%. \nOur current economic value of equity sensitivity profile demonstrates that our economic value of equity decreases in higher interest rate scenarios and increases in lower interest rate scenarios. The decrease in higher rate scenarios is due to the declines in the projected value of our fixed rate assets being only partially offset by corresponding movements in the projected value of our deposits and other liabilities. The pace of economic value of equity decrease is larger for the +200 bps scenario as our deposits are assumed to reprice more rapidly in higher interest rate environments. Our current economic value of equity sensitivity decreased modestly in higher rate scenarios while remaining largely unchanged for lower rate scenarios as compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in economic value of equity sensitivity in higher rate scenarios is mainly driven by modeling enhancements made to our deposit balance attrition forecast assumptions. The enhancement modestly increased the projected average life (and duration) of our deposit balances. In higher rate scenarios, the value of these deposits increased more due to longer duration, which provided modestly more offset to the decline in value of fixed-rate assets in these higher rate scenarios. \n114\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nTable 32 shows the estimated percentage impact on our projected baseline net interest income and our current economic value of equity calculated under the methodology described above as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nTable 32: Interest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nEstimated impact on projected baseline net interest income:\n+200 basis points\n1.3\n \n%\n0.7 \n%\n+100 basis points\n0.8\n \n0.8 \n+50 basis points\n0.4\n \n0.4 \n–50 basis points\n(0.4)\n(0.5)\n–100 basis points\n(0.8)\n(0.9)\n–200 basis points\n(1.9)\n(2.0)\nEstimated impact on economic value of equity:\n+200 basis points\n(6.3)\n(8.4)\n+100 basis points\n(3.0)\n(3.7)\n+50 basis points\n(1.4)\n(1.8)\n–50 basis points\n1.3\n \n1.6 \n–100 basis points\n2.5\n \n2.9 \n–200 basis points\n3.9\n \n4.0 \nIn addition to these industry standard measures, we also consider the potential impact of alternative interest rate scenarios, such as larger rate shocks, higher than +/- 200 bps, as well as steepening and flattening yield curve scenarios in our internal interest rate risk management decisions. We also regularly review the sensitivity of our interest rate risk metrics to changes in our key modeling assumptions, such as our loan and deposit balance forecasts, mortgage prepayments and deposit repricing. \nLimitations of Market Risk Measures\nThe interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and depositor behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.\nThere are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis described above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is performed at a particular point in time based on our existing balance sheet and, in some cases, expected future business growth and funding mix assumptions. The strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ significantly from our projections, which could cause our actual earnings and economic value of equity sensitivities to differ substantially from the above sensitivity analysis.\nFor further information on our interest rate exposures, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” \n115\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nForeign Exchange Risk\nForeign exchange risk represents exposure to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in other currencies. We are exposed to foreign exchange risk primarily from the intercompany funding denominated in pound sterling (“GBP”) and the Canadian dollar (“CAD”) that we provide to our businesses in the U.K. and Canada and net equity investments in those businesses. We are also exposed to foreign exchange risk due to changes in the dollar-denominated value of future earnings and cash flows from our foreign operations and from our Euro (“EUR”)-denominated borrowings.\nOur non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings expose our earnings to foreign exchange transaction risk. We manage these transaction risks by using forward foreign currency derivatives and cross-currency swaps to hedge our exposures. We measure our foreign exchange transaction risk exposures by applying a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation shock against the value of the non-dollar denominated intercompany funding and EUR-denominated borrowings and their related hedges, which shows the impact to our earnings from foreign exchange risk. Our nominal intercompany funding outstanding was 1.3 billion GBP and 973 million GBP as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and 1.4 billion CAD and 1.6 billion CAD as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our nominal EUR-denominated borrowings outstanding were 505 million EUR and 1.3 billion EUR as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur non-dollar equity investments in foreign operations expose our balance sheet and capital ratios to translation risk in AOCI. We manage our translation risk by entering into foreign currency derivatives designated as net investment hedges. We measure these exposures by applying a 30% U.S. dollar appreciation shock, which we believe approximates a significant adverse shock over a one-year time horizon, against the value of the equity invested in our foreign operations net of related net investment hedges where applicable. Our gross equity exposures in our U.K. and Canadian operations were 2.2 billion GBP as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, and 2.6 billion CAD and 2.4 billion CAD as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAs a result of our derivative management activities, we believe our net exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal. For m\nore information, see “\nItem 8.\n \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n—Note 10—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and “\nItem 8.\n \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n—Note 11—Stockholders’ Equity.”\nRisk related to Customer Accommodation Derivatives \nWe offer interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivatives as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We offset the majority of the market risk of these customer accommodation derivatives by entering into offsetting derivatives transactions with other counterparties. We use value-at-risk (“VaR”) as the primary method to measure the market risk in our customer accommodation derivative activities on a daily basis. VaR is a statistical risk measure used to estimate the potential loss from movements observed in the recent market environment. We employ a historical simulation approach using the most recent 500 business days and use a 99% confidence level and a holding period of one business day. As a result of offsetting our customer exposures with other counterparties, we believe that our net exposure to market risk in our customer accommodation derivatives is minimal. For further information on our risk related to customer accommodation derivatives, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”\n116\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nSUPPLEMENTAL TABLES\nTable A—Net Charge-Offs\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAverage loans held for investment\n$\n317,421\n$\n311,541\n$\n292,238\nNet charge-offs\n10,748\n8,414\n3,973\nNet charge-off rate\n3.39\n \n%\n2.70 \n%\n1.36 \n%\nTable B—\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nThe following non-GAAP measure consists of our adjusted results that we believe helps investors and users of our financial information understand the effect of adjusting items on our selected reported results; however, it may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures reported by other companies.

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the Company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nCapital One’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the Company’s assets; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that the Company’s receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company’s management and directors; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on its financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the framework in “2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), commonly referred to as the “2013 Framework.”\nBased on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria established by COSO in the 2013 Framework. Additionally, based upon management’s assessment, the Company determined that there were no material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\n/s/ RICHARD D. FAIRBANK\nRichard D. Fairbank\nChair and Chief Executive Officer\n/s/ ANDREW M. YOUNG\nAndrew M. Young\nChief Financial Officer\nFebruary 20, 2025\n131\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Capital One Financial Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Capital One Financial Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework)\n \n(the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Capital One Financial Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on\n \nthe COSO criteria\n.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company\n \nas of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nTysons, Virginia\nFebruary 20, 2025\n132\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Capital One Financial Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Capital One Financial Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.      \n \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. \nBasis for Opinion \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n133\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nAllowance for credit losses – Credit Card\nDescription of the Matter\nOn December 31, 2024, the Company’s allowance for credit losses for the credit card portfolio was $13.0 billion. As more fully described in Note 1 and Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements, the allowance for credit losses (ACL or allowance) represents management’s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of the Company’s held for investment (HFI) loan portfolios as of the balance sheet date and is comprised of two elements. The first is ‘quantitative’ and involves the use of loss forecasting models based upon various statistical analyses with adjustments for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions, which includes expected economic conditions. The second is ‘qualitative’ and involves factors that represent management’s judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses. Auditing the allowance for the credit card portfolio was especially challenging and highly judgmental due to the significant judgment required in establishing certain components of the qualitative element. The qualitative element requires management to make judgments regarding current and forward-looking conditions, internal and external factors, and uncertainty as it relates to economic, model, or forecast risks, where not already captured in the modeled results.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the internal controls over the ACL process, including, among others, controls over the development, operation, and monitoring of loss forecasting models and management review controls over key assumptions and qualitative judgments used in reviewing the final credit card allowance results. Our tests of controls included observation of certain of management’s quarterly ACL governance meetings, at which key management judgments, qualitative adjustments, and final ACL results are subjected to critical challenge by management groups independent of the group responsible for producing the ACL estimate.\nOur audit response included evaluating the comprehensive framework of the ACL, which involved engaging EY Specialists to evaluate the model methodology, model performance and model governance, as well as the conceptual soundness of certain qualitative elements. We also performed testing on data inputs utilized in the qualitative element calculation, as well as recalculated the qualitative element based on the framework. We evaluated the overall credit card ACL, inclusive of qualitative elements, and whether the recorded ACL appropriately reflects expected credit losses on the portfolio. Additionally, we performed searches for contrary evidence, which included reviewing historical loss statistics, peer bank metrics, and subsequent events and considered whether such information indicated that management’s judgements were not reasonable or consistently applied.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1994.\nTysons, Virginia\nFebruary 20,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company\nCapital One Financial Corporation, a Delaware corporation established in 1994 and headquartered in McLean, Virginia, is a diversified financial services holding company with banking and non-banking subsidiaries. Capital One Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company” or “Capital One”) offer a broad array of financial products and services to consumers, small businesses and commercial clients through digital channels, branch locations, cafés and other distribution channels. \nAs of December 31, 2024, Capital One Financial Corporation’s principal operating subsidiary was Capital One, National Association (“CONA”). The Company is hereafter collectively referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” CONA is referred to as the “Bank.”\nWe also offer products outside of the United States of America (“U.S.”) principally through Capital One (Europe) plc (“COEP”), an indirect subsidiary of CONA organized and located in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), and through a branch of CONA in Canada. Both COEP and our Canadian branch of CONA have the authority to provide credit card loans. \nOur principal operations are organized for management reporting purposes into \nthree\n major business segments, which are defined primarily based on the products and services provided or the types of customer served: Credit Card, Consumer Banking and Commercial Banking. We provide details on our business segments, the integration of any recent material acquisitions into our business segments, and the allocation methodologies and accounting policies used to derive our business segment results in “Note 18—Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers.”\nBasis of Presentation and Use of Estimates\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).\n \nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and in the related disclosures. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements. While management makes its best judgments, actual amounts or results could differ from these estimates.\n \nPrinciples of Consolidation \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Capital One Financial Corporation and all other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. We determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity (“VOE”) or a variable interest entity (“VIE”). All intercompany account balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nVoting Interest Entities \nVOEs are entities that have sufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that give them the power to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations. Since a controlling financial interest in an entity is typically obtained through ownership of a majority voting interest, we consolidate our majority-owned subsidiaries and other voting interest entities in which we hold, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting rights or where we exercise control through other contractual rights. \nInvestments in which we do not hold a controlling financial interest but have significant influence over the entity’s financial and operating decisions are accounted for under the equity method. If we do not have significant influence, we measure equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through net income, except those that do not have a readily determinable fair value (for which a measurement alternative is applied). We report equity investments in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets and include our share of income or loss for investments accounted for under the equity method and dividends from other equity investments in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income.\n The carrying value of investments included in other assets, excluding tax advantage investments, totaled $\n1.2\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, which primarily included equity investments measured using the alternative measurement method and equity method investments. The carrying value of equity investments measured using the alternative measurement method totaled $\n757\n million and $\n669\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n141\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nVariable Interest Entities\nVIEs are entities that, by design, either (i) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties; or (ii) have equity investors that do not have the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation to absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The entity that is deemed the primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE. An entity is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if that entity has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nIn determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider both qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of our involvement with the VIE, such as our role in establishing the VIE and our ongoing rights and responsibilities; our economic interests, including debt and equity investments, servicing fees and other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE; the design of the VIE, including the capitalization structure, subordination of interests, payment priority, relative share of interests held across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure and the reasons why the interests are held by us.\nWe perform on-going reassessments to evaluate whether changes in an entity’s capital structure or changes in the nature of our involvement with the entity result in a change to the VIE designation or a change to our consolidation conclusion. See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” for further details.\nBalance Sheet Offsetting of Financial Assets and Liabilities\nDerivative contracts that we execute bilaterally in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) market or are centrally cleared are generally governed by enforceable master netting agreements where we generally have the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty. Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under master netting agreements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. For derivative contracts entered into under master netting agreements for which we have not been able to confirm the enforceability of the setoff rights, or those not subject to master netting agreements, we do not offset our derivative positions for balance sheet presentation. See “Note 10—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for more details. \nWe also elect to present securities purchased or sold under resale or repurchase agreements on a net basis when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and other applicable criteria are met. Security collateral received from or pledged to the counterparties are not eligible for netting and are presented gross in our consolidated balance sheet. See “Note 9—Deposits and Borrowings” and “Note 10—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for more details.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits and other short-term investments, all of which, if applicable, have stated maturities of three months or less when acquired.\nSecurities Resale and Repurchase Agreements \nSecurities purchased under resale agreements and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase, principally U.S. government and agency obligations, are not accounted for as sales but as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold, plus accrued interest. We continually monitor the market value of these securities and deliver additional collateral to or obtain additional collateral from counterparties, as appropriate. See “Note 9—Deposits and Borrowings.”\nInvestment Securities \nOur investment portfolio consists primarily of the following: U.S. Treasury securities; U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (“GSE” or “Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”); Agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”); and other securities. The accounting and measurement framework for our investment securities differs depending on the security classification.\n142\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe classify securities as available for sale or held to maturity based on our investment strategy and management’s assessment of our intent and ability to hold the securities until maturity. We did not have any securities that were classified as held to maturity as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nWe report securities available for sale on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The amortized cost of investment securities reflects the amount for which the security was acquired, adjusted for accrued interest, amortization of premiums, discounts, and net deferred fees and costs, any applicable fair value hedge accounting adjustments, collection of cash, and charge-offs. Unrealized gains or losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”). Unamortized premiums, discounts and other basis adjustments for available for sale securities are generally recognized in interest income over the contractual lives of the securities using the interest method. However, premiums on certain callable investment securities are amortized to the earliest call date. We record purchases and sales of investment securities available for sale on a trade date basis. Realized gains or losses from the sale of debt securities are computed using the first-in first-out method of identification, and are included in non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income. We elect to present accrued interest for securities available for sale within interest receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. \nAn individual debt security is impaired when the fair value of the security is less than its amortized cost. If we intend to sell an available for sale security in an unrealized loss position or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, any allowance for credit losses is reversed through our provision for credit losses and the difference between the amortized cost basis of the security and its fair value is recognized in our consolidated statements of income.\nFor impaired debt securities that we have both the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss exists. The allowance for credit losses on our investment securities is recognized through our provision for credit losses and limited by the unrealized losses of a security measured as the difference between the security’s amortized cost and fair value. See further discussion below under the “Allowance for Credit Losses - Available for Sale Investment Securities” section of this Note.\nWe charge off any portion of an investment security that we determine is uncollectible. The amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, is charged off through the allowance for credit losses. Accrued interest is charged off as a reduction to interest income. Recoveries of previously charged off principal amounts are recognized in our provision for credit losses when received.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Available for Sale Investment Securities\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses that represents management’s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our investment securities classified as available for sale. When an investment security available for sale is impaired due to credit factors, we recognize that impairment through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and correspondingly establish an allowance for credit losses on our consolidated balance sheets. Credit losses recognized in the allowance for credit losses are limited to the amount by which the investment security’s amortized cost basis exceeds its fair value. Investment securities in unrealized gain positions do not have any allowance for credit losses as the investment security could be sold at its fair value to prevent realization of any credit losses. We exclude accrued interest from the fair value and amortized cost basis of an investment security for purposes of measuring impairment. Charge-offs of uncollectible amounts of investment securities are deducted from the allowance for credit losses.\nFor certain of our securities available for sale, we have determined that there is no risk of impairment due to credit factors. These investment securities include high quality debt instruments that are issued and guaranteed by the United States government and its agencies, certain government-sponsored enterprises, and certain foreign sovereign governments or supranational organizations. Management performs periodic assessments to reevaluate this conclusion by considering any changes in historical losses, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nWe evaluate impairment on a quarterly basis at the individual security level and determine whether any portion of the decline in fair value is due to a credit loss. We make this determination through the use of quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our qualitative analysis includes factors such as the extent to which fair value is less than amortized cost, any changes in the security’s credit rating, past defaults or delayed payments, and adverse conditions impacting the security or issuer. A credit loss exists to the extent that management does not expect to recover the amortized cost basis.\n143\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor investment securities which require further assessment, we perform a quantitative analysis using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology and compare the present value of expected future cash flows to the security’s amortized cost basis. Projected future cash flows reflect management’s best estimate and are based on our understanding of past events, current conditions, reasonable and supportable forecasts, and are discounted by the security’s effective interest rate adjusted for prepayments. The allowance for credit losses for investment securities reflects the difference by which the amortized cost basis exceeds the present value of future cash flows and is limited to the amount by which the security’s amortized cost exceeds its fair value. \nSee “Note 3—Investment Securities” for additional information.\nLoans\nOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated securitization trusts, and loans held for sale and is divided into three portfolio segments: credit card, consumer banking and commercial banking loans. Credit card loans consist of domestic and international credit card loans. Consumer banking loans consist of auto and retail banking loans. Commercial banking loans consist of commercial and multifamily real estate loans as well as commercial and industrial loans.\nLoan Classification \nWe classify loans as held for investment or held for sale based on our investment strategy and management’s intent and ability with regard to the loans, which may change over time. The accounting and measurement framework for loans differs depending on the loan classification, whether we elect the fair value option, whether the loans are originated or purchased and whether purchased loans are considered to have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. The presentation within the consolidated statements of cash flows is based on management’s intent at acquisition or origination. Cash flows related to loans that are acquired or originated with the intent to hold for investment are included in cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Cash flows related to loans that are acquired or originated with the intent to sell are included in cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nLoans Held for Investment\nLoans that we have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future and loans associated with consolidated securitization transactions are classified as held for investment. Loans classified as held for investment, except for credit card loans, are reported at their amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest. For these loans, we elect to present accrued interest within interest receivable on our consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans classified as held for investment, earned finance charges and fees are included in either loans held for investment (if they have been billed to the customer) or interest receivable (if they have not yet been billed to the customer).\nInterest income is recognized on performing loans on an accrual basis. We defer loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs on originated loans, premiums and discounts on purchased loans and loan commitment fees. We recognize these amounts in interest income as yield adjustments over the life of the loan and/or commitment period using the interest method. For credit card loans, loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a \n12\n-month period. The amortized cost of loans held for investment is subject to our allowance for credit losses methodology described below under the “Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for Investment” section of this Note.\nLoans Held for Sale\nLoans that we intend to sell or for which we do not have the ability and intent to hold for the foreseeable future are classified as held for sale. Multifamily commercial real estate loans originated with the intent to sell to government-sponsored enterprises are accounted for under the fair value option. We elect the fair value option on these loans as part of our management of interest rate risk along with the corresponding forward sale commitments. Loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are recognized as incurred and are reported in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Interest income is calculated based on the loan's stated rate of interest and is reported in interest income in the consolidated statements of income. Fair value adjustments are recorded in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\nAll other loans classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Loan origination fees, direct loan origination costs and any discounts and premiums are deferred until the loan is sold and are then recognized as part of the total gain or loss on sale. The fair value of loans held for sale is generally determined on an aggregate portfolio basis for each loan \n144\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ntype, however, fair value may be determined on an individual basis when circumstances warrant. Fair value adjustments are recorded in other non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income.\nIf a loan is transferred from held for investment to held for sale, then on the transfer date, any decline in fair value related to credit is recorded as a charge-off and any remaining allowance for credit losses is reversed through our provision for credit losses. The loan is then reclassified to held for sale at its amortized cost at the date of the transfer. A valuation allowance is established, if needed, such that the loan held for sale is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent to transfer, we report write-downs or recoveries in fair value up to the carrying value at the date of transfer and realized gains or losses on loans held for sale in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest income. We calculate the gain or loss on loan sales as the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold, net of the fair value of any interests retained.\nLoans Acquired\nAll purchased loans, including loans transferred in a business combination, are initially recorded at fair value, which includes consideration of expected future losses, as of the date of the acquisition. To determine the fair value of loans at acquisition, we estimate discounted contractual cash flows due using an observable market rate of interest, when available, adjusted for factors that a market participant would consider in determining fair value. In determining fair value, contractual cash flows are adjusted to include prepayment estimates based upon historical payment trends, forecasted default rates and loss severities and other relevant factors. The difference between the fair value and the unpaid principal balance is recorded as a loan premium or discount, which may relate to either credit or non-credit factors, at acquisition.\nWe account for purchased loans under the accounting guidance for purchased financial assets with credit deterioration when, at the time of purchase, the loans have experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination. These loans are herein referred to as purchased credit-deteriorated (“PCD”) loans and require the recognition of an allowance for credit losses at the time of acquisition.\nWe recognize an allowance for credit losses on purchased loans that have not experienced a more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination at the time of purchase through earnings in a manner that is consistent with originated loans. The policies relating to the allowance for credit losses on loans is described below in the “Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for Investment” section of this Note.\nLoan Modifications and Restructurings \nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectability of the loan and to avoid the need for foreclosure or repossession of collateral, if any. Loan modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, an interest rate reduction, a delay in payment, including payment deferrals or a term extension are reported as Financial Difficulty Modifications (“FDMs”). As restructurings offered to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are typically not at market terms, FDMs are generally accounted for as a continuation of the existing loan. See “Note 4—Loans” for additional information on our loan modifications and restructurings. \nLoan Modifications and Restructurings Prior to Adoption of ASU No. 2022-02\nIn periods prior to 2023, a loan modification in which a concession is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty was accounted for and reported as a TDR. These loan modifications typically include short-term payment deferrals, an extension of the loan term, a reduction in the interest rate, a reduction in the loan balance, or a combination of these modifications. See “Note 4—Loans” for additional information on our loan modifications and restructurings.\nDelinquent and Nonperforming Loans\n145\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe entire balance of a loan is considered contractually delinquent if the minimum required payment is not received by the first statement cycle date equal to or following the due date specified on the customer’s billing statement. Delinquency is reported on loans that are \n30\n or more days past due. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. For loan modifications, delinquency and nonaccrual status are reported in accordance with the revised terms of the loans. We generally place consumer and commercial loans on nonaccrual status when we believe the collectability of interest and principal is not reasonably assured. \nNonperforming loans generally include loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans classified as held for sale are excluded from nonperforming classification consideration.\nOur policies for classifying loans as nonperforming, by loan category, are as follows:\n•\nC\nredit card loans:\n As permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”), our policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being classified as nonperforming, as these loans are generally charged off in the period the account becomes \n180\n days past due. Consistent with industry conventions, we generally continue to accrue interest and fees on delinquent credit card loans until the loans are charged off, though any amounts deemed uncollectible are reserved for in our allowance for credit losses.\n•\nConsumer banking loans:\n We classify consumer banking loans as nonperforming when we determine that the collectability of all interest and principal on the loan is not reasonably assured, which is generally when the loan becomes \n90\n days past due.\n•\nCommercial banking loans\n: We classify commercial banking loans as nonperforming as of the date we determine that the collectability of all interest and principal on the loan is not reasonably assured.\n•\nModified loans and troubled debt restructurings:\n Modified loans, including TDRs for periods ending on or before December 31, 2022 and FDMs for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023, that are current at the time of the restructuring remain in accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and continued performance under the modified terms is expected. Otherwise, the modified loan is classified as nonperforming.\nInterest and fees accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status are reversed against earnings. In addition, the amortization of deferred loan fees, costs, premiums and discounts is suspended. Interest and fee income are subsequently recognized only upon the receipt of cash payments. However, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of loan principal, cash received is generally applied against the principal balance of the loan. Nonaccrual loans are generally returned to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful.\n146\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCharge-Offs\nWe charge off loans when we determine that the loan is uncollectible. The amortized cost basis, excluding accrued interest, is charged off as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses based on the time frames presented below. Accrued interest on loans other than credit card loans determined to be uncollectible is reversed as a reduction of interest income when the loan is classified as nonperforming. For credit card loans, accrued interest is charged off simultaneously with the charge-off of other components of amortized cost and as a reduction of interest income. When received, recoveries of previously charged off amounts are recorded as an increase to the allowance for credit losses (see the “Allowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for Investment” section of this Note for information on how we account for expected recoveries). Costs to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense as incurred. Our charge-off time frames by loan type are presented below.\n•\nCredit card loans\n: We generally charge off credit card loans in the period the account becomes \n180\n days past due. We charge off delinquent credit card loans for which revolving privileges have been revoked as part of loan workout when the account becomes \n120\n days past due. Credit card loans in bankruptcy are generally charged off by the end of the month following \n30\n days after the receipt of a complete bankruptcy notification from the bankruptcy court. Credit card loans of deceased account holders are generally charged off \n5\n days after receipt of notification.\n•\nConsumer banking loans:\n We generally charge off consumer banking loans at the earlier of the date when the account is a specified number of days past due or upon repossession of the underlying collateral. Our charge-off period for auto loans is \n120\n days past due. Small business banking loans generally charge off at \n120\n days past due or based on the date the amortized cost basis is deemed uncollectible. Auto loans that have not been previously charged off where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy and the loan has not been reaffirmed charge off in the period that is \n60\n days from the bankruptcy notification date, regardless of delinquency status. Auto loans that have not been previously charged off and have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy are charged off at the end of the month in which the bankruptcy discharge occurs. Remaining consumer loans generally are charged off within \n40\n days of receipt of notification from the bankruptcy court. In certain bankruptcy discharges, the loan is written down to the collateral value and the charged off amount is reported as principal reduction. Charge-off is determined using the present value of expected cash flows or a collateral evaluation for certain auto loans where the collateral value is lower than the amortized cost. Consumer loans of deceased account holders are charged off by the end of the month following \n60\n days of receipt of notification. \n•\nCommercial banking loans: \nWe charge off commercial loans in the period we determine that the amortized cost basis is uncollectible.\nAllowance for Credit Losses - Loans Held for Investment\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (“allowance”) that represents management’s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment. We measure the allowance on a quarterly basis through consideration of past events, including historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nWe measure current expected credit losses (“CECL”) over the contractual terms of our loans. The contractual terms are adjusted for expected prepayments but are not extended for renewals or extensions, except when an extension or renewal arises from a borrower option that is not unconditionally cancellable.\nWe aggregate loans sharing similar risk characteristics into pools for purposes of measuring expected credit losses. Pools are reassessed periodically to confirm that all loans within each pool continue to share similar risk characteristics. Expected credit losses for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets are measured individually.\nExpected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance, with a corresponding reduction to our provision for credit losses. At times expected recoveries may result in a negative allowance. We limit the allowance recovery expectations to amounts previously charged off and expected to be charged off. Charge-offs of uncollectible amounts result in a reduction to the allowance and recoveries of previously charged off amounts result in an increase to the allowance.\n147\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWhen developing an estimate of expected credit losses, we use both quantitative and qualitative methods in considering all available information relevant to assessing collectability. This may include internal information, external information, or a combination of both relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Judgment is applied to the development and duration of reasonable and supportable forecasts used in our estimation of lifetime losses. We estimate expected credit losses over the duration of those forecasts and then revert, on a rational and systematic basis, to historical losses at each relevant loss component of the estimate. Expected losses for contractual terms extending beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast and reversion periods are based on those historical losses.\nManagement will consider and may qualitatively adjust for conditions, changes and trends in loan portfolios that may not be captured in modeled results. These adjustments are referred to as qualitative factors and represent management’s judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses. Management’s judgment may involve an assessment of current and forward-looking conditions including but not limited to changes in lending policies and procedures, nature and volume of the portfolio, external factors, and uncertainty as it relates to economic, model or forecast risks, where not already captured in the modeled results.\nExpected credit losses for collateral-dependent loans are based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. When we intend to liquidate the collateral, the fair value of the collateral is adjusted for expected costs to sell. A loan is deemed to be a collateral-dependent loan when (i) we determine foreclosure or repossession of the underlying collateral is probable, or (ii) foreclosure or repossession is not probable, but the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and we expect repayment to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral. The allowance for a collateral-dependent loan reflects the difference between the loan’s amortized cost basis and the fair value (less selling costs, where applicable) of the loan’s underlying collateral.\nOur credit card and consumer banking loan portfolios consist of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans. The consumer banking loan portfolio is divided into two primary portfolio segments: auto loans and retail banking loans. We assess our credit card and consumer banking loan portfolios based on common risk characteristics, such as origination year, contract type, interest rate, borrower credit score and geography. The commercial banking loan portfolio is primarily composed of larger-balance, non-homogeneous loans. These loans are subject to reviews that result in internal risk ratings. In assessing the risk rating of a particular commercial banking loan, among the factors we consider are the financial condition of the borrower, geography, collateral performance, historical loss experience and industry-specific information that management believes is relevant in determining and measuring expected credit losses. Subjective assessment and interpretation are involved. Emphasizing one factor over another or considering additional factors could impact the risk rating assigned to that commercial banking loan.\nFor consumer banking and commercial banking loans, the contractual period typically does not include renewals or extensions because the renewals and extensions are generally not at the borrower’s exclusive option to exercise. The undrawn credit exposure associated with our credit card loans is unconditionally cancellable. For this reason, expected credit losses are measured based only on the drawn balance at each quarterly measurement date and not on the undrawn exposure. Because credit card loans do not have a defined contractual life, management estimates both the volume and application of payments to determine a contractual life of the drawn balance at the measurement date over which expected credit losses are developed for credit card loans.\nFor consumer banking and commercial banking loans, we have made a policy election to not measure an allowance on accrued interest for loans held for investment because we reverse uncollectible accrued interest in a timely manner. See the “Delinquent and Nonperforming Loans” and “Charge-Offs” sections of this Note for information on what we consider timely. For credit card loans, we do not make this election, and we reserve for uncollectible accrued interest relating to credit card loans in the allowance.\n148\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe allowance related to credit card and consumer banking loans is assessed on a pooled basis is based on a modeled calculation, which is supplemented by management judgment as described above. Because of the homogeneous nature of our consumer loan portfolios, the allowance is based on the aggregated portfolio segment evaluations. The allowance is established through a process that begins with estimates of historical losses in each pool based upon various statistical analyses, with adjustments for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions, which includes expected economic conditions. Loss forecast models are utilized to estimate expected credit losses and consider several portfolio indicators including, but not limited to, expected economic conditions, historical loss experience, account seasoning, the value of collateral underlying secured loans, estimated foreclosures or defaults based on observable trends, delinquencies, bankruptcy filings, unemployment, borrower credit scores and general business trends. Management also considers an evaluation of overall portfolio credit quality based on indicators such as changes in our credit evaluation, underwriting and collection management policies, the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements, general economic conditions and business trends, and uncertainties in forecasting and modeling techniques used in estimating our allowance.\nThe allowance related to commercial banking loans assessed on a pooled basis and is based on our historical loss experience for loans with similar risk characteristics and consideration of the current credit quality of the portfolio, which is supplemented by management judgment as described above. These are adjusted for current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions likely to cause future losses which vary from historical levels. We apply internal risk ratings to commercial banking loans, which we use to assess credit quality and derive a total loss estimate based on an estimated probability of default (“default rate”) and loss given default (“loss severity”). Management may also apply judgment to adjust the loss factors derived, taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors, including general economic conditions, industry-specific and geographic trends, portfolio concentrations, trends in internal credit quality indicators, and current and past underwriting standards that have occurred but are not yet reflected in the historical data underlying our loss estimates.\nThe allowance related to smaller-balance homogeneous credit card and consumer banking loans whose terms have been modified is calculated on a pool basis using historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions likely to cause future losses which vary from historical levels for the respective class of assets. The allowance related to consumer banking loans that are assessed at a loan-level is determined based on key considerations that include the borrower’s overall financial condition, resources and payment history, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, and when applicable, the estimated realizable value of any collateral. The allowance related to commercial banking loans that are assessed at a loan-level is generally determined in accordance with our policy for estimating expected credit losses for collateral-dependent loans as described above.\nOff-balance sheet credit exposures\nIn addition to the allowance, we also measure expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable in our Commercial Banking business. This reserve is measured using the same measurement objectives as the allowance for loans held for investment and is recorded within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. These commitments are segregated by risk according to our internal risk rating scale, which we use to assess credit quality and derive an expected credit loss estimate. We assess these risk classifications, taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative factors, including historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of conditions likely to cause future losses which vary from historical levels, and utilization assumptions to estimate the reserve for unfunded lending commitments. Expected credit losses are not measured on unfunded lending commitments that are unconditionally cancellable, including all of our unfunded credit card and consumer banking lending commitments and certain of our unfunded commercial banking lending commitments.\nDetermining the appropriateness of the allowance and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is complex and requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio, in light of the factors then prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments in future periods.\n See “Note 5—Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments” for additional information.\n149\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSecuritization of Loans\nOur loan securitization activities provide a source of funding and primarily involve the securitization of credit card and auto loans. Loan securitization involves the transfer of a pool of loan receivables from our portfolio to a trust. The trust then sells undivided interests in the pool of loan receivables to third-party investors through the issuance of debt securities and transfers the proceeds from the debt issuance to us as consideration for the loan receivables transferred. The debt securities are collateralized by the loan receivables transferred from our portfolio. We remove loans from our consolidated balance sheets if securitizations qualify as sales to unconsolidated VIEs, recognize assets retained and liabilities assumed at fair value and record a gain or loss on the transferred loans. Alternatively, if the transfer does not qualify as a sale but instead is considered a secured borrowing, the loans will remain on our consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting liability recognized for the amount of proceeds received.\n See “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” for additional details. \nPremises, Equipment and Leases\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Land is carried at cost. We capitalize direct costs incurred during the application development stage of internally developed software projects. Depreciation and amortization expenses are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. \nUseful lives for premises and equipment are generally estimated as follows:\nPremises and Equipment\nUseful Lives\nBuildings and improvements\n5\n-\n39\n years\nFurniture and equipment\n3\n-\n10\n years\nComputer software\n3\n years\nLeasehold improvements\nLesser of the useful life or the remaining lease term\nExpenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and gains or losses upon disposition are recognized in our consolidated statements of income as realized. See “Note 8—Premises, Equipment and Leases” for additional information.\nLeases\nLease classification is determined at inception for all lease transactions with an initial term greater than one year. Operating leases are included as right-of-use (“ROU”) assets within other assets, and operating lease liabilities are classified as other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in premises and equipment, and other borrowings on our consolidated balance sheets. Our operating lease expense is included in occupancy and equipment within non-interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. Lease expense for minimum lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. See “Note 8—Premises, Equipment and Leases” for additional information.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets \nGoodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date and is generally assigned to one or more reporting units at acquisition date. A reporting unit is defined as an operating segment, or a business unit that is one level below an operating segment. We have \nfour\n reporting units: Credit Card, Auto Finance, Other Consumer Banking, and Commercial Banking. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually or more frequently if adverse circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. These indicators could include a sustained, significant decline in the Company’s stock price, a decline in expected future cash flows, significant disposition activity, a significant adverse change in the economic or business environment, and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group, among others. \nIntangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on either an accelerated or straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. See “Note 7—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for additional information.\n150\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMortgage Servicing Rights \nMortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) are initially recorded at fair value when mortgage loans are sold or securitized in the secondary market and we retain the right to service these loans in exchange for a servicing fee. Commercial MSRs are subsequently accounted for under the amortization method. We evaluate for impairment as of each reporting date and recognize any impairment in other non-interest income. See “Note 7—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for additional information.\n \nForeclosed Property and Repossessed Assets \nForeclosed property and repossessed assets obtained through our lending activities typically include commercial real estate or personal property, such as automobiles, and are recorded at net realizable value. For foreclosed property and repossessed assets, we generally reclassify the loan to repossessed assets upon repossession of the property in satisfaction of the loan. Net realizable value is the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated selling costs and is based on appraisals, when available. Subsequent to initial recognition, foreclosed property and repossessed assets are recorded at the lower of our initial cost basis or net realizable value, which is routinely monitored and updated. Any changes in net realizable value and gains or losses realized from disposition of the property are recorded in other non-interest expense. See “Note 17—Fair Value Measurement” for details.\nRestricted Equity Investments\nWe have investments in Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) stock and in Federal Reserve Bank stock. These investments, which are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets, are not marketable, are carried at cost, and are reviewed for impairment if there is any indicator of impairment.\nLitigation\nWe establish reserves for legal and regulatory related matters that arise from the ordinary course of our business activities when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Professional service costs, including fees for attorneys and experts, expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are expensed as services are provided. See “Note 19—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for additional information.\nCustomer Rewards Reserve \nWe offer products, primarily credit cards, which include programs that allow members to earn rewards based on account activity that can be redeemed for cash (primarily in the form of statement credits), gift cards, travel, or covering eligible charges. The amount of rewards that a customer earns varies based on the terms and conditions of the rewards program and product. When rewards are earned by a customer, the cost of the rewards is generally recorded as an offset to interchange income, with a corresponding increase to the customer rewards reserve. The customer rewards reserve is computed based on the estimated future cost of earned rewards that are expected to be redeemed and is reduced as rewards are redeemed. In estimating the customer rewards reserve, we consider historical redemption and spending behavior, as well as the terms and conditions of the current rewards programs, among other factors. Our customer rewards reserve assumes the substantial majority of all rewards earned will eventually be redeemed.\n \nRevenue Recognition \nInterest Income and Fees\nInterest income and fees on loans and investment securities are recognized based on the contractual provisions of the underlying arrangements.\nLoan origination fees, direct loan origination costs, premiums and discounts on loans held for investment are deferred and generally amortized into interest income as yield adjustments over the contractual life and/or commitment period using the interest method. Costs deferred include, among other things, incentives paid to our network of auto dealers for loan referrals. We may elect to factor prepayment estimates into the calculation of the constant effective yield to apply the interest method for certain loan portfolios. Prepayment estimates are based on historical prepayment data, existing and forecasted interest rates, and \n151\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\neconomic data. For credit card loans, loan origination fees and direct loan origination costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over a \n12\n-month period.\nThe unamortized premiums, discounts and other basis adjustments on investment securities are included as components of the investment securities’ carrying value and are generally recognized in interest income as yield adjustments over the contractual lives of the securities using the interest method. However, premiums for certain callable investment securities are amortized to the earliest call date. \nFinance charges and fees on credit card loans are recorded in revenue when earned and presented on our consolidated balance sheets within either loan receivables (if they have been billed to the customer) or interest receivable (if they have not yet been billed to the customer). Annual membership fees are classified as service charges and other customer-related fees in our consolidated statements of income and are deferred and amortized into income over \n12\n months on a straight-line basis.\nInterchange Income \nInterchange income generally represents fees for standing ready to authorize and providing settlement on credit and debit card transactions processed through the MasterCard® (“MasterCard”) and Visa® (“Visa”) interchange networks. The levels and structure of interchange rates set by MasterCard and Visa can vary based on cardholder purchase volumes, among other factors. We recognize interchange income upon settlement. See “Note 18—Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers” for additional details.\nCard Partnership Agreements\n \nWe have contractual agreements with certain retailers and other partners to provide lending and other services to a mutual customer base. We primarily issue private-label and cobrand credit card loans to these customers over the terms of the partnership agreements. \nCertain partners assist in or perform marketing activities on our behalf and promote our products and services to their customers. As compensation for providing these services, we often pay royalties, bounties or other special bonuses to these partners. Our payments to partners are generally recorded as reductions of revenue or as marketing expenses, depending on the nature of the payments. Our credit card partnership agreements may also provide for profit or revenue sharing payments which are presented as a reduction of the related revenue line item(s) when owed to the partner.\nWhen a partner agrees to share a portion of the credit losses associated with the partnership, we evaluate the contractual provisions for the loss share payments as well as applicable accounting guidance to determine whether to present the sharing of losses on a gross or net basis in our consolidated financial statements. When loss sharing amounts due from partners are presented on a net basis, they are recorded as a reduction to our provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and reduce the charge-off amounts that we report. The allowance for credit losses attributable to these portfolios is also reduced by the expected reimbursements from these partners for loss sharing amounts. See “Note 5—Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments” for additional information related to our loss sharing arrangements.\nStock-Based Compensation \nWe are authorized to issue stock–based compensation to employees and directors in various forms, primarily as restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance share units (“PSUs”). In addition, we also issue cash-settled RSUs which are not counted against the common shares reserved for issuance or available for issuance because they are settled in cash. \nFor awards settled in shares, we generally recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the award’s requisite service period based on the fair value of the award at the grant date. If an award settled in shares contains a performance condition with graded vesting, we recognize compensation expense using the accelerated attribution method. Restricted stock units that are cash-settled are accounted for as liability awards which results in quarterly expense fluctuations based on changes in our stock price through the date that the awards are settled. Awards to participants that are eligible for retirement or become eligible during the vesting period are expensed immediately or over the time period between the grant date and when the participant becomes retirement eligible, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is included in salaries and associate benefits in the consolidated statements of income. \n152\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor RSUs and PSUs, the fair value of stock-based compensation used in determining compensation expense will generally equal the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Certain share-settled awards have discretionary vesting conditions which result in the remeasurement of these awards at fair value each reporting period and the potential for compensation expense to fluctuate with changes in our stock price. See “Note 14—Stock-Based Compensation Plans” for additional details.\nMarketing Expenses \nMarketing expense includes the cost of our various promotional efforts to attract and retain customers such as advertising, promotional materials and certain customer incentives, including spend-based bonuses. We expense marketing costs as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize the current and deferred tax consequences of all transactions that have been recognized in the financial statements using the provisions of the enacted tax laws. Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period and includes income tax expense related to our uncertain tax positions, as well as tax-related interest and penalties. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We record the effect of remeasuring deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates or laws as a component of income tax expense related to continuing operations for the period in which the change is enacted. We release income tax effects stranded in AOCI when an entire portfolio of the type of item is sold, terminated or extinguished. Income tax benefits are recognized when, based on their technical merits, they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination. The amount recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement. See “Note 16—Income Taxes” for additional details\n.\nEarnings Per Share\nEarnings per share is calculated and reported under the “two-class” method. The “two-class” method is an earnings allocation method under which earnings per share is calculated for each class of common stock and participating security considering both dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings as if all such earnings had been distributed during the period. We have unvested share-based payment awards which have a right to receive non-forfeitable dividends and are therefore deemed to be participating securities.\nWe calculate basic earnings per share by dividing net income, after deducting dividends on preferred stock and participating securities as well as undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities, by the average number of common shares outstanding during the period, net of any treasury shares. We calculate diluted earnings per share in a similar manner after consideration of the potential dilutive effect of common stock equivalents on the average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Common stock equivalents include stock options, RSUs and PSUs. Common stock equivalents are calculated based upon the treasury stock method using an average market price of common shares during the period. Dilution is not considered when a net loss is reported. Common stock equivalents that have an antidilutive effect are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. See “Note 13—Earnings Per Common Share” for additional details.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nAll derivative financial instruments, whether designated in a qualifying hedge accounting relationship or not, are reported at their fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities. See “Note 10—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” for additional details.\n153\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair Value \nFair value, also referred to as an exit price, is defined as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. See “Note 17—Fair Value Measurement” for additional information.\nAccounting for Acquisitions \nWe account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date, with limited exceptions. Transaction costs and any costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. Goodwill is recognized as the excess of the acquisition price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is greater than the acquisition price, a bargain purchase gain is recognized and recorded in other non-interest income. \nIf the acquired set of activities and assets do not meet the accounting definition of a business, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. In an asset acquisition, the assets acquired are recorded at the purchase price plus any transaction costs incurred and no goodwill is recognized.\n154\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNewly Adopted Accounting Standards During the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nStandard\nGuidance\nAdoption Timing and\nFinancial Statement Impacts\nTax Credit Investments\nASU No. 2023-02, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): \nAccounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method\nIssued March 2023\nPermits entities to elect to account for their tax equity investments, regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received, using the proportional amortization method, if certain criteria are met. Previously, only Low-Income Housing Tax Credit investments were eligible for application of the proportional amortization method.\nWe adopted this standard on its effective date of January 1, 2024 using a modified retrospective transition method, which results in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings in the period of adoption.\nOur adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSee “Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity” and “Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” for additional disclosures.\nSegment Reporting Disclosures\nASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIssued November 2023\nRequires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis.\nWe adopted this standard as of December 31, 2024 using a retrospective transition method.\nSee “Note 18—Business Segments and Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n”\n for additional disclosures.\n155\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2—BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nOn February 19, 2024, the Company entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Capital One, Discover Financial Services, a Delaware corporation (“Discover”) and Vega Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which (a) Merger Sub will merge with and into Discover, with Discover as the surviving entity in the merger (the “Merger”); (b) immediately following the Merger, Discover, as the surviving entity, will merge with and into Capital One, with Capital One as the surviving entity in the second-step merger (the “Second Step Merger”); and (c) immediately following the Second Step Merger, Discover Bank, a Delaware-chartered and wholly owned subsidiary of Discover, will merge with and into CONA, with CONA as the surviving entity in the merger (the “CONA Bank Merger,” and collectively with the Merger and the Second Step Merger, the “Transaction”). The Merger Agreement was unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of each of Capital One and Discover.\nAt the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock of Discover outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, other than certain shares held by Discover or Capital One, will be converted into the right to receive 1.0192 shares of common stock of Capital One. Holders of Discover common stock will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. At the effective time of the Second Step Merger, each share of Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, of Discover, and each share of 6.125% Fixed-Rate Reset Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series D, of Discover, in each case outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Second Step Merger, will be converted into the right to receive a share of newly created series of preferred stock of Capital One having terms that are not materially less favorable than the applicable series of Discover preferred stock.\nOn February 18, 2025, Capital One and Discover each held a special meeting of their respective stockholders. During the respective meetings, Capital One stockholders approved by the requisite vote the issuance of Capital One common stock as merger consideration to the holders of Discover common stock, and Discover stockholders adopted by the requisite vote the Merger Agreement. The closing of the Transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of other customary closing conditions, including the receipt of required regulatory approvals.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we have incurred $\n234\n million of integration expenses related to the agreement to acquire Discover, which are included in operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n156\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 3—INVESTMENT SECURITIES\nOur investment securities portfolio consists of the following: U.S. government-sponsored enterprise or agency (“GSE” or “Agency”) and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”), agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), U.S. Treasury securities and other securities.

We discuss these risks and our credit quality indicator for each portfolio segment below.\nCredit Card\nOur credit card loan portfolio is highly diversified across millions of accounts and numerous geographies without significant individual exposure. We therefore generally manage credit risk based on portfolios with common risk characteristics. The risk in our credit card loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends, such as the U.S. unemployment rate and U.S. Real Gross Domestic Product (“GDP”) growth rate, as well as consumers’ financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance. The key indicator we assess in monitoring the credit quality and risk of our credit card loan portfolio is delinquency trends, including an analysis of loan migration between delinquency categories over time. \nThe table below presents our credit card portfolio by delinquency status as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTable 4.3: Credit Card Delinquency Status\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollars in millions)\nRevolving Loans\nRevolving Loans Converted to Term\nTotal\nRevolving Loans\nRevolving Loans Converted to Term\nTotal\nCredit Card:\nDomestic credit card:\nCurrent\n$\n148,112\n \n$\n453\n \n$\n148,565\n \n$\n140,521\n \n$\n339\n \n$\n140,860\n \n30-59 days\n1,944\n \n29\n \n1,973\n \n1,940\n \n28\n \n1,968\n \n60-89 days\n1,483\n \n20\n \n1,503\n \n1,454\n \n17\n \n1,471\n \nGreater than 90 days\n3,549\n \n28\n \n3,577\n \n3,339\n \n28\n \n3,367\n \nTotal domestic credit card\n155,088\n \n530\n \n155,618\n \n147,254\n \n412\n \n147,666\n \nInternational card businesses:\nCurrent\n6,533\n \n37\n \n6,570\n \n6,521\n \n31\n \n6,552\n \n30-59 days\n102\n \n5\n \n107\n \n112\n \n4\n \n116\n \n60-89 days\n69\n \n3\n \n72\n \n72\n \n4\n \n76\n \nGreater than 90 days\n135\n \n6\n \n141\n \n132\n \n5\n \n137\n \nTotal international card businesses\n6,839\n \n51\n \n6,890\n \n6,837\n \n44\n \n6,881\n \nTotal credit card\n$\n161,927\n \n$\n581\n \n$\n162,508\n \n$\n154,091\n \n$\n456\n \n$\n154,547\n \n163\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nConsumer Banking\nOur consumer banking loan portfolio consists of auto and retail banking loans. Similar to our credit card loan portfolio, the risk in our consumer banking loan portfolio correlates to broad economic trends as well as consumers’ financial condition, all of which can have a material effect on credit performance.

We assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower’s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends. The scale based on our internal risk rating system is as follows:\n•\nNoncriticized:\n Loans that have not been designated as criticized, frequently referred to as “pass” loans.\n•\nCriticized performing:\n Loans in which the financial condition of the obligor is stressed, affecting earnings, cash flows or collateral values. The borrower currently has adequate capacity to meet near-term obligations; however, the stress, left unabated, may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects at some future date.\n•\nCriticized nonperforming:\n Loans that are not adequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as criticized nonperforming have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, which jeopardize the full repayment of the debt. These loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain a credit loss if the deficiencies are not corrected and are generally placed on nonaccrual status.\nWe use our internal risk rating system for regulatory reporting, determining the frequency of credit exposure reviews, and evaluating and determining the allowance for credit losses. Generally, loans that are designated as criticized performing and criticized nonperforming are reviewed quarterly by management to determine if they are appropriately classified/rated and whether any impairment exists. Noncriticized loans are generally reviewed, at least annually, to determine the appropriate risk rating. In addition, we evaluate the risk rating during the renewal process of any loan or if a loan becomes past due.\nThe following table presents our commercial banking portfolio of loans held for investment by internal risk ratings as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The internal risk rating status includes all past due loans, both performing and nonperforming. \nTable 4.5: Commercial Banking Portfolio by Internal Risk Ratings\nDecember 31, 2024\nTerm Loans by Vintage Year\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nPrior\nTotal Term Loans\nRevolving Loans\nRevolving Loans Converted to Term\nTotal\nInternal risk rating:\n(1)\nCommercial and multifamily real estate\nNoncriticized\n$\n1,820\n \n$\n2,574\n \n$\n3,846\n \n$\n2,230\n \n$\n903\n \n$\n4,887\n \n$\n16,260\n \n$\n12,691\n \n$\n49\n \n$\n29,000\n \nCriticized performing\n71\n \n89\n \n1,072\n \n35\n \n110\n \n922\n \n2,299\n \n93\n \n2\n \n2,394\n \nCriticized nonperforming\n23\n \n0\n \n46\n \n103\n \n86\n \n249\n \n507\n \n2\n \n0\n \n509\n \nTotal commercial and multifamily real estate\n1,914\n \n2,663\n \n4,964\n \n2,368\n \n1,099\n \n6,058\n \n19,066\n \n12,786\n \n51\n \n31,903\n \nCommercial and industrial\nNoncriticized\n5,694\n \n6,092\n \n9,952\n \n5,009\n \n2,730\n \n6,239\n \n35,716\n \n15,449\n \n266\n \n51,431\n \nCriticized performing\n101\n \n190\n \n680\n \n932\n \n92\n \n258\n \n2,253\n \n887\n \n0\n \n3,140\n \nCriticized nonperforming\n41\n \n13\n \n186\n \n43\n \n184\n \n91\n \n558\n \n143\n \n0\n \n701\n \nTotal commercial and industrial\n5,836\n \n6,295\n \n10,818\n \n5,984\n \n3,006\n \n6,588\n \n38,527\n \n16,479\n \n266\n \n55,272\n \nTotal commercial banking\n$\n7,750\n \n$\n8,958\n \n$\n15,782\n \n$\n8,352\n \n$\n4,105\n \n$\n12,646\n \n$\n57,593\n \n$\n29,265\n \n$\n317\n \n$\n87,175\n \n166\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDecember 31, 2023\nTerm Loans by Vintage Year\n(Dollars in millions)\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\n2019\nPrior\nTotal Term Loans\nRevolving Loans\nRevolving Loans Converted to Term\nTotal\nInternal risk rating:\n(1)\nCommercial and multifamily real estate\nNoncriticized\n$\n3,068\n \n$\n4,665\n \n$\n2,773\n \n$\n1,019\n \n$\n2,104\n \n$\n3,670\n \n$\n17,299\n \n$\n12,565\n \n$\n25\n \n$\n29,889\n \nCriticized performing\n148\n \n1,494\n \n706\n \n284\n \n463\n \n904\n \n3,999\n \n133\n \n0\n \n4,132\n \nCriticized nonperforming\n65\n \n26\n \n124\n \n0\n \n47\n \n163\n \n425\n \n0\n \n0\n \n425\n \nTotal commercial and multifamily real estate\n3,281\n \n6,185\n \n3,603\n \n1,303\n \n2,614\n \n4,737\n \n21,723\n \n12,698\n \n25\n \n34,446\n \nCommercial and industrial\nNoncriticized\n6,909\n \n11,935\n \n6,994\n \n3,566\n \n2,359\n \n5,117\n \n36,880\n \n14,822\n \n167\n \n51,869\n \nCriticized performing\n353\n \n706\n \n655\n \n237\n \n348\n \n349\n \n2,648\n \n1,189\n \n0\n \n3,837\n \nCriticized nonperforming\n13\n \n53\n \n30\n \n18\n \n123\n \n68\n \n305\n \n31\n \n0\n \n336\n \nTotal commercial and industrial\n7,275\n \n12,694\n \n7,679\n \n3,821\n \n2,830\n \n5,534\n \n39,833\n \n16,042\n \n167\n \n56,042\n \nTotal commercial banking\n$\n10,556\n \n$\n18,879\n \n$\n11,282\n \n$\n5,124\n \n$\n5,444\n \n$\n10,271\n \n$\n61,556\n \n$\n28,740\n \n$\n192\n \n$\n90,488\n \n__________\n(1)\nCriticized exposures correspond to the “Special Mention,” “Substandard” and “Doubtful” asset categories defined by bank regulatory authorities.\nFinancial Difficulty Modifications to Borrowers\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (one to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectibility of the loan and to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral. \nWe consider the impact of all loan modifications when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels.

We originated for sale $\n3.3\n billion, $\n4.4\n billion and $\n8.6\n billion of commercial multifamily real estate loans in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and typically retain servicing rights upon the sale of these loans.\nRevolving Loans Converted to Term Loans\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we converted $\n847\n million and $\n617\n million of revolving loans to term loans, respectively, primarily in our domestic credit card and commercial banking loan portfolios.\n173\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 5—ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES AND RESERVE FOR UNFUNDED LENDING COMMITMENTS\nOur allowance for credit losses represents management’s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. Significant judgment is applied in our estimation of lifetime credit losses. When developing an estimate of expected credit losses, we use both quantitative and qualitative methods in considering all available information relevant to assessing collectibility. This may include internal information, external information, or a combination of both relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Our estimate of expected credit losses includes a reasonable and supportable forecast period of one year and then reverts over a one-year period to historical losses at each relevant loss component of the estimate. Management will consider and may qualitatively adjust for conditions, changes and trends in loan portfolios that may not be captured in modeled results. These adjustments are referred to as qualitative factors and represent management’s judgment of the imprecision and risks inherent in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the allowance for credit losses.\nFor credit card loans, finance charges and fees are charged off simultaneously with the charge-off of other components of amortized cost as a reduction of revenue. Total net revenue was reduced by $\n2.6\n billion, $\n1.9\n billion and $\n946\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for finance charges and fees charged-off as uncollectible.\nWe have unfunded lending commitments in our Commercial Banking business that are not unconditionally cancellable by us and for which we estimate expected credit losses in establishing a reserve. This reserve is measured using the same measurement objectives as the allowance for loans held for investment. We build or release the reserve for unfunded lending commitments through the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income. The related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. \nSee “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for further discussion of the methodology and policies for determining our allowance for credit losses for each of our loan portfolio segments, as well as information on our reserve for unfunded lending commitments.\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Activity\nThe table below summarizes changes in the allowance for credit losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments by portfolio segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nTable 5.1: Allowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments Activity\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n(Dollars in millions)\nCredit Card\nConsumer Banking\nCommercial Banking\nTotal\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBalance as of December 31, 2021\n$\n8,345\n \n$\n1,918\n \n$\n1,167\n \n$\n11,430\n \nCharge-offs\n(\n4,362\n)\n(\n1,614\n)\n(\n88\n)\n(\n6,064\n)\n     Recoveries\n(1)\n1,314\n \n760\n \n17\n \n2,091\n \nNet charge-offs\n(\n3,048\n)\n(\n854\n)\n(\n71\n)\n(\n3,973\n)\nProvision for credit losses\n4,265\n \n1,173\n \n362\n \n5,800\n \nAllowance build for credit losses\n1,217\n \n319\n \n291\n \n1,827\n \nOther changes\n(2)\n(\n17\n)\n0\n \n0\n \n(\n17\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n9,545\n \n2,237\n \n1,458\n \n13,240\n \nReserve for unfunded lending commitments:\nBalance as of December 31, 2021\n0\n \n0\n \n165\n \n165\n \nProvision for losses on unfunded lending commitments\n0\n \n0\n \n53\n \n53\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n0\n \n0\n \n218\n \n218\n \nCombined allowance and reserve as of December 31, 2022\n$\n9,545\n \n$\n2,237\n \n$\n1,676\n \n$\n13,458\n \n174\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n(Dollars in millions)\nCredit Card\nConsumer Banking\nCommercial Banking\nTotal\nAllowance for credit losses:\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n9,545\n \n$\n2,237\n \n$\n1,458\n \n$\n13,240\n \nCumulative effects of accounting standards adoption\n(3)\n(\n63\n)\n0\n \n0\n \n(\n63\n)\nBalance as of January 1, 2023\n9,482\n \n2,237\n \n1,458\n \n13,177\n \nCharge-offs\n(\n7,787\n)\n(\n2,327\n)\n(\n588\n)\n(\n10,702\n)\nRecoveries\n(1)\n1,315\n \n963\n \n10\n \n2,288\n \nNet charge-offs\n(\n6,472\n)\n(\n1,364\n)\n(\n578\n)\n(\n8,414\n)\nProvision for credit losses\n8,651\n \n1,169\n \n665\n \n10,485\n \nAllowance build for credit losses\n2,179\n \n(\n195\n)\n87\n \n2,071\n \nOther changes\n(2)\n48\n \n0\n \n0\n \n48\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n11,709\n \n2,042\n \n1,545\n \n15,296\n \nReserve for unfunded lending commitments:\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n0\n \n0\n \n218\n \n218\n \nProvision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments\n0\n \n0\n \n(\n60\n)\n(\n60\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n0\n \n0\n \n158\n \n158\n \nCombined allowance and reserve as of December 31, 2023\n$\n11,709\n \n$\n2,042\n \n$\n1,703\n \n$\n15,454\n \nAllowance for credit losses:\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n11,709\n \n$\n2,042\n \n$\n1,545\n \n$\n15,296\n \nCharge-offs\n(\n10,757\n)\n(\n2,758\n)\n(\n234\n)\n(\n13,749\n)\nRecoveries\n(1)\n1,770\n \n1,165\n \n66\n \n3,001\n \nNet charge-offs\n(\n8,987\n)\n(\n1,593\n)\n(\n168\n)\n(\n10,748\n)\nProvision for credit losses\n10,272\n \n1,435\n \n23\n \n11,730\n \nAllowance build (release) for credit losses\n(4)\n1,285\n \n(\n158\n)\n(\n145\n)\n982\n \nOther changes\n(2)\n(\n20\n)\n0\n \n0\n \n(\n20\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n12,974\n \n1,884\n \n1,400\n \n16,258\n \nReserve for unfunded lending commitments:\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n0\n \n0\n \n158\n \n158\n \nProvision (benefit) for losses on unfunded lending commitments\n0\n \n0\n \n(\n15\n)\n(\n15\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n0\n \n0\n \n143\n \n143\n \nCombined allowance and reserve as of December 31, 2024\n$\n12,974\n \n$\n1,884\n \n$\n1,543\n \n$\n16,401\n \n________\n(1)\nThe amount and timing of recoveries are impacted by our collection strategies, which are based on customer behavior and risk profile and include direct customer communications, repossession of collateral, the periodic sale of charged off loans as well as additional strategies, such as litigation.\n(2)\nPrimarily represents foreign currency translation adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2024.

The expected reimbursements from these partners are netted against our allowance for credit losses. Our methodology for estimating reimbursements is consistent with the methodology we use to estimate the allowance for credit losses on our credit card loan receivables.

Our primary involvement with VIEs is related to our securitization transactions in which we transfer assets to securitization trusts. We primarily securitize credit card and auto loans, which provide a source of funding for us and enable us to transfer a certain portion of the economic risk of the loans or related debt securities to third parties.\nThe entity that has a controlling financial interest in a VIE is referred to as the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE. \nSummary of Consolidated and Unconsolidated VIEs\nThe assets of our consolidated VIEs primarily consist of cash, loan receivables and the related allowance for credit losses, which we report on our consolidated balance sheets under restricted cash for securitization investors, loans held in consolidated trusts and allowance for credit losses, respectively. The assets of a particular VIE are the primary source of funds to settle its obligations. Creditors of these VIEs typically do not have recourse to our general credit. Liabilities primarily consist of debt securities issued by the VIEs, which we report under securitized debt obligations on our consolidated balance sheets. For unconsolidated VIEs, we present the carrying amount of assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets and our maximum exposure to loss. Our maximum exposure to loss is estimated based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and we are required to meet the maximum amount of any remaining funding obligations.\nThe tables below present a summary of VIEs in which we had continuing involvement or held a significant variable interest, aggregated based on VIEs with similar characteristics as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

In these instances, we disclose the carrying amount of assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as unconsolidated VIEs to avoid duplicating our exposure, as the unconsolidated VIEs are generally the operating entities generating the exposure. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities included in the unconsolidated VIE columns above related to these investment structures were $\n2.7\n billion of assets and $\n1.0\n billion of liabilities as of December 31, 2024, and $\n2.6\n billion of assets and $\n989\n million of liabilities as of December 31, 2023.\n(4)\nPrimarily consists of variable interests in companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments.\nSecuritization-Related VIEs\nIn a securitization transaction, assets are transferred to a trust, which generally meets the definition of a VIE. We engage in securitization activities as an issuer and an investor. Our primary securitization issuance activity includes credit card and auto securitizations, conducted through securitization trusts which we consolidate. Our continuing involvement in these securitization transactions mainly consists of acting as the primary servicer and holding certain retained interests.\nIn our multifamily agency business, we originate multifamily commercial real estate loans and transfer them to GSEs who may, in turn, securitize them. We retain the related MSRs and service the transferred loans pursuant to the guidelines set forth by the GSEs. As an investor, we hold primarily RMBS, CMBS, and ABS in our investment securities portfolio, which represent variable interests in the respective securitization trusts from which those securities were issued. We do not consolidate the securitization trusts employed in these transactions as we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these securitization trusts. We exclude these VIEs from the tables within this note because we do not consider our continuing involvement with these VIEs to be significant as we either solely invest in securities issued by the VIE and were not involved in the design of the VIE or no transfers have occurred between the VIE and ourselves. Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with these VIEs is the carrying value of the MSRs and investment securities on our consolidated balance sheets as well as our contractual obligations under loss sharing arrangements. See “Note 19—Commitments, Contingencies, Guarantees and Others” for information about the loss sharing agreements, “Note 7—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets” for information related to our MSRs associated with these securitizations and “Note 3—Investment Securities” for more information on the securities held in our investment securities portfolio. In addition, where we have certain lending arrangements in the normal course of business with entities that could be VIEs, we have excluded these VIEs from the tables presented in this note. See “Note 4—Loans” for additional information regarding our lending arrangements in the normal course of business.\n179\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe table below presents our continuing involvement in certain securitization-related VIEs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTable 6.2: Continuing Involvement in Securitization-Related VIEs\n(Dollars in millions)\nCredit Card\nAuto\nDecember 31, 2024:\nSecurities held by third-party investors\n$\n11,066\n \n$\n3,198\n \nReceivables in the trusts\n25,639\n \n3,895\n \nCash balance of spread or reserve accounts\n0\n \n22\n \nRetained interests\nYes\nYes\nServicing retained\nYes\nYes\nDecember 31, 2023:\nSecurities held by third-party investors\n$\n14,029\n \n$\n4,014\n \nReceivables in the trusts\n26,404\n \n4,839\n \nCash balance of spread or reserve accounts\n0\n \n19\n \nRetained interests\nYes\nYes\nServicing retained\nYes\nYes\nCredit Card Securitizations\nWe securitize a portion of our credit card loans which provides a source of funding for us. Credit card securitizations involve the transfer of credit card receivables to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred receivables to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests in our credit card securitizations and continue to service the receivables in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts. \nAuto Securitizations\nSimilar to our credit card securitizations, we securitize a portion of our auto loans which provides a source of funding for us. Auto securitizations involve the transfer of auto loans to securitization trusts. These trusts then issue debt securities collateralized by the transferred loans to third-party investors. We hold certain retained interests and continue to service the loans in these trusts. We consolidate these trusts because we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary as we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the trusts, and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the trusts.\nOther VIEs\nAffordable Housing Entities\nAs part of our community reinvestment initiatives, we invest in private investment funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties, a majority of which are VIEs. We receive affordable housing tax credits for these investments. The activities of these entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. We account for our investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method, where costs of the investment are amortized over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a \ncomponent of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations\n. For the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized amortization of $\n701\n million and $\n682\n million, respectively, and tax credits of $\n718\n million and $\n721\n million, respectively, associated with these investments within income tax provision. The carrying value of our equity investments in these qualified affordable housing projects was $\n5.3\n billion and $\n5.5\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We are periodically required to provide additional financial or other support during the period of the investments.

We record our interests in these unconsolidated VIEs in loans held for investment, other assets and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our maximum exposure to these entities is limited to our variable interests in the entities which consisted of assets of approximately $\n5.5\n billion and $\n5.7\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit and we do not provide additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it.

Variable interests in the CDEs held by the consolidated Investor Entities are also our variable interests. The activities of the Investor Entities are financed with a combination of invested equity capital and debt. The activities of the CDEs are financed solely with invested equity capital. We receive federal and state tax credits for these investments. We consolidate the VIEs in which we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and where we have the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We consolidate other investments and CDEs that are not considered to be VIEs, but where we hold a controlling financial interest. The assets of the VIEs that we consolidated, which totaled approximately $\n2.6\n billion and $\n2.5\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets in cash, loans held for investment, and other assets. The liabilities are reflected in other liabilities. The creditors of the VIEs have no recourse to our general credit. We have not provided additional financial or other support other than during the period that we are contractually required to provide it.\nOther\nWe hold variable interests in other VIEs, including companies that promote renewable energy sources and other equity method investments. We are not required to consolidate these VIEs because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance.

An impairment of a reporting unit’s goodwill is determined based on the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe fair value of reporting units is calculated using a discounted cash flow methodology, a form of the income approach. The calculation uses projected cash flows based on each reporting unit’s internal forecast and uses the perpetuity growth method to calculate terminal values. These cash flows and terminal values are then discounted using appropriate discount rates, which are largely based on our external cost of equity with adjustments for the risk inherent in each reporting unit. The carrying amount for a reporting unit is the sum of its respective capital requirements, goodwill and other intangibles balances. Capital is allocated based on each reporting unit’s specific regulatory capital requirements and underlying risks. Consolidated stockholder’s equity in excess of the sum of all reporting unit’s capital requirements that is not identified for future capital needs, such as dividends, share buybacks, or other strategic initiatives, is allocated to the reporting units and the Other category and assumed distributed to equity holders in future periods. Our discounted cash flow analysis requires management to make judgments about future loan and deposit growth, revenue growth, credit losses, and capital rates. The reasonableness of our fair value calculation is assessed by reference to a market-based approach using comparable market multiples and recent market transactions where available.\n183\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIntangible Assets\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we recorded intangible assets that include PCCR, sponsorship, customer and merchant relationships, partnership, trade names, and other customer contract intangibles.

The majority of our leases are operating leases of office space, retail bank branches and cafés. Our operating leases expire at various dates through 2071, although some have extension or termination options, and we assess the likelihood of exercising such options. If it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the options, then we include the impact in the measurement of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\nOur right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating leases are included in \nother assets\n and \nother liabilities\n on our consolidated balance sheets. As most of our operating leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of future lease payments. Our operating lease expense is included in occupancy and equipment within non-interest expense in our consolidated statements of income. Total operating lease expense consists of operating lease cost, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and variable lease cost, which is recognized based on actual amounts incurred.

Our primary market risks stem from the impact on our earnings and economic value of equity due to changes in interest rates and, to a lesser extent, changes in foreign exchange rates. We manage our interest rate sensitivity by employing several techniques, which include changing the duration and re-pricing characteristics of various assets and liabilities by using interest rate derivatives. We also use foreign currency derivatives to limit our earnings and capital exposures to foreign exchange risk by hedging certain exposures denominated in foreign currencies. We primarily use interest rate and foreign currency swaps to perform these hedging activities, but we may also use a variety of other derivative instruments, including caps, floors, options, futures and forward contracts, to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks. We designate these risk management derivatives as either qualifying accounting hedges or free-standing derivatives. Qualifying accounting hedges are further designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges. Free-standing derivatives are economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting. \nWe offer interest rate, commodity, foreign currency derivatives and other contracts as an accommodation to our customers within our Commercial Banking business. We enter into these derivatives with our customers primarily to help them manage their interest rate risks, hedge their energy and other commodities exposures, and manage foreign currency fluctuations. We offset the substantial majority of the market risk exposure of our customer accommodation derivatives through derivative transactions with other counterparties.\nSee below for additional information on our use of derivatives and how we account for them:\n•\nFair Value Hedges:\n We designate derivatives as fair value hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value as a result of movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. We enter into receive-fixed, pay-float interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of outstanding fixed rate debt and deposits due to fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into pay-fixed, receive-float interest rate swaps to hedge changes in the fair value of fixed rate investment securities.\n•\nCash Flow Hedges:\n We designate derivatives as cash flow hedges when they are used to manage our exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded as a component of AOCI. Those amounts are reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged forecasted transactions impact earnings and presented in the same line item in our consolidated statements of income as the earnings effect of the hedged items. We enter into receive-fixed, pay-float interest rate swaps and interest rate floors to modify the interest rate characteristics of designated credit card and commercial loans from floating to fixed in order to reduce the impact of changes in forecasted future cash flows due to fluctuations in market interest rates. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to variability in cash flows related to intercompany borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.\n•\nNet Investment Hedges: \nWe use net investment hedges to manage the foreign currency exposure related to our net investments in foreign operations that have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in the translation adjustment component of AOCI, offsetting the translation gain or loss from those foreign operations. We execute net investment hedges using foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the translation exposure of the net investment in our foreign operations under the forward method.\n•\nFree-Standing Derivatives:\n Our free-standing derivatives primarily consist of our customer accommodation derivatives and other economic hedges. The customer accommodation derivatives and the related offsetting contracts are mainly interest rate, commodity and foreign currency contracts. The other free-standing derivatives are primarily used to economically hedge the risk of changes in the fair value of our commercial mortgage loan origination and purchase commitments as well as other interests held. Changes in the fair value of free-standing derivatives are recorded in earnings as a component of other non-interest income.\n189\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDerivatives Counterparty Credit Risk\nCounterparty Types\nDerivative instruments contain an element of credit risk that stems from the potential failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of the contract, including making payments due upon maturity of certain derivative instruments. We execute our derivative contracts primarily in OTC markets. We also execute interest rate and commodity futures in the exchange-traded derivative markets. Our OTC derivatives consist of both trades cleared through central counterparty clearinghouses (“CCPs”) and uncleared bilateral contracts. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange (“CME”), the Intercontinental Exchange (“ICE”) and the LCH Group (“LCH”) are our CCPs for our centrally cleared contracts. In our uncleared bilateral contracts, we enter into agreements directly with our derivative counterparties. \nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe manage the counterparty credit risk associated with derivative instruments by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements, where applicable, and exchanging collateral with our counterparties, typically in the form of cash or high-quality liquid securities. We exchange collateral in two primary forms: variation margin, which accounts for changes in market value due to daily market movements, and initial margin, which offsets the potential future exposure of a derivative.\n We exchange variation margin and initial margin on bilateral derivatives in scope for uncleared margin rules. \nThe amount of collateral exchanged for variation margin is dependent upon the fair value of the derivative instruments as well as the fair value of the pledged collateral and will vary over time as market variables change. The amount of the initial margin exchanged is dependent upon 1) the calculation of initial margin exposure, as prescribed by 1(a) the U.S. prudential regulators’ margin rules for uncleared derivatives (“PR Rules”) or 1(b) the CCPs for cleared derivatives and 2) the fair value of the pledged collateral; it will vary over time as market variables change. When valuing collateral, an estimate of the variation in price and liquidity over time is subtracted in the form of a “haircut” to discount the value of the collateral pledged. Our exposure to derivative counterparty credit risk, at any point in time, is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset on our balance sheet. The fair value of our derivatives is adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated collateral received or pledged. See Table 10.3 for our net exposure associated with derivatives.\nThe terms under which we collateralize our exposures differ between cleared exposures and uncleared bilateral exposures.\n•\nCCPs\n: We clear eligible OTC derivatives with CCPs as part of our regulatory requirements. We also clear exchange-traded instruments, like futures, with CCPs. Futures commission merchants (“FCMs”) serve as the intermediary between CCPs and us. CCPs require that we post initial and variation margin through our FCMs to mitigate the risk of non-payment or default. Initial margin is required by CCPs as collateral against potential losses on our exchange-traded and cleared derivative contracts and variation margin is exchanged on a daily basis to account for mark-to-market changes in those derivative contracts. For CME, ICE and LCH-cleared OTC derivatives, variation margin cash payments are required to be characterized as settlements. Our FCM agreements governing these derivative transactions include provisions that may require us to post additional collateral under certain circumstances. \n•\nBilateral Counterparties\n: We enter into master netting agreements and collateral agreements with bilateral derivative counterparties, where applicable, to mitigate the risk of default. These bilateral agreements typically provide the right to offset exposure with the same counterparty and require the party in a net liability position to post collateral. Agreements with certain bilateral counterparties require both parties to maintain collateral in the event the fair values of uncleared derivatives exceed established exposure thresholds. Certain of these bilateral agreements include provisions requiring that our debt maintain a credit rating of investment grade or above by each of the major credit rating agencies. In the event of a downgrade of our debt credit rating below investment grade, some of our counterparties would have the right to terminate their derivative contract and close out existing positions. \n190\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCredit Risk Valuation Adjustments\nWe record counterparty credit valuation adjustments (“CVAs”) on our derivative assets to reflect the credit quality of our counterparties. We consider collateral and legally enforceable master netting agreements that mitigate our credit exposure to each counterparty in determining CVAs, which may be adjusted due to changes in the fair values of the derivative contracts, collateral, and creditworthiness of the counterparty. We also record debit valuation adjustments (“DVAs”) to adjust the fair values of our derivative liabilities to reflect the impact of our own credit quality. \nBalance Sheet Presentation\nThe following table summarizes the notional amounts and fair values of our derivative instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, which are segregated by derivatives that are designated as accounting hedges and those that are not, and are further segregated by type of contract within those two categories. The total derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and any associated cash collateral received or pledged. Derivative assets and liabilities are included in other assets and other liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, and their related gains or losses are included in operating activities as changes in other assets and other liabilities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. \nTable 10.1: Derivative Assets and Liabilities at Fair Value\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nNotional or Contractual Amount\nDerivative\n(1)\nNotional or Contractual Amount\nDerivative\n(1)\n(Dollars in millions)\nAssets\nLiabilities\nAssets\nLiabilities\nDerivatives designated as accounting hedges:\nInterest rate contracts:\nFair value hedges\n$\n61,250\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n68,987\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n26\n \nCash flow hedges\n102,550\n \n123\n \n24\n \n70,350\n \n216\n \n23\n \nTotal interest rate contracts\n163,800\n \n126\n \n37\n \n139,337\n \n234\n \n49\n \nForeign exchange contracts:\nFair value hedges\n518\n \n0\n \n101\n \n1,380\n \n0\n \n113\n \nCash flow hedges\n2,549\n \n74\n \n0\n \n2,488\n \n0\n \n66\n \nNet investment hedges\n4,858\n \n190\n \n0\n \n4,870\n \n1\n \n89\n \nTotal foreign exchange contracts\n7,925\n \n264\n \n101\n \n8,738\n \n1\n \n268\n \nTotal derivatives designated as accounting hedges\n171,725\n \n390\n \n138\n \n148,075\n \n235\n \n317\n \nDerivatives not designated as accounting hedges:\nCustomer accommodation:\nInterest rate contracts\n108,754\n \n865\n \n1,014\n \n103,489\n \n1,188\n \n1,382\n \nCommodity contracts\n34,185\n \n858\n \n814\n \n33,495\n \n1,161\n \n1,147\n \nForeign exchange and other contracts\n6,951\n \n80\n \n52\n \n5,153\n \n50\n \n47\n \nTotal customer accommodation\n149,890\n \n1,803\n \n1,880\n \n142,137\n \n2,399\n \n2,576\n \nOther interest rate exposures\n(2)\n909\n \n14\n \n9\n \n872\n \n21\n \n31\n \nOther contracts\n3,254\n \n25\n \n5\n \n2,955\n \n20\n \n8\n \nTotal derivatives not designated as accounting hedges\n154,053\n \n1,842\n \n1,894\n \n145,964\n \n2,440\n \n2,615\n \nTotal derivatives\n$\n325,778\n \n$\n2,232\n \n$\n2,032\n \n$\n294,039\n \n$\n2,675\n \n$\n2,932\n \nLess: netting adjustment\n(3)\n(\n1,056\n)\n(\n304\n)\n(\n1,005\n)\n(\n597\n)\nTotal derivative assets/liabilities\n$\n1,176\n \n$\n1,728\n \n$\n1,670\n \n$\n2,335\n \n__________\n(1)\nDoes not reflect $\n1\n million and $\n2\n million\n recognized as a net valuation allowance on derivative assets and liabilities for non-performance risk as of December 31, 2024 and \n2023\n, respectively.

Either counterparty can generally request to net settle all contracts through a single payment upon default on, or termination of, any one contract. We elect to offset the derivative assets and liabilities under master netting agreements for balance sheet presentation where a right of setoff exists. For derivative contracts entered into under master netting agreements for which we have not been able to confirm the enforceability of the setoff rights, or those not subject to master netting agreements, we do not offset our derivative positions for balance sheet presentation.\nThe following table presents the gross and net fair values of our derivative assets, derivative liabilities, resale and repurchase agreements and the related offsetting amounts permitted under U.S. GAAP as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The table also includes cash and non-cash collateral received or pledged in accordance with such arrangements. The amount of collateral presented, however, is limited to the amount of the related net derivative fair values or outstanding balances; therefore, instances of over-collateralization are excluded.\n192\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTable 10.3: Offsetting of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nGross Amounts\nGross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet\nNet Amounts as Recognized\nSecurities Collateral Held Under Master Netting Agreements\nNet Exposure\n(Dollars in millions)\nFinancial Instruments\nCash Collateral Received\nAs of December 31, 2024\nDerivative assets\n(1)\n$\n2,232\n \n$\n(\n202\n)\n$\n(\n854\n)\n$\n1,176\n \n$\n(\n22\n)\n$\n1,154\n \nAs of December 31, 2023\nDerivative assets\n(1)\n2,675\n \n(\n433\n)\n(\n572\n)\n1,670\n \n(\n22\n)\n1,648\n \nGross Amounts\nGross Amounts Offset in the Balance Sheet\nNet Amounts as Recognized\nSecurities Collateral Pledged Under Master Netting Agreements\nNet Exposure\n(Dollars in millions)\nFinancial Instruments\nCash Collateral Pledged\nAs of December 31, 2024\nDerivative liabilities\n(1)\n$\n2,032\n \n$\n(\n202\n)\n$\n(\n102\n)\n$\n1,728\n \n$\n(\n53\n)\n$\n1,675\n \nRepurchase agreements\n(2)\n562\n \n0\n \n0\n \n562\n \n(\n562\n)\n0\n \nAs of December 31, 2023\nDerivative liabilities\n(1)\n2,932\n \n(\n433\n)\n(\n164\n)\n2,335\n \n(\n13\n)\n2,322\n \nRepurchase agreements\n(2)\n538\n \n0\n \n0\n \n538\n \n(\n538\n)\n0\n \n__________\n(1)\nWe received cash collateral from derivative counterparties totaling $\n1.1\n billion and $\n858\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

    "item1c": "Item 1C. Cybersecurity” of this Report.\nReputation Risk Management\nWe recognize that reputation risk is of particular concern for financial institutions and, increasingly, technology companies, in the current environment. Areas of concern have expanded to include company policies, practices and values and, with the growing use of social and digital platforms, public corporations face a new level of scrutiny and channels for activism and advocacy. The heightened expectations of internal and external stakeholders have made corporate culture, values and conduct pressure points for individuals and advocates voicing concerns or seeking change. We manage both strategic and tactical reputation issues and build our relationships with government officials, media, community and consumer advocates, customers and other constituencies to help strengthen the reputations of both our Company and industry. Our actions include implementing pro-customer practices in our business and serving low to moderate income communities in our market area consistent with a quality bank and an innovative technology leader. The Executive Vice President of External Affairs is responsible for managing our overall reputation risk program. Day-to-day activities are controlled by the frameworks set forth in our Reputation Risk Management Policy and other risk management policies.\nStrategic Risk Management\nWe recognize that strategic risk is present within our business and the Company’s strategy. We monitor risks for the impact on current or future earnings, capital growth or enterprise value arising from changes to the Company’s competitive and market positions, including as a result of evolving forces in the industry. Additionally, we monitor timely and effective responsiveness to these conditions, strategic decisions that impact the Company’s scale, market position or operating model and failure to appropriately consider implementation risks in the Company’s strategy. Potential areas of opportunity or risk inform the Company’s strategy, which is led by the Chief Executive Officer and other senior executives. The Chief Enterprise Risk Officer, in consultation with the Chief Credit and Financial Risk Officer, oversees the identification and assessment of  risks associated with the Company’s strategy and the monitoring of these risks throughout the year.\n93\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nOur Strategic Risk Management Policy, processes and controls encompass an ongoing assessment of risks associated with corporate or line of business specific strategies. These risks are managed through periodic reviews, along with regular updates to senior management and the Board.\nCREDIT RISK PROFILE\nOur loan portfolio accounts for the substantial majority of our credit risk exposure. Our lending activities are governed under our credit policies and are subject to independent review and approval. Below we provide information about the composition of our loan portfolio, key concentrations and credit performance metrics.\nWe also engage in certain non-lending activities that may give rise to ongoing credit and counterparty settlement risk, including purchasing securities for our investment securities portfolio, entering into derivative transactions to manage our market risk exposure and to accommodate customers, extending short-term advances on syndication activity including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten, depositing certain operational cash balances in other financial institutions, executing certain foreign exchange transactions and extending customer overdrafts. We provide additional information related to our investment securities portfolio under “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Investment Securities” and “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 3—Investment Securities” as well as credit risk related to derivative transactions in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 10—Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.”\nPrimary Loan Products \nWe provide a variety of lending products. Our primary loan products include credit cards, auto loans and commercial lending products.  \n•\nCredit cards:\n We originate both prime and subprime credit cards through a variety of channels. Our credit cards generally have variable interest rates. Credit card accounts are primarily underwritten using an automated underwriting system based on predictive models that we have developed. The underwriting criteria, which are customized for individual products and marketing programs, are established based on an analysis of the net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, subject to further analysis using a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on credit bureau information, including payment history, debt burden and credit scores, such as Fair Isaac Corporation (“FICO”) scores, and on other factors, such as applicant income. We maintain a credit card securitization program and selectively sell charged-off credit card loans.\n•\nAuto:\n We originate both prime and subprime auto loans through a network of auto dealers and direct marketing. Our auto loans have fixed interest rates and loan terms of 84 months or less. Loan size limits are customized by program and are generally less than $75,000. Similar to credit card accounts, the underwriting criteria are customized for individual products and marketing programs and based on analysis of net present value of expected revenues, expenses and losses, and are subject to maintaining resilience under a variety of stress conditions. Underwriting decisions are generally based on an applicant’s income, estimated net disposable income, and credit bureau information including FICO scores, along with collateral characteristics such as loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratio. We maintain an auto securitization program.\n•\nCommercial:\n We offer a range of commercial lending products, including loans secured by commercial real estate and loans to middle market commercial and industrial companies. Our commercial loans may have a fixed or variable interest rate; however, the majority of our commercial loans have variable rates. Our underwriting standards require an analysis of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects, as well as an assessment of the industry in which the borrower operates. Where relevant, we evaluate and appraise underlying collateral and guarantees. We maintain underwriting guidelines and limits for major types of borrowers and loan products that specify, where applicable, guidelines for debt service coverage, leverage, LTV ratio and standard covenants and conditions. We assign a risk rating and establish a monitoring schedule for loans based on the risk profile of the borrower, industry segment, source of repayment, the underlying collateral and guarantees, if any, and current market conditions. Although we generally retain the commercial loans we underwrite, we may syndicate positions for risk mitigation purposes, including bridge financing transactions we have underwritten. In addition, we originate and service multifamily commercial real estate loans which are sold to government-sponsored enterprises where we retain certain levels of residual risk after the loans are sold.\n94\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nPortfolio of Loans Held for Investment\nOur loan portfolio consists of loans held for investment, including loans held in our consolidated trusts, and loans held for sale. The information presented in this section excludes loans held for sale, which totaled $202 million\n \nand $854 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nTable 15 presents the maturities of our loans held for investment portfolio as of December 31, 2024. Determinations of maturities are based on scheduled repayments. Due to the revolving nature of credit card loans, we report the majority of our credit card loans as due in one year or less. \nTable 15: Loan Maturity Schedule\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n(Dollars in millions)\nDue Up to\n1 Year\n> 1 Year\nto 5 Years\n> 5 Years to 15 Years\n> 15 Years\nTotal\nFixed rate:\nCredit card\n$\n16,791\n \n$\n396\n \n—\n \n—\n \n$\n17,187\n \nConsumer banking\n18,129\n \n54,204\n \n$\n5,396\n \n$\n53\n \n77,782\n \nCommercial banking\n1,116\n \n4,135\n \n5,805\n \n993\n \n12,049\n \nTotal fixed-rate loans\n36,036\n \n58,735\n \n11,201\n \n1,046\n \n107,018\n \nVariable rate:\nCredit card\n145,321\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n145,321\n \nConsumer banking\n290\n \n11\n \n9\n \n—\n \n310\n \nCommercial banking\n12,459\n \n53,792\n \n8,788\n \n87\n \n75,126\n \nTotal variable-rate loans\n158,070\n \n53,803\n \n8,797\n \n87\n \n220,757\n \nTotal loans\n$\n194,106\n \n$\n112,538\n \n$\n19,998\n \n$\n1,133\n \n$\n327,775\n \n95\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nGeographic Composition\nWe market our credit card products throughout the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.

This change was made on a prospective basis in accordance with regulatory reporting changes made to the “Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income” (FFIEC 031) non-depository financial institution definition, effective December 31, 2024. \n(2)\nThe funded balance for commercial office real estate held for investment totaled $1.8 billion, or 2.1% and $2.3 billion, or 2.5%, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Commercial office real estate exposure does not include loans in our healthcare real estate business secured by medical office properties and loans to office real estate investment trusts or real estate investment funds.\n99\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCredit Risk Measurement\nWe closely monitor economic conditions and loan performance trends to assess and manage our exposure to credit risk. Trends in delinquency rates are the key credit quality indicator for our credit card and retail banking loan portfolios as changes in delinquency rates can provide an early warning of changes in potential future credit losses. The key indicator we monitor when assessing the credit quality and risk of our auto loan portfolio is borrower credit scores as they provide insight into borrower risk profiles, which give indications of potential future credit losses. The key credit quality indicator for our commercial loan portfolios is our internal risk ratings as we generally classify loans that have been delinquent for an extended period of time and other loans with significant risk of loss as nonperforming. In addition to these credit quality indicators, we also manage and monitor other credit quality metrics such as level of nonperforming loans and net charge-off rates. \nWe underwrite most consumer loans using proprietary models, which typically include credit bureau data, such as borrower credit scores, application information and, where applicable, collateral and deal structure data. We continuously adjust our management of credit lines and collection strategies based on customer behavior and risk profile changes. We also use borrower credit scores for subprime classification, for competitive benchmarking and, in some cases, to drive product segmentation decisions. \nTable 20 provides details on the credit scores of our domestic credit card and auto loan portfolios as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTable 20: Credit Score Distribution\n(Percentage of portfolio)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDomestic credit card—Refreshed FICO scores:\n(1)\nGreater than 660\n69\n \n%\n68 \n%\n660 or below\n31\n \n32 \nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100 \n%\nAuto\n—\nAt origination FICO scores:\n(2)\nGreater than 660\n54\n \n%\n53 \n%\n621 - 660\n19\n \n20 \n620 or below\n27\n \n27 \nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100 \n%\n__________\n(1)\nPercentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Domestic Card credit scores generally represent FICO scores. These scores are obtained from one of the major credit bureaus at origination and are refreshed monthly thereafter. We approximate non-FICO credit scores to comparable FICO scores for consistency purposes. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 660 or below category.\n(2)\nPercentages represent period-end loans held for investment in each credit score category. Auto credit scores generally represent average FICO scores obtained from three credit bureaus at the time of application and are not refreshed thereafter. Balances for which no credit score is available or the credit score is invalid are included in the 620 or below category.\nIn our commercial loan portfolio, we assign internal risk ratings to loans based on relevant information about the ability of the borrowers to repay their debt. In determining the risk rating of a particular loan, some of the factors considered are the borrower’s current financial condition, historical and projected future credit performance, prospects for support from financially responsible guarantors, the estimated realizable value of any collateral and current economic trends.\nWe present information in the section below on the credit performance of our loan portfolio, including the key metrics we use in tracking changes in the credit quality of our loan portfolio. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 4—Loans” for additional credit quality information and see “Item 8.

Our 30+ day delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due, whereas our 30+ day performing delinquency metrics include all loans held for investment that are 30 or more days past due but are currently classified as performing and accruing interest. The 30+ day delinquency and 30+ day performing delinquency metrics are the same for domestic credit card loans, as we continue to classify these loans as performing until the account is charged off, typically when the account is 180 days past due.

We charge off loans as a reduction to the allowance for credit losses when we determine the loan is uncollectible and record subsequent recoveries of previously charged off amounts as increases to the allowance for credit losses. Uncollectible finance charges and fees are reversed through revenue and certain fraud losses are recorded in other non-interest expense. Generally, costs to recover charged off loans are recorded as collection expenses as incurred and are included in our consolidated statements of income as a component of other non-interest expense. Our charge-off policy for loans varies based on the loan type. See “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for information on our charge-off policy for each of our loan categories.\nTable 25 presents our net charge-off amounts and rates, by portfolio segment, in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nTable 25: Net Charge-Offs (Recoveries)\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Dollars in millions)\nAmount\nRate\n(1)\nAmount\nRate\n(1)\nAmount\nRate\n(1)\nCredit Card:\nDomestic credit card\n(2)\n$\n8,634\n \n5.91\n \n%\n$\n6,164 \n4.56 \n%\n$\n2,833 \n2.47 \n%\nInternational card businesses\n353\n \n5.15\n \n308 \n4.84 \n215 \n3.65 \nTotal credit card\n8,987\n \n5.88\n \n6,472 \n4.57 \n3,048 \n2.53 \nConsumer Banking:\nAuto\n1,528\n \n2.05\n \n1,308 \n1.72 \n784 \n1.00 \nRetail banking\n65\n \n5.11\n \n56 \n3.89 \n70 \n4.24 \nTotal consumer banking\n1,593\n \n2.10\n \n1,364 \n1.76 \n854 \n1.06 \nCommercial Banking:\nCommercial and multifamily real estate\n87\n \n0.26\n \n489 \n1.34 \n— \n— \nCommercial and industrial\n81\n \n0.15\n \n89 \n0.16 \n71 \n0.13 \nTotal commercial banking\n168\n \n0.19\n \n578 \n0.62 \n71 \n0.08 \nTotal net charge-offs\n$\n10,748\n \n3.39\n \n$\n8,414 \n2.70 \n$\n3,973 \n1.36 \nAverage loans held for investment\n$\n317,421\n \n$\n311,541 \n$\n292,238 \n__________\n(1)\nNet charge-off rates are calculated by dividing net charge-offs by average loans held for investment for the period for each loan category. \n(2)\nThe Walmart Program Termination increased the Domestic Card net charge-off rate by 24 bps in 2024. \n105\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Difficulty Modifications to Borrowers\nA financial difficulty modification (“FDM”) occurs when a modification in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, an other-than-insignificant payment delay, a term extension or a combination of these modifications is granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty.\nAs part of our loss mitigation efforts, we may provide short-term (one to twelve months) or long-term (greater than twelve months) modifications to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to improve long-term collectibility of the loan and to avoid the need for repossession or foreclosure of collateral. \nWe consider the impact of all loan modifications, including FDMs, when estimating the credit quality of our loan portfolio and establishing allowance levels. For our Commercial Banking customers, loan modifications are also considered in the assignment of an internal risk rating.\nIn our Credit Card business, the majority of our FDMs receive an interest rate reduction and are placed on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months. If the customer does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan agreement may revert to its original payment terms, generally resulting in any loan outstanding being reflected in the appropriate delinquency category and charged off in accordance with our standard charge-off policy.\nIn our Consumer Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension, an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of these modifications. \nIn our Commercial Banking business, the majority of our FDMs receive an extension. A portion of FDMs receive an interest rate reduction, principal reduction, or a combination of modifications. \nFor more information on FDMs, see “Item 8. Financial Statements—Note 4—Loans.”\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Reserve for Unfunded Lending Commitments\nOur allowance for credit losses represents management’s current estimate of expected credit losses over the contractual terms of our loans held for investment as of each balance sheet date. Expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off are recognized within the allowance. We also estimate expected credit losses related to unfunded lending commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The provision for losses on unfunded lending commitments is included in the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income and the related reserve for unfunded lending commitments is included in other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We provide additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used in determining our allowance for credit losses in “Item 8.

Excluding the impact of the allowance for credit losses related to Domestic Card of $12.5 billion and $11.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, this ratio decreased by 75% to 189% as of December 31, 2024 from 264% as of December 31, 2023. The decrease in the ratio for the allowance for credit losses divided by total nonperforming loans was driven by an increase in nonperforming loans partially offset by an increase in our allowance for credit losses. \nLIQUIDITY RISK PROFILE\nWe manage our funding and liquidity risk in an integrated manner in support of the current and future cash flow needs of our business. We maintained liquidity reserves of $123.8 billion and $120.7 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as shown in Table 27 below. Included in liquidity reserves are cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and FHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had available issuance capacity of $40.2 billion under shelf registrations associated with our credit card and auto loan securitization programs. We also maintain a shelf registration that enables us to issue an indeterminate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. Our ability to issue under each shelf registration is subject to market conditions.\nFinally,\n as of December 31, 2024, we had access to available contingent liquidity sources totaling $102.6 billion\n through the prepositioning of collateral,\n including a portion of the investment securities included in the liquidity reserves amount in the following table, at the \nFederal Reserve Discount Window, the Standing Repo Facility, FHLB and the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation—Government Securities Division (“FICC—GSD”).\n \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our funding sources totaled $408.3 billion and $398.3 billion, respectively, \nprimarily composed of consumer deposits\n, as shown in “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Table 6: Funding Sources Composition.”\nOur liquidity reserves, borrowing capacity, contingent liquidity sources and total funding sources are all discussed in more detail in the following sections. \nTable 27 below presents the composition of our liquidity reserves as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTable 27: Liquidity Reserves\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n43,230\n \n$\n43,297 \nSecurities available for sale\n(1)\n83,013\n \n79,117 \nFHLB borrowing capacity secured by loans\n4,279\n \n5,205 \nOutstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans and investment securities\n(48)\n(50)\nOther encumbrances of investment securities\n(6,648)\n(6,917)\nTotal liquidity reserves\n$\n123,826\n \n$\n120,652 \n________\n(1)    \nIncludes securities that have been pledged or otherwise encumbered within the below Liquidity Reserves line items “Outstanding FHLB advances and letters of credit secured by loans and investment securities” and “Other encumbrances of investment securities\n.\n”\nOur liquidity reserves increased by $3.2 billion to $123.8 billion as of December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023, primarily \ndue to increases in securities available for sale.\n In addition to these liquidity reserves, we maintain access to a diversified mix of funding sources as discussed in the “Borrowing Capacity” and “Funding” sections below.

The LCR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to calculate its respective LCR daily. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a quarterly basis, its LCR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics, and a qualitative discussion of its LCR. Our average LCR during the fourth quarter of 2024 was 155%, which exceeded the LCR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” for additional information.\nNet Stable Funding Ratio\nWe are subject to the NSFR Rule as implemented by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The NSFR Rule requires each of the Company and the Bank to maintain an NSFR of 100% on an ongoing basis. It also requires the Company to publicly disclose, on a semi-annual basis each second and fourth quarter, its NSFR, certain related quantitative liquidity metrics and qualitative discussion of its NSFR. Our average NSFR \nfor each of the third and fourth \nquarter of 2024 was 135%, which exceeded the NSFR Rule requirement of 100%. The calculation and the underlying components are based on our interpretations, expectations and assumptions of the relevant regulations, as well as interpretations provided by our regulators, and are subject to change based on changes to future regulations and interpretations. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” for additional information.\nBorrowing Capacity\nWe maintain a shelf registration with the SEC so that we may periodically offer and sell an indeterminate aggregate amount of senior or subordinated debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares, common stock, purchase contracts, warrants and units. There is no limit under this shelf registration to the amount or number of such securities that we may offer and sell, subject to market conditions. In addition, we also maintain a shelf registration associated with our credit card securitization trust that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $30.0 billion of securitized debt obligations and a shelf registration associated with our auto loan securitization trusts that allows us to periodically offer and sell up to $25.0 billion of securitized debt obligations. The registered amounts under these shelf registration statements are subject to continuing review and change in the future, including as part of the routine renewal process. As of December 31, 2024, we had $21.6 billion and $18.6 \nbillion\n of available issuance capacity in our credit card and auto loan securitization programs, respectively. \nIn addition to our issuance capacity under the shelf registration statements, we also have collateral pledged to support our access to FHLB advances, the Federal Reserve Discount Window, \nthe Standing Repo Facility\n and FICC—GSD general collateral financing repurchase agreement service. For each of these programs, the ability to borrow utilizing these sources is dependent on meeting the respective membership requirements. Our borrowing capacity in each program is a function of the collateral the Bank has posted with each counterparty, including any respective haircuts applied to that collateral.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we pledged loans and securities to the FHLB to secure a maximum borrowing capacity of $35.1 billion, of which $48 million was used. Our FHLB membership is supported by our investment in FHLB stock of $18 million\n \nas of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAs a member of FICC—GSD, we have $20.8 billion of readily available borrowing capacity secured by securities from our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2024. Our FICC—GSD membership is supported by our investment in Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”) common stock of $412 thousand and $375 thousand as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we pledged loans to secure a borrowing capacity of $46.7 billion under the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Our membership with the Federal Reserve is supported by our investment in Federal Reserve stock, which totaled $1.3 billion as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n109\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nDeposits\nTable 28 provides a comparison of the average balance, interest expense and average deposits interest rate for \nDecember 31, 2024,\n 2023 and 2022.\nTable 28: Deposits Composition and Average Deposits Interest Rates\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Dollars in millions)\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nExpense\nAverage\nDeposits\nInterest Rate\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nExpense\nAverage\nDeposits\nInterest Rate\nAverage\nBalance\nInterest\nExpense\nAverage\nDeposit\nInterest Rate\nInterest-bearing checking accounts\n(1)\n$\n34,904\n \n$\n544\n \n1.56\n \n%\n$\n41,555 \n$\n797 \n1.92 \n%\n$\n48,291 \n$\n312 \n0.65 \n%\nSaving deposits\n(2)\n211,120\n \n7,083\n \n3.36\n \n197,896 \n5,353 \n2.71 \n202,454 \n1,628 \n0.80 \nTime deposits\n78,273\n \n3,866\n \n4.94\n \n74,286 \n3,339 \n4.49 \n26,463 \n595 \n2.25 \nTotal interest-bearing deposits\n$\n324,297\n \n$\n11,493\n \n3.54\n \n$\n313,737 \n$\n9,489 \n3.02 \n$\n277,208 \n$\n2,535 \n0.91 \n__________\n(1)\nIncludes negotiable order of withdrawal accounts.\n(2)\nIncludes money market deposit accounts.\nThe FDIC limits the acceptance of brokered deposits to well-capitalized insured depository institutions and, with a waiver from the FDIC, to adequately-capitalized institutions. The Bank was well-capitalized, as defined under the federal banking regulatory guidelines, as of both \nDecember 31, 2024\n and 2023. See “Part I—Item 1. Business—Supervision and Regulation” for additional information. We provide additional information on the composition of deposits in “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Table 6: Funding Sources Composition” and in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 9—Deposits and Borrowings.”\nFunding\nOur primary source of funding comes from insured retail deposits, as they are a relatively stable and lower cost source of funding. In addition to deposits, we raise funding through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes and securitized debt obligations, federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase and FHLB advances secured by certain portions of our loan and securities portfolios. A key objective in our use of these markets is to maintain access to a diversified mix of wholesale funding sources. See “Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis—Table 6: Funding Sources Composition” for additional information on our primary sources of funding.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments that affect our short-term and long-term liquidity and capital resource needs. Our future cash outflows primarily relate to deposits, borrowings and operating leases. The actual timing and amounts of future cash payments may vary over time due to a number of factors, such as early debt redemptions and changes in deposit balances.\n110\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we held $64.9 billion and $64.2 billion, respectively, of estimated uninsured deposits. These amounts were primarily \ncomprised of checking and savings deposits.\n These estimated uninsured deposits comprised approximately 18% of our total deposits as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nWe estimate our uninsured amounts based on methodologies and assumptions used for our “Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income” (FFIEC 031) filed with the Federal Banking Agencies, adjusted to exclude intercompany balances and cash collateral received on certain derivative contracts which are not presented within deposits on our consolidated balance sheet.\nTable 29 presents, by contractual maturity, the estimated uninsured portion of total time deposits as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Our funding and liquidity management activities factor in the expected maturities of these deposits. \nTable 29: Amount of Uninsured Time Deposits by Contractual Maturity\n1\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(Dollars in millions)\nAmount\n% of Total\nAmount\n% of Total\nUp to three months\n$\n4,619\n \n45.6\n \n%\n$\n4,784 \n53.2 \n%\n> 3 months to 6 months\n1,675\n \n16.6\n \n537 \n6.0 \n> 6 months to 12 months\n2,596\n \n25.6\n \n2,095 \n23.3 \n> 12 months\n1,230\n \n12.2\n \n1,577 \n17.5 \nTotal\n$\n10,120\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n8,993 \n100.0 \n%\n__________\n(1)\nSome customers have time deposits in excess of the federal deposit insurance limit, making a portion of the deposit uninsured. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total time deposit amount with some portion in excess of the insured amount\n \nwas $15.2 billion and $15.8 billion, respectively.\nShort-Term Borrowings and Long-Term Debt\nWe access the capital markets to meet our funding needs through the issuance of senior and subordinated notes, securitized debt obligations and federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase. In addition, we have access to short-term and long-term FHLB advances secured by certain investment securities, multifamily real estate loans and commercial real estate loans. \nOur short-term borrowings, which include those borrowings with an original contractual maturity of one year or less, typically consist of federal funds purchased, securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase or short-term FHLB advances, and do not include the current portion of long-term debt. Our short-term borrowings\n increased by $24 million to $562 million\n as of December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023 driven by \nan increase in repurchase agreements.\nOur long-term funding, which primarily consists of securitized debt obligations and senior and subordinated notes,\n decreased by $4.3 billion to $45.0 billion \nas of December 31, 2024 from December 31, 2023\n primarily driven by net maturities of securitized debt obligations. \nWe provide more information on our securitization activity in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6—Variable Interest Entities and Securitizations” and on our borrowings in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 9—Deposits and Borrowings.”\nThe following table summarizes issuances of securitized debt obligations, senior and subordinated notes, \nlong term FHLB advances\n and their respective maturities or redemptions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nTable 30: Long-Term Debt Funding Activities\nIssuances\nMaturities/Redemptions\nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSecuritized debt obligations\n$\n1,810\n \n$\n3,300 \n$\n9,750 \n$\n5,828\n \n$\n2,483 \n$\n7,060 \nSenior and subordinated notes\n4,000\n \n8,250 \n9,300 \n4,411\n \n8,436 \n3,561 \nFHLB advances\n—\n \n— \n12,000 \n—\n \n— \n12,000 \nTotal\n$\n5,810\n \n$\n11,550 \n$\n31,050 \n$\n10,239\n \n$\n10,919 \n$\n22,621 \n111\nCapital One Financial Corporation (COF)\nTable of Contents\nCredit Ratings\nOur credit ratings impact our ability to access capital markets and our borrowing costs.
