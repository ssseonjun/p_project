  "item1_summary": " Cognizant: We compete on the basis of reputation and experience, strategic advisory capabilities, digital services capabilities, performance and reliability, responsiveness to customer needs, financial stability, corporate governance and competitive pricing of services . The less we are able to differentiate our services and/or clearly convey the value of our services, the more difficulty we have in winning new work in sufficient volumes and at our target pricing and economics .\n Any inability to compete effectively would materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition . If we are not able to supply clients with services that they deem superior and successfully apply current business models with market level pricing while managing discounts, we may lose business to competitors and face downward pressure on gross margins and profitability . Some of our third-party alliance partners are also clients or suppliers for our internal operations .\n If we do not sufficiently invest in new technologies, we may be unable to keep pace with the demands of the markets we serve, it would adversely affect our results of operations . Some of these technological changes have reduced or replaced the demand for some of our historical services and solutions . We expect the proliferation of AI will have a s. anges in technology to serve our clients .\n We increasingly use AI-based technologies, including GenAI, in our client offerings and our own internal operations . We have incurred and plan to continue to incur significant development and operational costs to build and support our AI capabilities . AI technology and services are part of a highly competitive and rapidly evolving market . We believe our ability to compete in this space will be critical to our financial performance .\n In the future, we may face difficulties acquiring the necessary rights from third parties due to market competition and other factors . The use of AI by us or our business partners may create new cybersecurity vulnerabilities . The uncertainty around the safety and security of new and emerging AI applications requires significant investment to test for security, accuracy, bias, and other variables .\n The landscape surrounding AI technologies is rapidly evolving and uncertain, with jurisdictions around the world applying, or considering applying, laws and regulations related to AI and automated decision-making . Compliance with new or changing laws, regulations, industry standards or industry standards relating to AI may impose significant operational costs requiring us to change our service offerings or business practices . Failure to appropriately conform to this evolving landscape may result in legal liability, regulatory action, or brand and reputational harm .\n Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skilled employees, including project managers, IT engineers and senior technical personnel, in particular those with experience in key AI and digital areas . Media scrutiny over issues such as job displacement, privacy and ethical AI concerns can adversely affect our investments in AI technology, both directly and indirectly .\n Failure to attract, integrate and retain new senior executives as the needs of our business require, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations . Competition for skilled labor is intense and, in some jurisdictions in which we operate and in key AI and digital areas, there are more open positions than qualified persons to fill these positions . Changes in immigration laws or policies, or varying applications of immigration laws and policies, could limit the availability of certain work visas in the U.S.\n Many of our contracts with clients are short-term or can be terminated by our clients with short notice and without significant early termination cost . Even if not terminated, clients may be able to delay, reduce or eliminate spending on services and solutions we provide . Terminations and such other events may result from factors that are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product .\n Many of our client contracts tie our compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards, productivity improvements or milestones . Failure to satisfy any such requirements could significantly reduce our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments, subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms .\n Our goals for profitability and capital return rely upon a number of assumptions, including our ability to improve the efficiency of our operations . We may not be able to achieve our profitability goals and maintain our capital return strategy . If we do not accurately estimate the effort, anticipated productivity improvements, costs or timing for meeting contractual commitments or completing engagements to a client's satisfaction, our contracts have in the past and could in the future have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable .\n Cognizant’s December 31, 2024 Form 10-K statement includes a number of questions . The company's ability and decisions to pay dividends and repurchase shares depend on a variety of factors, including cash flow generated from operations, our cash and investment balances, our net income, our overall liquidity position, potential alternative uses of cash, such as acquisitions, and anticipated future economic conditions .\n Our ability to successfully manage change associated with the various business transformation initiatives is critical for our overall strategy execution . We expect to continue pursuing strategic and targeted acquisitions and investments to enhance our offerings of services and solutions . We may not be successful in identifying suitable opportunities, completing targeted transactions or achieving the desired results in the timeframe we expect or at all .\n Our NextGen program may result in the loss of institutional knowledge and expertise, the reallocation of certain roles and responsibilities across the company . In 2024, we incurred $134 million of employee separation, facility exit and other costs related to the program, bringing the total costs incurred since inception to $363 million .\n Cognizant:    to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from our NextGen program, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected . We face legal, reputational and financial risks if we fail to protect client and/or Cognizants data from cybersecurity incidents . Security breaches, employee malfeasance, or human or technological error have in the past and could in the future cause shutdowns or disruptions of our or our clients' operations .\n Like other global companies, we face threats to data and systems, including by nation state threat actors, insider threats (including inappropriate access) Recent international tensions (including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East) have heightened the overall risk of cyber-threats . The emergence and maturation of AI capabilities may also lead to new or more sophisticated methods of attack .\n Techniques used by bad actors to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may evolve and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion . Monetary damages imposed on us could be significant and may impose costs in excess of insurance policy limits or not be covered by our insurance at all . A security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of our information systems, diverting resources from other projects and disrupting businesses .\n There can be no assurance that the procedures and controls that we implement, or that our clients, suppliers, subcontractors and other third parties with whom we do business implement, will be sufficient to protect our information systems from the cybersecurity threats we face . Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, or the failure of our hedging strategies to mitigate such fluctuations can adversely impact our profitability, results of operations and financial condition .\n We are particularly susceptible to wage and cost pressures in India and the exchange rate of the Indian rupee relative to the currencies of our client contracts . The ultimate extent to which any future pandemics, epidemics or other outbreaks of disease impact our business, liquidity, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence .\n If we or our clients experience prolonged shutdowns or other business disruptions, our business, liquidity, results of operations, financial condition and trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected . Climate change, extreme weather and risks arising from the transition to a lower-carbon economy may impact our business . Any future pandemic, epidemic or other outbreak of disease, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from such an event, could precipitate or amplify the other risk factors .\n Shifting stakeholder expectations and evolving regulatory and disclosure standards around ESG could impact our business . Natural disasters and adverse weather events, such as droughts, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise and flooding, occurring more frequently, with less predictability or with greater intensity, could cause community disruptions and impact our employees’ abilities to commute or to work from home safely and effectively .\n An increasing number of stakeholders, regulators, and lawmakers have expressed or pursued contrary views, legislation and investment expectations with respect to ESG ratings and ambitions . If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our business could be negatively affected .\n System failures, outages and operational disruptions may be caused by factors outside of our control, such as hostilities (including the ongoing conflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East), political unrest, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity incidents, power shortages or telecommunications failures . Even if our operations are unaffected or recover quickly from any such events, if our clients cannot timely resume their own operations due to a catastrophic event, they may reduce or terminate our services .\n A substantial portion of our employees in the United States and in many other jurisdictions, including countries in Europe, rely upon temporary work authorization or work permits . The political environment in recent years has included significant support for anti-immigrant legislation and administrative changes . Many of these recent changes have resulted in, and various proposed and enacted changes may result in, increased difficulty in obtaining timely visas, whether as a result of visa application rejections, delays in processing applications .\n Cognizant's expected immigration agenda may have a material adverse impact on companies like ours that have a substantial percentage of our employees on visas . Our principal operating subsidiary in the United States utilizes a high number of skilled workers holding H-1B and L-1 visas and, as a result, may be subject to increased costs upon the effectiveness of any such laws, regulations, policy changes or executive orders .\n In the United States, measures aimed at limiting or restricting the performance of services from an offshore location have been put forward for consideration at both the federal and state levels . Any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends toward global service delivery would seriously harm our ability to compete effectively with competitors that provide the majority of their services from within the country in which our clients operate .\n There are numerous, evolving, and sometimes conflicting, standards, laws and regulations on matters such as immigration, immigration, employment and labor relations, human rights and AI . We face significant regulatory compliance costs and risks as a result of the size and breadth of our business . We may experience increased costs in 2025 and future years for employment and post-employment benefits in India as   “Indian Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the E.U.\n We commit significant financial and managerial resources to comply with internal control over financial reporting requirements, but we have in the past identified and may in the future identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in internal control . We could also face significant compliance and operational burdens and incur significant costs . Such burdens or costs may result in an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations .\n Cognizant: Violations of laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil actions . Violations could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations and financial condition . Changes in tax laws and regulations affecting us and our clients, including applicable tax rates, could increase our effective worldwide income tax rate . We routinely review and update our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements .\n Failure to successfully adapt our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements to align with our evolving business operations may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and financial condition . We are subject to routine tax audits, investigations and proceedings in various jurisdictions . Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions .\n Our business subjects us to considerable potential exposure to litigation and legal claims and could be materially adversely affected if we incur legal liability . Adverse outcomes in any such audits, investigations or proceedings could increase our tax exposure and cause us to incur increased expense, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition . While we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types of potential liabilities .\n If we infringe upon the IP rights of others or our IP rights are infringed upon, our business may be adversely affected . We establish reserves for these and other matters when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated . We have also been the subject of a number of putative securities class action complaints and putative shareholder derivative complaints .\n Cognizant may have to engage in legal action to protect its own IP rights . The existing laws in the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property . The legal landscape surrounding IP protection of software technologies, including AI, is rapidly evolving and as a result there is uncertainty concerning the scope of IP protection for our software IP rights.\n Cognizant's cybersecurity risk management program is guided by industry-recognized security frameworks, including ISO/IEC 27001, TISAX and NIST . e is responsible for assessing the materiality of cybersecurity threats and incidents and informs designated members of executive leadership and of the Board of Directors of material cybersecurity threats . The program is periodically audited as part of external certification audits ."
