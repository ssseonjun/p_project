    "item1a": "Item 1A. \nRisk Factors, I.\n \nRisks Related to Our Business Operations and Industry\n of this Annual Report.\nOur Approach\nWe take a holistic, multi-layered approach to cybersecurity and privacy that combines traditional Defense-in-Depth methods with next-generation Zero Trust principles. In \ndeveloping our cybersecurity risk management program, we are informed by industry benchmarks and standards, including the cybersecurity framework created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) and the Software Assurance Maturity Model developed by the OWASP (the “OWASP SAMM”). We also have various security-related certifications and authorizations, including ISO 27001, SOC 2 Type II and FedRAMP, for certain of our products and services.\nPeople\n. \nRecognizing that technology alone cannot mitigate all security threats, we focus on developing our most critical resource: our people. Our corporate cybersecurity awareness activities are combined with enterprise-wide and department-specific tools and mandatory employee training, providing our employees with knowledge and resources to support our efforts to mitigate security threats.\n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nProcess\n. \nWe maintain processes and policies to try to anticipate security risks and facilitate compliance with applicable contractual obligations, regulations, and standards, as well as address any incidents or violations. We focus on continuous improvement and constantly mature our processes to keep pace with the rapidly evolving cybersecurity threat landscape.\n \nTechnology\n. \nWe seek to automate processes and remove the potential for human error to the extent feasible by implementing technology solutions. From fundamental IT security to development of our software products and keeping our customers’ data safe, we aim to maintain a secure infrastructure that is appropriately monitored for possible threats.\n \nThese three key elements of people, process, and technology are tightly interwoven to support our aim to secure our environments and \nthe data for which we are a custodian\n.\nGovernance\n \nCybersecurity is a risk area with oversight at the highest levels of the organization, including the Executive and Board Level. \nThe overall operational program is led by the Cybersecurity Strategy Council, a cross-functional team of executives and subject matter experts, led by our Chief Product Security Officer, Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Compliance Officer. The Cybersecurity Strategy Council oversees a “Three Lines Model” of Operations, Risk Monitoring and Oversight, and Audit, to effectively address cybersecurity, risk management, and control. \nAll Cybersecurity, Risk, and Internal Audit functions report to the PTC Executive Leadership Team.\nWe provide regular updates on our cybersecurity strategic plans, programs, and initiatives to the Cybersecurity Committee of the Board of Directors at its four regularly scheduled meetings per year. Our Incident Response Plans provide for notice, and continued updates, to the Cybersecurity Committee of applicable incidents on a timely basis\n.\nRisk Assessment\nWe conduct an annual cybersecurity maturity assessment. \nPeriodically, we engage a third-party security consulting firm to conduct an Enterprise Security Maturity Assessment.\n This independent assessment provides a mechanism to benchmark our current risk profile and enables us to measure progress as we make program improvements. Identified cybersecurity risks are reviewed by the Cybersecurity Strategy Council, which ensures that risk tolerances are established and used to appropriately manage risks and address the risks identified.\nThird-Party Vendor Risk Management\nOur Vendor Risk Management (VRM) program is \ndesigned to meet cybersecurity, privacy, regulatory and compliance obligations, by managing risk associated with third-party vendors who have access to PTC IT systems and data\n. Prior to outsourcing or allowing third-party access to PTC or customer systems, IP, or data; risks associated with such activity are identified and documented. The process of selecting a third-party vendor includes due diligence of the vendor service or product in question. Third-party companies using PTC facilities or accessing PTC’s IT Systems are subject to PTC’s VRM review and \nmust demonstrate that proper security measures are in place before they have access to any PTC IT systems or data. All such vendors are to be approved by PTC’s VRM process and contractually bound to maintain appropriate cybersecurity technical and organization measures and to protect PTC’s data to which they may have access.\n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nIncident Response\nWe maintain an Enterprise Cybersecurity Incident Response Policy to address cybersecurity incidents. The Policy is tested on a periodic basis, including an ongoing improvement program involving periodic tabletop exercises. Cybersecurity incident handling is managed by individual organizations with cybersecurity responsibility and monitored/guided by applicable corporate functions. All Cybersecurity Incident Response Plans under the Policy are based on industry standards, such as the NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide – Special Publication 800-61.\nManagement’s Role in Assessing and Managing Our Risks from Cybersecurity Threats\nOur Cybersecurity Program is overseen by executives on our Executive Leadership Team and managed by our Cybersecurity Strategy Council, including our Senior Vice President, Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who reports to our Executive Vice President, Chief Digital and Information Officer (CDO)\n. Our CISO is responsible for day-to-day risk management activities, including staying informed about and monitoring prevention, detection, mitigation, and remediation efforts through regular communication and reporting from professionals in the information security team, and the use of technological tools and software.\n Our CDO is responsible for our broader IT program, which includes our ability to remediate and recover from a cybersecurity incident while reducing impacts to the business and operations\n.\n \nOur CDO and CISO regularly report directly to the Cybersecurity Committee of the Board of Directors\n on our Cybersecurity Program and efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate issues.\n In addition, we have an escalation process in place to inform senior management and the Cybersecurity Committee and the Board of Directors of material issues.\nManagement Experience\nOur CDO and CISO have extensive experience assessing and managing cybersecurity programs and cybersecurity risk. Our CDO joined PTC as Chief Digital and Information Officer in January 2022 and is responsible for PTC’s global information technology (IT) team, overseeing PTC’s digital infrastructure and working with business leaders to guide PTC’s digital process optimization strategy.
