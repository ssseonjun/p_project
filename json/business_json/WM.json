    "item1": "Item 1. \nBusiness – Regulation – Recent Developments and Focus Areas in Policy and Regulation\n.\nWe encounter intense competition from governmental, quasi-governmental and private service providers based on pricing, and to a much lesser extent, the nature of service offerings, particularly in the residential line of business. Our industry is directly affected by changes in general economic factors, including increases and decreases in consumer spending, business expansions and construction activity. These factors generally correlate to volumes of waste generated and impact our revenue. Negative economic conditions and other macroeconomic trends can and have caused customers to reduce their service needs. Such negative economic conditions, in addition to competitor actions, can impact our strategy to negotiate, renew, or expand service contracts and grow our business. We also encounter competition for acquisitions and growth opportunities. General economic factors and the market for consumer goods, in addition to regulatory developments, can also significantly impact commodity prices for the recyclable materials we sell. Significant components of our operating expenses vary directly as we experience changes in revenue due to volume and inflation. Volume changes \n49\n\n\nTable of Contents\ncan fluctuate significantly by line of business and volume changes in higher margin businesses can impact key financial metrics. We must dynamically manage our cost structure in response to volume changes and cost inflation.\nWe believe the Company’s industry-leading asset network and strategic focus on investing in our people and our digital platform will give the Company the necessary tools to address the evolving challenges impacting the Company and our industry. In line with our commitment to continuous improvement and a differentiated customer experience, we remain focused on our automation and optimization investments to enhance our operational efficiency and change the way we interact with our customers. Advancements made through these initiatives are intended to seamlessly and digitally connect all enterprise functions required to service customers and provide the best experience. We have made significant progress in executing this technology enablement strategy to automate and optimize certain elements of our service delivery model. The key benefits are reduced labor dependency on certain high-turnover jobs, particularly in customer experience, recycling and residential collection, while further elevating our customer self-service through digitalization and implementation of technologies to enhance the safety, reliability and efficiency within our collection operations. Additionally, in 2022, we implemented a new general ledger accounting system, complementary finance enterprise resource planning system and a human capital management system, which will continue to drive operational and service excellence by empowering our people through a modern, simplified and connected employee experience.\nWe sometimes experience margin pressures and variability in earnings and margins from our commodity-driven businesses, specifically within our Recycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy segments. While recycling commodity prices have recovered in 2024 from the low levels experienced in 2023, commodity prices are still below levels seen at the beginning of 2022. The impacts of commodity price fluctuations are not currently material to our WM Renewable Energy segment; however, as we continue to make investments to grow that segment, we may experience more significant impacts from fluctuations in the prices of electricity, natural gas, RINs and RECs. We continue to take proactive steps to adjust our business models to protect against the down-side risk of changes in commodity prices. \nVariability in economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, employment trends and supply chain reliability, can create risk and uncertainty in financial outlook. We take proactive steps to recover and mitigate inflationary cost pressures through our overall pricing efforts and by managing our costs through efficiency, labor productivity, and investments in technology to automate certain aspects of our business. We remain committed to putting our people first to ensure that they are well positioned to execute our daily operations diligently and safely. We remain focused on delivering outstanding customer service, managing our variable costs with changing volumes and investing in technology that will enhance our customers’ experience and provide operating efficiencies intended to reduce our cost to serve.\nCurrent Year Financial Results\nDuring 2024, we continued to focus on our priorities to advance our strategy—enhancing employee engagement, reducing our cost to serve through the use of technology and automation, and investing in growth through acquisitions and our Recycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy segments. We invested approximately $8 billion, with $7.5 billion funded in cash and $0.5 billion as the assumption of debt, on acquisitions in 2024, including having completed our acquisition of Stericycle in early November. We remain diligent in offering competitive and differentiated services that meet the needs of our customers, and we are focused on driving operating efficiencies and reducing discretionary spend. We continue to invest in our people through paying a competitive market wage, investing in our digital platform and providing training for our team members. We also continue to make investments in automation and optimization to enhance our operational efficiency and improve labor productivity for all lines of business. This strategic focus, combined with strong operational execution, resulted in increased revenue, income from operations and income from operations margin in 2024 when compared to the prior year. During 2024, the Company allocated $3,231 million of available cash to capital expenditures. We also allocated $1,472 million of available cash to our shareholders during 2024 through dividends and common stock repurchases.\n50\n\n\nTable of Contents\nKey elements of our 2024 financial results include:\n●\nRevenues of $22,063 million for 2024 compared with $20,426 million in 2023, an increase of $1,637 million, or 8.0%. The increase is primarily attributable to (i) higher yield in our Collection and Disposal businesses; (ii) acquisitions, net of divestitures; (iii) increases in commodity prices in our Recycling and Sales and WM Renewable Energy segments and (iv) increased volumes. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenue from our energy surcharge program as a result of a decline in the price of fuel, particularly diesel;\n●\nOperating expenses of $13,383 million in 2024, or 60.7% of revenues, compared with $12,606 million, or 61.7% of revenues, in 2023. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses improved significantly compared to the prior year as revenue growth from price, efficiency gains, improved employee retention and momentum in truck deliveries offset the impacts of inflationary increases in wages and other expenses. The increase in total operating expenses from prior year related primarily to (i) acquisitions; (ii) inflationary pressure on wages and expenses; (iii) higher recycling customer rebates resulting from an approximate 50% increase in single-stream recycling commodity prices; (iv) volume growth within our WMSBS business which relies more extensively on subcontracted hauling and services than our Collection and Disposal businesses; (v) increases in landfill operating costs, particularly for higher leachate costs due to wet weather and (vi) higher risk management spend, due in part, to increases in certain large loss claims reserves. These increases were partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices and an increase in gains on the sale of non-strategic assets in 2024 as compared with the prior year;\n●\nSelling, general and administrative expenses of $2,264 million in 2024, or 10.3% of revenues, compared with $1,926 million, or 9.4% of revenues, in 2023. The $338 million increase was primarily due to (i) costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Stericycle of which a significant portion were transaction and integration costs that are not expected to recur; (ii) increased labor costs from higher annual and long-term incentive compensation costs and annual wage increases and (iii) increased professional fees to support strategic initiatives. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in litigation costs;\n●\nIncome from operations of $4,063 million, or 18.4% of revenues, in 2024 compared with $3,575 million, or 17.5% of revenues, in 2023.\n \nThe increase in the current year earnings was primarily driven by (i) revenue growth and improved performance within our Collection and Disposal businesses; (ii) impairments incurred in 2023 and (iii) higher RIN quantities generated and sold at higher market values in the current year;\n●\nNet income attributable to Waste Management, Inc. was $2,746 million, or $6.81 per diluted share, compared with $2,304 million, or $5.66 per diluted share, in 2023. The $442 million increase is due to an increase in income from operations discussed above, as well as lower income tax expense driven by benefits generated from our low-income housing investments and federal tax credits realized from our RNG investments. These increases were partially offset by\n \nhigher interest expense;\n●\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $5,390 million in 2024, compared with $4,719 million in 2023. The $671 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by\n \n(i) higher earnings in our Collection and Disposal businesses; (ii) favorable changes in working capital, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures and (iii) lower annual incentive compensation payments. This increase was partially offset by higher cash interest payments and income tax payments; and\n●\nFree cash flow was $2,317 million in 2024, compared with $1,902 million in 2023. The $415 million increase in free cash flow was primarily due to the increases in operating cash described above and increase in proceeds from the divestiture of non-strategic assets and businesses. These increases were partially offset by an increase in capital spending, which was driven by our planned and ongoing investments in our Recycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy segments and higher capital asset purchases in the current year to support our Collection and Disposal businesses. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity. Refer to Free Cash Flow below for our definition of free cash flow, additional information about our use of this measure, and a reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure.\n51\n\n\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues\nThe mix of operating revenues for the years ended December 31 are as follows (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNet\n​\nIntercompany\n​\nGross\n​\n    \nOperating\n​\nOperating\n​\nOperating\n​\n​\nRevenues\n    \nRevenues(a)(b)\n    \nRevenues(b)\nYear Ended December 31:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2024\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCommercial\n \n$\n 5,371\n​\n$\n 798\n​\n$\n 6,169\nIndustrial\n​\n \n 3,089\n​\n​\n 794\n​\n \n 3,883\nResidential\n​\n​\n 3,466\n​\n​\n 89\n​\n​\n 3,555\nOther collection\n​\n \n 2,964\n​\n \n 230\n​\n \n 3,194\nTotal collection\n​\n \n 14,890\n​\n \n 1,911\n​\n \n 16,801\nLandfill \n​\n​\n 3,445\n​\n​\n 1,513\n​\n​\n 4,958\nTransfer\n​\n​\n 1,381\n​\n​\n 1,067\n​\n​\n 2,448\nTotal Collection and Disposal\n​\n \n 19,716\n​\n \n 4,491\n​\n \n 24,207\nRecycling Processing and Sales \n​\n \n 1,603\n​\n \n 287\n​\n \n 1,890\nWM Renewable Energy\n​\n \n 318\n​\n \n 3\n​\n \n 321\nWM Healthcare Solutions\n​\n​\n 403\n​\n​\n 10\n​\n​\n 413\nCorporate and Other\n​\n​\n 23\n​\n​\n 25\n​\n​\n 48\nTotal\n​\n$\n 22,063\n​\n$\n 4,816\n​\n$\n 26,879\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2023\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCommercial\n \n$\n 5,109\n​\n$\n 692\n​\n$\n 5,801\nIndustrial\n​\n \n 3,083\n​\n​\n 753\n​\n \n 3,836\nResidential\n​\n​\n 3,378\n​\n​\n 96\n​\n​\n 3,474\nOther collection\n​\n \n 2,786\n​\n \n 220\n​\n \n 3,006\nTotal collection\n​\n \n 14,356\n​\n \n 1,761\n​\n \n 16,117\nLandfill \n​\n​\n 3,252\n​\n​\n 1,479\n​\n​\n 4,731\nTransfer\n​\n​\n 1,257\n​\n​\n 1,036\n​\n​\n 2,293\nTotal Collection and Disposal\n​\n \n 18,865\n​\n \n 4,276\n​\n \n 23,141\nRecycling Processing and Sales \n​\n \n 1,264\n​\n \n 312\n​\n \n 1,576\nWM Renewable Energy\n​\n \n 273\n​\n \n 3\n​\n \n 276\nCorporate and Other \n​\n​\n 24\n​\n​\n 22\n​\n​\n 46\nTotal\n​\n$\n 20,426\n​\n$\n 4,613\n​\n$\n 25,039\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2022\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCommercial\n \n$\n 4,860\n​\n$\n 590\n​\n$\n 5,450\nIndustrial\n​\n \n 3,025\n​\n​\n 656\n​\n \n 3,681\nResidential\n​\n​\n 3,264\n​\n​\n 75\n​\n​\n 3,339\nOther collection\n​\n \n 2,466\n​\n \n 217\n​\n \n 2,683\nTotal collection\n​\n \n 13,615\n​\n \n 1,538\n​\n \n 15,153\nLandfill \n​\n​\n 3,062\n​\n​\n 1,454\n​\n​\n 4,516\nTransfer\n​\n​\n 1,166\n​\n​\n 977\n​\n​\n 2,143\nTotal Collection and Disposal \n​\n \n 17,843\n​\n \n 3,969\n​\n \n 21,812\nRecycling Processing and Sales \n​\n \n 1,516\n​\n \n 244\n​\n \n 1,760\nWM Renewable Energy\n​\n \n 312\n​\n \n 3\n​\n \n 315\nCorporate and Other \n​\n​\n 27\n​\n​\n 22\n​\n​\n 49\nTotal\n​\n$\n 19,698\n​\n$\n 4,238\n​\n$\n 23,936\n52\n\n\nTable of Contents\n(a)\nIntercompany operating revenues reflect each segment’s total intercompany sales, including intercompany sales within a segment and between segments.

We are continuing to see growth in our landfill business with our municipal solid waste experiencing average yield of 3.1% in 2024.\nRecycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy —\n Recycling Processing and Sales revenues attributable to yield increased $245 million in 2024 and decreased $308 million in 2023, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods. Average market prices for single-stream recycled commodities increased approximately 50% in 2024 and decreased 40% in 2023 as compared with the prior year period. During 2023, the revenue decline from lower commodity pricing that started in 2022 was partially offset by higher pricing in our recycling brokerage business as well as our continued focus on a fee-based pricing model. Additionally, revenue in our WM Renewable Energy segment increased $26 million in 2024 and decreased $73 million in 2023 as compared with the prior year periods, primarily driven by fluctuations in energy prices and the value and quantity of RINs. While there may be short-term fluctuations in our commodity-driven businesses as prices change, we believe that our business models and processes appropriately mitigate the downside risk of changes in commodity prices.\nEnergy Surcharge and Mandated Fees — \nThese fees decreased $97 million and $104 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. Beginning in the second quarter of 2023, our energy surcharge was revised to incorporate market prices for both diesel and CNG. The decrease in energy surcharge revenues is primarily due to a decline in market prices for diesel fuel of approximately 10% in 2024 and 15% in 2023 as compared to the prior year periods. The mandated fees are primarily related to fees and taxes assessed by various state, county and municipal government agencies at our landfills and transfer stations. These amounts have not significantly impacted the change in revenue for the periods presented. \nVolume\nOur revenues from volume (excluding volumes from acquisitions and divestitures) increased $88 million, or 0.4%, and $150 million, or 0.8%, in 2024 and 2023, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods. Although our 2024 volume growth has moderated when compared to 2023, special waste and municipal solid waste tons at our landfills continue to be a significant driver of our growth. Additionally, in 2024 we saw an increase in volumes in our WMSBS business due to our continued focus on a differentiated service model for national accounts customers and our recycling activity, renewable energy projects and commercial collection business contributed to our overall volume growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in industrial collection volumes and the intentional shedding of low-margin residential collection business. Furthermore, our construction and demolition landfill volumes for the year ended December 31, 2024, declined as compared to prior year due to clean-up efforts in our East Tier from Hurricane Ian in 2023.\n54\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions and divestitures resulted in a net increase in revenues of $576 million, or 2.9%, and $181 million, or 0.9%, in 2024 and 2023, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The 2024 increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Stericycle in November 2024. The remaining increases were related to our ongoing investment in tuck-in acquisitions of solid waste businesses.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses are comprised of (i) labor and related benefits costs (excluding labor costs associated with maintenance and repairs discussed below), which include salaries and wages, bonuses, related payroll taxes, insurance and benefits costs and the costs associated with contract labor; (ii) transfer and disposal costs, which include tipping fees paid to third-party disposal facilities and transfer stations; (iii) maintenance and repairs costs relating to equipment, vehicles and facilities and related labor costs; (iv) subcontractor costs, which include the costs of independent haulers who transport waste collected by us to disposal facilities and are affected by variables such as volumes, distance and fuel prices; (v) costs of goods sold, which includes the cost to purchase recycling materials for our Recycling Processing and Sales segment, including certain rebates paid to suppliers; (vi) fuel costs, net of tax credits for alternative fuel, which represent the costs of fuel to operate our truck fleet and landfill operating equipment; (vii) disposal and franchise fees and taxes, which include landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees, contingent landfill lease payments and royalties; (viii) landfill operating costs, which include interest accretion on landfill liabilities, interest accretion on and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities, leachate and methane collection and treatment, landfill remediation costs and other landfill site costs; (ix) risk management costs, which include general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs costs and (x) other operating costs, which include gains and losses on sale of assets, telecommunications, equipment and facility lease expenses, property taxes, utilities and supplies. Variations in volumes year-over-year, as discussed above in \nOperating Revenues\n, in addition to cost inflation, affect the comparability of the components of our operating expenses.\nThe following table summarizes the major components of our operating expenses for the year ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n​\n    \n2023\n​\n  \n2022\n​\nLabor and related benefits\n​\n$\n 3,845\n    \n17.4 \n%  \n​\n$\n 3,669\n    \n18.0 \n%\n​\n$\n 3,452\n    \n17.5 \n%\nTransfer and disposal costs\n​\n \n 1,331\n​\n6.0 \n​\n​\n \n 1,273\n​\n6.2 \n​\n​\n \n 1,215\n​\n6.2 \n​\nMaintenance and repairs\n​\n \n 2,079\n​\n9.4 \n​\n​\n \n 1,978\n​\n9.7 \n​\n​\n \n 1,835\n​\n9.3 \n​\nSubcontractor costs\n​\n \n 2,240\n​\n10.2 \n​\n​\n \n 2,185\n​\n10.7 \n​\n​\n \n 2,006\n​\n10.2 \n​\nCost of goods sold\n​\n \n 1,048\n​\n4.7 \n​\n​\n \n 769\n​\n3.8 \n​\n​\n \n 973\n​\n4.9 \n​\nFuel\n​\n \n 437\n​\n2.0 \n​\n​\n \n 501\n​\n2.4 \n​\n​\n \n 592\n​\n3.0 \n​\nDisposal and franchise fees and taxes\n​\n \n 744\n​\n3.4 \n​\n​\n \n 736\n​\n3.6 \n​\n​\n \n 720\n​\n3.7 \n​\nLandfill operating costs\n​\n \n 524\n​\n2.4 \n​\n​\n \n 453\n​\n2.2 \n​\n​\n \n 421\n​\n2.1 \n​\nRisk management\n​\n \n 351\n​\n1.6 \n​\n​\n \n 320\n​\n1.6 \n​\n​\n \n 348\n​\n1.8 \n​\nOther\n​\n \n 784\n​\n3.6 \n​\n​\n \n 722\n​\n3.5 \n​\n​\n \n 732\n​\n3.7 \n​\n​\n​\n$\n 13,383\n​\n 60.7\n%  \n​\n$\n 12,606\n​\n61.7 \n%  \n​\n$\n 12,294\n​\n62.4 \n%\n​\nAs a percentage of revenue, operating expenses improved significantly compared to the prior year as revenue growth from price, efficiency gains, improved employee retention and momentum in truck deliveries offset the impacts of inflationary increases in wages and other expenses. The increase in total operating expenses from prior year related primarily to (i) acquisitions; (ii) inflationary pressure on wages and expenses; (iii) higher recycling customer rebates resulting from an approximate 50% increase in single-stream recycling commodity prices; (iv) volume growth within our WMSBS business which relies more extensively on subcontracted hauling and services than our Collection and Disposal businesses; (v) increases in landfill operating costs due to wet weather and (vi) higher risk management spend, due in part, to increases in certain large loss claims reserves. These increases were partially offset by lower diesel fuel prices and an increase in gains on the sale of non-strategic assets in 2024 as compared with the prior year.\nOur operating expenses increased in 2023, as compared with 2022, primarily due to (i) inflationary cost pressures, \n55\n\n\nTable of Contents\nparticularly for maintenance and repairs and subcontractor costs and (ii) labor cost pressure from frontline employee market wage adjustments. These increases were offset, in part, by commodity-driven business impacts, particularly from lower recycling rebates reflected in costs of goods sold and lower fuel prices. Our focus on operating efficiency and efforts to control our costs, along with revenue growth, enabled us to improve operating costs as a percent of revenues in 2023 as compared with 2022.\nSignificant items affecting the comparison of operating expenses between reported periods include: \nLabor and Related Benefits\n — Our investments in technology that focus on driving route optimization, improving driver retention, and creating efficiencies have positively impacted our labor and related benefits costs. The increase in costs in 2024, as compared with 2023, was primarily driven by (i) increased headcount from our recent acquisitions and (ii) annual employee wage increases and higher annual incentive compensation. These increases were offset, in part, by the benefit of productivity and operational efficiency gains. The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2023, as compared with 2022, was primarily driven by (i) employee market wage adjustments; (ii) increased headcount primarily from acquisitions and (iii) increases in health and welfare costs and in medical care activity. These increases were offset, in part, by lower annual incentive compensation. \nTransfer and Disposal Costs\n — The increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2024, as compared with 2023, was primarily due to (i) inflationary cost increases, which includes increased disposal fees at third-party sites and higher rates from our third-party haulers and (ii) incremental third-party transfer and disposal costs as a result of our recent acquisitions. These cost increases were offset, in part, by decreases in industrial and residential collection volumes.\n \nThe increase in transfer and disposal costs in 2023, as compared with 2022, was primarily due to inflationary cost increases, which includes increased disposal fees at third-party sites and higher rates from our third-party haulers, offset, in part, by a decrease in collection volumes.\nMaintenance and Repairs\n — The increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2024, as compared with 2023, was primarily driven by (i) inflationary and acquisition related cost increases for parts, supplies and third-party services, and (ii) annual wage increases and higher technician headcount. These cost increases were offset, in part, by an improvement in new truck deliveries, which require less maintenance than older trucks, (ii) fleet rationalization efforts that removed older trucks and reduced our fleet count and (iii) improvements in operational efficiencies. The increase in maintenance and repairs costs in 2023, as compared with 2022, was primarily driven by (i) continued inflationary cost increases for parts, supplies and third-party services, although the impact of such inflationary cost increases moderated throughout the year and (ii) labor cost increases for our technicians, including additional headcount.\nSubcontractor Costs\n — The increase in subcontractor costs in 2024, as compared with 2023, was primarily due to (i) an increase in volumes in our WMSBS business, which relies more extensively on subcontracted hauling and services than our Collection and Disposal businesses (ii) continued inflationary cost increases related to labor costs from third-party haulers and (iii) our recent acquisitions. These increases were offset, in part, by the impact of lower fuel prices on third-party subcontracted hauling and services. The increase in subcontractor costs in 2023, as compared with 2022, was primarily due to (i) an increase in volumes in our WMSBS and SES businesses, which rely more extensively on subcontracted hauling and services than other parts of our Collection and Disposal businesses and (ii) continued inflationary cost increases, particularly labor and other costs from third-party haulers. \nCost of Goods Sold — \nThe increase in cost of goods sold in 2024, as compared with 2023, was primarily driven by an approximate 50% increase in single-stream recycling commodity prices. The decrease in cost of goods sold in 2023, as compared with 2022, was primarily driven by a 40% decrease in average single-stream recycling commodity prices.\nFuel — \nThe decrease in fuel costs was primarily due to a decrease of approximately 10% in average market prices for diesel fuel in 2024 and 15% in 2023. \nDisposal and Franchise Fees and Taxes — \nThe increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2024, as compared with 2023, was primarily driven by an increase in landfill volumes and an overall rate increase in fees and taxes paid to municipalities on our disposal volumes. The increase in disposal and franchise fees and taxes in 2023, as compared with 2022, was primarily driven by an overall rate increase in fees and taxes paid to municipalities on our disposal volumes. \n56\n\n\nTable of Contents\nLandfill Operating Costs — \nThe increase in landfill operating costs in 2024, as compared with 2023, was primarily due to (i) higher leachate collection and treatment and site maintenance costs which can largely be attributed to particularly wet weather in certain markets throughout 2024 and (ii) increased methane collection and treatment costs. Our landfill operating costs increased in 2023, as compared with 2022, primarily due to (i) higher expenses for interest accretion on landfill and environmental remediation liabilities and (ii) an increase in remediation expense due to changes in measurement of certain environmental remediation obligations.\n​\nRisk Management\n — The increase in risk management in 2024, as compared with 2023, was primarily due to (i) adjustments to our reserves for certain large loss claims; (ii) higher auto and workers compensation claims costs and (iii) increases in premiums for property coverage. These increases were offset, in part, by current year insurance recoveries for property claims associated with a fire and natural disasters. Risk management costs decreased in 2023, as compared with 2022, primarily due to lower levels of large loss claims.\n​\nOther \n— Other operating costs increased in 2024, as compared with 2023, primarily due to (i) our recent acquisitions (ii) higher supply chain rebates in 2023 and (iii) a prior year favorable litigation settlement, which reduced our expenses in that period. These increases were offset, in part, by gains on the sales of non-strategic assets in 2024. Other operating costs decreased in 2023, as compared with 2022, primarily due to (i) supply chain rebates in 2023 and (ii) a favorable litigation settlement, which were offset, in part, by (i) inflationary cost pressures, although the impact of such continued inflationary cost increases moderated throughout the year; (ii) higher utility costs at our facilities; (iii) an increase in business travel and (iv) higher equipment rental costs.\n \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses \nOur selling, general and administrative expenses consist of (i) labor and related benefits costs, which include salaries, bonuses, related insurance and benefits, contract labor, payroll taxes and equity-based compensation; (ii) professional fees, which include fees for consulting, legal, audit and tax services; (iii) provision for bad debts, which includes allowances for uncollectible customer accounts and collection fees and (iv) other selling, general and administrative expenses, which include, among other costs, facility-related expenses, voice and data telecommunication, advertising, bank charges, computer costs, travel and entertainment, rentals, postage and printing. In addition, the financial impacts of litigation reserves generally are included in our “Other” selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe following table summarizes the major components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n​\n    \n2023\n​\n    \n2022\n​\nLabor and related benefits\n​\n$\n 1,400\n    \n 6.4\n%\n​\n$\n 1,205\n    \n 5.9\n%\n​\n$\n 1,195\n    \n 6.1\n%\nProfessional fees\n​\n \n 358\n​\n 1.6\n​\n​\n \n 228\n​\n 1.1\n​\n​\n \n 268\n​\n 1.4\n​\nProvision for bad debts\n​\n \n 51\n​\n 0.2\n​\n​\n \n 56\n​\n 0.3\n​\n​\n \n 50\n​\n 0.2\n​\nOther\n​\n \n 455\n​\n 2.1\n​\n​\n \n 437\n​\n 2.1\n​\n​\n \n 425\n​\n 2.1\n​\n​\n​\n$\n 2,264\n​\n 10.3\n%\n​\n$\n 1,926\n​\n 9.4\n%\n​\n$\n 1,938\n​\n 9.8\n%\n​\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in 2024, as compared with 2023, have increased due to (i) severance and consulting costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Stericycle, of which a significant portion are transaction and integration costs that are not expected to recur; (ii) increased labor costs from higher annual and long-term incentive compensation and annual wage increases and (iii) increased professional fees to support strategic initiatives. Partially offsetting these increases was a decline in litigation costs.\n​\nSelling, general and administrative expenses in 2023, as compared with 2022, decreased primarily due to (i) reduced professional fees in connection with investments in our digital platform, as certain digital projects have moved from higher cost development activities to implementation activities, and (ii) lower annual incentive compensation costs. These decreases were partially offset by annual wage increases and increased litigation costs.\n \n​\n57\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSignificant items affecting the comparison of our selling, general and administrative expenses between reported periods include: \nLabor and Related Benefits\n — The increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2024, as compared with 2023, was primarily related to (i) costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of Stericycle, including severance costs and additional headcount; (ii) higher annual and long-term incentive compensation costs and (iii) annual employee wage increases.\n \nThe increase in labor and related benefits costs in 2023, as compared with 2022, was primarily related to (i) annual wage increases for our employees; (ii) market adjustments for deferred compensation plans related to investment performance and (iii) higher long-term incentive compensation costs, partially offset by lower annual incentive compensation costs and lower contract labor expenses.\nProfessional Fees\n — The increase in professional fees in 2024, as compared with 2023, was primarily attributable to legal, consulting and accounting costs incurred to support strategic initiatives, including our acquisition of Stericycle. The decrease in professional fees in 2023, as compared with 2022, was primarily attributable to reduced expenses in connection with investments in our digital platform.\nOther — \nThe increase in other expenses in 2024, as compared with 2023, was primarily related to (i) risk management costs incurred in connection with the acquisition and integration of Stericycle and (ii) increased spend across multiple cost categories including technology and travel. These cost increases were partially offset by a decline in litigation costs. The increase in other expenses in 2023, as compared with 2022, was primarily related to (i) increased litigation costs; (ii) increased bank charges and (iii) higher advertising spend, which were partially offset by lower travel expenses and lower telecommunication costs. \nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expenses\nThe following table summarizes the components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31 (dollars in millions and as a percentage of revenues):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n​\n    \n2023\n​\n    \n2022\n \nDepreciation of tangible property and equipment\n​\n$\n 1,292\n    \n 5.9\n%\n​\n$\n 1,197\n    \n 5.9\n%\n​\n$\n 1,155\n    \n 5.9\n%\nDepletion of landfill airspace\n​\n \n 795\n​\n 3.6\n​\n​\n \n 745\n​\n 3.6\n​\n​\n \n 754\n​\n 3.8\n​\nAmortization of intangible assets\n​\n \n 180\n​\n 0.8\n​\n​\n \n 129\n​\n 0.6\n​\n​\n \n 129\n​\n 0.6\n​\n​\n​\n$\n 2,267\n​\n10.3 \n%\n​\n$\n 2,071\n​\n10.1 \n%\n​\n$\n 2,038\n​\n10.3 \n%\n​\nThe increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment in 2024, as compared with 2023, was driven by (i) increased investments in capital assets such as trucks and containers and (ii) the acquisition of Stericycle. The increase in depletion of landfill airspace in 2024, as compared to with 2023, was driven by changes in amortization rates from revisions in landfill estimates and volume increases, partially offset by the closure of a landfill in our East Tier. The increase in amortization of intangibles was driven by the amortization of acquired intangible assets. \nThe increase in depreciation of tangible property and equipment in 2023, as compared with 2022, was mainly influenced by strategic investments in our digital platform and investments in capital assets to service our customers, such as machinery and containers. The decrease in depletion of landfill airspace in 2023, as compared with 2022, was primarily driven by reductions in volume partially offset by the reopening of a previously closed site in our East Tier. \n58\n\n\nTable of Contents\n(Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net\nThe following table summarizes the major components of (gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net for the year ended December 31 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nGain from divestitures, net\n​\n$\n (26)\n​\n$\n —\n​\n$\n (5)\nAsset impairments\n​\n \n 90\n​\n \n 275\n​\n \n 50\nOther, net\n​\n \n 18\n​\n \n (32)\n​\n \n 17\n​\n​\n$\n 82\n​\n$\n 243\n​\n$\n 62\n​\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $82 million of net charges primarily consisting of (i) a $54 million charge required to increase the estimated fair value of a liability associated with the expected disposition of an investment the Company holds in a waste diversion technology business; (ii) a $14 million loss associated with the divestiture of a minority investment in a medical waste company within Corporate and Other, in connection with our acquisition of Stericycle and (iii) a $13 million charge pertaining to reserves for loss contingencies in our Corporate and Other segment to adjust an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary’s estimated potential share of the liability for a proposed environmental remediation plan at a closed site, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $243 million of net charges primarily consisting of (i) a $168 million goodwill impairment charge within our Recycling Processing and Sales segment related to a business engaged in accelerating film and plastic wrap recycling capabilities, with $22 million attributable to noncontrolling interests. This charge was partially offset by the recognition of $46 million of income related to the reversal of a liability for contingent consideration associated with our investment in such business; (ii) $107 million of impairment charges within Corporate and Other for certain investments in waste diversion technology businesses and (iii) a $17 million charge within Corporate and Other to adjust an indirect wholly owned subsidiary’s estimated potential share of the liability for a proposed environmental remediation plan at a closed site. Refer to Notes 5 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $62 million of net charges consisting of (i) $50 million of asset impairment charges primarily related to management’s decision to close two landfills within our East Tier and (ii) a $17 million charge pertaining to reserves for loss contingencies within Corporate and Other to adjust an indirect wholly owned subsidiary’s estimated potential share of the liability for a proposed environmental remediation plan at a closed site, as discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These losses were partially offset by a $5 million gain from the divestiture of a collection and disposal operation in our West Tier.\n \nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments.

These increases were partially offset by (i) a decline in contributions from lower industrial volumes; (ii) an increase in landfill operating costs and (iii) increased depreciation expenses with relation to our fleet, machinery and equipment as well as higher depletion costs at our landfills\n.\n●\nIncome from operations in our Collection and Disposal businesses increased in 2023, as compared with 2022, primarily due to revenue growth in our collection and disposal operations driven by both yield and volume. This increase was partially offset by (i) inflationary cost pressures, particularly for maintenance and repairs and subcontractor costs and (ii) labor cost pressure from frontline employee market wage adjustments.\n \nRecycling Processing and Sales\n — Income from operations in our Recycling Processing and Sales segment increased in 2024, as compared with 2023, primarily due to (i) net charges of $122 million recognized in 2023 related to a goodwill impairment and reversal of contingent consideration, as discussed below and (ii) benefits from the automation of our recycling facilities as well as investments in new facilities and cost management. These improvements were partially offset by the impact of higher costs incurred from the temporary shutdown of facilities for technology upgrades.\n​\nIncome from operations in our Recycling Processing and Sales segment decreased in 2023, as compared with 2022, primarily due to (i) a $168 million goodwill impairment charge, with $22 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, which was partially offset by the recognition of $46 million of income related to the reversal of contingent consideration as discussed above in \n(Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net\n; (ii) a decline in recycling commodity prices; (iii) lower revenue resulting from the temporary shutdown of facilities for technology upgrades combined with increased costs associated with the transportation and third-party tip fees for processing recyclables and (iv) startup costs linked to the establishment of a new processing facility. \n​\nWM Renewable Energy\n — Income from operations in our WM Renewable Energy segment increased in 2024, as compared with 2023, primarily due to (i) higher RIN quantities generated and sold at higher market values in the current year and (ii) increased beneficial use of landfill gas sold to third parties due to the completion of additional projects. Income from operations in our WM Renewable Energy segment decreased in 2023, as compared with 2022, primarily due to (i) lower energy prices and the value of RINs and (ii) increased operating and selling, general and administrative costs \n60\n\n\nTable of Contents\nassociated with the construction of new projects to increase the beneficial use of landfill gas. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in volume of RFS credits, electricity and natural gas.\n​\nWM Healthcare Solutions \n— Our WM Healthcare Solutions segment generated a loss of $69 million in 2024, which was largely attributable to acquisition and integration related expenses. There is no 2023 or 2022 activity as Stericycle was acquired on November 4, 2024.  \nCorporate and Other\n — The costs incurred by our Corporate and Other segment increased in 2024, as compared with 2023, primarily due to (i) increased professional and transaction fees to support strategic initiatives, including our acquisition of Stericycle; (ii) higher annual and long-term incentive compensation costs and (iii) an increase in risk management costs due to an increase in our large loss reserves as well as higher auto and workers compensation claims. This increase was partially offset by the impact of non-cash impairment charges for certain investments incurred in 2023, as discussed below.\nIncome from operations in Corporate and Other decreased in 2023, as compared with 2022, primarily due to impairment charges of (i) $107 million for certain investments in waste diversion technology businesses and (ii) $17 million to adjust an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary’s estimated potential share of the liability for a proposed environmental remediation plan at a closed site. \nInterest Expense, Net\nOur interest expense, net was $598 million, $500 million and $378 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in interest expense, net for 2024 is primarily related to an increase in our average debt balances to fund our acquisition of Stericycle. The increase in interest expense, net for 2023 is primarily related to an increase in our weighted average borrowing rate of approximately 80 basis points due to increased rates on floating-rate debt and higher fixed rates on refinancing as well as an increase in average debt balances to fund growth. Partially offsetting these increases were benefits from higher capitalized interest and increases in interest income as a result of higher cash and cash equivalent balances as well as higher investment rates. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our debt balances.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt, Net \nIn October 2024, we drew $5.2 billion of borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement that were applied to funding our acquisition of Stericycle. In November 2024, we repaid all outstanding borrowings with net proceeds from our November 2024 issuance of $5.2 billion of senior notes and contemporaneously terminated the Term Credit Agreement, resulting in a \n$7 million loss on early extinguishment of debt.\nEquity in Net Income (Losses) of Unconsolidated Entities\nWe recognized equity method investment income of $4 million in 2024 and losses of $60 million and $67 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. These financial statement impacts are largely related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. In 2024, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-02, and, as a result, beginning in 2024, the amortization of these investments is recognized as a component of income tax expense. Refer to Notes 2 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. We generate tax benefits, including tax credits, from the losses incurred from these investments. The losses are more than offset by the tax benefits generated by these investments as further discussed in Notes 8 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nIncome Tax Expense\nWe recorded income tax expense of $713 million, $745 million and $678 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, resulting in effective income tax rates of 20.6%, 24.7% and 23.2% for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The comparability of our income tax expense for the reported periods has been primarily affected by the following:\n61\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\nRenewable Natural Gas — \nThrough our subsidiaries, including our WM Renewable Energy segment, we have invested in building landfill gas-to-energy facilities in the U.S. and Canada that produce renewable electricity and RNG. We expect our new RNG facilities to qualify for federal tax credits and to realize those credits through 2027 under Sections 48 and 45Z of the Internal Revenue Code. We completed construction of five RNG facilities in 2024 and one RNG facility in 2023, resulting in a reduction to our income tax expense of $137 million and $8 million, respectively, for investment tax credits under Section 48 (additional information related to these tax credits is included below under the Tax Legislation section);\n●\nLow-Income Housing\n \n— As a result of adopting ASU 2023-02, we amortize our investments in these entities using the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the equity investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received. The amortization expense and the income tax credits are required to be presented on a net basis in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to fiscal year 2024, we accounted for our investments in these entities using the equity method of accounting, recognizing our share of each entity’s results of operations and other reductions in the value of our investments in equity in net income (losses) of unconsolidated entities, within our Consolidated Statements of Operations. W\ne recognized additional income tax expense of $78 million in 2024, related to amortization under ASU 2023-02. We recognized net losses of $66 million and $65 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively, and a reduction in our income tax expense of $104 million, $108 million and $99 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, primarily due to federal tax credits realized from these investments as well as the tax benefits from the pre-tax losses realized. \nSee Notes 2, 8, and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these unconsolidated variable interest entities;\n●\nTax Implications of Impairments\n — During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized additional income tax expense of $14 million and $50 million, respectively, due to non-cash impairment charges that were not deductible for tax purposes in the year of impairment. The non-cash impairment charge recognized during 2022 was deductible for tax purposes. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to our impairment charges; and\n●\nTax Legislation\n — The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) contains several tax-related provisions, including with respect to (i) alternative fuel tax credits; (ii) tax incentives for investments in renewable energy production, carbon capture, and other climate actions and (iii) the overall measurement of corporate income taxes. Given the complexity and uncertainty around the applicability of the legislation to our specific facts and circumstances, we continue to analyze the IRA provisions to identify and quantify potential opportunities and applicable benefits included in the legislation. The provisions of the IRA related to alternative fuel tax credits secure approximately $60 million of annual pre-tax benefit (recorded as a reduction in our operating expense) from tax credits in 2023 and 2024. The alternative fuel credit expired at the end of 2024 and will not provide any future benefit to the Company absent further legislative action. With respect to the investment tax credit, we expect the cumulative benefit to be between $300 million and $400 million, a large portion of which is anticipated to be realized in 2024 through 2026. The expected benefit from the investment tax credit for 2025 and 2026 is dependent on a number of estimates and assumptions, including the timing of project completion. Finally, we expect that the production tax credit incentives for investments in renewable energy and carbon capture, as expanded by the IRA, will likely result in an incremental benefit to the Company, although at this time, the anticipated amount of such benefit has not been quantified due, in part, to the lack of regulatory guidance. \nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information related to income taxes.\n62\n\n\nTable of Contents\nLandfill and Environmental Remediation Discussion and Analysis\nWe owned or operated 257 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2024 and 258 solid waste landfills and five secure hazardous waste landfills as of December 31, 2023.

Estimates of the amount of waste that can be placed in the future are reviewed annually by our engineers and are based on a number of factors, including standard engineering techniques and site-specific factors such as current and projected mix of waste type; initial and projected waste density; estimated number of years of life remaining; depth of underlying waste; anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. We continually focus on improving the utilization of airspace through efforts that may include recirculating landfill leachate where allowed by permit; optimizing the placement of daily cover materials and increasing initial compaction through improved landfill equipment, operations and training.\n(d)\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of converting remaining cubic yards of airspace to tons of capacity.\nThe depletable tons received at our landfills for the year ended December 31 are shown below (tons in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\n​\n    \n# of\n    \nDepletable\n    \nTons per\n    \n# of\n    \nDepletable\n    \nTons per\n​\n    \nSites\n    \nTons\n    \nDay\n    \nSites\n    \nTons\n    \nDay\nSolid waste landfills (a)\n \n 257\n​\n 124,271\n \n 456\n \n 258\n \n 122,141\n \n 450\nHazardous waste landfills\n \n 5\n \n 626\n \n 2\n \n 5\n \n 658\n \n 2\n​\n \n 262\n \n 124,897\n \n 458\n \n 263\n \n 122,799\n \n 452\nSolid waste landfills closed, divested or lease or other contractual agreement expired during related year\n \n —\n \n 113\n \n  \n \n —\n \n —\n \n  \n​\n \n  \n \n 125,010\n​\n  \n \n  \n \n 122,799\n​\n  \n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had 15 and 17 landfills, respectively, which were not accepting waste.\n63\n\n\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024, we owned or managed 239 sites that are either in closure or post-closure, have received a certification post-closure, or are regulated under a remedial action plan.\nBased on remaining permitted airspace as of December 31, 2024 and projected annual disposal volume, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all of our owned or operated landfills is approximately 38 years. Many of our landfills have the potential for expanded airspace beyond what is currently permitted. We monitor the availability of permitted airspace at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future disposal volume, disposal prices, construction and operating costs, remaining airspace and likelihood of obtaining an expansion permit. We are seeking expansion permits at 18 of our landfills that meet the expansion criteria outlined in the \nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions — Landfills \nsection below. Although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted or permitted as designed, the weighted average remaining landfill life for all owned or operated landfills is approximately 39 years when considering remaining permitted airspace, expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume.\nThe number of landfills owned or operated as of December 31, 2024, segregated by their estimated operating lives based on remaining permitted and expansion airspace and projected annual disposal volume, was as follows:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n # of Landfills\n​\n0 to 5 years\n \n 28\n​\n6 to 10 years\n \n 22\n​\n11 to 20 years\n \n 53\n​\n21 to 40 years\n \n 62\n​\n41+ years\n \n 97\n​\nTotal\n \n 262\n(a)\n(a)\nOf the 262 landfills, 221 are owned, 29 are operated under lease agreements and 12 are operated under other contractual agreements. For the landfills not owned, we are usually responsible for final capping, closure and post-closure obligations.\nLandfill Assets —\n We capitalize various costs that we incur to prepare a landfill to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property), permitting, excavation, liner material and installation, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, and on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities, which are discussed further below.\nThe changes to the cost basis of our landfill assets and accumulated landfill airspace depletion for the year ended December 31, 2024 are reflected in the table below (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n​\n​\n    \nAccumulated\n    \n​\nNet Book\n​\n​\nCost Basis of\n​\nLandfill Airspace\n​\n​\nValue of\n​\n    \nLandfill Assets\n    \nDepletion\n    \nLandfill Assets\nDecember 31, 2023\n​\n$\n 19,473\n​\n$\n (11,643)\n​\n$\n 7,830\nCapital additions\n​\n \n 832\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 832\nAsset retirement obligations incurred and capitalized\n​\n \n 91\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n 91\nDepletion of landfill airspace\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n (795)\n​\n \n (795)\nForeign currency translation\n​\n \n (100)\n​\n \n 47\n​\n \n (53)\nAsset retirements and other adjustments\n​\n \n (23)\n​\n \n 132\n​\n \n 109\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\n$\n 20,273\n​\n$\n (12,259)\n​\n$\n 8,014\n​\nAs of December 31, 2024, we estimate that we will spend approximately $845 million in 2025, and approximately $1.8 billion in 2026 and 2027 combined, for the construction and development of our landfill assets. The specific timing \n64\n\n\nTable of Contents\nof landfill capital spending is dependent on future events and spending estimates are subject to change due to fluctuations in landfill waste volumes, changes in environmental requirements and other factors impacting landfill operations.\nLandfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities —\n As we accept waste at our landfills, we incur significant asset retirement obligations, which include liabilities associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These liabilities are accounted for in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for asset retirement obligations and are discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We also have liabilities for the remediation of properties that have incurred environmental damage, which generally was caused by operations or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired operations or a site. We recognize environmental remediation liabilities when we determine that the liability is probable and the cost for the likely remedy can be reasonably estimated.\nThe changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 are reflected in the table below (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nEnvironmental\n​\n    \nLandfill\n    \nRemediation\nDecember 31, 2023\n​\n$\n 2,853\n​\n$\n 209\nObligations incurred and capitalized\n​\n \n 91\n  \n \n —\nObligations settled\n​\n \n (136)\n  \n \n (23)\nInterest accretion\n​\n \n 133\n  \n \n —\nRevisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions\n​\n \n 121\n  \n \n 36\nAcquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments \n​\n \n (5)\n  \n \n —\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\n$\n 3,057\n​\n$\n 222\n​\nLandfill Operating Costs —\n The following table summarizes our landfill operating costs for the year ended December 31 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nInterest accretion on landfill and environmental remediation liabilities\n​\n$\n 133\n​\n$\n 130\n​\n$\n 112\nLeachate and methane collection and treatment\n​\n \n 230\n​\n \n 196\n​\n \n 193\nLandfill remediation costs and discount rate adjustments to environmental remediation liabilities and recovery assets\n​\n \n 18\n​\n \n 7\n​\n \n (2)\nOther landfill site costs\n​\n \n 143\n​\n \n 120\n​\n \n 118\nTotal landfill operating costs\n​\n$\n 524\n​\n$\n 453\n​\n$\n 421\n​\nDepletion of Landfill Airspace\n — Depletion of landfill airspace, which is included as a component of depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, includes the following:\n●\nthe depletion of landfill capital costs, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) estimated future costs for landfill development and construction required to develop our landfills to their remaining permitted and expansion airspace; and\n●\nthe depletion of asset retirement costs arising from landfill final capping, closure and post-closure obligations, including (i) costs that have been incurred and capitalized and (ii) projected asset retirement costs.\nDepletion expense is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying cost as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the depletable basis of a landfill (net of accumulated depletion) by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace. Landfill capital costs and closure and post-closure asset retirement costs are generally incurred to support the operation of the landfill over its entire operating life and are, therefore, depleted on a per-ton basis using a landfill’s total permitted and expansion airspace. Final capping asset retirement costs are related to a specific final capping event and are, therefore, depleted on a per-ton basis using each discrete final capping event’s estimated permitted and expansion airspace. Accordingly, each landfill has multiple per-ton depletion rates.\n65\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents our landfill airspace depletion expense on a per-ton basis for the year ended December 31:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nDepletion of landfill airspace (in millions)\n​\n$\n 795\n​\n$\n 745\n​\n$\n 754\nTons received, net of redirected waste (in millions)\n​\n \n 125\n​\n \n 123\n​\n \n 125\nAverage landfill airspace depletion expense per ton\n​\n$\n 6.36\n​\n$\n 6.07\n​\n$\n 6.05\n​\nDifferent per-ton depletion rates are applied at each of our 262 landfills, and per-ton depletion rates vary significantly from one landfill to another due to (i) inconsistencies that often exist in construction costs and provincial, state and local regulatory requirements for landfill development and landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities and (ii) differences in the cost basis of landfills that we develop versus those that we acquire. Accordingly, our landfill airspace depletion expense measured on a per-ton basis can fluctuate due to changes in the mix of volumes we receive across the Company each year. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources \nThe Company consistently generates annual cash flow from operations that meets and exceeds our working capital needs, allows for payment of our dividends, investment in the business through capital expenditures and tuck-in acquisitions, and funding of strategic sustainability growth investments. We continually monitor our actual and forecasted cash flows, our liquidity and our capital resources, enabling us to plan for our present needs and fund unbudgeted business requirements that may arise during the year. The Company believes that its investment grade credit ratings, diverse investor base, large value of unencumbered assets and modest leverage enable it to obtain adequate financing, and refinance upcoming maturities, as necessary to meet its ongoing capital, operating, strategic and other liquidity requirements. We also have the ability to manage liquidity during periods of significant financial market disruption through temporary modification of our capital expenditure and share repurchase plans. \nSummary of Contractual Obligations \nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2024 (other than recorded obligations related to liabilities associated with environmental remediation costs and non-cancelable operating lease obligations, which are discussed further in Notes 3 and 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively) and the anticipated effect of these obligations on our liquidity in future years (in millions): \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n  \n2025\n  \n2026\n  \n2027\n  \n2028\n  \n2029\n  \nThereafter\n  \nTotal\nRecorded Obligations:\n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \nFinal capping, closure and post-closure liabilities (a)\n​\n$\n 177\n​\n$\n 223\n​\n$\n 265\n​\n$\n 197\n​\n$\n 166\n​\n$\n 3,762\n​\n$\n 4,790\nDebt payments (b)\n​\n \n 2,613\n​\n \n 747\n​\n \n 2,022\n​\n \n 1,969\n​\n \n 2,048\n​\n \n 14,680\n​\n \n 24,079\nUnrecorded Obligations:\n​\n \n​\n​\n \n  \n​\n \n  \n​\n \n  \n​\n \n  \n​\n \n  \n​\n \n​\nInterest on debt (c)\n​\n \n 928\n​\n \n 888\n​\n \n 838\n​\n \n 736\n​\n \n 647\n​\n \n 5,168\n​\n \n 9,205\nEstimated unconditional purchase obligations (d)\n​\n \n 274\n​\n \n 270\n​\n \n 142\n​\n \n 96\n​\n \n 68\n​\n \n 556\n​\n \n 1,406\nAnticipated liquidity impact as of December 31, 2024\n​\n$\n 3,992\n​\n$\n 2,128\n​\n$\n 3,267\n​\n$\n 2,998\n​\n$\n 2,929\n​\n$\n 24,166\n​\n$\n 39,480\n(a)\nIncludes liabilities for final capping, closure and post-closure costs recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024, without the impact of discounting and inflation.

We primarily use senior notes and tax-exempt bonds to borrow on a long-term basis, but we also use other instruments and facilities, when appropriate. The components of our borrowings as of December 31, 2024 are described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $4.0 billion of debt maturing within the next 12 months, including (i) $1.4 billion of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months, which is prior to their scheduled maturities; (ii) $1.2 billion of short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program (net of related discount on issuance); (iii) $422 million of 3.125% senior notes that mature in March 2025; (iv) $500 million of 0.750% senior notes that mature in November 2025 and (v) $438 million of other debt with scheduled maturities within the next 12 months, including $298 million of tax-exempt bonds. As of December 31, 2024, we have classified $2.6 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months as long term because we have the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our $3.5 billion long-term U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facility (“$3.5 billion revolving credit facility”). The remaining $1.4 billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months is classified as current obligations.\n67\n\n\nTable of Contents\nSenior Notes \n— In July 2024, WMI issued $750 million of 4.950% senior notes due July 2027 and $750 million of 4.950% notes due July 2031, the net proceeds of which were $1.49 billion. The net proceeds were used primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. We also repaid $156 million of WMI’s 3.500% senior notes upon maturity in May 2024. \n​\nIn August 2024, WMI entered into a delayed draw Term Credit Agreement in a principal amount of up to $7.2 billion (the “Term Credit Agreement”). In October 2024, we drew $5.2 billion of borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement that were applied to funding our acquisition of Stericycle. In November 2024, we repaid all outstanding borrowings and contemporaneously terminated the Term Credit Agreement, resulting in a $7 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n​\nIn November 2024, we issued senior notes, the net proceeds of which were approximately $5.2 billion, consisting of (i) $1.0 billion of 4.500% senior notes due March 2028; (ii) $700 million of 4.650% senior notes due March 2030; (iii) $750 million of 4.800% senior notes due March 2032; (iv) $1.5 billion of 4.950% senior notes due March 2035; and (v) $1.25 billion of 5.350% senior notes due October 2054. We used the net proceeds to repay all outstanding borrowing under the Term Credit Agreement.\n​\nStericycle Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation — \nOn November 8, 2024, we completed our private offer to eligible holders to exchange $500 million of outstanding 3.875% senior notes issued by Stericycle (the “Stericycle Notes”) for new notes issued by us (the “WM Notes”) and cash. The WM Notes have the same interest rate, interest payment dates, and maturity date as the exchanged Stericycle Notes but differ in certain respects from the Stericycle Notes, including with respect to the redemption provisions. Approximately $485 million in aggregate principal amount of the Stericycle Notes, or 97%, were tendered and accepted, and new WM Notes were issued. The portion of Stericycle Notes not exchanged, approximately $15 million, remains an outstanding obligation of Stericycle, our wholly-owned subsidiary. The debt exchange is accounted for as a modification of debt, as the financial terms of the WM Notes do not differ from the Stericycle Notes, and there is no substantial difference between the present value of cash flows under each respective set of notes. In connection with the exchange offer, we solicited and obtained sufficient consents to amend the Stericycle Notes and related indenture to eliminate substantially all the restrictive covenants, restrictive provisions and events of default, other than payment-related, guarantee-related and bankruptcy-related events of default, and such amendments took effect with respect to the remaining Stericycle Notes on November 8, 2024.\n​\nWe have credit lines in place to support our liquidity and financial assurance needs. The following table summarizes our outstanding letters of credit, categorized by type of facility as of December 31 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\nRevolving credit facility (a)\n​\n$\n 224\n​\n$\n 180\nOther letter of credit lines (b)\n​\n \n 862\n​\n \n 834\n​\n​\n$\n 1,086\n​\n$\n 1,014\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had an unused and available credit capacity of $2.1 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively.\n(b)\nAs of December 31, 2024, these other letter of credit lines are uncommitted with terms extending through December 2028. \nGuarantor Financial Information\nWM Holdings has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of WMI’s senior indebtedness. WMI has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of WM Holdings’ senior indebtedness. None of WMI’s other subsidiaries have guaranteed any of WMI’s or WM Holdings’ debt. In lieu of providing separate financial statements for the subsidiary issuer and guarantor (WMI and WM Holdings), we have presented the accompanying supplemental summarized combined balance sheet and income statement information for WMI and WM Holdings on a combined basis after elimination of intercompany transactions between WMI and WM Holdings and amounts related to investments in any subsidiary that is a non-guarantor (in millions):\n​\n68\n\n\nTable of Contents\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nDecember 31,\n2024\nBalance Sheet Information:\n​\n​\n​\nCurrent assets\n \n$\n 15\nNoncurrent assets\n​\n​\n 14\nCurrent liabilities\n​\n \n 1,367\nNoncurrent liabilities:\n​\n​\n​\nAdvances due to affiliates\n​\n​\n 15,328\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n​\n \n 20,140\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nYear Ended\n​\n​\nDecember 31, 2024\nIncome Statement Information:\n​\n​\n​\nRevenue\n \n$\n —\nOperating income\n​\n​\n (547)\nNet loss\n​\n​\n (405)\n​\n​\nSummary of Cash Flow Activity\nThe following is a summary of our cash flows for the year ended December 31 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n​\n$\n 5,390\n​\n$\n 4,719\n​\n$\n 4,536\nNet cash used in investing activities\n​\n$\n (10,601)\n​\n$\n (3,091)\n​\n$\n (3,063)\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n​\n$\n 5,155\n​\n$\n (1,524)\n​\n$\n (1,216)\n​\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities —\n \n \nOur operating cash flows increased in 2024, as compared with 2023, by $671 million primarily driven by (i) higher earnings in our Collection and Disposal businesses; (ii) favorable changes in working capital, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures and (iii) lower annual incentive compensation payments. This increase was partially offset by higher cash interest and income tax payments.\nOur operating cash flows increased in 2023, as compared with 2022, by $183 million primarily driven by higher earnings attributable to our Collection and Disposal businesses and lower income tax payments as a result of a deposit of approximately $103 million that was made to the IRS in 2022 related to a disputed tax matter discussed within Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These increases were partially offset by (i) unfavorable changes in working capital, net of effects of acquisitions and divestitures; (ii) higher interest payments and (iii) higher incentive compensation payments. \nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities —\n The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:\n●\nAcquisitions — \nOur spending on acquisitions was $7,503 million, $173 million and $377 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of which $7,488 million, $170 million and $377 million, respectively, are considered cash used in investing activities. The remaining spend is cash used in financing activity related to the timing of contingent consideration paid. Excluding our acquisition of Stericycle in 2024, substantially all of the remaining acquisitions are related to our solid waste and recycling businesses. \n●\nCapital Expenditures —\n We used $3,231 million, $2,895 million and $2,587 million for capital expenditures in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The increase in capital spending in 2024 is primarily driven by (i) our planned and ongoing investments in our Recycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy segments; (ii) an increase in truck spending in the current year due to supply chain constraints on truck deliveries in the prior year and (iii) capital expenditures within our WM Healthcare Solutions segment to support the business. The increase in 2023 is primarily driven by our planned and ongoing investments in our Recycling Processing and Sales and WM Renewable Energy segments, as well as \ninflationary increases in many fixed asset categories required to support ongoing operations and investments in the Company’s landfills to reduce greenhouse gas emissions\n.\n69\n\n\nTable of Contents\nThe Company continues to maintain a disciplined focus on capital management to prioritize investments for expansion, the replacement of aging assets and assets that support our strategy of differentiation and continuous improvement through efficiency and innovation. The Company expects to invest $3.0 billion in growth investments across the recycling and renewable energy platforms from 2022 to 2026, which includes the $1.7 billion already invested in 2023 and 2024.\n●\nDivestitures —\n Proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, net of cash divested, were $158 million, $78 million and $27 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, primarily as the result of the sale of certain non-strategic assets.\n●\nOther, Net —\n Our spending within other, net was $40 million, $104 million and $126 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we used $4 million, $61 million and $23 million, respectively, of cash from restricted cash and cash equivalents to invest in available-for-sale securities.\n \nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we used $33 million, $20 million and $28 million, respectively, to make initial cash payments associated with low-income housing investments. In 2022, we also used $67 million to fund secured convertible promissory notes associated with an acquisition.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities —\n The most significant items affecting the comparison of our financing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below:\n●\nDebt Borrowings (Repayments) — \nThe following summarizes our cash borrowings and repayments of debt for the year ended December 31 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nBorrowings\n:\n \n​\n  \n​\n​\n  \n​\n​\n  \nCommercial paper program\n \n$\n 12,678\n​\n$\n 17,799\n​\n$\n 6,596\nTerm loan (a)\n​\n​\n 5,200\n​\n​\n —\n​\n​\n 1,000\nSenior notes\n​\n​\n 6,650\n​\n​\n 3,207\n​\n​\n 992\nTax-exempt bonds\n​\n​\n 50\n​\n​\n 300\n​\n​\n 100\n​\n \n$\n 24,578\n​\n$\n 21,306\n​\n$\n 8,688\nRepayments\n:\n \n \n  \n​\n \n  \n​\n \n  \nCommercial paper program\n \n$\n (12,319)\n​\n$\n (18,709)\n​\n$\n (6,664)\nTerm loan (a)\n​\n​\n (5,200)\n​\n​\n (1,000)\n​\n​\n —\nSenior notes\n​\n​\n (156)\n​\n​\n (500)\n​\n​\n (500)\nTax-exempt bonds\n \n \n (60)\n​\n \n (65)\n​\n \n (71)\nOther debt\n \n \n (135)\n​\n \n (120)\n​\n \n (93)\n​\n \n$\n (17,870)\n​\n$\n (20,394)\n​\n$\n (7,328)\nNet cash borrowings (repayments)\n​\n$\n 6,708\n​\n$\n 912\n​\n$\n 1,360\n​\n(a)\nIn October 2024, we drew $5.2 billion of borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement that were applied to funding our acquisition of Stericycle. In November 2024, we repaid all outstanding borrowings and contemporaneously terminated the Term Credit Agreement. \nRefer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our debt borrowings and repayments.\n●\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program — \nFor the periods presented, all share repurchases have been made in accordance with financial plans approved by our Board of Directors. We allocated $262 million, $1,302 million and $1,500 million of available cash to common stock repurchases during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. In 2024, we announced our temporary suspension of share repurchase activity as a result of the acquisition of Stericycle. We expect to resume share repurchase once the Company’s leverage returns to targeted levels, which is currently projected to be about 18 months after the November 2024 acquisition of Stericycle. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our share repurchase activity.\n70\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\nCash Dividends — \nFor the periods presented, all dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors. Cash dividends declared and paid were $1,210 million in 2024, or $3.00 per common share, $1,136 million in 2023, or $2.80 per common share, and $1,077 million in 2022, or $2.60 per common share.\nIn December 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $0.75 to $0.825 per share for dividends declared in 2025. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans, growth and acquisitions and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.\n●\nExercise of Common Stock Options — \nThe exercise of common stock options generated financing cash inflows of $53 million, $44 million and $44 million from the exercise of 693,000, 597,000 and 675,000 of employee stock options during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n●\nOther, Net —\n In 2022, we acquired a controlling interest in a business engaged in accelerating film and plastic wrap recycling capabilities, and in the fourth quarter of 2024, we acquired the remaining minority interests in this business for $41 million.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe are presenting free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP measure of liquidity, in our disclosures because we use this measure in the evaluation and management of our business. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures, plus proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, net of cash divested. We believe it is indicative of our ability to pay our quarterly dividends, repurchase common stock, fund acquisitions and other investments and, in the absence of refinancings, to repay our debt obligations. Free cash flow is not intended to replace net cash provided by operating activities, which is the most comparable GAAP measure. We believe free cash flow gives investors useful insight into how we view our liquidity, but the use of free cash flow as a liquidity measure has material limitations because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to, such as declared dividend payments and debt service requirements.\nOur calculation of free cash flow and reconciliation to net cash provided by operating activities is shown in the table below for the year ended December 31 (in millions), and may not be calculated the same as similarly-titled measures presented by other companies:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nNet cash provided by operating activities \n​\n$\n 5,390\n​\n$\n 4,719\n​\n$\n 4,536\nCapital expenditures to support the business\n​\n​\n (2,281)\n​\n​\n (2,131)\n​\n​\n (2,026)\nCapital expenditures - sustainability growth investments (a)\n​\n​\n (950)\n​\n​\n (764)\n​\n​\n (561)\nTotal capital expenditures\n​\n \n (3,231)\n​\n \n (2,895)\n​\n \n (2,587)\nProceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, net of cash divested\n​\n \n 158\n​\n \n 78\n​\n \n 27\nFree cash flow\n​\n$\n 2,317\n​\n$\n 1,902\n​\n$\n 1,976\n(a)\nThese growth investments are intended to further our sustainability leadership position by increasing recycling volumes and growing renewable natural gas generation and we expect they will deliver circular solutions for our customers and drive environmental value to the communities we serve. \nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions \nIn preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, long-lived asset impairments, intangible asset impairments and the fair value of assets and liabilities \n71\n\n\nTable of Contents\nacquired in business combinations. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below and in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.\nLandfills \nAccounting for landfills requires that significant estimates and assumptions be made regarding (i) the cost to construct and develop each landfill asset; (ii) the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure asset retirement obligations, which must consider both the expected cost and timing of these activities and (iii) the determination of each landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace.\nLandfill Costs —\n We estimate the total cost to develop each of our landfill sites to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace. This estimate includes such costs as landfill liner material and installation, excavation for airspace, landfill leachate collection systems, landfill gas collection systems, environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas, directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. Additionally, landfill development includes all land purchases for the landfill footprint and landfill buffer property. The projection of these landfill costs is dependent, in part, on future events. The remaining depletable basis of each landfill includes costs to develop a site to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace and includes amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace depletion, and projections of future purchase and development costs.\nFinal Capping Costs —\n We estimate the cost for each final capping event based on the area to be capped and the capping materials and activities required. The estimates also consider when these costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. Our engineering personnel allocate landfill final capping costs to specific final capping events and the capping costs are depleted as waste is disposed of at the landfill. We review these costs annually, or more often if significant facts change. Changes in estimates, such as timing or cost of construction, for final capping events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed landfill, the adjustment to the asset must be depleted immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a final capping event at a landfill with remaining airspace, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace depletion.\nClosure and Post-Closure Costs —\n We base our estimates for closure and post-closure costs on our interpretations of permit and regulatory requirements for closure and post-closure monitoring and maintenance. The estimates for landfill closure and post-closure costs also consider when the costs are anticipated to be paid and factor in inflation and discount rates. The possibility of changing legal and regulatory requirements and the forward-looking nature of these types of costs make any estimation or assumption less certain. Changes in estimates for closure and post-closure events immediately impact the required liability and the corresponding asset. When the change in estimate relates to a fully consumed landfill, the adjustment to the asset must be depleted immediately through expense. When the change in estimate relates to a landfill with remaining airspace, the adjustment to the asset is recognized in income prospectively as a component of landfill airspace depletion.\nRemaining Permitted Airspace —\n Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.\nExpansion Airspace —\n We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely. Second, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years, in addition to meeting the following criteria:\n●\nPersonnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals;\n72\n\n\nTable of Contents\n●\nWe have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan;\n●\nThere are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and\n●\nFinancial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets Company criteria for investment.\nThese criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer on a quarterly basis. \nWhen we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the depletable basis of the landfill.\nOnce the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will consider several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.\nAfter determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton depletion rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change.\nIt is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower earnings may be experienced due to higher depletion rates or higher expenses; or higher earnings may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher depletion expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.\nEnvironmental Remediation Liabilities\nA significant portion of our operating costs and capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of environmental protection. The nature of our operations, particularly with respect to the construction, operation and maintenance of our landfills subjects us to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. In addition to remediation activity required by state or local authorities, such liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations. The costs associated with these liabilities can include settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as incremental internal and external costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up. \n73\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWhere it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then either developed using our internal resources or by third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:\n●\nManagement’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites;\n●\nInformation available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation;\n●\nThe number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and\n●\nThe typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined.\nRefer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our environmental liabilities.\nFair Value of Nonfinancial Assets and Liabilities\nSignificant estimates are made in determining the fair value of long-lived tangible and intangible assets (i.e., property and equipment, intangible assets and goodwill) during the impairment evaluation process. In addition, the majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are required to be recognized at fair value under the relevant accounting guidance.\nFair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable.\nProperty and Equipment, Including Landfills and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets —\n We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Fair value is generally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.\nThe assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded.\n74\n\n\nTable of Contents\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill —\n At least annually using a measurement date of October 1, and more frequently if warranted, we assess the indefinite-lived intangible assets including the goodwill of our reporting units for impairment using Level 3 inputs.\nWe first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the assessment indicates a possible impairment, we complete a quantitative review, comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value was less than its carrying amount. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach using Level 3 inputs. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.\nAcquisitions\n — In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid for an acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. When we are in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in an acquisition, there can be subsequent adjustments to our estimates of fair value and resulting preliminary purchase price allocation. Generally, the valuation of our acquired asset and liabilities rely on complex estimates and assumptions.\nAcquisition-date fair value estimates are revised as necessary if, and when, additional information regarding these contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Subsequent to finalization of purchase accounting, these revisions are accounted for as adjustments to income from operations. All acquisition-related transaction costs are expensed as incurred. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to our acquisitions.\nSee Item 7. \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n —\n (Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net\n. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to Asset Impairments and Unusual Items.\nInflation\nVariability in economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, employment trends, and supply chain reliability, can create risk and uncertainty in financial outlook. We take proactive steps to recover and mitigate inflationary cost pressures through our overall pricing efforts and by managing our costs through efficiency, labor productivity, and investments in technology to automate certain aspects of our business. These efforts may not be successful for various reasons including the pace of inflation, operating cost inefficiencies, market responses, and contractual limitations, such as the timing lag in our ability to recover increased costs under certain contracts that are tied to a price escalation index with a lookback provision.\nRefer to",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. \nRisk Factors\n for further discussion. \nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. \nIn the normal course of business, we are exposed to market risks, including changes in interest rates, certain commodity prices and currency rates. From time to time, we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks. As of December 31, 2024, our outstanding derivatives were immaterial.\n75\n\n\nTable of Contents\nInterest Rate Exposure —\n Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financing activities. As of December 31, 2024, we had $24.1 billion of long-term debt, excluding the impacts of accounting for debt issuance costs, discounts and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives. We have $2.7 billion of debt that is exposed to changes in market interest rates within the next 12 months comprised primarily of (i) $1.3 billion of short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program and (ii) $1.4 billion of tax-exempt bonds with term interest rate periods that expire within the next 12 months. We currently estimate that a 100-basis point increase in the interest rates of our outstanding variable-rate debt obligations would increase our 2024 interest expense by $19 million.\nOur remaining outstanding debt obligations have fixed interest rates through either the scheduled maturity of the debt or, for certain of our fixed-rate tax-exempt bonds, through the end of a term interest rate period that exceeds 12 months. The fair value of our fixed-rate debt obligations can increase or decrease significantly if market interest rates change.\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk-sensitive debt instruments. This analysis is inherently limited because it reflects a singular, hypothetical set of assumptions. Actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions. An instantaneous, 100-basis point increase in interest rates across all maturities attributable to these instruments would have decreased the fair value of our debt by approximately $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nWe are also exposed to interest rate market risk from our cash and cash equivalent balances, as well as assets held in restricted trust fund accounts. These assets are generally invested in high-quality, liquid instruments including money market funds that invest in U.S. government obligations with original maturities of three months or less. We believe that our exposure to changes in fair value of these assets due to interest rate fluctuations is insignificant as the fair value generally approximates our cost basis. We also invest a portion of our restricted trust fund account balances in available-for-sale securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, municipal securities, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, which generally mature over the next ten years, as well as equity securities.\nCommodity Price Exposure —\n In the normal course of our business, we are subject to operating agreements that expose us to market risks arising from changes in the prices for commodities such as diesel fuel, electricity (and related renewable energy credits) and recycled materials, including old corrugated cardboard and plastics. We work to manage these risks through operational strategies that focus on capturing our costs in the prices we charge our customers for the services provided. Accordingly, as the market prices for these commodities increase or decrease, our revenues, operating costs and margins may also increase or decrease. Recycling revenues attributable to yield increased $245 million and decreased $308 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, as compared with the prior year periods. While recycling commodity prices have recovered in 2024 from the low levels experienced in 2023, commodity values are still below prices seen at the beginning of 2022. Average market prices for single-stream recycled commodities were up 50% and down 40% in 2024 and 2023, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. Variability in commodity prices can also impact the margins of our business as certain components of our revenue are structured as a pass through of costs, including recycling brokerage and fuel surcharges. \nIn recent years, we have discussed our sustainability growth strategy that includes significant planned and ongoing investments in our WM Renewable Energy segment. We have invested, and continue to invest, in facilities to capture methane produced from the Company’s landfills and process it into RNG and electricity. RNG produced from our landfills constitutes a significant source of fuel allocated to our natural gas collection vehicles. The primary drivers of renewable fuel development at our landfills are tax policies, such as the federal tax credits for RNG production and renewable electricity generation under the IRA, and federal and state incentive programs, such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) program, California Low Carbon Fuel Standard and similar state programs that promote the production and use of renewable transportation fuels. At the federal level, oil refiners and importers are required through the RFS program to blend specified volumes of various categories of renewable transportation fuels with gasoline or buy credits, referred to as Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”), from renewable fuel producers. Many of our facilities are EPA-registered producers of transportation fuel making compressed and liquefied RNG from landfill biogas, which qualifies as a cellulosic biofuel under the RFS program. The Company has invested, and continues to invest, in facilities that capture and process landfill gas into RNG so that we can participate in the RFS program, and the Company has grown and stated its intention to continue to grow its asset base to increase its RNG production.\n76\n\n\nTable of Contents\nRINs prices generally respond to regulations enacted by the EPA, as well as fluctuations in supply and demand. The value of the RINs is set through a market established by the RFS program, which market has historically been very volatile. Prior to 2022, the EPA had promulgated rules on an annual basis establishing refiners’ obligations to purchase RNG and other cellulosic biofuels under the RFS program, which introduced a level of uncertainty into the renewable fuels and RINs market. However, in 2023, the EPA issued a highly anticipated rule establishing biofuel blending volumes under the RFS program for compliance years 2023 through 2025. The rule reflected the outsized role of biogas under the program, delivered on many reforms that benefit the solid waste sector, and recognized the continued growth of the market for RNG in vehicle applications. However, we cannot be certain that these changes, or the outcome of pending litigation challenging various aspects of the rule, will ultimately reduce volatility in the RINs market or that future rulemakings will be similarly favorable to our business. The new U.S. presidential administration could seek to reduce existing renewable fuel targets in a new rulemaking or otherwise set reduced targets for renewable fuels under the RFS program in future rulemakings. Moreover, consistent with its prior approach, the new administration may also increase the frequency with which it grants small refinery exemptions from RFS program requirements. While we cannot predict what actions the new administration may take with respect to the RFS program, any changes to existing or future renewable fuel targets or more frequent approval of requests for small refinery exemptions could have a significant negative impact on demand for renewable fuels and the value of RINs. In an effort to mitigate against such risk and stabilize our RNG portfolio, we are pursuing long-term sales transactions in the voluntary market. We continue to advocate for policies that could reduce the potential for volatility in the RINs market and ensure long-term stability for renewable transportation fuels, as changes in the RINs market or the structure of the RFS program can and has impacted the financial performance of our facilities. Such changes could impact or alter our projected future investments, and such investments may not yield the results anticipated. Revenue in our WM Renewable Energy segment attributable to yield increased $26 million and decreased $73 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods, primarily driven by the fluctuations in energy and RIN market prices.\nThe Company’s sustainability growth strategy also is informed by the increased adoption of state and Canadian clean fuel standard programs, utility policies, and voluntary market demand for RNG in transportation and industrial applications. Clean fuel standard programs, originally developed in California and subsequently adopted in Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico, establish annual carbon intensity benchmarks for transportation fuels that decrease over time. These programs operate similar to the RFS program in that certain regulated parties purchase credits from fuel producers, including RNG producers, to meet their carbon intensity obligations. Like RINs, clean fuel standard program credit values can fluctuate with policy and market dynamics. As such, we are advocating for existing programs to adopt measures to promote stability in credit pricing and for other states to adopt similar programs that incentivize the growth in RNG. We also are working closely with stakeholders to encourage the voluntary market for RNG demand, including utility RNG procurement programs, and sustainability protocols, as companies and other customers increasingly look to reduce their GHG emissions profiles. However, these state and voluntary programs may be altered, paused, or otherwise revoked by the applicable governmental authorities or as result of legal challenges.  \n​\nCurrency Rate Exposure —\n Our operations are primarily in the U.S. but we also have significant operations in Canada and certain countries in Europe. Additionally, we have certain support functions in India. Where significant, we have quantified and described the impact of foreign currency translation on components of income, including operating revenues and operating expenses. However, the impact of foreign currency has not materially affected our results of operations. \n​\n77\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nINDEX TO\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n​\n    \nPage\nReports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n (PCAOB ID \n42\n)\n​\n79\nConsolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\n​\n84\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n​\n85\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n​\n85\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n​\n86\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Equity for the Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n​\n87\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n​\n88\n​\n​\n​\n78\n\n\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Waste Management, Inc.\n​\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Waste Management, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Waste Management, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\n​\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Stericycle, Inc., which is included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 13.0% of total assets, excluding goodwill, as of December 31, 2024 and approximately 1.8% of consolidated operating revenues, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Stericycle, Inc.\n​\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company, and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n​\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n​\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n​\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n​\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  \n​\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n​\n​\n​\n/s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 19, 2025\n​\n​\n79\n\n\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Waste Management, Inc.\n​\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Waste Management, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n​\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 19, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n​\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n​\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n​\nCritical Audit Matters \nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n​\n80\n\n\nTable of Contents\n​\n​\n​\n​\nLandfill Depletion\n​\nDescription of the Matter\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company’s landfill assets, net of accumulated depletion, totaled $8.0 billion and the associated depletion expense for 2024 was $795 million. As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, the Company updates the estimates used to calculate individual landfill depletion rates at least annually, or more often if significant facts change. Landfill depletion rates are used in the computation of landfill depletion expense.\n​\nAuditing landfill depletion rates and related depletion expense is complex due to the highly judgmental nature of assumptions used in estimating the rates. Significant assumptions used in the calculation of the rates include: estimated future development costs associated with the construction and retirement of the landfill, estimated remaining permitted and expansion airspace, and airspace utilization factors.\n​\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over determining landfill depletion rates and calculating depletion expense. Our audit procedures included, among others, testing controls over: the Company’s process for evaluating and updating the significant assumptions used in the development of the landfill depletion rates, management’s review of those significant assumptions, and the mathematical accuracy of the calculation and recording of depletion expense. \n​\nTo test the landfill asset depletion rates, our audit procedures included, among others, assessing methodologies used by the Company and testing the significant assumptions discussed above, inclusive of the underlying data used by the Company in its development of these assumptions. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to historical trends and, when available, to comparable size landfills accepting a similar type of waste. Regarding expansion airspace, we evaluated the Company’s criteria for inclusion in remaining airspace. In addition, we considered the professional qualifications and objectivity of management’s internal engineers responsible for developing the assumptions. We involved EY engineering specialists to assist with the evaluation of the Company’s landfill future development cost and airspace assumptions. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the historical data utilized in the development of the landfill depletion rates.\n​\n81\n\n\nTable of Contents\n​\n​\nLandfill – Final Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs\nDescription of the Matter\nAt December 31, 2024, the carrying value of the Company’s landfill asset retirement obligations related to final capping, closure and post-closure costs totaled $3.1 billion. As discussed in Note 2 of the financial statements, the Company updates the estimates used to measure the asset retirement obligations annually, or more often if significant facts change.\n​\nAuditing the landfill asset retirement obligation is complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the assumptions used in the measurement process. Significant assumptions include: estimated future costs associated with the capping, closure and post closure activities at each specific landfill, airspace consumed to date in relation to total estimated permitted and expansion airspace and the projected remaining landfill life.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the calculation of landfill asset retirement obligations. Our audit procedures included, among others, testing the Company’s controls over the landfill asset retirement obligation estimation process and management’s review of the significant assumptions used in the estimation of the liability, including the amount and timing of retirement costs.\n​\nTo test the landfill asset retirement obligation valuation, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies used by the Company, testing the completeness of activities included in the estimate (e.g., gas monitoring and extraction), and testing the significant assumptions discussed above, inclusive of the underlying data used by the Company in its development of these assumptions. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to historical trends and, when available, to comparable size landfills accepting the same type of waste. In addition, we considered the professional qualifications and objectivity of management’s internal engineers responsible for developing the assumptions. We involved EY engineering specialists to assist us with these procedures. Specifically, we utilized the EY engineering specialists to evaluate the reasons for significant changes in assumptions from the historical trend, and to determine whether the change from the historical trend was appropriate and identified timely. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the historical data utilized in preparing the estimate.\n​\n​\n​\nAcquisition of Stericycle, Inc. – Valuation of Customer Relationships\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Stericycle, Inc. (“Stericycle”) for purchase consideration of approximately $6.9 billion, of which $2.3 billion was allocated to customer relationships. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination.\n​\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Stericycle was complex due to the significant estimation uncertainty in determining the fair value of certain customer relationships included within Other intangible assets. The Company valued the customer relationships using an income approach; specifically, the multi-period excess earnings model. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the fair value to underlying assumptions, including projected revenue, attrition rate, EBITDA margin, and discount rate. These significant assumptions are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\n​\n82\n\n\nTable of Contents\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company’s controls over the purchase price allocation process. We tested management’s review controls over the significant assumptions described above along with the completeness and accuracy of the data used in the fair value estimates.\n​\nTo test the estimated fair value of the customer relationships, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the significant assumptions described above used to develop the prospective financial information and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. We involved our valuation specialists to assist with evaluating the methodology and significant assumptions used by the management to determine the fair value estimates. We compared the significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, the assumptions used by the Company to value similar assets in other acquisitions, as well as historical results of the Company's business and other guideline companies within the same industry. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the significant assumptions to evaluate the change in the estimated fair value of the customer relationships resulting from changes in the assumptions.\n​\n​\n​\n​\n/s/ \nERNST & YOUNG LLP\n​\n​\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\n​\n​\n​\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 19, 2025\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n83\n\n\nTable of

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYears Ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n1.    Basis of Presentation\nThe financial statements presented in this report represent the consolidation of Waste Management, Inc., a Delaware corporation; its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries; and certain variable interest entities for which Waste Management, Inc. or its subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries as described in Note 18. Waste Management, Inc. is a holding company and all operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. When the terms “the Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are used in this document, those terms refer to Waste Management, Inc., together with its consolidated subsidiaries and consolidated variable interest entities. When we use the term “WMI,” we are referring only to Waste Management, Inc., the parent holding company.\nWe are North America’s leading provider of comprehensive environmental solutions, providing services throughout the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada. We partner with our customers and the communities we serve to manage and reduce waste at each stage from collection to disposal, while recovering valuable resources and creating clean, renewable energy. Our solid waste business is operated and managed locally by our subsidiaries that focus on distinct geographic areas and provide collection, transfer, disposal, recycling and resource recovery services. Through our subsidiaries, including our Waste Management Renewable Energy (“WM Renewable Energy”) segment, we are also a leading developer, operator and owner of landfill gas-to-energy facilities in the U.S. and Canada that produce renewable electricity and renewable natural gas, which is a significant source of fuel that we allocate to our natural gas fleet.\nOn November 4, 2024, we completed our acquisition of all outstanding shares of Stericycle, Inc. (“Stericycle”), the operations of which are presented in this report as our new WM Healthcare Solutions segment. The acquisition expands our offerings in the U.S. and Canada and adds operations in parts of Western Europe. These businesses provide Regulated Waste and Compliance Services (“RWCS”) and Secure Information Destruction (“SID”) services that protect people and brands, promote health and well-being and safeguard the environment. Refer to Note 17 for further discussion.\nOur senior management evaluates, oversees and manages the financial performance of our business through \nfive\n reportable segments, referred to as (i) Collection and Disposal - East Tier (“East Tier”); (ii) Collection and Disposal - West Tier (“West Tier”); (iii) Recycling Processing and Sales; (iv) WM Renewable Energy and (v) WM Healthcare Solutions. Our East and West Tiers along with certain ancillary services (“Other Ancillary”) that are not managed through our Tier segments, but that support our collection and disposal operations, form our “Collection and Disposal” businesses. We also provide additional services not managed through our \nfive\n reportable segments, which are presented as Corporate and Other. Refer to Note 19 for further discussion.\nReclassifications\nWhen necessary, reclassifications have been made to our prior period financial information to conform to the current year presentation and are not material to our consolidated financial statements. \n​\n​\n2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of WMI, its wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities for which we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary. In the opinion of management, these Consolidated Financial Statements include all adjustments, which, unless otherwise disclosed, are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for the periods presented. All material intercompany \n88\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in unconsolidated entities are accounted for under the appropriate method of accounting.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nIn preparing our financial statements, we make numerous estimates and assumptions that affect the accounting for and recognition and disclosure of assets, liabilities, equity, revenues and expenses. We must make these estimates and assumptions because certain information that we use is dependent on future events, cannot be calculated with precision from available data or simply cannot be calculated. In some cases, these estimates are difficult to determine, and we must exercise significant judgment. In preparing our financial statements, the most difficult, subjective and complex estimates and the assumptions that present the greatest amount of uncertainty relate to our accounting for landfills, environmental remediation liabilities, long-lived asset impairments, intangible asset impairments and the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations. Each of these items is discussed in additional detail below. Actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase and is stated at cost, which approximates market value.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, investments held within restricted funds, and accounts receivable. We make efforts to control our exposure to credit risk associated with these instruments by (i) placing our assets and other financial interests with a diverse group of credit-worthy financial institutions; (ii) holding high-quality financial instruments while limiting investments in any one instrument and (iii) maintaining strict policies over credit extension that include credit evaluations, credit limits and monitoring procedures, although generally we do not have collateral requirements for credit extensions. We also control our exposure associated with trade receivables by discontinuing service, to the extent allowable, to non-paying customers. However, our overall credit risk associated with trade receivables is limited due to the large number and diversity of customers we serve. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no single customer represented greater than 5% of total accounts receivable.\nAccounts and Other Receivables \nOur receivables, which are recorded when billed, when services are performed or when cash is advanced, are claims against third parties that will generally be settled in cash. The carrying value of our receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents the estimated net realizable value. We estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection trends; type of customer, such as municipal or commercial; the age of outstanding receivables and existing as well as expected economic conditions. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that specific receivable balances may be impaired, further consideration is given to the collectability of those balances and the allowance is adjusted accordingly. Past-due receivable balances are written off when our collection efforts have been unsuccessful. Also, we recognize interest income on long-term interest-bearing notes receivable as the interest accrues under the terms of the notes. We no longer accrue interest once the notes are deemed uncollectible.\n89\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nThe following table reflects the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts of trade receivables for the year ended December 31 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\nBalance as of January 1\n​\n$\n \n30\n​\n$\n \n26\nAdditions charged to expense\n​\n \n \n65\n​\n \n \n53\nAccounts written-off, net of recoveries\n​\n \n (\n55\n)\n​\n \n (\n58\n)\nAcquisitions, divestitures and other, net\n​\n \n \n125\n​\n \n \n9\nBalance as of December 31\n​\n$\n \n165\n​\n$\n \n30\n​\nTo determine the allowance for doubtful accounts for trade receivables, we rely upon, among other factors, historical loss trends, the age of outstanding receivables, and existing as well as expected economic conditions, and we believe that all of our trade receivables share similar risk characteristics. We monitor our credit exposure on an ongoing basis and assess whether assets in the pool continue to display similar risk characteristics. Our acquisition of Stericycle introduced a new mix of customers which we believe generally share similar risk characteristics with our existing trade receivables; however, Stericycle has and continues to encounter certain billing and collection delays. The Company determined that a portion of the acquired Stericycle receivables have experienced more-than-insignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination, as of the acquisition date. As a result, a gross allowance for doubtful accounts of trade receivables was recognized in the amount of $\n130\n million as of the acquisition date of November 4, 2024. Based on aging analysis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately \n85\n% and \n90\n%, respectively, of our trade receivables were outstanding less than \n60 days\n. \nTo determine the allowance for doubtful accounts for other receivables, as well as loans and other instruments, we rely primarily on credit ratings and associated default rates based on the maturity of the instrument. Other receivables, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, include receivables related to income tax payments in excess of our current income tax obligations of $\n255\n million and $\n120\n million, respectively. Other receivables as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 also include a receivable of $\n46\n million and $\n26\n million, respectively, related to alternative fuel tax credits. Based on an aging analysis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, approximately \n65\n% and \n50\n%, respectively, of our other receivables were due within 12 months or less.\nParts and Supplies\nParts and supplies consist primarily of spare parts, fuel, tires, lubricants and processed recycling materials. Our parts and supplies are stated at the lower of cost (using the average cost method) or market.\nLandfill Accounting\nCost Basis of Landfill Assets —\n We capitalize various costs that we incur to make a landfill ready to accept waste. These costs generally include expenditures for land (including the landfill footprint and required landfill buffer property); permitting; excavation; liner material and installation; landfill leachate collection systems; landfill gas collection systems; environmental monitoring equipment for groundwater and landfill gas; and directly related engineering, capitalized interest, on-site road construction and other capital infrastructure costs. The cost basis of our landfill assets also includes asset retirement costs, which represent estimates of future costs associated with landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities. These costs are discussed below.\n90\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nFinal Capping, Closure and Post-Closure Costs —\n Following is a description of our asset retirement activities and our related accounting:\n●\nFinal Capping —\n Generally involves the installation of flexible membrane liners and geosynthetic clay liners, drainage and compacted soil layers and topsoil over areas of a landfill where total airspace has been consumed. Final capping asset retirement obligations are recorded on a units-of-consumption basis as airspace is consumed related to the specific final capping event with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset. Each final capping event is accounted for as a discrete obligation and recorded as an asset and a liability based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with each final capping event.\n●\nClosure —\n Includes the construction of the final portion of methane gas collection systems (when required), demobilization and routine maintenance costs. These are costs incurred after the site ceases to accept waste, but before the landfill is certified as closed by the applicable regulatory agency. These costs are recorded as an asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset. Closure obligations are recorded over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing closure activities.\n●\nPost-Closure —\n Involves the maintenance and monitoring of a landfill site that has been certified closed by the applicable regulatory agency. Generally, we are required to maintain and monitor landfill sites for a 30-year period. These maintenance and monitoring costs are recorded as an asset retirement obligation as airspace is consumed over the life of the landfill with a corresponding increase in the landfill asset. Post-closure obligations are recorded over the life of the landfill based on estimates of the discounted cash flows associated with performing post-closure activities.\nWe develop our estimates of these obligations using input from our operations personnel, engineers and accountants. Our estimates are based on our interpretation of current requirements and are intended to approximate fair value. Absent quoted market prices, the estimate of fair value is based on the best available information, including the results of present value techniques. In many cases, we contract with third parties to fulfill our obligations for final capping, closure and post-closure. We use historical experience, professional engineering judgment and quoted or actual prices paid for similar work to determine the fair value of these obligations. We are required to recognize these obligations at market prices whether we plan to contract with third parties or perform the work ourselves. In those instances where we perform the work with internal resources, the incremental profit margin realized is recognized as a component of operating income when the work is completed.\nOnce we have determined final capping, closure and post-closure costs, we inflate those costs to the expected time of payment and discount those expected future costs back to present value. As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we inflated these costs in current dollars to the expected time of payment using an inflation rate of \n2.50\n%, for each year. We discounted these costs to present value using the credit-adjusted, risk-free rate effective at the time an obligation is incurred, consistent with the expected cash flow approach. Any changes in expectations that result in an upward revision to the estimated cash flows are treated as a new liability and discounted at the current rate while downward revisions are discounted at the historical weighted average rate of the recorded obligation. As a result, the credit-adjusted, risk-free discount rate used to calculate the present value of an obligation is specific to each individual asset retirement obligation. The weighted average rate applicable to our long-term asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2024 was approximately \n4.8\n%.\nWe record the estimated fair value of final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities for our landfills based on the airspace consumed through the current period. The fair value of final capping obligations is developed based on our estimates of the airspace consumed to date for each final capping event and the expected timing of each final capping event. The fair value of closure and post-closure obligations is developed based on our estimates of the airspace consumed to date for the entire landfill and the expected timing of each closure and post-closure activity. Because these obligations \n91\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nare measured at estimated fair value using present value techniques, changes in the estimated cost or timing of future final capping, closure and post-closure activities could result in a material change in these liabilities, related assets and results of operations. We assess the appropriateness of the estimates used to develop our recorded balances annually, or more often if significant facts change.\nSustained changes in inflation rates or the estimated costs, timing or extent of future final capping, closure and post-closure activities typically result in both (i) a current adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill asset and (ii) a change in liability and asset amounts to be recorded prospectively over either the remaining permitted and expansion airspace (as defined below) of the related discrete final capping event or the remaining permitted and expansion airspace of the landfill, as appropriate. Any changes related to the capitalized and future cost of the landfill assets are then recognized in accordance with our landfill depletion policy, which would generally result in depletion expense being recognized prospectively over the remaining permitted and expansion airspace of the final capping event or the remaining permitted and expansion airspace of the landfill, as appropriate. Changes in such estimates associated with a fully consumed landfill result in an adjustment to the recorded liability and landfill assets with an immediate corresponding adjustment to landfill airspace depletion expense.\nInterest accretion on final capping, closure and post-closure liabilities is recorded using the effective interest method and is recorded as landfill operating costs, which is included in operating expenses within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDepletion of Landfill Assets —\n The depletable basis of a landfill includes (i) amounts previously expended and capitalized, net of accumulated airspace depletion; (ii) capitalized landfill final capping, closure and post-closure costs, net of accumulated airspace depletion; (iii) projections of future purchase and development costs required to develop the landfill site to its remaining permitted and expansion airspace (as defined below) and (iv) projected asset retirement costs related to landfill final capping, closure and post-closure activities.\nDepletion is recorded on a units-of-consumption basis, applying expense as a rate per ton. The rate per ton is calculated by dividing each component of the depletable basis of a landfill by the number of tons needed to fill the corresponding asset’s airspace. For landfills that we do not own, but operate through lease or other contractual agreements, the rate per ton is calculated based on expected airspace to be utilized over the lesser of the contractual term of the underlying agreement or the life of the landfill.\nWe apply the following guidelines in determining a landfill’s remaining permitted and expansion airspace:\n●\nRemaining Permitted Airspace —\n Our engineers, in consultation with third-party engineering consultants and surveyors, are responsible for determining remaining permitted airspace at our landfills. The remaining permitted airspace is determined by an annual survey, which is used to compare the existing landfill topography to the expected final landfill topography.\n●\nExpansion Airspace —\n We also include currently unpermitted expansion airspace in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace in certain circumstances. First, for unpermitted airspace to be initially included in our estimate of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we must believe that obtaining the expansion permit is likely. Second, we must generally expect the initial expansion permit application to be submitted within one year and the final expansion permit to be received within five years, in addition to meeting the following criteria:\n●\nPersonnel are actively working on the expansion of an existing landfill, including efforts to obtain land use and local, state or provincial approvals;\n●\nWe have a legal right to use or obtain land to be included in the expansion plan;\n92\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\n●\nThere are no significant known technical, legal, community, business, or political restrictions or similar issues that could negatively affect the success of such expansion; and\n●\nFinancial analysis has been completed based on conceptual design, and the results demonstrate that the expansion meets Company criteria for investment.\nThese criteria are evaluated by our field-based engineers, accountants, managers and others to identify potential obstacles to obtaining the permits. Once the unpermitted airspace is included, our policy provides that airspace may continue to be included in remaining permitted and expansion airspace even if certain of these criteria are no longer met as long as we continue to believe we will ultimately obtain the permit, based on the facts and circumstances of a specific landfill. In these circumstances, continued inclusion must be approved through a landfill-specific review process that includes approval by our Chief Financial Officer on a quarterly basis. Of the \n18\n landfill sites with expansions included as of December 31, 2024, \none\n landfill required the Chief Financial Officer to approve the inclusion of the unpermitted airspace because the permit application process did not meet the \none\n- or \nfive-year\n requirements.\nWhen we include the expansion airspace in our calculations of remaining permitted and expansion airspace, we also include the projected costs for development, as well as the projected asset retirement costs related to final capping, closure and post-closure of the expansion in the depletable basis of the landfill.\nOnce the remaining permitted and expansion airspace is determined in cubic yards, an airspace utilization factor (“AUF”) is established to calculate the remaining permitted and expansion capacity in tons. The AUF is established using the measured density obtained from previous annual surveys and is then adjusted to account for future settlement. The amount of settlement that is forecasted will consider several site-specific factors including current and projected mix of waste type, initial and projected waste density, estimated number of years of life remaining, depth of underlying waste, anticipated access to moisture through precipitation or recirculation of landfill leachate and operating practices. In addition, the initial selection of the AUF is subject to a subsequent multi-level review by our engineering group and the AUF used is reviewed on a periodic basis and revised as necessary. Our historical experience generally indicates that the impact of settlement at a landfill is greater later in the life of the landfill when the waste placed at the landfill approaches its highest point under the permit requirements.\nAfter determining the costs and remaining permitted and expansion capacity at each of our landfills, we determine the per ton rates that will be expensed as waste is received and deposited at the landfill by dividing the costs by the corresponding number of tons. We calculate per ton depletion rates for each landfill for assets associated with each final capping event, for assets related to closure and post-closure activities and for all other costs capitalized or to be capitalized in the future. These rates per ton are updated annually, or more often, as significant facts change.\nIt is possible that actual results, including the amount of costs incurred, the timing of final capping, closure and post-closure activities, our airspace utilization or the success of our expansion efforts could ultimately turn out to be significantly different from our estimates and assumptions. To the extent that such estimates, or related assumptions, prove to be significantly different than actual results, lower earnings may be experienced due to higher depletion rates or higher expenses; or higher earnings may result if the opposite occurs. Most significantly, if it is determined that expansion capacity should no longer be considered in calculating the recoverability of a landfill asset, we may be required to recognize an asset impairment or incur significantly higher depletion expense. If at any time management makes the decision to abandon the expansion effort, the capitalized costs related to the expansion effort are expensed immediately.\nEnvironmental Remediation Liabilities\nA significant portion of our operating costs and capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of environmental protection. The nature of our operations, particularly with respect to the construction, operation and maintenance of our landfills, subjects us to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws \n93\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nand regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. In addition to remediation activity required by state or local authorities, such liabilities include potentially responsible party (“PRP”) investigations. The costs associated with these liabilities can include settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as incremental internal and external costs directly associated with site investigation and clean up. \nWhere it is probable that a liability has been incurred, we estimate costs required to remediate sites based on site-specific facts and circumstances. We routinely review and evaluate sites that require remediation and determine our estimated cost for the likely remedy based on a number of estimates and assumptions. Next, we review the same type of information with respect to other named and unnamed PRPs. Estimates of the costs for the likely remedy are then developed using our internal resources, third-party environmental engineers or other service providers. Internally developed estimates are based on:\n●\nManagement’s judgment and experience in remediating our own and unrelated parties’ sites;\n●\nInformation available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation;\n●\nThe number, financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other PRPs who may be liable for remediation of a specific site; and\n●\nThe typical allocation of costs among PRPs, unless the actual allocation has been determined.\nEstimating our degree of responsibility for remediation is inherently difficult. We recognize and accrue for an estimated remediation liability when we determine that such liability is both probable and reasonably estimable. Determining the method and ultimate cost of remediation requires that a number of assumptions be made. There can sometimes be a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with the likely site remediation alternatives identified in the environmental impact investigation. In these cases, we use the amount within the range that is our best estimate. If no amount within a range appears to be a better estimate than any other, we use the amount that is the low end of such range. If we used the high ends of such ranges (where estimable), our aggregate potential liability would be approximately $\n9\n million higher than the $\n222\n million recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024. Our ultimate responsibility may differ materially from current estimates. It is possible that technological, regulatory or enforcement developments, the results of environmental studies, the inability to identify other PRPs, the inability of other PRPs to contribute to the settlements of such liabilities, or other factors could require us to record additional liabilities. Our ongoing review of our remediation liabilities, in light of relevant internal and external facts and circumstances, could result in revisions to our accruals that could cause upward or downward adjustments to our balance sheet and income from operations. These adjustments could be material in any given period.\nWe record our obligations on an undiscounted basis unless we are aware of a material environmental liability where we believe that both the amount and timing of the payments are fixed or reliably determinable.  \nProperty and Equipment (exclusive of landfills, discussed above)\nWe record property and equipment at cost. Expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and maintenance activities are expensed as incurred. We depreciate property and equipment over the estimated useful life of the asset using the straight-line method. We generally assume no salvage value for our depreciable property and equipment. When property and equipment are retired, sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from our accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in results of operations as an offset or increase to operating expense for the period.\n94\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nThe estimated useful lives for significant property and equipment categories are as follows (in years):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nUseful Lives\nVehicles — excluding rail haul cars\n \n3\n to \n10\nVehicles — rail haul cars\n \n10\n to \n30\nMachinery and equipment (a)\n \n3\n to \n30\nBuildings and improvements\n \n5\n to \n40\nFurniture, fixtures and office equipment\n \n3\n to \n10\n(a)\nIncludes recycling and renewable natural gas (“RNG”) facilities and WM Healthcare Solutions autoclaves and incinerators as well as containers.\nLeases\nWe lease property and equipment in the ordinary course of our business. Our operating lease activities primarily consist of leases for real estate, landfills, fleet vehicles and operating equipment. Our financing lease activities primarily consist of leases for operating equipment, railcars and landfill assets. Our leases have varying terms. Some may include renewal or purchase options, escalation clauses, restrictions, penalties or other obligations that we consider in determining minimum lease payments. The leases are classified as either operating leases or financing leases, as appropriate. \nOperating Leases (excluding landfill leases discussed below) —\n The majority of our leases are operating leases. This classification generally can be attributed to either (i) relatively low fixed minimum lease payments as a result of real property lease obligations that vary based on the volume of waste we receive or process or (ii) minimum lease terms that are much shorter than the assets’ economic useful lives. Management expects that in the normal course of business our operating leases will be renewed, replaced by other leases or replaced with fixed asset expenditures. \nFinancing Leases (excluding landfill leases discussed below) —\n Assets under financing leases are capitalized using interest rates determined at the commencement of each lease and are depreciated over either the useful life of the asset or the lease term, as appropriate, on a straight-line basis. The present value of the related lease payments is recorded as a debt obligation. \nLandfill Leases —\n From an operating perspective, landfills that we lease are similar to landfills we own because generally we will operate the landfill for the life of the operating permit. The most significant portion of our rental obligations for landfill leases is contingent upon operating factors such as disposal volume and often there are no contractual minimum rental obligations. Contingent rental obligations are expensed as incurred. For landfill financing leases that provide for minimum contractual rental obligations, we record the present value of the minimum obligation as part of the landfill asset, which is depleted on a units-of-consumption basis over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the landfill. \nFor operating and financing leases, including landfill leases, our rent expense for each of the last three years and future minimum lease payments are disclosed in Note 7.\nAcquisitions\nWe generally recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, including contingent assets and liabilities, based on fair value estimates as of the date of acquisition.\nContingent Consideration — \nIn certain acquisitions, we agree to pay additional amounts to sellers contingent upon achievement by the acquired businesses of certain negotiated goals, such as targeted revenue levels, targeted disposal \n95\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nvolumes or the issuance of permits for expanded landfill airspace. We have recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations based on their estimated fair value as of the date of acquisition with any differences between the acquisition date fair value, subsequent remeasurements and the ultimate settlement of the obligations being recognized as an adjustment to income from operations. Refer to Note 11 for adjustments recognized during the reported periods.\nAcquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities — \nAssets and liabilities arising from contingencies such as pre-acquisition environmental matters and litigation are recognized at their acquisition-date fair value when their respective fair values can be determined. Acquired contingencies whose fair value is not determinable during the measurement period are recognized only if they are probable and reasonably estimable. \nAcquisition-date fair value estimates are revised as necessary if, and when, additional information regarding these contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Subsequent to finalization of purchase accounting, these revisions are accounted for as adjustments to income from operations. All acquisition-related transaction costs are generally expensed as incurred. During 2024, we acquired Stericycle which is included in our new WM Healthcare Solutions segment. We also acquired 11 solid waste and recycling businesses. See Note 17 for additional information related to our acquisitions.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is the excess of our purchase cost over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We do not amortize goodwill, but as discussed in the \nLong-Lived Asset Impairments\n section below, we assess our goodwill for impairment at least annually.\nOther intangible assets consist primarily of customer and supplier relationships, covenants not-to-compete, licenses, permits (other than landfill permits, which are combined with landfill tangible assets and depleted per our landfill depletion policy), trade names and other contracts. Other intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the acquisition date and are generally amortized using either a 150% declining balance approach or a straight-line basis as we determine appropriate. Customer and supplier relationships are typically amortized over terms of \n10\n to \n15 years\n. Covenants not-to-compete are amortized over the term of the non-compete covenant, which is generally \nfive years\n. Definite-lived intangibles are amortized over their useful lives on a straight-line basis while indefinite-lived intangibles are not amortized. Licenses, permits and other contracts are amortized over the definitive terms of the related agreements. If the underlying agreement does not contain definitive terms and the useful life is determined to be indefinite, the asset is not amortized.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairments\nWe assess our long-lived assets for impairment as required under the applicable accounting standards. If necessary, impairments are recorded in (gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nProperty and Equipment, Including Landfills and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\n — We monitor the carrying value of our long-lived assets for potential impairment on an ongoing basis and test the recoverability of such assets generally using significant unobservable (“Level 3”) inputs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances, including management decisions pertaining to such assets, are referred to as impairment indicators. If an impairment indicator occurs, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we will determine whether an impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which we can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, we measure any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset or asset group to its carrying value and the difference is recorded in the period that the impairment indicator occurs. Fair value is \n96\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\ngenerally determined by considering (i) internally developed discounted projected cash flow analysis of the asset or asset group; (ii) third-party valuations and/or (iii) information available regarding the current market for similar assets. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from the cash flows eventually realized, which could impact our ability to accurately assess whether an asset has been impaired.\nThe assessment of impairment indicators and the recoverability of our capitalized costs associated with landfills and related expansion projects require significant judgment due to the unique nature of the waste industry, the highly regulated permitting process and the sensitive estimates involved. During the review of a landfill expansion application, a regulator may initially deny the expansion application although the expansion permit is ultimately granted. In addition, management may periodically divert waste from one landfill to another to conserve remaining permitted landfill airspace, or a landfill may be required to cease accepting waste, prior to receipt of the expansion permit. However, such events occur in the ordinary course of business in the waste industry and do not necessarily result in impairment of our landfill assets because, after consideration of all facts, such events may not affect our belief that we will ultimately obtain the expansion permit. As a result, our tests of recoverability, which generally make use of a probability-weighted cash flow estimation approach, may indicate that no impairment loss should be recorded.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill —\n At least annually using a measurement date of October 1, and more frequently if warranted, we assess our indefinite-lived intangible assets, including the goodwill of our reporting units, for impairment.\nWe first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the assessment indicates a possible impairment, we complete a quantitative review, comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. An impairment charge is recognized if the asset’s estimated fair value is less than its carrying amount. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach using Level 3 inputs. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units’ expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly-traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units’ earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units.\nFair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable.\nRefer to Note 11 for information related to impairments recognized during the reported periods. \nInsured and Self-Insured Claims\nWe have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our health and welfare, general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. For our self-insured portions, the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial valuation or internal estimates. The gross estimated liability associated with settling unpaid claims is included in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets if expected to be settled within one year; otherwise, it is included in other long-term liabilities. Estimated \n97\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\ninsurance recoveries related to recorded liabilities are reflected as other current receivables or other long-term assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets when we believe that the receipt of such amounts is probable.\nWe use a wholly-owned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. We continue to maintain conventional insurance policies with third-party insurers. WMI pays an annual premium to the insurance captive on behalf of WMI and its insured subsidiaries, typically in the first quarter of the year, for estimated losses based on an external actuarial analysis. These premiums are held in a restricted funds account to be used solely for paying insurance claims, resulting in a transfer of risk from our Company to the insurance captive, and are allocated between current and long-term assets depending on estimated timing of the use of funds.\nRestricted Funds \nOur restricted funds accounts primarily consist of funds deposited for purposes of funding insurance claims and settling landfill final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. These funds are generally allocated between cash, money market funds, equity securities and available-for-sale debt securities depending on the estimated timing and purpose of the use of funds. We use a wholly-owned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for certain claims programs\n \nand the premiums paid are directly deposited into a restricted funds account to be used solely for paying insurance claims. At several of our landfills, we provide financial assurance by depositing cash into restricted trust funds for purposes of settling final capping, closure, post-closure and environmental remediation obligations. Balances maintained in these restricted funds accounts will fluctuate based on (i) changes in statutory requirements; (ii) future deposits made to comply with contractual arrangements; (iii) the ongoing use of funds; (iv) acquisitions or divestitures and (v) changes in the fair value of the financial instruments held in the restricted funds accounts. \nSee Notes 16 and 18 for additional discussion related to restricted funds accounts for final capping, closure, post-closure or environmental remediation obligations.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities \nAs a result of adopting ASU 2023-02 in 2024, our investments in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties are accounted for using the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the equity investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received. Investments in unconsolidated entities over which the Company has significant influence are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Equity investments in which the Company does not have the ability to exert significant influence over the investees’ operating and financing activities are measured using a quantitative approach as these investments do not have readily determinable fair values. The quantitative approach, or measurement alternative, is equal to its cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The following table summarizes our investments in unconsolidated entities as of December 31 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\nEquity method investments\n​\n$\n \n86\n​\n$\n \n538\nInvestments qualifying for proportional amortization method (a)\n​\n​\n \n707\n​\n​\n —\nInvestments without readily determinable fair values\n​\n \n \n53\n​\n​\n \n68\nInvestments in unconsolidated entities\n​\n$\n \n846\n​\n$\n \n606\n(a)\nAs discussed above, our low-income housing investments are accounted for using the proportional amortization method. Prior to 2024, these investments were included as equity method investments.\n98\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nWe monitor and assess the carrying value of our investments throughout the year for potential impairment and write them down to their fair value when other-than-temporary declines exist. Fair value is generally based on (i) other third-party investors’ recent or pending transactions in the securities; (ii) other information available regarding the current market for similar assets; (iii) a market or income approach, as deemed appropriate and/or (iv) a quantitative approach, or measurement alternative, as noted above. Impairments of our investments are recorded in (gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in accordance with appropriate accounting guidance.\nRefer to Note 11 for information related to impairments and other adjustments recognized during the reported periods. \nDerivative Instruments \nAt times we use derivative instruments to manage risk. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedged item must expose us to risk and the related derivative instrument must reduce the exposure to that risk and meet specific hedge documentation requirements related to designation dates, expectations for hedge effectiveness and the probability that hedged future transactions will occur as forecasted. We formally designate derivative instruments as hedges and document and assess their effectiveness at inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter. Forecasted transactions are evaluated for the probability of occurrence.\nWe are required to recognize derivative instruments at fair value as either assets or liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets unless such instruments meet certain normal purchase/normal sale criteria. For derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, we designate them as cash flow hedges. The change in the fair value of a cash flow hedge is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and is reclassified to earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings. See Note 6 for additional information regarding our derivative instruments.\nForeign Currency\nOur operations are primarily in the U.S. but we also have significant operations in Canada and certain countries in Western Europe. Additionally, we have certain support functions in India. Local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies of our operations and investments outside the U.S. The assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate during the period. The resulting translation difference is reflected as a component of other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Foreign currency translation adjustments have primarily been impacted by fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate and to a lesser extent, the U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rates and the U.S. dollar/British pound sterling exchange rate. \nThe U.S. dollar/Canadian dollar exchange rate was \n1.4384\n at December 31, 2024, \n1.3243\n at December 31, 2023 and \n1.3554\n at December 31, 2022. The U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rate was \n0.9659\n at December 31, 2024. The U.S. dollar/British pound sterling exchange rate was \n0.7990\n at December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 12 for information regarding the impacts of foreign currency on our comprehensive income and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generally recognize revenue as services are performed or products are delivered. For example, revenue typically is recognized as waste is collected; tons are received at our landfills, transfer stations or processing facilities; or recycling and other commodities, such as RNG, electricity and capacity, Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) and Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”), are sold. Compliance services revenues are recognized over the contractual service period. We also bill for certain services prior to performance. Such services include, among others, certain commercial \n99\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nand residential contracts, and equipment rentals. These advanced billings are included in deferred revenues and recognized as revenue in the period service is provided.\nOur Collection and Disposal operating revenues are primarily generated from fees charged for our collection, transfer and disposal. Revenues from our collection operations are influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type of collection equipment furnished, type and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to the disposal facility or recycling facility and our disposal costs. Revenues from our landfill operations consist of tipping fees, which are generally based on the type and weight or volume of waste being disposed of at our disposal facilities. Fees charged at transfer stations are generally based on the weight or volume of waste deposited, considering our cost of loading, transporting and disposing of the solid waste at a disposal site. The fees we charge for our services generally include applicable fees, such as our energy surcharge, which are intended to pass through to customers direct and indirect costs incurred.\nRecycling Processing and Sales revenues generally consist of tipping fees and the sale of recycling commodities to and/or on behalf of third parties. \nOur WM Renewable Energy revenue is primarily generated from (i) the sale of captured and converted landfill methane gas; (ii) the sale of RINs under the Renewable Fuel Standard (“RFS”) program implemented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”); (iii) sale of Low Carbon Fuel credits designed to stimulate the use of low-carbon fuels and (iv) the sale of energy (electricity and capacity) and associated RECs.\nOur WM Healthcare Solutions revenue is primarily generated from (i) RWCS, which provide collection, processing and disposal of regulated and specialized waste, including medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste, and compliance programs and (ii) SID services, which provides for the collection of personal and confidential information for secure destruction and recycling of sorted office paper. The customers typically enter into a contract for the provision of services on a weekly, monthly or as-needed basis over the contract term. We receive fees based on a monthly, quarterly or annual rate and/or fees based on contractual rates depending on measures including the volume, weight, and type of waste, as specified in applicable contracts.\nSee Note 19 for additional information related to revenue by reportable segment and major lines of business. \nDeferred Revenues\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance and classify them as current since they are earned within a year and there are no significant financing components. Substantially all our deferred revenues during the reported periods are realized as revenues within \none\n to \nthree months\n, when the related services are performed.\nContract Acquisition Costs\nOur incremental direct costs of obtaining a contract, which consist primarily of sales incentives, are generally deferred and amortized to selling, general and administrative expense over the estimated life of the relevant customer relationship, ranging from \nfive\n to \n13 years\n. Contract acquisition costs that are paid to the customer are deferred and amortized as a reduction in revenue over the contract life. Our contract acquisition costs are classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when we expect to recognize amortization and are included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $\n218\n million and $\n207\n million of deferred contract costs, respectively, of which $\n154\n million and $\n148\n million, respectively, were related to deferred sales incentives. During each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we amortized $\n28\n million, $\n26\n million and $\n24\n million, respectively, of sales incentives to selling, general and administrative expense.\n100\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nLong-Term Contracts\nApproximately \n25\n% of our total revenue is derived from contracts with a remaining term greater than one year. The consideration for these contracts is primarily variable in nature. The variable elements of these contracts primarily include the number of homes and businesses served, weight, number of containers served and annual rate changes based on consumer price index, fuel prices or other operating costs. Such contracts are generally within our collection, recycling and other lines of business and have a weighted average remaining contract life of approximately \nfour years\n. We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for these contracts as our right to consideration corresponds directly to the value provided to the customer for services completed to date and all future variable consideration is allocated to wholly unsatisfied performance obligations.\nEnvironmental Credits \nWe generate environmental credits through our production and sale of renewable energy. Our operating costs are associated with the production of renewable energy. The environmental credits are a form of government incentive generated through our renewable energy production and not as a result of the physical attributes of our production. The environmental credits are able to be separated and sold independent of the renewable energy produced. Thus, no cost is allocated to the environmental credit when it is generated.\nCapitalized Interest\nWe capitalize interest on certain projects under development, including landfill expansion projects, certain assets under construction, including operating landfills and landfill gas-to-energy projects and internal-use software. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, total interest costs were $\n728\n million, $\n590\n million and $\n425\n million, respectively, of which $\n84\n million, $\n63\n million and $\n29\n million were capitalized in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income tax in the U.S., Canada and within parts of Western Europe. Current tax obligations associated with our income tax expense are reflected in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of accrued liabilities and our deferred tax obligations are reflected in deferred income taxes.\nDeferred income taxes are based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax expense represents the change during the reporting period in the deferred tax assets and liabilities, net of the effect of acquisitions and dispositions. Deferred tax assets include tax loss and credit carry-forwards and are reduced by a valuation allowance if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We establish reserves for uncertain tax positions when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that certain positions may be challenged and potentially disallowed. When facts and circumstances change, we adjust these reserves through our income tax expense.\nShould interest and penalties be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts would be accrued and classified as a component of our income tax expense in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSee Note 8 for discussion of our income taxes.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe estimate the amount of potential exposure we may have with respect to claims, assessments and litigation in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for contingencies. We are party to pending or threatened legal \n101\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nproceedings covering a wide range of matters in various jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict the outcome of litigation, as it is subject to many uncertainties. Additionally, it is not always possible for management to make a meaningful estimate of the potential loss or range of loss associated with such contingencies. See Note 10 for discussion of our commitments and contingencies.\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information \nThe following table shows supplemental cash flow information for the year ended December 31 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nInterest, net of capitalized interest\n​\n$\n \n530\n​\n$\n \n447\n​\n$\n \n348\nIncome taxes\n​\n \n \n656\n​\n \n \n636\n​\n \n \n736\nAccrued capital expenditures\n​\n \n \n620\n​\n \n \n508\n​\n \n \n564\n​\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had $\n474\n million, $\n276\n million and $\n225\n million, respectively, of non-cash financing activities primarily from our low-income housing investments and new financing leases. These are discussed further in Notes 6 and 8. Additionally, we had approximately $\n20\n million, $\n25\n million and $\n135\n million of non-cash investing activities related to non-cash consideration transferred as part of our acquisitions in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 17 for further discussion of our acquisitions. \n​\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards in 2024\nInvestments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method \nIn March 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-02, “Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method\" (“ASU 2023-02”), which allows reporting entities the option to use the proportional amortization method to account for equity investments made primarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and other income tax benefits when certain requirements are met. For public business entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, including interim periods within those fiscal years. In 2024, the Company adopted ASU 2023-02 on a modified retrospective basis. The amended guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 8 for further discussion of our low-income housing investments.\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”) which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 was effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 for the year ended 2024 and accordingly, our segment disclosures for years 2023 and 2022 have been retrospectively recast under this guidance. See Note 19 for further discussion of our segments.\n​\n​\n102\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\n3.    Landfill and Environmental Remediation Liabilities\nLiabilities for landfill and environmental remediation costs as of December 31 are presented in the table below (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n2024\n​\n2023\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nEnvironmental\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nEnvironmental\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \nLandfill\n    \nRemediation\n    \nTotal\n    \nLandfill\n    \nRemediation\n    \nTotal\nCurrent (in accrued liabilities)\n \n$\n \n177\n​\n$\n \n54\n​\n$\n \n231\n​\n$\n \n143\n​\n$\n \n31\n​\n$\n \n174\nLong-term\n​\n \n \n2,880\n​\n \n \n168\n​\n \n \n3,048\n  \n \n \n2,710\n​\n \n \n178\n​\n \n \n2,888\n​\n \n$\n \n3,057\n​\n$\n \n222\n​\n$\n \n3,279\n​\n$\n \n2,853\n​\n$\n \n209\n​\n$\n \n3,062\n​\nThe changes to landfill and environmental remediation liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 are reflected in the table below (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nEnvironmental\n​\n    \nLandfill\n    \nRemediation\nDecember 31, 2023\n​\n$\n \n2,853\n​\n$\n \n209\nObligations incurred and capitalized\n​\n \n \n91\n  \n \n —\nObligations settled\n​\n \n (\n136\n)\n  \n \n (\n23\n)\nInterest accretion\n​\n \n \n133\n  \n \n —\nRevisions in estimates and interest rate assumptions\n​\n \n \n121\n  \n \n \n36\nAcquisitions, divestitures and other adjustments \n​\n \n (\n5\n)\n  \n \n —\nDecember 31, 2024\n​\n$\n \n3,057\n​\n$\n \n222\n​\nOur recorded liabilities as of December 31, 2024 include the impacts of inflating certain of these costs based on our expectations of the timing of cash settlement. \n4.    Property and Equipment \nProperty and equipment as of December 31 consisted of the following (in millions): \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\nLand\n​\n$\n \n873\n​\n$\n \n772\nLandfills\n​\n \n \n20,273\n​\n \n \n19,473\nVehicles \n​\n \n \n7,065\n​\n \n \n6,581\nMachinery and equipment (a)\n​\n \n \n5,757\n​\n \n \n4,989\nContainers \n​\n \n \n3,369\n​\n \n \n3,104\nBuildings and improvements \n​\n \n \n5,210\n​\n \n \n4,266\nFurniture, fixtures and office equipment \n​\n​\n \n570\n​\n​\n \n609\n​\n​\n \n \n43,117\n​\n \n \n39,794\nLess: Accumulated depreciation of tangible property and equipment \n​\n \n (\n11,518\n)\n​\n \n (\n11,183\n)\nLess: Accumulated depletion of landfill airspace\n​\n \n (\n12,259\n)\n​\n​\n (\n11,643\n)\nProperty and equipment, net (b)\n​\n$\n \n19,340\n​\n$\n \n16,968\n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, includes (i) \n$\n1.7\n billion and \n$\n1.5\n billion, respectively, related to recycling facilities and (ii) \n$\n834\n million and \n$\n720\n million, respectively, related to RNG facilities.

As discussed in Note 2, we perform our annual impairment test of goodwill balances for our reporting units using a measurement date of October 1. We will also perform interim tests if an impairment indicator exists. In 2023, as a result of a longer-than-anticipated ramp toward full scale and profitability of a business engaged in accelerating film and plastic wrap recycling capabilities, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n168\n million, with $\n22\n million attributable to noncontrolling interests. This charge was partially offset by the recognition of $\n46\n million of income related to the reversal of a liability for contingent consideration associated with our investment in such business for the year ended December 31, 2023. This net charge was reflected in our financial statements as part of our Recycling Processing and Sales segment. Fair value of the business was estimated using an income approach based on long-term projected discounted future cash flows of the reporting unit. The $\n4,184\n million increase in goodwill during 2024 is primarily related to our acquisition of Stericycle. There were \nno\n impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets as of December 31, 2024. See Notes 11 and 17 for additional information.\nGoodwill is included within each segment’s total assets. For segment reporting purposes, our recycling facilities and recycling brokerage services are included within our Recycling Processing and Sales segment.

As of December 31, 2024, we have classified $\n2.6\n billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months as long-term because we have the intent and ability to refinance these borrowings on a long-term basis as supported by the forecasted available capacity under our $\n3.5\n billion long-term U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facility (“$3.5 billion revolving credit facility”). The remaining $\n1.4\n billion of debt maturing in the next 12 months is classified as current obligations. \nAccess to and Utilization of Credit Facilities, Term Credit Agreement and Commercial Paper Program\nTerm Credit Agreement up to $7.2 Billion\n \n—\n On August 28, 2024, the Company entered into a delayed draw Term Credit Agreement in a principal amount of up to \n$\n7.2\n billion (the “Term Credit Agreement”). \nIn October 2024, we drew $\n5.2\n billion of borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement that were applied to funding our acquisition of Stericycle. In November 2024, we repaid all outstanding borrowings and contemporaneously terminated the Term Credit Agreement\n.\n$3.5 Billion Revolving Credit Facility —\n In May 2024, we amended and restated our $3.5 billion U.S. and Canadian revolving credit facility, extending the term through May 2029. The agreement includes a $\n1.0\n billion accordion feature that may be used to increase total capacity in future periods, and we have the option to request up to two one-year extensions. Waste Management of Canada Corporation and WM Quebec Inc., each an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI, are borrowers under the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and the agreement permits borrowing in Canadian dollars up to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $\n375\n million, with such borrowings to be repaid in Canadian dollars. WM Holdings, Inc. (“WM Holdings”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of WMI, guarantees all the obligations under the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. \n​\nThe $3.5 billion revolving credit facility provides us with credit capacity to be used for cash borrowings, to support letters of credit and to support our commercial paper program. The interest rates we pay on outstanding U.S. or Canadian loans are based on a secured overnight financing rate administered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“SOFR”) or the Canadian Overnight Repo Rate Average (“CORRA”) administered by the Bank of Canada, respectively, plus a spread depending on our senior public debt rating assigned by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. and Standard and Poor’s Global Ratings. The spread above SOFR or CORRA can range from \n0.585\n% to \n1.025\n% per annum, plus applicable credit adjustments. We also pay certain other fees set forth in the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility agreement, including a facility fee based on the aggregate commitment, regardless of usage. As of December 31, 2024, we had \nno\n outstanding borrowings under this facility. We had $\n1.2\n billion of outstanding borrowings (net of related discount on issuance) under our commercial paper program and $\n224\n million of letters of credit issued, both supported by the facility, leaving unused and available credit capacity of $\n2.1\n billion as of December 31, 2024.\nCommercial Paper Program\n — We have a commercial paper program that enables us to borrow funds for up to \n397 days\n at competitive interest rates. The rates we pay for outstanding borrowings are based on the term of the notes. The commercial paper program is fully supported by our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024, we had $\n1.2\n billion of outstanding borrowings (net of related discount on issuance) under our commercial paper program. \nOther Letter of Credit Lines —\n As of December 31, 2024, we had utilized $\n862\n million of other uncommitted letter of credit lines with terms extending through December 2028.\n106\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nDebt Borrowings and Repayments \nCommercial Paper Program\n — During the year ended December 31, 2024 we made cash repayments of $\n12.3\n billion, which were partially offset by $\n12.7\n billion of cash borrowings (net of related discount on issuance). A portion of these borrowings were repaid with proceeds from our senior notes issuances discussed below.\nSenior Notes \n— In July 2024, WMI issued $\n750\n million of \n4.950\n% senior notes due July 2027 and $\n750\n million of \n4.950\n% notes due July 2031, the net proceeds of which were $\n1.49\n billion. The net proceeds were used primarily to reduce outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. We also repaid $\n156\n million of WMI’s \n3.500\n% senior notes upon maturity in May 2024.\n​\nIn November 2024, we issued senior notes, the net proceeds of which were approximately $\n5.2\n billion, consisting of (i) $\n1.0\n billion of \n4.500\n% senior notes due March 2028; (ii) $\n700\n million of \n4.650\n% senior notes due March 2030; (iii) $\n750\n million of \n4.800\n% senior notes due March 2032; (iv) $\n1.5\n billion of \n4.950\n% senior notes due March 2035 and (v) $\n1.25\n billion of \n5.350\n% senior notes due October 2054. We used the net proceeds to repay all outstanding borrowing under the Term Credit Agreement.  \n​\nTerm Credit Agreement \n- In October 2024, we drew \n$\n5.2\n billion of borrowings under the Term Credit Agreement that were applied to funding our acquisition of Stericycle. In November 2024, we repaid all outstanding borrowings with net proceeds from our November 2024 issuance of \n$\n5.2\n billion of senior notes and contemporaneously terminated the Term Credit Agreement, resulting in a \n$\n7\n million loss on early extinguishment of debt.\n \nStericycle Exchange Offer and Consent Solicitation \n– On November 8, 2024, we completed our private offer to eligible holders to exchange $\n500\n million of outstanding \n3.875\n% senior notes issued by Stericycle (the “Stericycle Notes”) for new notes issued by us (the “WM Notes”) and cash. The WM Notes have the same interest rate, interest payment dates, and maturity date as the exchanged Stericycle Notes but differ in certain respects from the Stericycle Notes, including with respect to the redemption provisions. Approximately $\n485\n million in aggregate principal amount of the Stericycle Notes, or \n97\n%, were tendered and accepted, and new WM Notes were issued. The portion of Stericycle Notes not exchanged, approximately $\n15\n million, remains an outstanding obligation of Stericycle, our wholly-owned subsidiary. The debt exchange is accounted for as a modification of debt, as the financial terms of the WM Notes do not differ from the Stericycle Notes, and there is no substantial difference between the present value of cash flows under each respective set of notes. In connection with the exchange offer, we solicited and obtained sufficient consents to amend the Stericycle Notes and related indenture to eliminate substantially all the restrictive covenants, restrictive provisions and events of default, other than payment-related, guarantee-related and bankruptcy-related events of default, and such amendments took effect with respect to the remaining Stericycle Notes on November 8, 2024. \nTax-Exempt Bonds —\n We issued $\n50\n million of tax-exempt bonds in 2024. The proceeds from the issuance of these bonds were deposited directly into a restricted trust fund to be used for the specific purpose for which the money was raised, which is generally to finance expenditures for solid waste disposal, recycling and renewable natural gas facility construction and development. In 2024, we also repaid $\n60\n million of our tax-exempt bonds with available cash at their scheduled maturities.\nFinancing Leases and Other —\n The increase in our financing leases and other debt obligations in 2024 are primarily related to (i) a note payable associated with our low-income housing investment discussed in Note 8, which increased our debt obligations by $\n316\n million and (ii) $\n153\n million primarily related to non-cash financing leases. The increase in our debt obligations was partially offset by $\n135\n million of cash repayments of debt at maturity.\n \n107\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nScheduled Debt Payments\nPrincipal payments of our debt for the next five years and thereafter, based on scheduled maturities are as follows: $\n2,613\n million in 2025, $\n747\n million in 2026, $\n2,022\n million in 2027, $\n1,969\n million in 2028, $\n2,048\n million in 2029 and $\n14,680\n million thereafter. Our recorded debt and financing lease obligations include non-cash adjustments associated with debt issuance costs, discounts and fair value adjustments attributable to terminated interest rate derivatives, which have been excluded from these amounts because they will not result in cash payments. As discussed above, we have the intent and ability to refinance our commercial paper borrowings on a long-term basis. See Note 7 below for further discussion of our financing lease arrangements.\nSecured Debt\nOur debt balances are generally unsecured, except for financing lease obligations and the notes payable associated with our investments in low-income housing properties. See Notes 8 and 18 for additional information related to these investments.\nDebt Covenants\n \nThe terms of certain of our financing arrangements require that we comply with financial and other covenants. Our most restrictive financial covenant is the one contained in our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, which sets forth a maximum total debt to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization ratio (the “Leverage Ratio”). This covenant requires that the Leverage Ratio for the preceding four fiscal quarters will not be more than \n3.75\n to 1, provided that if an acquisition permitted under the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility involving aggregate consideration in excess of $\n200\n million occurs during the fiscal quarter, the Company shall have the right to increase the Leverage Ratio to \n4.25\n to 1 during such fiscal quarter and for the following three fiscal quarters (the “Elevated Leverage Ratio Period”). Given the strength of the Company’s financial position and its expectation to maintain headroom within the Leverage Ratio, the Company has not elected to increase the Leverage Ratio for an Elevated Leverage Ratio Period in connection with the acquisition of Stericycle. There shall be no more than two Elevated Leverage Ratio Periods during the term of the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, and the Leverage Ratio must return to \n3.75\n to 1 for at least one fiscal quarter between Elevated Leverage Ratio Periods. The calculation of all components used in the Leverage Ratio covenant are as defined in the $3.5 billion revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we were in compliance with our Leverage Ratio covenant.\nOur $3.5 billion revolving credit facility, senior notes and other financing arrangements also contain certain restrictions on the ability of the Company’s subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness as well as restrictions on the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur liens, engage in sale-leaseback transactions and engage in mergers and consolidations. We monitor our compliance with these restrictions, but do not believe that they significantly impact our ability to enter into investing or financing arrangements typical for our business. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under our financing arrangements, in addition to our Leverage Ratio covenant, that may have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n​\n108\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nDerivatives\nIn order to secure underlying interest rates associated with senior note issuances, we entered into treasury lock transactions during 2024 to (i) fix the ten-year treasury rate on an aggregate notional amount of $\n900\n million and (ii) to fix the thirty-year treasury rate on an aggregate notional amount of $\n650\n million. We designated our treasury locks as cash flow hedges. These treasury rate locks were terminated contemporaneously with the related issuances of senior notes in November 2024, and we received cash of $\n35\n million to settle the related assets. The deferred gains are being amortized from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to interest expense over the ten-year and thirty-year lives of the related senior notes issuances using the effective interest method. Additionally, although not material to our financial statements, we do periodically enter into natural gas hedges to mitigate against risk from fluctuation in natural gas prices. As of December 31, 2024, our outstanding natural gas hedges were immaterial. \n​\n7.    Leases\nOur operating lease activities primarily consist of leases for real estate, landfills (as discussed further in Note 2), fleet vehicles and operating equipment. Our financing lease activities primarily consist of leases for operating equipment, railcars and landfill assets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, which are not expected to be renewed beyond one year, are not recorded on the balance sheet and are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms generally ranging from \none\n to \n10 years\n. The exercise of lease renewal options is generally at our sole discretion. We include the renewal term in the calculation of the right-of-use asset and related lease liability when such renewals are reasonably certain of being exercised. Certain leases also include options to purchase the leased property. The depreciable life of assets and leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term, unless there is a transfer of title or purchase option reasonably certain of exercise. Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments based on usage, and other lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation; these payments are treated as variable lease payments. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nWhen the implicit interest rate is not readily available for our leases, we discount future cash flows of the remaining lease payments using the current interest rate that would be paid to borrow on collateralized debt over a similar term, or incremental borrowing rate, at the commencement date.\n109\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nSupplemental balance sheet information for our leases as of December 31 is as follows (in millions): \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nLeases\n    \nClassification\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\nAssets\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nLong-term:\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOperating\n​\nOther assets\n​\n$\n \n996\n​\n$\n \n453\nFinancing\n​\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and depletion\n​\n​\n \n457\n​\n​\n \n393\nTotal lease assets\n​\n​\n​\n$\n \n1,453\n​\n$\n \n846\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nLiabilities\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCurrent:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOperating\n​\nAccrued liabilities\n​\n$\n \n162\n​\n$\n \n66\nFinancing\n​\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n​\n​\n \n73\n​\n​\n \n53\nLong-term:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nOperating\n​\nOther liabilities\n​\n​\n \n878\n​\n​\n \n452\nFinancing\n​\nLong-term debt, less current portion\n​\n​\n \n374\n​\n​\n \n321\nTotal lease liabilities\n​\n​\n​\n$\n \n1,487\n​\n$\n \n892\n​\nOperating lease expense was $\n264\n million, $\n189\n million and $\n183\n million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and is included in operating and selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We expect our new RNG facilities to qualify for federal tax credits and to realize those credits through 2027 under Sections 48 and 45Z of the Internal Revenue Code. We completed construction of five RNG facilities in 2024 and one RNG facility in 2023, resulting in a reduction to our income tax expense of $\n137\n million and $\n8\n million, respectively for investment tax credits under Section 48.\nLow-Income Housing —\n We have significant financial interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. In October 2024, we acquired an additional noncontrolling interest in a limited liability company established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. Total consideration for this investment is expected to be $\n426\n million, comprised of a $\n316\n million note payable, an initial cash payment of $\n33\n million and $\n77\n million of interest payments expected to be paid over the life of the investment. At the time of the investment, we increased our investments in unconsolidated entities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet by $\n349\n million, representing the principal balance of the note and the initial cash payment. We support the operations of these entities in exchange for a pro-rata share of the tax credits they generate. The low-income housing investments qualify for federal tax credits that we expect to realize through 2036 under Section 42 or Section 45D of the Internal Revenue Code. \nAs a result of adopting \nASU\n 2023-02, we amortize our investments in these entities using the proportional amortization method. Under the proportional amortization method, the equity investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received. The amortization expense and the income tax credits are required to be presented on a net basis in income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior to fiscal year 2024, we accounted for our investments in these entities using the equity method of accounting, recognizing our share of each entity’s results of operations and other reductions in the value of our investments in equity in net income (losses) of unconsolidated entities, within our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized additional income tax expense of $\n78\n million, related to amortization under ASU 2023-02. For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized net losses of $\n66\n million and $\n65\n million, respectively, and a reduction in our income tax expense of $\n104\n million, $\n108\n million and $\n99\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, primarily due to federal tax credits realized from these investments as well as the tax benefits from the pre-tax losses realized. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized interest expense of $\n24\n million, $\n15\n million and $\n14\n million, respectively, associated with our investments in low-income housing properties. See Note 18 for additional information related to these unconsolidated variable interest entities.\nTax Implications of Impairments\n — \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized additional income tax expense of $\n14\n million and $\n50\n million, respectively, due to non-cash impairment charges that were not deductible for tax purposes in the year of impairment. The non-cash impairment charge recognized during 2022 was deductible for tax purposes. See Note 11 for more information related to our impairment charges.\nTax Audits — \nWe participate in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process, which means we work with the IRS throughout the year towards resolving any material issues prior to the filing of our annual tax return. Any unresolved issues \n112\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nas of the tax return filing date are subject to routine examination procedures. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company received a notice of tax due for the 2017 tax year related to a remaining disagreement with the IRS. In response to the notice, the Company made a deposit of approximately $\n103\n million with the IRS. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company filed a claim for refund of the entire amount deposited with the IRS. We expect to litigate any denial of the claim for refund. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the IRS deposit, net of reserve for uncertain tax positions, was classified as a component of other long-term assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn addition, we are in the examination phase of IRS audits for the 2023 and 2024 tax years and expect the audits to be completed within the next 15 months. We are also currently undergoing audits by the Canada Revenue Agency for the 2021 tax year and various state and local jurisdictions for tax years that date back to 2014. \nDeferred Tax Assets (Liabilities)\nThe components of net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31 are as follows (in millions): \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\nDeferred tax assets:\n \n​\n  \n \n​\n  \nNet operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carry-forwards\n​\n$\n \n159\n​\n$\n \n137\nLandfill and environmental remediation liabilities\n​\n \n \n162\n​\n \n \n195\nOperating lease liabilities\n​\n \n \n276\n​\n \n \n128\nMiscellaneous and other reserves, net\n​\n \n \n258\n​\n \n \n143\nTotal deferred tax assets\n​\n \n \n855\n​\n \n \n603\nValuation allowance\n​\n \n (\n199\n)\n​\n \n (\n181\n)\nDeferred tax liabilities:\n​\n \n  \n​\n \n  \nProperty and equipment\n​\n \n (\n1,308\n)\n​\n \n (\n1,091\n)\nGoodwill and other intangibles\n​\n \n (\n1,895\n)\n​\n \n (\n1,046\n)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n​\n \n (\n263\n)\n​\n \n (\n111\n)\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n​\n$\n (\n2,810\n)\n​\n$\n (\n1,826\n)\n​\nThese net deferred tax liabilities are included as a component of other long-term assets, accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024, we had $\n123\n million of international net operating loss carry-forwards with expiration dates through 2041 and $\n2.0\n billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards with expiration dates through 2044. We also had $\n106\n million of federal and foreign interest expense carry-forwards that do not expire, $\n40\n million of foreign tax credit carry-forwards with expiration dates through 2033 and $\n6\n million of state tax credit carry-forwards with expiration dates through 2034.\nWe have established valuation allowances for uncertainties in realizing the benefit of certain tax loss and credit carry-forwards and other deferred tax assets. While we expect to realize the deferred tax assets, net of the valuation allowances, changes in estimates of future taxable income or in tax laws may alter this expectation.\n113\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nLiabilities for Uncertain Tax Positions\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, is as follows (in millions): \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nBalance as of January 1\n​\n$\n \n66\n​\n$\n \n64\n​\n$\n \n64\nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n​\n \n \n4\n​\n \n \n6\n​\n \n \n5\nAccrued interest\n​\n \n \n2\n​\n \n \n2\n​\n \n \n1\nAcquisitions\n​\n \n \n2\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n —\nSettlements\n​\n \n (\n21\n)\n​\n \n —\n​\n \n —\nLapse of statute of limitations\n​\n \n (\n10\n)\n​\n \n (\n6\n)\n​\n \n (\n6\n)\nBalance as of December 31\n​\n$\n \n43\n​\n$\n \n66\n​\n$\n \n64\n​\nThese liabilities are included as a component of other long-term liabilities or as an offset to other long-term assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets because the Company does not anticipate that settlement of the liabilities will require payment of cash within the next 12 months. As of December 31, 2024, we had $\n36\n million of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized in future periods, would impact our effective income tax rate.\nWe recognize interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense, which was not material for the reported periods. We did not have any material accrued liabilities or expense for penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits for the reported periods. \n​\n9.  Employee Benefit Plans\nDefined Contribution Plans — \nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) retirement savings plan that covers employees, except those working subject to collective bargaining agreements that do not provide for coverage under the plan. U.S. employees who are not subject to such collective bargaining agreements are generally eligible to participate in the plan following a \n90-day\n waiting period after hire and may contribute as much as \n50\n% of their eligible annual compensation and \n80\n% of their annual incentive plan bonus, subject to annual contribution limitations established by the IRS. Under the 401(k) retirement savings plan, for non-union employees, we match \n100\n% of employee contributions on the first \n3\n% of their eligible annual compensation and \n50\n% of employee contributions on the next \n3\n% of their eligible annual compensation, resulting in a maximum match of \n4.5\n% of eligible annual compensation. Non-union employees are automatically enrolled in the plan at a \n3\n% contribution rate upon eligibility. Both employee and Company contributions are in cash and vest immediately. In connection with our acquisition of Stericycle in November 2024, we acquired a domestic defined contribution plan with attributes similar to our existing Waste Management 401(k) retirement savings plan.\nCertain U.S. employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements may participate in the 401(k) retirement savings plan under terms specified in their collective bargaining agreement. Certain employees outside the U.S., including those in Canada and across Europe, participate in defined contribution plans maintained by the Company in compliance with laws of the appropriate jurisdiction. Charges to operating and selling, general and administrative expenses for our defined contribution plans totaled $\n125\n million, $\n118\n million and $\n112\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nDefined Benefit Plans (other than multiemployer defined benefit pension plans\n \ndiscussed below) — \nWM Holdings sponsors a defined benefit plan for certain employees who are subject to collective bargaining agreements that provide for participation in this plan. Further, certain of our Canadian subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit plans that are frozen to new participants. As of December 31, 2024, the combined benefit obligation of these pension plans was $\n115\n million supported by $\n117\n million of combined plan assets, resulting in an aggregate plan asset for these plans of $\n2\n million. As of \n114\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nDecember 31, 2023, the combined benefit obligation of these pension plans was $\n119\n million supported by $\n118\n million of combined plan assets, resulting in an aggregate unfunded benefit obligation for these plans of $\n1\n million. \nIn addition, WM Holdings and certain of its subsidiaries provided post-retirement health care and other benefits to eligible retirees. In conjunction with our acquisition of WM Holdings in July 1998, we limited participation in these plans to participating retirees as of December 31, 1998. The unfunded benefit obligation for these plans was $\n7\n million and $\n7\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOur assets and accrued benefit liabilities for our defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans are included as components of long-term other assets, accrued liabilities and long-term other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMultiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plans — \nWe are a participating employer in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer defined benefit pension plans (“Multiemployer Pension Plans”) for employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The risks of participating in these Multiemployer Pension Plans are different from single-employer plans in that (i) assets contributed to the Multiemployer Pension Plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees or former employees of other participating employers; (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be required to be assumed by the remaining participating employers and (iii) if we choose to stop participating in any of our Multiemployer Pension Plans, we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal amount based on the underfunded status of the plan.

The zone status is based on information that we received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuary. As defined in the Pension Protection Act of 2006, among other factors, plans reported as critical are generally less than 65% funded and plans reported as endangered are generally less than 80% funded. Under the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014, a plan is \n115\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\ngenerally in critical and declining status if it (i) is certified to be in critical status pursuant to the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and (ii) is projected to be insolvent within the next 15 years or, in certain circumstances, 20 years.\n(b)\nThe “FIP/RP Status” column indicates plans for which a Funding Improvement Plan (“FIP”) or a Rehabilitation Plan (“RP”) has been implemented.\n(c)\nA Multiemployer Pension Plan that has been certified as endangered, seriously endangered or critical may begin to levy a statutory surcharge on contribution rates. Once authorized, the surcharge is at the rate of 5% for the first 12 months and 10% for any periods thereafter. Contributing employers, however, may eliminate the surcharge by entering into a collective bargaining agreement that meets the requirements of the applicable FIP or RP.\n(d)\nOf the Multiemployer Pension Plans considered to be individually significant, the Company was listed in the Form 5500 of the Suburban Teamsters of Northern Illinois Pension Plan as providing more than 5%\n \nof the total contributions for plan years ending December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n(e)\nTotal contributions to Multiemployer Pension Plans exclude contributions related to withdrawal liabilities, if any.\nOur portion of the projected benefit obligation, plan assets and unfunded liability for the Multiemployer Pension Plans is not material to our financial position. However, the failure of participating employers to remain solvent could affect our portion of the plans’ unfunded liability. Specific benefit levels provided by union pension plans are not negotiated with or known by the employer contributors.\nIn connection with our ongoing renegotiations of various collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans. Further, business events, such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a customer contract, the decertification of a union, or relocation, reduction or discontinuance of certain operations, which result in the decline of Company contributions to a Multiemployer Pension Plan could trigger a partial or complete withdrawal. In the event of a withdrawal, we may incur expenses associated with our obligations for unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal. Refer to Note 10 for additional information related to our obligations to Multiemployer Pension Plans.\nMultiemployer Plan Benefits Other Than Pensions — \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company made contributions of $\n62\n million, $\n56\n million and $\n49\n million, respectively, to multiemployer health and welfare plans that also provide other post-retirement employee benefits. Funding of benefit payments for plan participants are made at negotiated rates in the respective collective bargaining agreements as costs are incurred.\n​\n10.  Commitments and Contingencies\nFinancial Instruments —\n We have obtained letters of credit, surety bonds and insurance policies and have established trust funds and issued financial guarantees to support tax-exempt bonds, contracts, performance of landfill final capping, closure and post-closure requirements, environmental remediation and other obligations. Letters of credit generally are supported by our $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and other credit lines established for that purpose. These facilities are discussed further in Note 6. Surety bonds and insurance policies are supported by (i) a diverse group of third-party surety and insurance companies; (ii) an entity in which we have a noncontrolling financial interest or (iii) a wholly-owned insurance captive, the sole business of which is to issue surety bonds and/or insurance policies on our behalf.\nManagement does not expect that any claims against or draws on these instruments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We have not experienced any unmanageable difficulty in obtaining the required financial assurance instruments for our current operations. In an ongoing effort to mitigate risks of future cost increases and reductions in available capacity, we continue to evaluate various options to access cost effective sources of financial assurance.\n116\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nInsurance —\n We carry insurance coverage for protection of our assets and operations from certain risks including general liability, automobile liability, workers’ compensation, real and personal property, directors’ and officers’ liability, pollution legal liability, cyber incident liability and other coverages we believe are customary to the industry. Our exposure to loss for insurance claims is generally limited to the per-incident deductible under the related insurance policy and any amounts that exceed our insured limits. Our exposure could increase if our insurers are unable to meet their commitments on a timely basis.\nWe have retained a significant portion of the risks related to our general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. “General liability” refers to the self-insured portion of specific third-party claims made against us that may be covered under our commercial general liability insurance policy. For our self-insured portions, the exposure for unpaid claims and associated expenses, including incurred but not reported losses, is based on an actuarial valuation or internal estimates. The accruals for these liabilities could be revised if future occurrences or loss development significantly differ from such valuations and estimates. We use a wholly-owned insurance captive to insure the deductibles for our general liability, automobile liability and workers’ compensation claims programs. Our receivable balance associated with insurance claims was $\n111\n million and $\n127\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively. The changes to our insurance reserves for the year ended December 31 are summarized below (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024(a)\n    \n2023\nBalance as of January 1\n​\n$\n \n712\n​\n$\n \n729\nSelf-insurance expense\n​\n \n \n243\n​\n \n \n201\nCash paid and other\n​\n​\n (\n231\n)\n​\n​\n (\n218\n)\nAssumed liabilities from acquisitions\n​\n​\n \n74\n​\n​\n —\nBalance as of December 31\n​\n$\n \n798\n​\n$\n \n712\nCurrent portion as of December 31\n​\n$\n \n211\n​\n$\n \n175\nLong-term portion as of December 31\n​\n$\n \n587\n​\n$\n \n537\n(a)\nBased on current estimates, we anticipate that most of our insurance reserves will be settled in cash over the next \nsix years\n.\nWe do not expect the impact of any known casualty, property, environmental or other contingency to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\n — Our unconditional purchase obligations are generally established in the ordinary course of our business and are structured in a manner that provides us with access to important resources at competitive, market-driven rates and consist primarily of the following:\n●\nDisposal —\n We have several agreements expiring at various dates through 2052 that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third-party disposal facilities. Under these put-or-pay agreements, we are required to pay for the agreed upon minimum volumes regardless of the actual number of tons placed at the facilities. We generally fulfill our minimum contractual obligations by disposing of volumes collected in the ordinary course of business at these disposal facilities.\n●\nOther —\n We are party to certain multi-year service agreements, including various contracts to support our WM Renewable Energy segment, such as interconnection agreements, expiring at various dates through 2046 requiring minimum annual payments.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our estimated minimum obligations associated with unconditional purchase obligations were $\n274\n million in 2025, $\n270\n million in 2026, $\n142\n million in 2027, $\n96\n million in 2028, $\n68\n million in 2029 and $\n556\n million thereafter. We may also establish unconditional purchase obligations in conjunction with acquisitions or divestitures. Our future minimum obligations under these outstanding purchase agreements are generally quantity driven and, as a result, our associated financial obligations are not fixed as of December 31, 2024. For contracts that require us to \n117\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\npurchase minimum quantities of goods or services, we have estimated our future minimum obligations based on the current market values of the underlying products or services or contractually stated amounts. We currently expect the products and services provided by these agreements to continue to meet the needs of our ongoing operations. Therefore, we do not expect these established arrangements to materially impact our future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOther Commitments\n●\nRoyalties —\n We have various arrangements that require us to make royalty payments to third parties including prior landowners, lessors or host communities where our operations are located. Our obligations generally are based on per ton rates for waste actually received at our transfer stations or landfills. Royalty agreements that are non-cancelable and require fixed or minimum payments are included in our financing leases and other debt obligations in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as disclosed in Note 6. Additionally, our Collection and Disposal and Corporate and Other businesses earn royalties from our WM Renewable Energy segment related to the transfer of landfill gas to our WM Renewable Energy segment from our active and closed landfills. All royalties between our WM Renewable Energy segment and Collection and Disposal and Corporate and Other businesses are eliminated in consolidation.\nGuarantees —\n We have entered into the following guarantee agreements associated with our operations:\n●\nAs of December 31, 2024, WM Holdings has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of WMI’s senior indebtedness, including its senior notes which mature through 2054, $3.5 billion revolving credit facility and certain letter of credit lines. WMI has fully and unconditionally guaranteed the senior indebtedness of WM Holdings, which matures in 2026. Performance under these guarantee agreements would be required if either party defaulted on their respective obligations. No additional liabilities have been recorded for these intercompany guarantees because all of the underlying obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. \n●\nWMI and WM Holdings have guaranteed subsidiary debt obligations, including tax-exempt bonds, financing leases and other indebtedness. If a subsidiary fails to meet its obligations associated with its debt agreements as they come due, WMI or WM Holdings will be required to perform under the related guarantee agreement. No additional liabilities have been recorded for these intercompany guarantees because all of the underlying obligations are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 6 for information related to the balances and maturities of these debt obligations.\n●\nCertain of our subsidiaries have guaranteed the market or contractually-determined value of certain homeowners’ properties that are adjacent to or near certain of our landfills. These guarantee agreements extend over the life of the respective landfill. Under these agreements, we would be responsible for the difference, if any, between the sale value and the guaranteed market or contractually-determined value of the homeowners’ properties. As of December 31, 2024, we have agreements guaranteeing certain market value losses for certain properties adjacent to or near \n18\n of our landfills. Any liability associated with the triggering of the home value guarantee has been reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not believe that the remaining contingent obligations will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n●\nWe have indemnified the purchasers of businesses or divested assets for the occurrence of specified events under certain of our divestiture agreements. Other than certain identified items that are currently recorded as obligations, we do not believe that it is possible to determine the contingent obligations associated with these indemnities. Additionally, under certain of our acquisition agreements, we have provided for additional consideration to be paid to the sellers if established financial targets or other market conditions are achieved post-closing and we have recognized liabilities for these contingent obligations based on an estimate of the fair value of these contingencies at the time of acquisition. We do not currently believe that contingent obligations to provide indemnification or pay additional post-closing consideration in connection with our divestitures or acquisitions \n118\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nwill have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n●\nWMI and WM Holdings guarantee the service, lease, financial and general operating obligations of certain of their subsidiaries. If such a subsidiary fails to meet its contractual obligations as they come due, the guarantor has an unconditional obligation to perform on its behalf. No additional liability has been recorded for service, financial or general operating guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly accounted for as costs of operations as services are provided or general operating obligations as incurred. No additional liability has been recorded for the lease guarantees because the subsidiaries’ obligations are properly accounted for as operating or financing leases, as appropriate.\nEnvironmental Matters —\n A significant portion of our operating costs and capital expenditures could be characterized as costs of environmental protection. The nature of our operations, particularly with respect to the construction, operation and maintenance of our landfills, subjects us to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may have liabilities for environmental damage caused by our operations, or for damage caused by conditions that existed before we acquired a site. In addition to remediation activity required by state or local authorities, such liabilities include PRP investigations. The costs associated with these liabilities can include settlements, certain legal and consultant fees, as well as incremental internal and external costs directly associated with site investigation and clean-up.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have been notified by the government that we are a PRP in connection with \n74\n locations listed on EPA Superfund National Priorities List (“NPL”). Of the \n74\n sites at which claims have been made against us, \n14\n are sites we own. Each of the NPL sites we own was initially developed by others as a landfill disposal facility. At each of these facilities, we are working in conjunction with the government to characterize or remediate identified site problems, and we have either agreed with other legally liable parties on an arrangement for sharing the costs of remediation or are working toward a cost-sharing agreement. We generally expect to receive any amounts due from other participating parties at or near the time that we make the remedial expenditures. The other \n60\n NPL sites, which we do not own, are at various procedural stages under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, known as CERCLA or Superfund.\nThe majority of proceedings involving NPL sites that we do not own are based on allegations that certain of our subsidiaries (or their predecessors) transported hazardous substances to the sites, often prior to our acquisition of these subsidiaries. CERCLA generally provides for liability for those parties owning, operating, transporting to or disposing at the sites. Proceedings arising under Superfund typically involve numerous waste generators and other waste transportation and disposal companies and seek to allocate or recover costs associated with site investigation and remediation, which costs could be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. At some of the sites at which we have been identified as a PRP, our liability is well defined as a consequence of a governmental decision and an agreement among liable parties as to the share each will pay for implementing that remedy. At other sites, where no remedy has been selected or the liable parties have been unable to agree on an appropriate allocation, our future costs are uncertain.\nIn 2018, both of McGinnes Industrial Maintenance Corporation (“MIMC”), a subsidiary of Waste Management of Texas, Inc., and International Paper Company (“IPC”) entered into an Administrative Order on Consent with the EPA as PRPs to develop a remedial design for the San Jacinto River Waste Pits Superfund Site in Harris County, Texas. We recorded a liability for MIMC’s estimated potential share of the EPA’s proposed remedy and related costs, although allocation of responsibility among the PRPs for the proposed remedy has not been established. MIMC and IPC have continued to work on a remedial design to support the EPA’s proposed remedy; however, in the first quarter of 2024, the EPA publicly issued a letter alleging that the remedial design had serious deficiencies. MIMC and IPC engaged with the EPA throughout the year, and in November 2024, MIMC and IPC publicly issued a proposed revised full remedial design to address the EPA’s comments. Due to increases in the estimated costs of the remedy to address the EPA’s comments, in \n119\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nthe fourth quarter of 2024 we recorded an additional $\n13\n million liability for MIMC’s estimated potential share of such costs. As a result, the recorded liability as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, was approximately $\n97\n million and $\n85\n million, respectively. MIMC’s ultimate liability could be materially different from current estimates, including potential increases resulting from MIMC’s continued engagement with the EPA regarding a final remedial design for the site. Refer to Notes 2 and 11 for additional information regarding the measurement of certain environmental liabilities.\nItem 103 of the SEC’s Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters when a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings, or such proceedings are known to be contemplated, unless we reasonably believe that the matter will result in no monetary sanctions, or in monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, below a stated threshold. In accordance with this SEC regulation, the Company uses a threshold of $\n1\n million for purposes of determining whether disclosure of any such environmental proceedings is required. Other than the matter discussed below involving Stericycle’s divested Domestic Environmental Solutions business, as of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any matters that are required to be disclosed pursuant to this standard.\nFrom time to time, we are also named as defendants in personal injury and property damage lawsuits, including purported class actions, on the basis of having owned, operated or transported waste to a disposal facility that is alleged to have contaminated the environment or, in certain cases, on the basis of having conducted environmental remediation activities at sites. Some of the lawsuits may seek to have us pay the costs of monitoring of allegedly affected sites and health care examinations of allegedly affected persons for a substantial period of time even where no actual damage is proven. While we believe we have meritorious defenses to these lawsuits, the ultimate resolution is often substantially uncertain due to the difficulty of determining the cause, extent and impact of alleged contamination (which may have occurred over a long period of time), the potential for successive groups of complainants to emerge, the diversity of the individual plaintiffs’ circumstances, and the potential contribution or indemnification obligations of co-defendants or other third parties, among other factors. Additionally, we often enter into agreements with landowners imposing obligations on us to meet certain regulatory or contractual conditions upon site closure or upon termination of the agreements. Compliance with these agreements inherently involves subjective determinations and may result in disputes, including litigation.\nLitigation — \nWe are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes and claims arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions that have been filed against us, and that may be filed against us in the future, include personal injury, property damage, commercial, customer, and employment-related claims, including purported state and national class action lawsuits related to: alleged environmental contamination, including releases of hazardous material and odors; sales and marketing practices, customer service agreements and prices and fees; and federal and state wage and hour and other laws. The plaintiffs in some actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. These actions are in various procedural stages, and some are covered, in part, by insurance. We currently do not believe that the eventual outcome of any such actions will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOn November 4, 2024, the Company acquired Stericycle. At the time of the acquisition, Stericycle was subject to the following legal matters, which are now legal matters of our wholly-owned subsidiary. \nStericycle entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (“DPA”) with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) and a cease-and-desist order with the SEC in 2022 relating to Stericycle’s compliance\n \nwith the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws with respect to now-divested operations in Latin America. The DPA and cease-and-desist order required Stericycle to engage an independent compliance monitor for two years, which Stericycle satisfied. Additionally, the DPA requires Stericycle to self-report any potential violations of the anti-corruption laws through November 2025. If Stericycle remains in compliance with the DPA during the remainder of the term, deferred charges against Stericycle will be dismissed with prejudice. We do not expect this matter to have any material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n120\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nStericycle has been cooperating with an investigation by the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York (“SDNY”) and the EPA into Stericycle’s historical compliance with federal environmental statutes, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, in connection with the collection, transportation and disposal of hazardous waste by Stericycle’s Domestic Environmental Solutions business unit that was divested in 2020. Stericycle previously disclosed that it made an accrual in respect of this matter of approximately $\n10\n million. In January 2025, the parties agreed on settlement terms for this matter, which are within Stericycle’s prior accrual. On January 17, 2025, the U.S. Attorney filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the SDNY, and on the same day, announced the settlement agreement with Stericycle that will resolve this matter upon court approval. The settlement will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \nOn February 11, 2020, Stericycle received an administrative subpoena from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), which executed a search warrant at a facility in Rancho Cordova, California and an administrative inspection warrant at a facility in Indianapolis, Indiana for materials related to Stericycle’s now-divested Domestic Environmental Solutions business of collecting, transporting, and destroying controlled substances from retail customers (the “ESOL Retail Controlled Substances Business”). On that same day, agents from the California Department of Toxic Substances Control executed a separate search warrant at the Rancho Cordova facility. Since that time, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of California (“USAO EDCA”) has been overseeing criminal and civil investigations of the ESOL Retail Controlled Substances Business. The USAO EDCA informed Stericycle that the investigations relate to Stericycle’s operation and sale of its ESOL Retail Controlled Substances Business that was divested in 2020 and has asserted that Stericycle and some of Stericycle’s current or former employees may have civil and criminal liability under the Controlled Substances Act and other federal statutes related to that business. Stericycle has been cooperating with the ongoing investigations, which are limited to the period of Stericycle’s historical operation and ownership of the ESOL Retail Controlled Substances Business from 2015 through 2020. While the ultimate disposition of this matter remains uncertain, we do not currently believe that it will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn June 2022, we and certain of our officers were named as defendants in a complaint alleging violation of the federal securities laws and seeking certification as a class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. A lead plaintiff has been appointed and an amended complaint was filed in January 2023. The amended complaint seeks damages on behalf of a putative class of secondary market purchasers of our senior notes with a special mandatory redemption feature issued in May 2019, asserting claims under the Securities Exchange Act based on alleged misrepresentations and omissions concerning the time for completion of our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Our motion to dismiss is pending and we will vigorously defend against this pending suit. We believe any potential recovery by the plaintiffs, in excess of applicable deductibles, will be covered by insurance, and we do not believe that the eventual outcome of this suit will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWMI’s charter and bylaws provide that WMI shall indemnify against all liabilities and expenses, and upon request shall advance expenses to any person, who is subject to a pending or threatened proceeding because such person is or was a director or officer of the Company. Such indemnification is required to the maximum extent permitted under Delaware law. Accordingly, the director or officer must execute an undertaking to reimburse the Company for any fees advanced if it is later determined that the director or officer was not permitted to have such fees advanced under Delaware law. Additionally, the Company has direct contractual obligations to provide indemnification to each of the members of WMI’s Board of Directors and each of WMI’s executive officers. The Company may incur substantial expenses in connection with the fulfillment of its advancement of costs and indemnification obligations in connection with actions or proceedings that may be brought against its former or current officers, directors and employees.\nMultiemployer Defined Benefit Pension Plans —\n About \n20\n% of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements with various local unions across the U.S. and Canada, and certain parts of Europe. As a result of some of these \n121\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nagreements, certain of our subsidiaries are participating employers in a number of Multiemployer Pension Plans for the covered employees. Refer to Note 9 for additional information about our participation in Multiemployer Pension Plans considered individually significant. In connection with our ongoing renegotiation of various collective bargaining agreements, we may discuss and negotiate for the complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these Multiemployer Pension Plans. A complete or partial withdrawal from a Multiemployer Pension Plan may also occur if employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement vote to decertify a union from continuing to represent them. Any other circumstance resulting in a decline in Company contributions to a Multiemployer Pension Plan through a reduction in the labor force, whether through attrition over time or through a business event (such as the discontinuation or nonrenewal of a customer contract, the decertification of a union, or relocation, reduction or discontinuance of certain operations) may also trigger a complete or partial withdrawal from one or more of these pension plans.\nWe do not believe that any future liability relating to our past or current participation in, or withdrawals from, the Multiemployer Pension Plans to which we contribute will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or liquidity. However, liability for future withdrawals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows for a particular reporting period, depending on the number of employees withdrawn and the financial condition of the Multiemployer Pension Plan(s) at the time of such withdrawal(s).\nTax Matters — \nWe maintain a liability for uncertain tax positions, the balance of which management believes is adequate. Results of audit assessments by taxing authorities are not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. We participate in the IRS’s Compliance Assurance Process, which means we work with the IRS throughout the year towards resolving any material issues prior to the filing of our annual tax return. Any unresolved issues as of the tax return filing date are subject to routine examination procedures. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company received a notice of tax due for the 2017 tax year related to a remaining disagreement with the IRS. In response to the notice, the Company made a deposit of approximately $\n103\n million with the IRS. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company filed a claim for refund of the entire amount deposited with the IRS. We expect to litigate any denial of the claim for refund. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the IRS deposit, net of reserve for uncertain tax positions, was classified as a component of other long-term assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n​\n11.  Asset Impairments and Unusual Items\n(Gain) Loss from Divestitures, Asset Impairments and Unusual Items, Net\nThe following table summarizes the major components of (gain) loss from divestitures, asset impairments and unusual items, net for the year ended December 31 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nGain from divestitures, net\n​\n$\n (\n26\n)\n​\n$\n —\n​\n$\n (\n5\n)\nAsset impairments\n​\n \n \n90\n​\n \n \n275\n​\n \n \n50\nOther, net\n​\n \n \n18\n​\n \n (\n32\n)\n​\n \n \n17\n​\n​\n$\n \n82\n​\n$\n \n243\n​\n$\n \n62\n​\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized \n$\n82\n million of net charges primarily consisting of (i) a \n$\n54\n million charge required to increase the estimated fair value of a liability associated with the expected disposition of an investment the Company holds in a waste diversion technology business within Corporate and Other; (ii) a \n$\n14\n million loss associated with the divestiture of a minority investment in a medical waste company within Corporate and Other, in connection with our acquisition of Stericycle and (iii) a \n$\n13\n million charge pertaining to reserves for loss contingencies in our Corporate and Other to adjust an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary’s estimated potential share of the liability for a proposed environmental remediation plan at a closed site, as discussed in Note 10\n.\n122\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we recognized $\n243\n million of net charges primarily consisting of (i) a $\n168\n million goodwill impairment charge within our Recycling Processing and Sales segment related to a business engaged in accelerating film and plastic wrap recycling capabilities, with $\n22\n million attributable to noncontrolling interests. This charge was partially offset by the recognition of $\n46\n million of income related to the reversal of a liability for contingent consideration associated with our investment in such business; (ii) $\n107\n million of impairment charges within Corporate and Other for certain investments in waste diversion technology businesses and (iii) a $\n17\n million charge within Corporate and Other to adjust an indirect wholly owned subsidiary’s estimated potential share of the liability for a proposed environmental remediation plan at a closed site. Refer to Notes 5 and 10 for further information. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized $\n62\n million of net charges consisting of (i) $\n50\n million of asset impairment charges primarily related to management’s decision to close two landfills within our East Tier and (ii) a $\n17\n million charge pertaining to reserves for loss contingencies within Corporate and Other to adjust an indirect wholly owned subsidiary’s estimated potential share of the liability for a proposed environmental remediation plan at a closed site, as discussed in Note 10. These losses were partially offset by a $\n5\n million gain from the divestiture of a collection and disposal business in our West Tier. \nSee Note 2 for additional information related to the accounting policy and analysis involved in identifying and calculating impairments. See Note 19 for additional information related to the impact of impairments on the results of operations of our reportable segments.\nEquity in Net Income (Losses) of Unconsolidated Entities\nThese financial statement impacts are largely related to our noncontrolling interests in entities established to invest in and manage low-income housing properties. In 2024, we adopted ASU 2023-02, and, as a result, beginning in 2024, the amortization of these investments is recognized as a component of income tax expense. We generate tax benefits, including tax credits, from the losses incurred from these investments. The losses more than offset by the tax benefits generated by these investments as further discussed in Note 8. Refer to Notes 8 and 18 for additional information related to these investments.

The Board of Directors is authorized to issue preferred stock in series, and with respect to each series, to fix its designation, relative rights (including voting, dividend, conversion, sinking fund, and redemption rights), preferences (including dividends and liquidation) and limitations. We have \n10\n million shares of authorized preferred stock, $\n0.01\n par value, \nnone\n of which is currently outstanding.\n124\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nDividends\nOur quarterly dividends have been declared by our Board of Directors. Cash dividends declared and paid were $\n1,210\n million in 2024, or $\n3.00\n per common share, $\n1,136\n million in 2023, or $\n2.80\n per common share, and $\n1,077\n million in 2022, or $\n2.60\n per common share.\nIn December 2024, we announced that our Board of Directors expects to increase the quarterly dividend from $\n0.75\n to $\n0.825\n per share for dividends declared in 2025. However, all future dividend declarations are at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depend on various factors, including our net earnings, financial condition, cash required for future business plans, growth and acquisitions and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nThe Company repurchases shares of its common stock as part of capital allocation programs authorized by our Board of Directors. Share repurchases are a part of our long-term strategy and incorporated into our overall capital allocation plan to enhance our Company’s performance, in conjunction with our other uses of capital, and to return value to stockholders in a tax-efficient manner. Share repurchases during the reported periods were completed through accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements and, to a lesser extent, open market transactions. The terms of these ASR agreements required that we deliver cash at the beginning of each ASR repurchase period. In exchange, we received a portion of the total shares expected to be repurchased based on the then-current market price of our common stock. The remaining shares repurchased over the course of each repurchase period are delivered to us once the repurchase period is complete. In the table below, shares repurchased are measured and reported based on the period shares are delivered to us, which can differ from the period cash is delivered to a repurchase agent for the value of such shares. The following is a summary of our share repurchases under our common stock repurchase program for the year ended December 31:\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n    \n2024(a)\n    \n2023(b)\n    \n2022(c)\nShares repurchased (in thousands)\n \n​\n \n1,494\n \n​\n \n7,840\n \n​\n \n9,796\nWeighted average price per share \n \n$\n \n196.95\n​\n$\n \n158.47\n​\n$\n \n160.26\nTotal repurchases (in millions)\n​\n$\n \n262\n​\n$\n \n1,242\n​\n$\n \n1,570\n(a)\nWe executed and completed one ASR agreement during 2024 to repurchase \n$\n250\n million of our common stock and received \n1.2\n million shares in connection with this ASR agreement. In February 2024, we also received \n0.2\n million shares pursuant to our October 2023 ASR agreement based on a final weighted average price of \n$\n175.29\n. \nWe also repurchased an additional \n0.1\n million shares of our common stock in open market transactions in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) for $\n12\n million, inclusive of per-share commission.\n(b)\nWe executed and completed three ASR agreements during 2023 to repurchase \n$\n950\n million of our common stock and received \n6.0\n million shares in connection with these ASR agreements. Additionally, in October 2023, we executed an ASR agreement to repurchase \n$\n300\n million of our common stock. At the beginning of the repurchase period, we delivered \n$\n300\n million in cash and received \n1.5\n million shares based on a stock price of \n$\n161.38\n. The ASR agreement completed in February 2024, at which time we received \n0.2\n million additional shares based on a final weighted average price of \n$\n175.29\n. \nWe also repurchased an additional \n0.3\n million shares of our common stock in open market transactions in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) for $\n52\n million, inclusive of per-share commissions.\nThe IRA, which was enacted into law on August 16, 2022, imposed a nondeductible 1% excise tax on the net value of certain stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022. We reflected the applicable excise tax in treasury stock \n125\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nas part of the cost basis of the stock repurchased. The above discussion of our common stock repurchases in 2023 is excluding the 1% excise tax.\n(c)\nWe executed and completed four ASR agreements during 2022 to repurchase \n$\n1.417\n billion of our common stock and received \n8.8\n million shares in connection with these ASR agreements. We also repurchased an additional \n0.6\n million shares of our common stock in open market transactions in compliance with Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b 18 of the Exchange Act for \n$\n83\n million, inclusive of per-share commissions. Shares repurchased in 2022 include \n0.4\n million shares of our common stock for \n$\n70\n million pursuant to our December 2021 ASR agreement that completed in January 2022. \nAs a result of the Stericycle acquisition, the Company has temporarily suspended share repurchases. We expect to resume share repurchase once the Company’s leverage returns to targeted levels, which is currently projected to be about 18 months after the November 2024 acquisition of Stericycle.\n​\n14.  Equity-Based Compensation\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) under which employees that have been employed for at least \n30 days\n may purchase shares of our common stock at a discount. The plan provides for two offering periods for purchases: January through June and July through December. At the end of each offering period, enrolled employees purchase shares of our common stock at a price equal to \n85\n% of the market value on the last day of the applicable offering period. The purchases are made at the end of an offering period with funds accumulated through payroll deductions over the course of the offering period. Subject to limitations set forth in the plan and under IRS regulations, eligible employees may elect to have up to \n10\n% of their base pay deducted during the offering period. The total number of shares issued under the plan for the offering periods in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was approximately \n408,000\n, \n473,000\n and \n455,000\n, respectively. After the January 2025 issuance of shares associated with the July to December 2024 offering period, \n1.4\n million shares remain available for issuance under the ESPP.\nAs a result of our ESPP, annual compensation expense increased by $\n11\n million, or $\n8\n million net of tax expense, for 2024, $\n14\n million, or $\n11\n million net of tax expense, for 2023 and $\n13\n million, or $\n10\n million net of tax expense, for 2022.\nEmployee Stock Incentive Plans\nIn May 2023, our stockholders approved our 2023 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2023 Plan”) to replace our 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”). Upon approval of the 2023 Plan, no further awards could be granted under the 2014 Plan, and the \n15.2\n million shares of our common stock that were previously available for issuance under the 2014 Plan became available for issuance under the 2023 Plan, in addition to any shares of our common stock that were subject to outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan that subsequently cease to be subject to such awards as a result of the forfeiture, cancellation or termination. We did not request that our stockholders approve any shares in addition to the shares that roll over from the 2014 Plan for issuance pursuant to the 2023 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, approximately \n13.5\n million shares were available for future grants under the 2023 Plan. Our equity-based compensation awards described herein have been made pursuant to our 2023 Plan or our 2014 Plan (collectively, the “Incentive Plans”). We currently utilize treasury shares to meet the needs of our equity-based compensation programs. \nPursuant to the 2023 Plan, we can issue cash awards, stock options, stock appreciation rights, phantom stock and stock awards, including restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance share units (“PSUs”). The terms and conditions of equity awards granted under the Incentive Plans are determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.\n126\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nThe 2024 annual stock incentive plan awards granted to the Company’s senior leadership team, which generally includes the Company’s executive officers, included a combination of PSUs and stock options. Awards granted to other eligible employees under the Incentive Plans included a combination of PSUs, RSUs and stock options in 2024. The Company also periodically grants RSUs to employees working on key initiatives, in connection with new hires and promotions and to field and corporate managers.\nUpon our acquisition of Stericycle on November 4, 2024, each outstanding award of Stericycle RSUs and PSUs held by an employee of Stericycle that continued their employment with us was assumed by us and converted into new RSU awards granted pursuant to the 2023 Plan (the “Replacement RSUs”). The number of Replacement RSUs issued was calculated by multiplying the number of Stericycle RSUs and PSUs by a conversion factor of \n0.289171\n, which represents the $\n62.00\n per share consideration for the Stericycle acquisition divided by the average of the closing sales price of a share or our common stock for each of the five consecutive trading days before the closing. The Replacement RSUs pay out in shares of our common stock and are subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable to the corresponding Stericycle RSUs. Stericycle RSUs and PSUs held by employees who did not continue their employment with us, and all employee stock options, were cancelled and converted into a right to receive cash immediately upon closing of the acquisition.\nRestricted Stock Units — \nA summary of our RSUs is presented in the table below (units in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n \n​\n​\n​\n​\nWeighted Average\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPer Share\n​\n    \nUnits\n    \nFair Value\nUnvested as of January 1, 2024\n \n \n371\n​\n$\n \n139.37\nGranted\n \n \n237\n​\n$\n \n209.86\nVested\n \n (\n122\n)\n​\n$\n \n119.10\nForfeited\n \n (\n14\n)\n​\n$\n \n163.18\nUnvested as of December 31, 2024\n \n \n472\n​\n$\n \n179.25\n​\nThe total fair market value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n25\n million, $\n15\n million and $\n15\n million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued approximately \n86,000\n shares of common stock for these vested RSUs, net of approximately \n36,000\n units deferred or used for payment of associated taxes.\nRSUs may not be voted or sold by award recipients until time-based vesting restrictions have lapsed. RSUs currently outstanding primarily provide for \nthree-year\n cliff vesting and include dividend equivalents accumulated during the vesting period. Unvested units are subject to forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause termination. RSUs are generally subject to pro-rata vesting upon an employee’s involuntary termination other than for cause and generally payout at the end of the \nthree-year\n vesting period and become immediately vested in the event of an employee’s death or disability.\nCompensation expense associated with RSUs is measured based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the required employment period. RSUs generally continue to vest following a qualifying retirement as if the employee had remained employed until the end of the vesting period, and compensation expense for RSUs granted to retirement eligible employees is recognized over the longer of (i) the period between grant date and the date that the recipient becomes retirement-eligible or (ii) the defined service requirement of the award. Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of expected forfeitures.\nPerformance Share Units — \nTwo types of PSUs are currently outstanding: (i) PSUs for which payout is dependent on total shareholder return relative to the S&P 500 Index (“TSR PSUs”) and (ii) PSUs for which payout is dependent on the Company’s performance against pre-established adjusted cash flow metrics (“Cash Flow PSUs”). Both types of PSUs are \n127\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\npayable in shares of common stock after the end of a \nthree-year\n performance period, when the Company’s financial performance for the entire performance period is reported, typically in the first half of the first quarter of the succeeding year. At the end of the performance period, the number of shares awarded can range from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of the targeted amount, depending on the performance against the pre-established targets. A summary of our PSUs, at \n100\n% of the targeted amount, is presented in the table below (units in thousands):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n​\n    \nWeighted Average\n​\n​\n​\n​\nPer Share\n​\n    \nUnits\n    \nFair Value\nUnvested as of January 1, 2024\n \n \n881\n​\n$\n \n150.77\nGranted\n \n \n281\n​\n$\n \n255.98\nVested\n \n (\n309\n)\n​\n$\n \n122.58\nForfeited\n \n (\n24\n)\n​\n$\n \n200.21\nUnvested as of December 31, 2024\n \n \n829\n​\n$\n \n195.49\n​\nThe determination of achievement of performance results and corresponding vesting of PSUs for the \nthree-year\n performance period ended December 31, 2024 was performed by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors in January 2025. Accordingly, vesting information for such awards is not included in the table above as of December 31, 2024. The “vested” PSUs are for the \nthree-year\n performance period ended December 31, 2023, as achievement of performance results and corresponding vesting was determined in February 2024. The performance of the Company’s common stock for purposes of the TSR PSUs and the Cash Flow PSUs exceeded maximum performance criteria. Accordingly, recipients of the PSU awards received a payout of \n200\n% of the vested TSR PSUs and \n200\n% of the vested Cash Flow PSUs. In February 2024, approximately \n617,000\n PSUs vested and we issued approximately \n406,000\n shares of common stock for these vested PSUs, net of units deferred or used for payment of associated taxes. The shares of common stock that were issued or deferred during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 for prior PSU award grants had a fair market value of $\n121\n million, $\n74\n million and $\n91\n million, respectively. \nPSUs have no voting rights. PSUs receive dividend equivalents that are paid out in cash based on the number of shares that vest at the end of the awards’ performance period. Subject to attainment of the performance metrics described above, PSUs are payable to an employee (or applicable beneficiary) upon death or disability as if that employee had remained employed until the end of the performance period. PSUs are generally subject to pro-rata vesting upon an employee’s involuntary termination other than for cause and are subject to forfeiture in the event of voluntary or for-cause termination. PSUs generally continue to vest following a qualifying retirement as if the employee had remained employed until the end of the performance period, and compensation expense for PSUs granted to retirement-eligible employees is accelerated over the period that the recipient becomes retirement-eligible plus a defined service requirement. \nCompensation expense associated with our Cash Flow PSUs is based on the grant-date fair value of our common stock. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the performance period based on our estimated achievement of the established performance criteria. Compensation expense is only recognized for those awards that we expect to vest, which we estimate based upon an assessment of both the probability that the performance criteria will be achieved and expected forfeitures. The grant-date fair value of our TSR PSUs is based on a Monte Carlo valuation and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Compensation expense is recognized for all TSR PSUs whether or not the market conditions are achieved less expected forfeitures.\nDeferred Units — \nCertain employees can elect to defer some or all of the vested RSU or PSU awards for payout six months after the employee leaves the Company. Deferred units are not invested, nor do they earn interest, but deferred amounts do receive dividend equivalents paid in cash during deferral at the same time and at the same rate as dividends on the Company’s common stock. Deferred amounts are paid out in shares of common stock at the end of the deferral period. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately \n183,000\n vested deferred units outstanding.\n128\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nStock Options —\n Stock option awards vest ratably in three annual increments, beginning on the first anniversary of the date of grant.

The expected volatility assumption is derived from the historical volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the Company’s stock options, combined with other relevant factors including implied volatility in market-traded options on the Company’s stock. The expected dividend yield is the annual rate of dividends per share over the exercise price of the option as of the grant date.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $\n99\n million, $\n78\n million and $\n71\n million, respectively, of compensation expense associated with RSU, PSU and stock option awards as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 includes related income tax benefits of $\n18\n million, $\n15\n million and $\n14\n million, respectively. We have not capitalized any equity-based compensation costs during the reported periods.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we estimate that $\n49\n million of currently unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.7\n years for our unvested RSU, PSU and stock option awards issued and outstanding.\nNon-Employee Director Plan\nOur non-employee directors receive annual grants of shares of our common stock, generally payable in two equal installments, under the Incentive Plans described above. Each non-employee director is required to hold all shares issued pursuant to a Company stock award, after the sale of shares necessary to cover applicable taxes, until retirement or other termination of service as a director of the Company. \n​\n15.  Earnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share were computed using the following common share data for the year ended December 31 (shares in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nNumber of common shares outstanding at end of period\n \n \n401.5\n​\n \n401.5\n \n \n407.9\nEffect of using weighted average common shares outstanding\n \n —\n​\n \n3.4\n \n \n4.9\nWeighted average basic common shares outstanding\n \n \n401.5\n​\n \n404.9\n \n \n412.8\nDilutive effect of equity-based compensation awards and other contingently issuable shares \n \n \n1.9\n​\n \n2.0\n \n \n2.2\nWeighted average diluted common shares outstanding\n \n \n403.4\n​\n \n406.9\n \n \n415.0\nPotentially issuable shares\n \n \n4.7\n​\n \n5.0\n \n \n5.2\nNumber of anti-dilutive potentially issuable shares excluded from diluted common shares outstanding\n \n \n1.2\n​\n \n1.0\n \n \n1.1\n​\n130\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nRefer to the Consolidated Statements of Operations for net income attributable to Waste Management, Inc.\n​\n16.  Fair Value Measurements\nAssets and Liabilities Accounted for at Fair Value\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When measuring assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the Company would transact. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:\nLevel 1 —\n Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2 —\n Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 —\n Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nWe use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. In measuring the fair value of our assets and liabilities, we use market data or assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, including assumptions about risk when appropriate. Our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis include the following as of December 31 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\nQuoted prices in active markets (Level 1):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nCash equivalents and money market funds\n \n$\n \n56\n \n$\n \n327\nEquity securities\n​\n​\n \n70\n​\n​\n \n61\nSignificant other observable inputs (Level 2):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nAvailable-for-sale securities\n \n​\n \n445\n​\n​\n \n431\nTotal assets measured at fair value\n​\n$\n \n571\n​\n$\n \n819\n​\nCash Equivalents and Money Market Funds\nCash equivalents primarily include short-term interest-bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less. We invest portions of our restricted trust funds in money market funds and we measure the fair value of these investments using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The fair value of our cash equivalents and money market funds approximates our cost basis in these instruments. \nEquity Securities\nWe invest portions of our restricted trust funds in equity securities and we measure the fair value of these securities using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Any changes in fair value of these securities related to unrealized gains and losses have been appropriately reflected as a component of other income (expense).\n131\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities\nOur available-for-sale securities include restricted trust funds and investments in unconsolidated entities as discussed in Note 18. We invest primarily in debt securities, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. agency securities, municipal securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities, which generally mature over the next ten years. We measure the fair value of these securities using quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets. Any changes in fair value of these trusts related to unrealized gains and losses have been appropriately reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). \nFair Value of Debt\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the carrying value of our debt was $\n23.9\n billion and $\n16.2\n billion, respectively. The estimated fair value of our debt was approximately $\n22.9\n billion and $\n15.6\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAlthough we have determined the estimated fair value amounts using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies, considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, our estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that we, or holders of the instruments, could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different assumptions or estimation methodologies could have a material effect on the estimated fair values. The fair value estimates are based on Level 2 inputs of the fair value hierarchy available as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. These amounts have not been revalued since those dates, and current estimates of fair value could differ significantly from the amounts presented.\n​\nSee Note 11 for information related to our nonrecurring fair value measurements. See Note 17 for information related to the nonrecurring fair value measurement of assets and liabilities acquired in connection with our acquisition of Stericycle.\n​\n​\n17.  Acquisitions and Divestitures \nAcquisitions\nStericycle Acquisition\nOn June 3, 2024, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) to acquire all outstanding shares of Stericycle for $\n62.00\n per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $\n7.2\n billion (net of cash acquired) when including the assumption of $\n0.5\n billion of debt and the repayment of approximately $\n0.8\n billion of net debt. The acquisition expands our offerings in the U.S., Canada and parts of Western Europe by providing RWCS and SID services that protect people and brands, promote health and well-being and safeguard the environment. The transaction closed on November 4, 2024 and was funded using borrowings under our Term Credit Agreement, commercial paper program and available cash on hand. Shortly thereafter, we repaid all outstanding borrowings under our Term Credit Agreement with net proceeds from our November 2024 issuance of $\n5.2\n billion of senior notes.\nWe incurred acquisition and integration related costs of approximately $\n160\n million, which were primarily classified as “Selling, general and administrative expenses.” The post-closing operating results of Stericycle have been included in our consolidated financial statements, within our new reportable WM Healthcare Solutions segment. Post-closing through December 31, 2024, Stericycle recognized $\n403\n million, $\n244\n million and $\n155\n million of operating revenue, operating expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, which are net of intercompany transactions and included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n132\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nOur consolidated financial statements have not been retroactively restated to include Stericycle’s historical financial position or results of operations. The acquisition is accounted for as a business combination. In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. We are in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in the acquisition, and, until we have completed our valuation process, there may be adjustments to our estimates of fair value and resulting preliminary purchase price allocation. \nWe used the following valuation techniques for the following significant accounts in which carrying value did not approximate fair value: (i) property and equipment were valued primarily using the cost approach with significant assumptions including replacement cost, trend indices, and normal useful lives; (ii) customer relationship assets were valued using the multi-period excess earnings method with significant assumptions including projected revenue, attrition rate, operating expense, selling and general administrative expenses, and discount rate; (iii) indefinite trade name assets were valued using the relief from royalty method with significant assumptions including revenue attributable to the trade names and royalty rates and (iv) permit assets were valued using the cost to recreate method with significant assumptions including costs required to obtain the permits and the opportunity costs if the permits were not in place on the acquisition date. \nThe fair values for property and equipment and intangibles were based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy. The WM Notes were valued using observable market prices which represent a Level 1 measurement in the fair value hierarchy.\nOur estimates and assumptions are subject to change during the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the acquisition date. The areas of acquisition accounting that are not yet finalized primarily relate to (i) finalizing the review and valuation of trade names, permits, customer relationships, and certain property plant and equipment and other intangibles (including the models, key assumptions, estimates and inputs used) and assignment of remaining useful lives associated with the depreciable and amortizable assets and (ii) finalizing the review and valuation of accounts receivable, accrued expenses, contingent liabilities, deferred taxes and goodwill (including key assumptions, inputs and estimates).\nGoodwill of $\n3.6\n billion was calculated as the excess of the consideration paid over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits expected to arise from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized and from synergies of the combination. All of the goodwill was provisionally assigned to the WM Healthcare Solutions segment. We have not yet completed the assignment of goodwill to our reporting units as of December 31, 2024. Substantially all of the goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\n133\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nThe following table shows the preliminary purchase price allocation (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\nNovember 4, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents\n​\n$\n \n198\nAccounts and other receivables (a)\n    \n \n \n506\nParts and supplies\n​\n​\n \n19\nOther current assets\n​\n​\n \n64\nAssets held for sale (b)\n​\n​\n \n125\nProperty and equipment\n​\n​\n \n782\nGoodwill\n​\n​\n \n3,633\nOther intangible assets\n​\n​\n \n3,536\nOther assets\n​\n​\n \n619\nAccounts payable\n​\n​\n (\n186\n)\nAccrued liabilities\n​\n​\n (\n336\n)\nDeferred revenues\n​\n​\n (\n77\n)\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n​\n​\n (\n5\n)\nLiabilities held for sale (b)\n​\n​\n (\n35\n)\nLong-term debt, less current portion\n​\n​\n (\n510\n)\nDeferred income taxes\n​\n​\n (\n884\n)\nOther liabilities\n​\n​\n (\n542\n)\nTotal purchase price\n​\n$\n \n6,907\n(a)\nIncludes allowance for doubtful accounts of \n$\n130\n million.

Total consideration included $\n783\n million in net cash paid and $\n7\n million in non-cash consideration, primarily related to purchase price holdbacks. In addition, we paid $\n23\n million of holdbacks, of which $\n16\n million related to prior year acquisitions.\nTotal consideration for our other 2024 acquisitions was primarily allocated to $\n160\n million of property and equipment, $\n79\n million of other intangible assets and $\n588\n million of goodwill. Other intangible assets included $\n63\n million of customer relationships and $\n14\n million of covenants not-to-compete. \nThe goodwill related to our other 2024 acquisitions was primarily a result of expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses with our existing operations a significant portion of which was tax deductible.\nIn 2022, we acquired a controlling interest in a business engaged in accelerating film and plastic wrap recycling capabilities that is included in our Recycling Processing and Sales segment. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we acquired the remaining minority interests in this business for $\n41\n million.\n2023 Acquisitions \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we acquired \n12\n businesses, primarily related to our Collection and Disposal businesses. Total consideration, net of cash acquired, for all acquisitions was $\n182\n million, which included $\n157\n million in net cash paid and $\n25\n million in non-cash consideration, primarily related to purchase price holdbacks. In addition, we paid $\n13\n million of holdbacks, of which $\n6\n million related to prior year acquisitions.\nTotal consideration for our 2023 acquisitions was primarily allocated to $\n49\n million of property and equipment, $\n44\n million of other intangible assets and $\n88\n million of goodwill. Other intangible assets included $\n34\n million of customer relationships and $\n10\n million of covenants not-to-compete. \nThe goodwill related to our 2023 acquisitions was primarily a result of expected synergies from combining the acquired businesses with our existing operations and substantially all was tax deductible. \n2022 Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, we acquired \n13\n businesses, including the acquisition of a controlling interest in a business intended to allow us to deliver new recycling capabilities for our customers and provide circular solutions for film and clear plastic wrap used commercially, such as plastic stretch wrap for pallets, furniture film, grocery bags and potentially shrink wrap around food and beverage containers. Our other acquisitions in 2022 primarily related to our Collection and Disposal businesses.

Our aggregate investment balance in these entities was $\n707\n million and $\n458\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The debt balance related to our investments in low-income housing properties was $\n670\n million and $\n408\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Additional information related to these investments is discussed in Note 8.\nTrust Funds for Final Capping, Closure, Post-Closure or Environmental Remediation Obligations\nUnconsolidated Variable Interest Entities —\n Trust funds that are established for both the benefit of the Company and the host community in which we operate are not consolidated because we are not the primary beneficiary of these entities as (i) we do not have the power to direct the significant activities of the trusts or (ii) power over the trusts’ significant activities is shared. Our interests in these trusts are accounted for as investments in unconsolidated entities and receivables. These amounts are recorded in other receivables, investments in unconsolidated entities and long-term other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate. We also reflect our share of the unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities held by these trusts as a component of our accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our investments and receivables related to these trusts had an aggregate carrying value of $\n111\n million and $\n104\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities —\n Trust funds for which we are the sole beneficiary are consolidated because we are the primary beneficiary.

Our East and West Tiers along with Other Ancillary services that are not managed through our Tier segments, but that support our collection and disposal operations, form our “Collection and Disposal” businesses. We also provide additional services not managed through our \nfive\n reportable segments, which are presented as Corporate and Other. \nFrom time to time, our operating results are significantly affected by certain transactions or events that management believes are not indicative or representative of our results. Refer to Note 11 for an explanation of certain transactions and events affecting our operating results. Reclassifications have been made to our prior period consolidated financial information to conform to the current year presentation.\nCollection and Disposal\nOur Collection and Disposal businesses provide integrated environmental services, including collection, transfer, disposal and resource recovery services. We evaluate our Collection and Disposal businesses primarily through two geographic segments, East Tier and West Tier. Our East Tier primarily consists of geographic areas located in the Eastern U.S., the Great Lakes region and substantially all of Canada. Our West Tier primarily includes geographic areas located in the Western U.S., including the upper Midwest region and British Columbia, Canada. Additionally, we provide Other Ancillary services that are not managed through the Tier segments but that support our collection and disposal operations. Other Ancillary includes specialized services performed for customers that have differentiated needs. These specialized services are targeted at large industrial customers managed through our Sustainability and Environmental Solutions (“SES”) business or geographically dispersed customers managed through our Strategic Business Solutions (“WMSBS”) business. Also included within Other Ancillary are the results of non-operating entities that provide financial assurance and self-insurance support for our business, net of intercompany activity.\nIncluded within our Collection and Disposal businesses are landfills having (i) 20 third-party power generating facilities converting our landfill gas to fuel electricity generators; (ii) 16 third-party RNG facilities processing landfill gas to be sold to natural gas suppliers and (iii) six third-party projects delivering our landfill gas by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes. In return for providing our landfill gas, we receive royalties from each facility, including the benefit of a \n15\n% royalty from our WM Renewable Energy segment based on net operating revenue generated through the sale of RNG, RINs, electricity and capacity, RECs and related environmental attributes from the 84 landfill beneficial use renewable energy projects owned by WM Renewable Energy on our active landfills, which is eliminated in consolidation.\nRecycling Processing and Sales\nOur Recycling Processing and Sales segment includes the processing and sales of materials collected from residential, commercial and industrial customers. The materials are delivered to and processed at one of our many recycling facilities. Through our brokerage business, we also manage the marketing of recycling commodities that are processed in our facilities and by third parties by maintaining comprehensive service centers that continuously analyze market prices, logistics, market demands and product quality. Our Recycling Processing and Sales segment excludes the collection of recycled materials from our residential, commercial, and industrial customers which is included within our Collection and Disposal businesses.\n137\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nWM Renewable Energy\nOur WM Renewable Energy segment develops, operates and promotes projects for the beneficial use of landfill gas. Landfill gas is produced naturally as waste decomposes in a landfill. The methane component of the landfill gas is a readily available, renewable energy source that can be gathered and used beneficially as an alternative to fossil fuel. WM Renewable Energy converts landfill gas into several sources of renewable energy which include RNG, electricity and capacity, heat and/or steam. WM Renewable Energy also generates RINs under the RFS program, other credits under a variety of state programs associated with the use of RNG in our compressed natural gas fleet, and RECs associated with the production of electricity. The RINs, RECs, and other credits are sold to counterparties who are obligated under the regulatory programs and have a responsibility to procure RINs, RECs and other credits proportionate to their fossil fuel production and imports. RINs and RECs prices generally fluctuate in response to regulations enacted by the EPA or other regulatory bodies, as well as changes in supply and demand.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 102 landfill gas beneficial use projects producing commercial quantities of methane gas at owned or operated landfills. For 65 of these projects, the processed gas is used to fuel electricity generators. The electricity is then sold to public utilities, municipal utilities or power cooperatives. For 23 of these projects, the gas is used at the landfill or delivered by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes. For 11 of these projects, the landfill gas is processed to pipeline quality RNG and then sold to natural gas suppliers. Additionally, three of these projects are on third-party landfills. The revenues from these facilities are primarily generated through the sale of RNG, RINs, electricity and capacity, RECs and related environmental attributes. WM Renewable Energy is charged a \n15\n% royalty on net operating revenue from these facilities residing on our active and closed landfills from our Collection and Disposal and Corporate and Other businesses, which is eliminated in consolidation. Additionally, WM Renewable Energy operates and maintains seven third-party landfill beneficial gas use projects in return for service revenue. Our Collection and Disposal and Corporate and Other businesses benefit from these projects as well as 52 additional third-party landfill beneficial gas use projects in the form of royalties.\nWM Healthcare Solutions\nOur WM Healthcare Solutions segment includes (i) RWCS, which provide compliance programs and collection, processing and disposal of regulated and specialized waste, including medical, pharmaceutical and hazardous waste and (ii) SID services, which provide for the collection of personal and confidential information for secure destruction and recycling of sorted office paper. RWCS are provided to customers in the U.S., Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”). SID services are provided to customers in the U.S., Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the U.K. \nOur WM Healthcare Solutions customers are primarily in the following industries: enterprise healthcare (i.e., hospitals, health systems and national and corporate healthcare), practices and care providers (i.e., physician offices, surgery centers, veterinary clinics, nursing and long-term care facilities, dental clinics, clinics and urgent care, dialysis centers and home health organizations), and pharmacy labs and research centers. Our WM Healthcare Solutions businesses also provide services to airports and seaports, education institutions, funeral homes and crematories, government and military, banks and professional services, and other businesses. While the WM Healthcare Solutions businesses manage large volumes of waste and other materials, the average volume per customer site is relatively small. \nOur WM Healthcare Solutions customers typically enter into a contract for the provision of services on a scheduled basis including weekly, monthly or on an as-needed basis over the contract term. Under the contract terms, the WM Healthcare Solutions businesses receive fees based on a monthly, quarterly or annual rate and/or fees based on contractual rates depending upon measures including the volume, weight or type of waste. Operating revenues are invoiced based on the terms of the underlying contract either on a regular basis, or as services are performed and are generally due within a \n138\n\n\nTable of Contents\nWASTE MANAGEMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n​\nshort period of time after invoicing based upon normal terms and conditions for our business type and the geography of the services performed.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our WM Healthcare Solutions businesses include a global fleet of approximately 6,100 routed trucks, tractors, collection vans and small duty vehicles. Our WM Healthcare Solutions segment operates out of approximately 361 leased and owned facilities worldwide with 69 autoclaves or other alternative medical waste treatment facilities, 18 medical waste incinerator facilities, 107 SID processing facilities, and 167 transfer stations. Included within our WM Healthcare Solutions segment are 35 locations that are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2024.\nCorporate and Other\nWe also provide additional services that are not managed through our operating segments, which are presented in this report as Corporate and Other as they do not meet the criteria to be aggregated with other operating segments and do not meet the quantitative criteria to be separately reported. This includes the activities of our corporate office, including costs associated with our long-term incentive program, expanded service offerings and solutions (such as our investments in businesses and technologies that are designed to offer services and solutions ancillary or supplementary to our current operations) as well as our closed sites. Also, included within our Corporate and Other businesses closed sites are (i) six third-party power generating facilities converting our landfill gas to fuel electricity generators; (ii) two third-party projects delivering our landfill gas by pipeline to industrial customers as a direct substitute for fossil fuels in industrial processes and (iii) two third-party RNG facilities processing landfill gas to be sold to natural gas suppliers in return for a royalty. Additionally, Corporate and Other benefits from a \n15\n% royalty from our WM Renewable Energy segment based on net operating revenue generated through the sale of RNG, RINs, electricity and capacity, RECs and related environmental attributes from the 15 landfill beneficial use renewable energy projects owned by WM Renewable Energy on our closed sites, which is eliminated in consolidation.\nOur chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the chief executive officer. The CODM regularly reviews financial results, operating performance, and capital expenditures of our five reportable segments. Our CODM uses income from operations for each segment predominantly in the annual budget and forecasting process and considers budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment. Our CODM also uses segment income from operations to assess the performance of each segment by comparing the results of each segment with one another. Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments as of December 31 and for the year then ended is shown in the following table (in

Transactions within and between segments are generally made on a basis intended to reflect the market value of the service. \n(b)\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company adjusted gross and intercompany operating revenues to reflect the \n15\n%\n royalty paid by WM Renewable Energy to Collection and Disposal and Corporate and Other businesses for the purchase of landfill gas. There was no change to net operating revenues. Prior periods were recast to conform to current year presentation.\nOur financial and operating results may fluctuate for many reasons, including period-to-period changes in the relative contribution of revenue by each line of business, changes in commodity prices and general economic conditions. Our operating revenues and volumes typically experience seasonal increases in the summer months that are reflected in second and third quarter revenues and results of operations.\nService or operational disruptions caused by severe storms, extended periods of inclement weather or climate events can significantly affect the operating results of the geographic areas affected. Extreme weather events may also lead to supply chain disruption and delayed project development, or disruption of our customers’ businesses, reducing the amount of waste generated by their operations.\nConversely, certain destructive weather and climate conditions, such as wildfires in the Western U.S. and hurricanes that most often impact our operations in the Southern and Eastern U.S. during the second half of the year, can increase our revenues in the geographic areas affected as a result of the waste volumes generated by these events. While weather-related and other event-driven special projects can boost revenues through additional work for a limited time, due to significant start-up costs and other factors, such revenue can generate earnings at comparatively lower margins.\nNet operating revenues relating to operations for the year ended December 31 are as follows (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\n    \n2022\nU.S.\n​\n$\n \n21,107\n​\n$\n \n19,595\n​\n$\n \n18,860\nCanada \n​\n \n \n852\n​\n \n \n813\n​\n \n \n838\nWestern Europe and other (a) (b)\n​\n \n \n104\n​\n \n \n18\n​\n \n —\nTotal\n​\n$\n \n22,063\n​\n$\n \n20,426\n​\n$\n \n19,698\n(a)\n2024 primarily relates to the impact of operations from the U.K., Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands as a result of the Stericycle acquisition.\n(b)\n2023 primarily relates to an acquired smaller recycling-related operations in the Netherlands\n.\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and depletion, relating to operations as of December 31 are as follows (in millions): \n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n    \n2024\n    \n2023\nU.S.\n​\n$\n \n17,995\n​\n$\n \n15,903\nCanada \n​\n​\n \n1,222\n​\n​\n \n1,060\nWestern Europe and other (a) (b)\n​\n \n \n123\n​\n \n \n5\nTotal\n​\n$\n \n19,340\n​\n$\n \n16,968\n(a)\n2024 primarily relates to the impact of operations from the U.K., Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands as a result of the Stericycle acquisition.\n(b)\n2023 primarily relates to an acquired smaller recycling-related operations in the Netherlands\n.\n​\n​\n143\n\n\nTable of Contents\nItem 9.       \nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and\n \nFinancial Disclosure.\nNone.\nItem 9A.    \nControls and Procedures.\nEffectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures \nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive and financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, including ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to management (including the principal executive and financial officers) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers have concluded that such disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024 (the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K) at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nManagement of the Company, including the principal executive and financial officers, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Our internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and includes those policies and procedures that:\ni.\npertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\nii.\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\niii.\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement of the Company assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. On November 4, 2024 we consummated our acquisition of Stericycle, Inc. (“Stericycle”). As permitted by the SEC rules and regulations, management's assessment did not include the internal controls of the acquired operations of Stericycle, which are included in our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024 and for the period from the acquisition date through December 31, 2024. In accordance with our integration efforts, we plan to incorporate the acquired operations of Stericycle into our internal control over financial reporting program within the time period provided by applicable SEC rules and \n144\n\n\nTable of Contents\nregulations. The assets, excluding goodwill, of the acquired operations of Stericycle constituted approximately 13.0% of total assets as of December 31, 2024. Operating results of the acquired operations of Stericycle comprised approximately 1.8% of consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited our consolidated financial statements, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement, together with our CEO and CFO, evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024. We determined that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n​\nItem 9B.    \nOther Information.\nSecurities Trading Plans of Directors and Executive Officers \nOn \nNovember 5, 2024\n, \nJames C. Fish, Jr\n., \nPresident, Chief Executive Officer and member of our Board of Directors\n, adopted a stock trading plan (the “Fish Trading Plan”). The Fish Trading Plan went into effect on the date of adoption and was \nnot intended\n to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The Fish Trading Plan provided for the exercise of \n44,125\n vested stock options upon our common stock reaching a specified market price on or before December 6, 2024. The options were automatically exercised pursuant to such terms, and the Company withheld shares of common stock necessary to cover tax requirements and the exercise price of such options. All remaining shares of common stock resulting from the option exercise after the net share settlement process were delivered to Mr. Fish\n. \nOn \nNovember 5, 2024\n, Mr. Fish adopted a stock trading plan (the “Second Fish Trading Plan”) \nintended\n to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The Second Fish Trading Plan will commence two business days following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and will automatically terminate on the earlier of February 3, 2026 and the completion of all of the contemplated transactions set forth therein. The Second Fish Trading Plan provides for the potential sale of all net after-tax shares of our common stock received from the payout of performance share unit (“PSU”) equity compensation awards for the performance period ended December 31, 2024, upon our common stock reaching specified market prices. Mr. Fish received a target grant of \n47,620\n PSU awards with a performance period ended December 31, 2024; the number of shares to be paid out to Mr. Fish on account of these PSU awards can range from zero to 200% of the initial target grant. As a result, the number of shares of common stock to potentially be sold pursuant to the Second Fish Trading Plan will be determined in the first quarter of 2025 based on certification by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company’s achievement relative to applicable performance measures for the underlying PSU awards.\nOn \nNovember 5, 2024\n, \nMichael J. Watson\n, \nSenior Vice President and Chief Customer Officer\n, adopted a stock trading plan (the “Watson Trading Plan”) \nintended\n to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act.

The Watson Trading Plan provides for (i) the sale of \n3,000\n shares of our common stock; (ii) the potential cashless exercise of \n11,594\n stock options, pursuant to which shares of common stock will be sold to cover option costs, tax obligations, commissions and fees, and Mr. Watson will then continue to hold all remaining shares of common stock resulting from the option exercise after the settlement; (iii) the potential sale of 50% of net after-tax shares of our common stock received from the vesting on March 1, 2025 of \n5,102\n restricted share unit (“RSU”) equity compensation awards and (iv) the potential sale of 50% of net after-tax shares of our common stock received from the payout of PSU equity compensation awards for the performance period ended December 31, 2024. Each of the contemplated transactions will occur upon our common stock reaching specified market prices. Mr. Watson received a target grant of \n5,986\n PSU awards with a performance period ended December 31, 2024; the number of shares to be paid out to Mr. Watson on account of \n145\n\n\nTable of Contents\nthese PSU awards can range from zero to 200% of the initial target grant. As a result, as described above in connection with the Second Fish Trading Plan, the number of shares of common stock to potentially be sold pursuant to the Watson Trading Plan will be determined in the first quarter of 2025.\nOn \nNovember 8, 2024\n, Mr. \nCharles C. Boettcher\n, \nExecutive Vice President and Chief Legal Officer\n, adopted a stock trading plan (the “Boettcher Trading Plan”). The Boettcher Trading Plan went into effect on the date of adoption and was \nnot intended\n to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The Boettcher Trading Plan provided for the exercise of \n7,500\n vested stock options upon our common stock reaching a specified market price on or before December 6, 2024. The options were automatically exercised pursuant to such terms, and the Company withheld shares of common stock necessary to cover tax requirements and the exercise price of such options. All remaining shares of common stock resulting from the option exercise after the net share settlement process were delivered to Mr. Boettcher\n.\nOn \nNovember 26, 2024\n, Mr. Fish adopted a stock trading plan (the “Third Fish Trading Plan”). The Third Fish Trading Plan went into effect on the date of adoption and was \nnot intended\n to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5 1(c) under the Exchange Act. The Third Fish Trading Plan provided for the exercise of \n19,805\n vested stock options upon our common stock reaching a specified market price on or before December 6, 2024. The options were automatically exercised pursuant to such terms, and the Company withheld shares of common stock necessary to cover tax requirements and the exercise price of such options. All remaining shares of common stock resulting from the option exercise after the net share settlement process were delivered to Mr. Fish.\nOn \nNovember 26, 2024\n, Mr. Boettcher, adopted a stock trading plan (the “Second Boettcher Trading Plan”). The Second Boettcher Trading Plan went into effect on the date of adoption and was \nnot intended\n to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The Second Boettcher Trading Plan provided for the exercise of \n8,458\n vested stock options upon our common stock reaching a specified market price on or before December 4, 2024. The options were automatically exercised pursuant to such terms, and the Company withheld shares of common stock necessary to cover tax requirements and the exercise price of such options. All remaining shares of common stock resulting from the option exercise after the net share settlement process were delivered to Mr. Boettcher.\nOn \nDecember 4, 2024\n, \nJohn J. Morris, Jr\n., \nExecutive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer\n, adopted a stock trading plan (the “Morris Trading Plan”) \nintended\n to satisfy the affirmative defense of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The Morris Trading Plan will commence on March 7, 2025 and will automatically terminate on the earlier of March 6, 2026 and the completion of all of the contemplated transactions set forth therein. The Morris Trading Plan provides for (i) the potential sale of all net after-tax shares of our common stock received from the vesting on March 1, 2025 of \n10,204\n RSU equity compensation awards and (ii) the potential sale of all net after-tax shares of our common stock received from the payout of PSU equity compensation awards for the performance period ended December 31, 2024. Each of the contemplated transactions will occur upon our common stock reaching specified market prices. Mr. Morris received a target grant of \n14,150\n PSU awards with a performance period ended December 31, 2024; the number of shares to be paid out to Mr. Morris on account of these PSU awards can range from zero to 200% of the initial target grant. As a result, as described above in connection with the Second Fish Trading Plan, the number of shares of common stock to potentially be sold pursuant to the Morris Trading Plan will be determined in the first quarter of 2025.\n​\nItem 9C.    \nDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\n.\nNot applicable.\nPART III\nItem 10.    \nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\nWe have adopted a code of ethics that applies to our CEO, CFO and Chief Accounting Officer, as well as other officers, directors and employees of the Company.
