    "item1": "Item 1A.\nOVERVIEW\n \nBusiness Overview \nPinnacle West is an investor-owned electric utility holding company based in Phoenix, Arizona with consolidated assets of approximately $26 billion.\n \nSince 1886, Pinnacle West and our affiliates have provided energy and energy-related products to people and businesses throughout Arizona. \nPinnacle West derives essentially all of our revenues and earnings from our principal subsidiary, APS.\n \nAPS is Arizona’s largest and longest-serving electric company that generates safe, affordable and reliable electricity for approximately 1.4 million retail customers in 11 of Arizona’s 15 counties.\n \nAPS is also the operator and co-owner of Palo Verde — a primary source of electricity for the southwestern United States.\n \nStrategic Overview \nOur strategy is to create a sustainable energy future for Arizona that delivers shareholder value and shared value by serving our customers with reliable, affordable, and clean energy.\nCustomer-Focused\nAPS’s focus remains on its customers and the communities it serves.  Accordingly, it is APS’s goal to achieve an industry-leading, best-in-class customer experience.  This multi-year objective includes incrementally improving APS’s J.D. Power (“JDP”) residential and business customer satisfaction ratings from the fourth to the top of second quartile for its customers.  For 2024, APS ranked at the top of the second quartile for large investor-owned utilities for both business and residential customers, with the residential results being APS’s highest rank and placement since 2016.\nIn furtherance of a customer-centric culture, APS employees have delivered an enhanced customer experience in recent years through a number of past and ongoing initiatives, such as improving the ease-of-use of APS’s automated phone system, improving the speed of answering customer calls, advancing phone advisor soft skill development through updated training curriculum, and adding 1,100-plus in-person payment locations, as well as introducing new customer payment channels.  Recently, APS redesigned its customer bills with the aim of increasing personalization and helping customers better understand their \n57\nTable of Contents \nenergy use and find ways to save.  APS also implemented numerous enhancements to its website, including improving page-loading speeds, adding user-friendly dashboards, and making content more simple, relevant, and useful.  APS enhanced other customer touchpoints, such as communications throughout outages and the online outage center in addition to continuing to communicate with customers in their preferred channels about topics that matter most to them, such as reliability, energy-efficiency, financial assistance, the environment, and programs that enable them to design their own personalized energy experience.  Finally, APS continues to focus on employee learning, training, tools, and resources to ensure all employees understand their role in APS customers’ experiences.\nAdditionally, APS has implemented a variety of financial assistance programs to support customers struggling to pay their energy bills.  Among these assistance programs are discounts for qualified limited-income customers, including a new tier with larger discounts for APS’s lowest income customers added in the second quarter of 2024 and other non-income-based assistance programs, such as flexible payment arrangements and emergency utility bill assistance.  To ensure our most vulnerable customers are connected to these programs, we train and partner with more than one hundred community action agencies across our service territory.\nReliable\nWhile our energy mix evolves, APS’s commitment to deliver reliable service to our customers remains.\n \nAPS is managing through significant growth in the Phoenix metropolitan area while experiencing supply chain issues similar to those experienced in other industries.\n \nPlanned investments will support operating and maintaining the grid, updating technology, accommodating customer growth, and enabling more renewable energy resources.\n \nTo prioritize reliability and meet substantial growth in customer energy needs, APS has developed a future-focused, strategic transmission plan (the “Ten-Year Transmission Plan”).\n \nThe Ten-Year Transmission Plan includes five critical transmission projects that comprise the APS strategic transmission portfolio, which represent a significant upgrade to our transmission system.\n \nThese five projects, along with other projects included in the Ten-Year Transmission Plan, will support growing energy needs, strengthen reliability, and allow for the connection of new resources.\nOur advanced distribution management system allows operators to locate outages and control line devices remotely and helps them coordinate more closely with field crews to safely maintain an increasingly dynamic grid.\n \nThe system will also integrate a new meter data management system that will increase grid visibility and give customers access to more of their energy usage data. \nWildfire safety remains a critical focus for APS and other utilities.  We have increased investment in fire mitigation efforts to clear defensible space around our infrastructure, continue ongoing system upgrades, build partnerships with government entities and first responders and educate customers and communities.  We also increased spend on mitigating the risk associated with trees that could cause hazards, resulting in more of these trees being removed before they could cause outages or wildfires.  These programs contribute to customer reliability, responsible forest management and safe communities.  With recent wildfire events in Hawaii, California, and across North America, we have been devoting and will continue to devote substantial efforts to analyzing and developing enhancements to our systems and processes to mitigate fire risk within our service territory and communities, including by hardening our infrastructure, deploying new technologies where appropriate, increasing our awareness, implementing operational changes, and enhancing our wildfire response capabilities.  APS completed implementation of fire modelling software that we are utilizing to more surgically identify and calculate risk and target future \n58\nTable of Contents \nsystem improvement investments such as fire-resistant pole wrapping, wood to steel pole conversions, and additional remote-controllable field devices like reclosers and switches.  In 2024, APS began installing a system of artificial intelligence-based fire sensing cameras with the ability to detect and alert on fire ignitions.  These alerts are sent both to APS and fire response dispatch centers to speed fire response in APS’s service territory regardless of the cause of the fire.  APS also implemented a PSPS program on certain feeders that began in the 2024 fire season, leveraging the additional real-time analysis provided by the new modelling software, and has educated and is continuing education outreach to customers and communities that may potentially be impacted by the PSPS program.  APS continues to evaluate policy and regulatory options, as well as insurance programs, to mitigate the impact of wildfire events.\nFor example, on August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.  See Note 3 for more information.  \nAdditionally, APS was selected by the DOE’s Grid Deployment Office (“GDO”) to receive up to $70 million in federal money for fire mitigation and grid infrastructure projects.  This funding is part of the GDO’s Grid Resilience and Innovation Partnership Program and is contingent on APS negotiating and executing final grant agreements with GDO.\nMaintaining reliability and affordability for customers during the clean energy transition is fundamental to APS’s strategy.\n  Dispatchable natural gas generators provide energy during times when intermittent resources, such as solar and wind, are insufficient to meet customer demand.  \nIn addition to the previously added natural gas units at the modernized Ocotillo Power Plant in 2019 and efficiency improvements to gas units at the Redhawk, Sundance, and West Phoenix Power Plants in 2024, APS has contracted for two simple cycle combustion turbines (approximately 90 MW in total) at Sundance, which are expected to be in service in 2026, and eight simple cycle combustion turbines (approximately 397 MW in total) at Redhawk, which are expected to be in service in 2028.\n \nAPS continues to evaluate and pursue options for reliably serving growing customer energy needs and demand.\nIn October 2021, APS announced plans to evaluate regional market solutions as part of the Western Markets Exploratory Group (“WMEG”).\n \nAs a member of WMEG, APS explored the potential for a staged approach to new market services, including day-ahead energy sales, transmission system expansion, and other power supply and grid solutions consistent with existing regulations and known and expected market design.  APS utilizes the work done by WMEG to help identify market solutions that can help achieve carbon reduction goals while supporting reliable, affordable service for customers.\nAPS went live with a new Energy Management System (“EMS”) in April 2024.  APS expects the new EMS to provide a better foundation which will improve future integration of the renewable and energy storage assets into APS’s generation resource portfolio, allowing APS to maximize the flexibility of its resources and fully engage in the Western Energy Imbalance Market (“WEIM”).\n \nAPS also believes it will better position APS to participate in market opportunities that develop over the next decade.\nAPS’s key elements to delivering reliable power include resource and transmission planning, sufficient reserve margins, partnering with customers to manage peak demand, fire mitigation, and operational preparedness, among others.  Seasonal readiness procedures at APS include inspections to ensure good material conditions and critical control system surveys.  APS also plans for the unexpected by conducting emergency operations drills and coordinating with federal, state, and local agencies on fire and emergency management.\n59\nTable of Contents \nAffordable \nAPS continues to focus on mitigating the cost pressures related to inflation and other factors, such as tariffs.\n \nOverall inflation grew by 1.6% in Phoenix and 2.9% nationally over the twelve months ended December 2024.  Although inflationary impacts to APS began to slow in 2024, APS is still managing the impacts high inflation.  Additionally, the implementation of recent and future tariffs could further escalate costs and introduce supply chain constraints.\nAPS’s customer affordability initiative includes internal opportunities, such as training and mentoring employees on identifying efficiency opportunities; maintaining an inventory to take advantage of lower pricing and avoid expediting fees; entering into long-term contracts to hedge against price volatility, which has allowed APS to mitigate against procurement spend areas such as transformers; and implementing automation technologies to enhance efficiencies and increase data-oriented decision making.\nThere are also external opportunities under APS’s customer affordability initiative, such as APS’s participation in the WEIM.  WEIM continues to be a tool for creating savings for APS’s customers from the real-time, voluntary market.  APS continues to expect that its participation in WEIM will lower its fuel and purchased-power costs, improve situational awareness for system operations in the Western Interconnection power grid, and improve integration of APS’s renewable resources.  APS participated in market design and tariff development of Markets+, a day-ahead and real-time market offering from Southwest Power Pool (“SPP”).  The Markets+ tariff was filed with FERC on March 29, 2024 and was approved on January 16, 2025.  APS announced a market decision to pursue participation in SPP Markets+.  In addition, APS is participating in the Western Resource Adequacy Program administered by Western Power Pool and is transitioning to full binding participation as early as summer 2027.  These regional efforts are driven by the objectives of reducing customer cost and improving reliability.\nIn terms of generation affordability, every three years, APS performs a comprehensive study, called an Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), to identify what resources will be necessary to safely and reliably meet the demand and energy needs of its customers over the next 15 years.\n \nIn November 2023, APS released its latest IRP, which identified forecasted customer demand and energy needs growing at an unprecedented rate.\n \nIn developing the IRP, APS considered how factors such as forecasted economic growth, impacts from weather, and new resource technology availability impact the amount and type of resources required to reliably meet customer needs.\n \nThese factors, among others, were used to develop a plan that identified a balanced mix of diverse energy generating resources to reliably serve customers’ future energy needs in the most affordable and sustainable manner possible.  To help ensure competitive costs for resources procured by APS, APS regularly issues competitive bid solicitations through the ASRFP process, with the most recent ASRFPs being issued in 2022, 2023, and 2024.  These ASRFPs are open to bids for all resource types, including customer-scale (behind the meter) and utility-scale (in front of the meter) resources.  Through the ASRFP process, APS has found that clean resources like wind, solar, and energy storage technology, are important elements of a least cost portfolio.\n \n During the clean energy transition, dispatchable resources will play a vital role in maintaining grid reliability by serving as a back-up to intermittent energy resources when output is insufficient to meet customer needs.  Over the long term, each resource in a balanced and diverse portfolio is expected to provide complementary value and contribute to sustained delivery of reliable electric service.\n \nIn addition to managing the cost of electricity generation, APS has continued building upon existing cost management efforts, including a customer affordability initiative launched in 2019.\n \nThe initiative was implemented company-wide to thoughtfully and deliberately assess our business processes \n60\nTable of Contents \nand organizational approaches to completing high-value work and achieving internal efficiencies.\n \nAPS continues to drive this initiative by identifying opportunities to streamline its business processes, mitigate cost increases, increase employee retention, and improve customer satisfaction.\nClean Energy Commitment\nWe are committed to doing our part to build a clean and carbon-free future.\n \nAs Arizona stewards, we do what is right for the people and prosperity of Arizona.\n \nOur vision is to create a sustainable energy future for Arizona by providing reliable, affordable, and clean energy to our customers.\n \nWe can accomplish our vision by collaborating with customers, communities, employees, policymakers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\n \nOur clean energy commitment is based on sound science and supports continued growth and economic development while maintaining reliability and affordable prices for APS’s customers.\nAPS’s clean energy commitment consists of three parts: \n•\nA 2050 goal to provide 100% clean, carbon-free electricity;\n•\nA 2030 target to achieve a resource mix that is 65% clean energy, with 45% of the generation portfolio coming from renewable energy; and\n•\nA plan to exit from coal-fired generation by 2031.\nAPS’s ability to successfully execute its clean energy commitment depends upon a number of important external factors, including a supportive regulatory environment, sales and customer growth, development of clean energy technologies, and continued access to capital markets, among others.\n2050 Goal: 100% Clean, Carbon-Free Electricity.\n \nAchieving a fully clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050 is our aspiration.\n \nAchieving this 2050 goal will require, among other things, innovative thinking, emergent clean energy and storage technologies, upgrades and expansions to the grid, and supportive public policy.\n2030 Goal: 65% Clean Energy.\n \nAPS has an energy mix that is already more than 50% clean and plans to continue to add more renewables and energy storage.\n \nBy building on those plans, APS intends to attain an energy mix that is 65% clean by 2030, with 45% of APS’s generation portfolio coming from renewable energy.\n \n“Clean” is measured as percent of energy mix, which includes all carbon-free resources like nuclear, renewables, and demand-side management.\n \n“Renewable” energy includes generation resources such as solar, wind, and biomass, and is measured in accordance with the ACC Renewable Energy Standard as a percentage of retail sales.\n \nThis target will serve as a checkpoint for our resource planning, investment strategy, and customer affordability efforts as APS moves toward a 100% clean, carbon-free energy mix by 2050.\n2031 Goal: Exit Coal-Fired Generation.\n \nThe plan to exit coal-fired generation by 2031 will require APS to stop relying on coal-generation at Four Corners.\n \nAPS has permanently retired more than 1,000 MW of coal-fired electric generating capacity.\n \nThese closures and other measures taken by APS have resulted in annual carbon emissions that were 36% lower in 2023 compared to 2005.\n \nIn addition, APS has committed to end the use of coal at its remaining Cholla units during 2025.\nIn June 2021, APS and the owners of Four Corners entered into an agreement that would allow Four Corners to operate seasonally at the election of the owners as early as fall 2023, subject to the \n61\nTable of Contents \nnecessary governmental approvals and conditions associated with changes in plant ownership.\n \nUnder seasonal operation, one generating unit would be shut down during seasons where electricity demand is reduced, such as the winter and spring.\n \nThe other unit would remain online year-round, subject to market conditions as well as planned maintenance outages and unplanned outages.\n  As of the date of this report, \nAPS has elected not to begin seasonal operation due to market conditions.\nRenewables.\n  APS’s IRP identifies a diverse mix of resources adequate to maintain grid reliability while serving increasing future customer energy needs.\n \nOur IRP shows that renewable and clean resources are an important part of a reliable, cost effective portfolio.  APS seeks market-based pricing of procured resources through regular solicitation of project bids using its competitive ASRFP process.\nAPS has a diverse portfolio of existing and planned resources, including solar, wind, energy storage, nuclear, geothermal, biomass and biogas, that supports our commitment to clean energy.  This commitment is already strengthened by Palo Verde, one of the nation’s largest carbon-free, clean energy resources, which provides the foundation for reliable and affordable service for APS customers.  APS’s longer-term clean energy strategy includes pursuing the right mix of purchased power contracts for new resources, procurement of new resources to be owned by APS, and the ongoing development of distributed energy resources.  Maintaining a balanced and diverse portfolio of resources will ensure continued reliable service to our customers in the most affordable manner possible.\nAPS uses competitive ASRFPs to pursue market-priced resources that meet its system needs and offer the best value for customers.\n \nAPS selects projects based on cost, ability to meet system requirements and commercial viability, taking into consideration timing and likelihood of successful contracting and development.\n \nUnder current market conditions, APS must aggressively contract for resources that can withstand supply chain and other geopolitical pressures.\n \nGuided by IRP-established timelines and quantities, APS maintains a flexible approach that allows it to optimize system reliability and customer affordability through the ASRFP process.\n \nAgreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting and interconnection to the electric grid.\nOn June 30, 2023, APS issued an ASRFP (the “2023 ASRFP”) pursuant to which\n \nAPS procured nearly 7,300 MW of new resources to be in service from 2026 to 2028.\nOn November 20, 2024, APS issued an ASRFP (the “2024 ASRFP”) seeking 2,000 MW of resources.  APS is seeking projects that can reach commercial operation beginning June 1, 2028 through June 1, 2030 but will consider projects that may achieve commercial operation as early as 2026.  Additionally, APS is interested in projects that require longer planning, permitting, and construction and can be commercially operational after June 1, 2030.  Bids for the 2024 ASRFP were due on February 5, 2025.\n62\nTable of Contents \nThe following table summarizes the resources in APS’s renewable energy portfolio that are in operation, planned or under development as of the date of this report.  Agreements for the development and completion of future resources are subject to various conditions, including successful siting, permitting, and interconnection of the projects to the electric grid. \nNet Capacity in Operation\n(MW)\nNet Capacity Planned / Under\nDevelopment (MW)\nTotal APS Owned: Solar\n416\n168 \nPPAs Renewables:\nSolar\n585\n3,321 \nWind\n853\n500 \nGeothermal\n10\n— \nBiomass\n14\n— \nBiogas\n3\n— \nTotal PPAs\n1,465 \n3,821 \nTotal Distributed Energy: Solar (a)\n1,727 \n63 \n(b)\nTotal Renewable Portfolio\n3,608 \n4,052 \n(a)    Includes rooftop solar facilities owned by third parties.

APS has been monitoring emerging nuclear technologies, such as small modular nuclear reactors (“SMRs”).  SMRs are typically designed to generate 300 MW or less of energy per unit compared to, for example, the 1,400 MW per unit generated at Palo Verde.  The utilities have applied for a grant from the DOE to begin preliminary exploration of a potential site for additional nuclear energy for Arizona.  The grant could support a three-year site selection process and possible preparation of an early site permit application to NRC. \nElectric Vehicles\n \nAs a part of the statewide transportation electrification plan (“TE Plan”) adopted in 2021, the ACC approved a target of 450,000 light-duty electric vehicles (“EVs”) in APS’s service territory by 2030.  APS’s Take Charge AZ (“TCAZ”) program has helped to deploy Level 2 EV charging stations on customer properties for fleet, public, and workplace EV charging.  As of December 31, 2024, APS has installed 829 energized Level 2 charging ports at 197 customer locations.  Additionally, APS has energized direct current fast charging stations that are owned and operated by APS at five locations in Arizona: Sedona, Prescott, Globe, Show Low, and Payson.  Effective December 12, 2023, the TCAZ program was discontinued by the ACC.  As part of that decision, APS was permitted to complete certain projects that were in process as of December 12, 2023.\nAdditionally, as part of APS’s DSM Implementation Plan, APS launched the EV Charging Demand Management Pilot to proactively address the growing electric demand from charging as EVs become more widely adopted.  The EV programs in the DSM Implementation Plan include APS SmartCharge (an EV data gathering program), Fleet Advisory Services, and a $100 rebate to home builders for new homes to be built EV-ready with 240V receptacle.  APS previously offered a $250 residential rebate to customers that purchased a qualifying home Level 2 charger.  Effective December 12, 2023, APS discontinued this rebate per the ACC decision.  See the discussion above. \nAPS filed its 2024 DSM Implementation Plan on November 30, 2023.  The 2024 DSM Implementation Plan includes APS’s 2024 TE Plan and, among other things, proposes two new programs that were initially proposed in the 2023 DSM Implementation Plan: an expanded residential EV Managed Charging program and a Commercial EV Make-Ready Program.  On April 26, 2024, APS filed an amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan.  The amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan includes an updated budget of $90.9 million to reflect removal of incentive funds for the Level 2 Smart Charger rebate within the EV Charging Demand Management Pilot, an update on the performance incentive calculation, and the withdrawal of tranches two and three of the residential battery pilot.  The amended 2024 DSM Plan is still pending ACC review and approval.  APS will not file a 2025 DSM Implementation Plan, pending ACC review of the amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.\n64\nTable of Contents \nCarbon Capture\nCarbon Capture Utilization and Storage (“CCUS”) technologies can isolate CO\n2\n and either sequester it permanently in geologic formations or convert it for use in products.\n \nCurrently, almost all existing fossil fuel generators do not control carbon emissions the way they control emissions of other air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen.\n \nCCUS technologies are still in the demonstration phase and while they show promise, they are still being tested in real-world conditions.\n \nThese technologies could offer the potential to keep in operation existing generators that otherwise would need to be retired.\n \nAPS will continue to monitor this emerging technology.\nSustainability Practices\nIn 2020, in support of our clean energy commitment and the growing focus on sustainability within our organization, we increased our focus on sustainability by dedicating a new Sustainability Department at Pinnacle West responsible for integrating responsible business practices into the everyday work of the Company.\nIn 2024, the Sustainability Department engaged an external consultant and leveraged input from employees, large customers, limited-income advocates, economic development groups, tribes, nonprofits, environmental non-governmental organizations, residential customers, and other stakeholders to identify and assess the sustainability issues that matter most.  In total, 15 Priority Sustainability Issues (“PSIs”) were identified and prioritized.  The top five issues that were prioritized by stakeholders are as follows: energy affordability, electric reliability, clean energy and decarbonization, workforce development, and climate resilience and adaptation.  Understanding the sustainability priorities of internal and external stakeholders can help companies improve performance, identify risks and opportunities, and refine sustainability strategy. \nFinally, the Company maintains an annual Corporate Responsibility Report on the Pinnacle West website (\nwww.pinnaclewest.com/corporate-responsibility\n).\n \nThe report provides information related to the Company’s sustainability practices and performance.\n \nThe information on Pinnacle West’s website, including the Corporate Responsibility Report, is not incorporated by reference into or otherwise a part of this report.\nArtificial Intelligence\nTo address the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence technology risks and opportunities, APS has developed a cross functional governance structure with leadership and experts from our information technology, cybersecurity, human resources, ethics, supply chain, legal, and nuclear generation teams.\n \nThis cross functional structure assesses the opportunities and risks in alignment with enterprise strategy to ensure compliance with data security and reliability requirements as well as our Code of Ethical Conduct, while observing market trends in this rapidly evolving area.\nRegulatory Overview\nAPS expects to file an application with the ACC for its next general rate case mid-year 2025 and is continuing to evaluate the timing of such filing.\n65\nTable of Contents \n2022 Retail Rate Case\nAPS filed an application with the ACC on October 28, 2022 (the “2022 Rate Case”) seeking an increase in annual retail base rates.\nOn January 25, 2024, an Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO in the 2022 Rate Case, as corrected on February 6, 2024 (the “2022 Rate Case ROO”).  The 2022 Rate Case ROO recommended, among other things, (i) a $523.1 million increase in the annual base rate revenue requirement, (ii) a 9.55% return on equity, (iii) a 0.25% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of 4.36%, (v) 12 months of post-test year plant and the inclusion of the Four Corners Effluent Limitations Guideline (“ELG”) project, (vi) the approval of APS’s System Reliability Benefit (“SRB”) proposal with certain procedural and other modifications, (vii) no additional Coal Community Transition (“CCT”) funding, (viii) a 5.0% return on the prepaid pension asset and a return of 5.35% on the OPEB liability, and (ix) no disallowances on APS’s coal contracts.  \nThe 2022 Rate Case ROO also recommended a number of changes to existing adjustors, including (i) the approval of modified DSM performance incentives and the requested DSM transfer to base rates, (ii) the retention of $1.9 million of Renewable Energy Adjustment Charge (“REAC”) in the adjustor rather than base rates, (iii) a partial transfer of $27.1 million of LFCR funds to base rates, and (iv) the adoption of an increase in the annual PSA cap to $0.006/kWh.  \nOn February 22, 2024, the ACC approved a number of amendments to the 2022 Rate Case ROO that resulted in, among other things, (i) an approximately $491.7 million increase in the annual base revenue requirement, (ii) a 9.55% return on equity, (iii) a 0.25% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of 4.39%, (v) a return set at the Company’s weighted average cost of capital on the net prepaid pension asset and net other post-employment benefit liability in rate base, (vi) an adjustment to generation maintenance and outage expense  to reflect a more reasonable level of test year costs, (vii) approval of the SRB mechanism with modifications to customer notifications, procedural timelines and the inclusion of any qualifying technology and fuel source bid received through an ASRFP, and (viii) recovery of all DSM costs through the DSM Adjustment Charge (“DSMAC”) rather than through base rates.\nThe ACC’s decision results in an expected total net annual revenue increase for APS of approximately $253.4 million and a roughly 8% increase to the typical residential customer’s bill.\n \nThe ACC issued the final order for the 2022 Rate Case on March 5, 2024, with the new rates becoming effective for all service rendered on or after March 8, 2024.\nSix intervenors and the Attorney General of Arizona requested rehearing on various issues included in the ACC’s decision, such as the grid access charge (“GAC”) for solar customers, the SRB, and CCT funding.  On April 15, 2024, the ACC granted, in part, the rehearing applications of the Attorney General, Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association, Solar Energy Industries Association, and Vote Solar specifically to review whether the GAC rate is just and reasonable, including whether it should be higher or lower, whether the GAC rate constitutes a discriminatory fee to solar customers, and whether omission of a GAC charge is discriminatory to non-solar customers.  All other applications for rehearing were denied.    A limited rehearing was held October 28 through November 1.  Following the limited rehearing, an Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO (the “Limited Rehearing ROO”) on December 3, 2024.  The Limited Rehearing ROO recommended affirming the GAC as just and reasonable and that the GAC is not discriminatory to solar customers and the absence of a GAC is not discriminatory to non-solar customers.  On December 17, 2024, the ACC approved the Limited Rehearing ROO with an amendment that requires \n66\nTable of Contents \nAPS in its next rate case to propose a revenue allocation based on a site-load cost of service study in order to bring further parity in revenue collection between solar and non-solar customers.  SEIA, AriSEIA, Vote Solar, the Arizona Attorney General, and two individual customers have filed requests for rehearing of the Commission’s December 17, 2024 decision on the rehearing.  The Commission has taken no action on these requests.  In addition, each of these parties have subsequently filed notices of appeal to the Arizona Court of Appeals seeking review of the Commission’s decisions regarding the GAC and on rehearing.  APS cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.\n2019 Retail Rate Case\nOn October 31, 2019, APS filed an application with the ACC (the “2019 Rate Case”) for an annual increase in retail base rates.\n \nOn August 2, 2021, an Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO in the 2019 Rate Case (the “2019 Rate Case ROO”) and issued corrections on September 10 and September 20, 2021. \n \nSubsequently, the ACC approved an amended 2019 Rate Case ROO on November 2, 2021. \nAfter the 2019 Rate Case decision, APS filed an application for rehearing of the 2019 Rate Case and later filed a Notice of Direct Appeal by APS at the Arizona Court of Appeals, requesting review of certain matters from the 2019 Rate Case decision.\n \nThe Arizona Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part the ACC’s decision in the 2019 Rate Case, remanding the issue to the ACC for further proceedings.\n \nOn June 14, 2023, APS and the ACC Legal Division filed a joint resolution with the ACC to allow recovery of $215.5 million in costs related to the installation of the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) project, a reversal of the 20 basis points reduction to APS’s return on equity from 8.9% to 8.7% as a result of the 2019 Rate Case decision, and recovery of $59.6 million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and June 20, 2023.\n \nThe joint resolution provides for a new Court Resolution Surcharge (“CRS”) mechanism, which is designed to recover the $59.6 million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and\n \nJune 20, 2023, and the prospective recovery of ongoing costs related to the SCR investments and expense and the allowable return on equity difference in current base rates.\n \nOn   June 21, 2023, the ACC approved the joint resolution and proposals therein for recovery through the CRS mechanism, which became effective on July 1, 2023.  As of December 31, 2024, $26.2 million \nof the $59.6 million of lost revenue has been recovered.  \nFinally, the CRS tariff has been updated to account for changes to return on equity and depreciation and deferral adjustments approved in Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case.\nRegulatory Lag Docket\nOn January 5, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to explore the possibility of modifications to the ACC’s historical test year rules.  The ACC requested comments and held two workshops exploring ways to reduce regulatory lag, including alternative ratemaking structures such as future test years, hybrid test years, and formula rates.  On December 3, 2024, the ACC approved a policy statement regarding formula rate plans.  The policy statement allows regulated utilities to propose formula rate plans in future rate cases.  Proposed plans must be based on a historical test year, include an annual update with a true-up and an earnings test to ensure a utility earns within a 20 basis points band of its authorized return on equity.  Proposed plans should also include an annual meeting and challenge periods for stakeholder feedback.  Utilities that implement formula rates also must file a full rate case at least every five years unless an alternate schedule is set by the ACC.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n67\nTable of Contents \nCholla\nOn August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order associated with unrecovered book value and closure costs of the remaining Cholla units.  This order would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, both the expenses necessary to close and decommission coal-fired power plant infrastructure at Cholla, including legally required site environmental remediation, CCR corrective actions, the closure of CCR management facilities, and any unrecovered plant investment and operating costs incurred through and after April 2025.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nFire Mitigation\nOn August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nSee Note 3 for information regarding additional regulatory matters.\nCaptive Insurance Cell \nPinnacle West is the primary beneficiary of\n \na protected cell captive insurance company.  The Captive provides insurance coverage to Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries that supplements third-party insurance policies. \n \nThe Captive insures Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries for terrorism coverage, excess liability including certain wildfire coverage, excess property insurance, and excess employment practice liability.  The Captive policies exclude nuclear liability at Palo Verde.  See Note 10. \n \nThe Captive may hold investment assets in cash, cash equivalents, and equity and fixed income instruments. \nInflation Reduction Act of 2022\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) significantly expands the availability of tax credits for investments in clean energy generation technologies and energy storage.\n \nKey provisions that are relevant to APS’s clean energy commitment include (i) an extension of tax credits for solar and wind generation, including a new option for solar investments to claim a Production Tax Credit (\n“\nPTC\n”\n) in lieu of the Investment Tax Credit (\n“\nITC\n”\n) beginning in 2022; (ii) expansion of the ITC to cover stand-alone energy storage technology beginning in 2023; (iii) introduction of technology neutral clean energy ITCs and PTCs beginning in 2025; and (iv) introduction of a new PTC for nuclear energy produced by existing nuclear energy plants, available from 2024 through 2032.\n \nThe Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Treasury Department have issued preliminary guidance related to various provisions of the IRA that have enabled APS to claim credits related to its solar and energy storage investments.\n \nThe Company continues to await regulations and other guidance, including with respect to the nuclear PTC, which will provide additional details and clarifications regarding how the Company may be able to claim IRA tax credits.  See Note 4 for more information. \nThe prospects for federal tax reform, including potential modification or repeal of the IRA tax provisions, have increased due to the results of the 2024 election.  Any such reform may impact the availability of future potential tax benefits from the IRA and could impact the Company’s effective tax rate, cash taxes paid and other financial results such as earnings per share, gross revenues, and cash flows.  We cannot predict the timing or extent of such tax-related developments which, absent appropriate regulatory treatment, may have a negative impact on our financial results.\n68\nTable of Contents \nFinancial Strength and Flexibility\nPinnacle West and APS currently have ample borrowing capacity under their respective credit facilities and may readily access these facilities ensuring adequate liquidity for each company.  Capital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.\nOther Subsidiaries\nPNW Power\n.\n \n \nOn August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which we agreed to sell all of our equity interest in our wholly-owned subsidiary BCE to Ameresco (the “BCE Sale”).\n \nThe transaction was accounted for as the sale of a business and closed in multiple stages.\n  T\nhe final closing of the BCE Sale was completed on January 12, 2024.  See Note 20 for additional details.  Certain investments and assets that BCE previously held, including the TransCanyon joint venture and holdings in the two Tenaska wind farm investments, were not included in the BCE Sale and were instead transferred to PNW Power, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West.\nPNW Power’s investments include TransCanyon, a 50/50 joint venture that was formed in 2014 with BHE U.S. Transmission LLC, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  TransCanyon is pursuing independent electric transmission opportunities within the 11 U.S. states that comprise the Western Interconnection, excluding opportunities related to transmission service that would otherwise be provided under the tariffs of the retail service territories of the venture partners’ utility affiliates.  The U.S. Department of Energy’s Grid Deployment Office selected TransCanyon to enter into capacity contract negotiations for up to 25% of the Cross-Tie 500-kilovolt transmission line (“Cross-Tie”) as part of the Transmission Facilitation Program.  The agreement was executed on June 12, 2024.  The proposed Cross-Tie project includes a 214-mile transmission line connecting Utah and Nevada that is intended to help improve grid reliability and relieve congestion on other transmission lines.\nPNW Power’s investments also include minority ownership positions in two wind farms operated by Tenaska Energy, Inc. and Tenaska Energy Holdings, LLC, the 242 MW Clear Creek and the 250 MW Nobles 2 wind farms.\n \nClear Creek achieved commercial operation in May 2020; however, in the fourth quarter of 2022, PNW Power’s equity method investment was fully impaired.\n \nNobles 2 achieved commercial operation in December 2020.\n \nBoth wind farms deliver power under long-term PPAs.\n \nPNW Power indirectly owns 9.9% of Clear Creek and 5.1% of Nobles 2.\nEl Dorado\n.\n \nEl Dorado is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pinnacle West.  El Dorado owns debt investments and minority interests in several energy-related investments and Arizona community-based ventures.  In particular, El Dorado has committed to the following:\n•\n$25 million investment in the Energy Impact Partners fund, of which approximately $18.8 million has been funded as of December 31, 2024.  Energy Impact Partners is an organization that focuses on fostering innovation and supporting the transformation of the utility industry.  \n•\n$25 million investment in AZ-VC (formerly invisionAZ Fund), of which approximately $11.8 million has been funded as of December 31, 2024.  AZ-VC is a fund focused on analyzing, investing, managing, and otherwise dealing with investments in privately-held early stage and emerging growth technology companies and businesses primarily based in Arizona, or based in \n69\nTable of Contents \nother jurisdictions and having existing or potential strategic or economic ties to companies or other interests in Arizona.  \n•\n$7.5 million investment in Westly Seed Fund, of which approximately $1.2 million has been funded as of December 31, 2024.  Westly Seed Fund is focused on supporting entrepreneurs involved in the energy, mobility, building, and industrial sectors.\n•\nEquity investment in SAI Advanced Power Solutions (“SAI”), a private corporation that manufactures electrical switchgear equipment used by data centers.  El Dorado accounts for this investment under the equity method, with a December 31, 2024 investment carrying value of zero.  SAI has seen an increased demand for their customized switchgear products.  El Dorado has no funding commitments to SAI.\nThe remainder of these investment commitments will be contributed by El Dorado as each investment fund selects and makes investments.\nKey Financial Drivers\n \nIn addition to the continuing impact of the matters described above, many factors influence our financial results and our future financial outlook, including those listed below.  We closely monitor these factors to plan for the Company’s current needs, and to adjust our expectations, financial budgets and forecasts appropriately.\n \nElectric Operating Revenues.\n \nFor the years 2022 through 2024, retail electric revenues comprised approximately 92% of our total operating revenues.\n \nOur electric operating revenues are affected by customer growth or decline, variations in weather from period to period, customer mix, average usage per customer and the impacts of energy efficiency programs, distributed energy additions, electricity rates and tariffs, the recovery of PSA deferrals and the operation of other recovery mechanisms.\n \nThese revenue transactions are affected by the availability of excess generation or other energy resources and wholesale market conditions, including competition, demand, and prices.\n \nActual and Projected Customer and Sales Growth.\n \nRetail customers in APS’s service territory increased 2.1% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period.  For the three years through 2024, APS’s customer growth averaged 2.1% per year.  We currently project annual customer growth to be 1.5% to 2.5% for 2025 and the average annual growth to be in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% through 2027 based on anticipated steady population growth in Arizona during that period.\nRetail electricity sales in kWh, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations, increased 5.7% for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period.  While steady customer growth was somewhat offset by weaker usage among residential customers, energy savings driven by customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable generation initiatives, the main drivers of positive sales for this period were continued strong sales to commercial and industrial customers and the ramp-up of new data center and large manufacturing customers.\nFor the three years through 2024, annual retail electricity sales growth averaged 3.2%, adjusted to exclude the effects of weather variations.  Due to the expected growth of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, we currently project that annual retail electricity sales in kWh will increase in the range of 4.0% to 6.0% for 2025 and that average annual growth will be in the range of 4.0% to 6.0% through 2027, including the effects of customer conservation, energy efficiency, and distributed renewable \n70\nTable of Contents \ngeneration initiatives, but excluding the effects of weather variations.  These projected sales growth ranges include the impacts of several large data centers and new large manufacturing facilities, which are expected to contribute to 2025 growth in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% and to average annual growth in the range of 3.0% to 5.0% through 2027. \nLonger term, APS has been preparing for and can serve significant load growth from residential and business customers.  On top of these existing growth trends, APS is also now receiving unprecedented incremental requests for service from extra-large commercial energy users (over 25 MW) with very high energy demands that persist virtually around-the-clock.  These incremental requests for service by extra-large energy users far exceed available generation and transmission resource capacity in the Southwest region for the foreseeable future.  In April 2023, APS notified prospective extra-large customers without existing commitments from APS that it is not able to commit at this time to future extra-large projects of over 25 MW.  Because of the high growth in demand for such projects, APS has developed a prioritization queue that identifies and prioritizes projects while maintaining system reliability and affordability for existing APS customers.  APS is exploring available options for securing sufficient electric generation and transmission to meet these projections of future customer needs.\nActual sales growth, excluding weather-related variations, may differ from our projections as a result of numerous factors, such as economic conditions, customer growth, usage patterns and energy conservation, slower ramp-up of and/or fewer data centers and large manufacturing facilities, slower than expected commercial and industrial expansions, impacts of energy efficiency programs and growth in DG, responses to retail price changes, changes in regulatory standards, and impacts of new and existing laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations.  Based on past experience, a 1% variation in our annual residential and small commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $24 million, and a 1% variation in our annual large commercial and industrial kWh sales projections under normal business conditions can result in increases or decreases in annual net income of approximately $6 million.\nWeather.\n \nIn forecasting the retail sales growth numbers provided above, we assume normal weather patterns based on historical data.\n \nOur experience indicates that typical variations from normal weather can result in increases and decreases in annual net income of up to $20 million.  However, since 2020, extreme weather events, such as record-setting summer heat and decreased annual precipitation in our service territory, have resulted in increases in annual net income that are more than historically typical, on average.\n \nFuel and Purchased Power Costs.\n \nFuel and purchased power costs included on our Consolidated Statements of Income are impacted by our electricity sales volumes, existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel, our power plant performance, transmission availability or constraints, prevailing market prices, new generating plants being placed in service in our market areas, changes in our generation resource allocation, our hedging program for managing such costs and PSA deferrals and the related amortization.\nOperations and Maintenance Expenses\n. \n \nOperations and maintenance expenses are impacted by customer and sales growth, power plant operations, maintenance of utility plant (including generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), inflation, unplanned outages, planned outages (typically scheduled in the spring and fall), renewable energy and DSM related expenses (which are mostly offset by the same amount of operating revenues) and other factors. \n71\nTable of Contents \nDepreciation and Amortization Expenses.\n \nDepreciation and amortization expenses are impacted by net additions to utility plant and other property (such as new generation, transmission, and distribution facilities), and increases in intangible assets and changes in depreciation and amortization rates.\n \nSee “Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for information regarding the planned additions to our facilities.\n \n \nPension and Other Postretirement Non-Service Credits, Net\n.\n \nPension and other postretirement non-service credits can be impacted by changes in our actuarial assumptions.\n \nThe most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our net periodic costs/credit, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long-term, the mortality assumptions and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates.\n \nWe review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.  See Note 7.\nProperty Taxes.\n  Taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes, which are affected by changes in plant balances related to new investments and improvements to existing facilities, the value of property in service and under construction, assessment ratios, and tax rates. \n \nThe average property tax rate in Arizona for APS, which owns essentially all of our property, was 9.7% of the assessed value for 2024, 10.0% for 2023, and 10.2% for 2022.  Property taxes increased in 2024 due to higher plant balances related to expansion and improvements on our existing generation, transmission, and distribution facilities, partially offset by legislative changes reducing both property tax assessment ratios and rates in Arizona.  \n \nIncome Taxes\n.\n  Income taxes are affected by the amount of pretax book income, income tax rates, certain deductions, and non-taxable items, such as AFUDC.  In addition, income taxes may also be affected by the settlement of issues with taxing authorities. \n \nInterest Expense.\n  Interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt.  See Note 6 for further details.  The primary factors affecting borrowing levels are expected to be our capital expenditures, long-term debt maturities, equity issuances and internally generated cash flow.\n \nAn allowance for borrowed funds used during construction offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction.\n \nWe stop accruing AFUDC on a project when it is placed into service.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \nPinnacle West’s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to Native Load customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.  Our reportable segment activities are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS.  All other operating segment activities are insignificant to Pinnacle West.  \n \n72\nTable of Contents \nOperating Results – 2024 compared with 2023\nOur consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024, was $609 million, compared with consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders of $502 million for the prior-year period.  The results reflect an increase of approximately $107 million, primarily as a result of the impacts of new customer rates, increased customer usage and growth, the effects of weather, and higher CRS revenue and LFCR revenue.  These positive factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation and amortization expense mostly due to increased plant and intangible assets, higher interest charges, net of AFUDC, higher income taxes and lower transmission revenues.\nThe following table presents net income attributable to common shareholders compared with the prior year for Pinnacle West consolidated and for APS consolidated:\n \nPinnacle West Consolidated\nAPS Consolidated\nYear Ended December 31,\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nNet \nChange\n2024\n2023\nNet \nChange\n \n(dollars in millions)\nOperating revenues\n$\n5,125 \n$\n4,696 \n$\n429 \n$\n5,125 \n$\n4,696 \n$\n429 \nFuel and purchased power expense\n(1,823)\n(1,793)\n(30)\n(1,823)\n(1,793)\n(30)\nOperating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses\n3,302 \n2,903 \n399 \n3,302 \n2,903 \n399 \nOperations and maintenance\n(1,165)\n(1,059)\n(106)\n(1,159)\n(1,044)\n(115)\nDepreciation and amortization\n(895)\n(794)\n(101)\n(895)\n(794)\n(101)\nTaxes other than income taxes\n(227)\n(224)\n(3)\n(227)\n(224)\n(3)\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction\n39 \n53 \n(14)\n39 \n53 \n(14)\nPension and other postretirement non-service credits, net\n49 \n41 \n8 \n49 \n42 \n7 \nOther income and expenses, net\n11 \n7 \n4 \n(11)\n7 \n(18)\nInterest charges, net of allowance for borrowed funds used during construction\n(377)\n(331)\n(46)\n(312)\n(285)\n(27)\nIncome taxes\n(111)\n(77)\n(34)\n(127)\n(94)\n(33)\nLess income related to noncontrolling interests\n(17)\n(17)\n— \n(17)\n(17)\n— \nNet Income Attributable to Common Shareholders\n$\n609 \n$\n502 \n$\n107 \n$\n642 \n$\n547 \n$\n95 \n73\nTable of Contents \nOperating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses.  \nOperating revenues less fuel and purchased power expenses were $399 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period.

See Note 16.  The difference between APS’s and Pinnacle West’s other income and expense, net is primarily related to Pinnacle West’s gain on the sale of BCE.\nIncome taxes.\n  Income taxes were $34 million higher for the year ended December 31, 2024, compared with the prior-year period, primarily due to higher pre-tax income, and lower tax benefits from AFUDC equity, partially offset by higher tax credits.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n \nOverview\n \nPinnacle West’s primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.  The level of our common stock dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on declaration by our Board of Directors and based on a number of factors, including our financial condition, payout ratio, free cash flow and other factors.\n \nOur primary sources of cash are dividends from APS and external debt and equity issuances.  An ACC order does not allow APS to pay common dividends if the payment would reduce its common equity below 40%.  Per the related ACC order, the common equity ratio is defined as total shareholder equity divided by the sum of total shareholder equity and long-term debt, including current maturities of long-term debt.  At December 31, 2024, APS’s common equity ratio, as defined, was 52%.  Its total shareholder equity was approximately $8.3 billion, and total capitalization was approximately $15.9 billion.  Under this order, APS would be prohibited from paying dividends if such payment would reduce its total shareholder equity below approximately $6.4 billion, assuming APS’s total capitalization remains the same.  This restriction does not materially affect Pinnacle West’s ability to meet its ongoing cash needs or ability to pay dividends to shareholders.\n \nDividends to Pinnacle West from APS are also dependent on a number of factors including, among others, APS’s financial condition and free cash flow, the sources of which vary from quarter-to-quarter due in part to the seasonal nature of electricity demand.  APS’s sources of cash include cash from operations and external sources of liquidity, including long- and short-term external debt financing such as commercial paper, term loan and its revolving credit facility.  Cash from operations is dependent upon, among other things, the rates APS may charge and the timeliness of recovering costs incurred through its rates and adjustor recovery mechanisms.  APS’s capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and maturities of long-term debt.  APS funds its capital requirements with cash from operations and, to the extent necessary, external debt financings and equity infusions from Pinnacle West.  On December 17, 2024, the ACC issued a financing order approving a limit on yearly equity infusions equal to 2.5% of \nAPS’s total ass\nets each calendar year on a three-year rolling average basis, subject to APS’s equity ratio remaining below the most recently approved rate case capital structure plus 50 basis points.\n75\nTable of Contents \nOn June 12, 2024, Pinnacle West contributed $450 million into APS in the form of an equity infusion.  APS used this contribution to repay short-term indebtedness.  On December 23, 2024, Pinnacle West contributed $345 million into APS in the form of an equity infusion.  APS used this contribution to repay a portion of commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes.\nPinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities that enhance liquidity and provide credit support for accessing commercial paper markets.  These credit facilities mature in 2029.  See Note 5. \nPinnacle West has an ATM program under which Pinnacle West may offer and sell Pinnacle West common stock and enter into forward sale agreements from time to time, subject to market conditions and other factors.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately $850 million of common stock is available to be issued under the ATM program, which takes into account the forward sale agreement in effect as of December 31, 2024. \nIn addition to the ATM program, Pinnacle West has forward sale agreements from an equity offering in February 2024 in effect as of December 31, 2024.  In December 2024, Pinnacle West partially settled the February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements with the issuance of 5,377,115 shares of common stock and received net proceeds of $345 million.  The proceeds were recorded in equity.  At December 31, 2024, Pinnacle West could have settled the remaining February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements with the issuance of 5,863,486 shares of common stock in exchange for cash of $377 million.\n \nFor additional information regarding common stock issuances, the ATM program, and outstanding forward sale agreements, see Note 13.\nSummary of Cash Flows\n \nThe following tables present net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024, and 2023 (dollars in millions):\nPinnacle West Consolidated\n \n2024\n2023\nNet Change\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities\n$\n1,610 \n$\n1,207 \n$\n403 \nNet cash flow used for investing activities\n(1,934)\n(1,694)\n(240)\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities\n323 \n487 \n(164)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(1)\n$\n— \n$\n(1)\n \nArizona Public Service Company\n \n2024\n2023\nNet Change\nNet cash flow provided by operating activities\n$\n1,610 \n$\n1,275 \n$\n335 \nNet cash flow used for investing activities\n(1,986)\n(1,687)\n(299)\nNet cash flow provided by financing activities\n375 \n412 \n(37)\nNet decrease in cash and cash equivalents\n$\n(1)\n$\n— \n$\n(1)\n76\nTable of Contents \n \nOperating Cash Flows\n \n2024 Compared with 2023.  \nPinnacle West’s consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was $1,610 million in 2024 compared to $1,207 million in 2023, an increase of $403 million in net cash provided, primarily due to $447 million higher cash receipts from electric revenues, $236 million lower fuel and purchased power costs, $15 million change in net collateral, partially offset by $125 million higher income taxes paid, $104 million higher payments for operations and maintenance costs, $49 million higher interest payments and $17 million of other changes in working capital.\n  The difference between APS’s and Pinnacle West’s net cash provided by operating activities primarily relates to APS’s higher income tax cash payments to Pinnacle West and other changes in working capital.\nRetirement plans and other postretirement benefits.  \nPinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries.  Pinnacle West also sponsors other postretirement benefit plans for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries.  The requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”) require us to contribute a minimum amount to the qualified plan.  We contribute at least the minimum amount required under ERISA regulations, but no more than the maximum tax-deductible amount.  Under ERISA, the qualified pension plan was estimated to be 100% funded as of January 1, 2025, and was 113% as of January 1, 2024.  Future year contribution amounts are dependent on plan asset performance and plan actuarial assumptions.  We did not make any contributions to our pension plan in 2024 and 2023.  The expected minimum required cash contributions for the pension plan are zero for the next three years and we do not expect to make any voluntary cash contributions in 2025, 2026 or 2027.  Regarding contributions to our other postretirement benefit plan, we did not make any contributions in 2024 or 2023 and do not expect to make any contributions in 2025, 2026 or 2027.  The Company was reimbursed $27 million in 2024, $23 million in 2023, and $26 million in 2022 for prior years retiree medical claims from the other postretirement benefit plan trust assets.  We continually monitor financial market volatility and its impact on our retirement plans and other postretirement benefits, but we believe our liability driven investment strategy helps to minimize the impact of market volatility on our plan’s funded status.  For instance, our pension plan’s funded status, as measured for accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) purposes, was 99% funded as of December 31, 2024, and our postretirement benefit plans were 195% funded, as measured for GAAP purposes at December 31, 2024.  See Note 7 for additional details.  \nInvesting Cash Flows\n2024 Compared with 2023.  \nPinnacle West’s consolidated net cash used for investing activities was $1,934 million in 2024 compared to $1,694 million in 2023, an increase of $240 million primarily related to $272 million of increased capital expenditures and $21 million of additional investing activity, partially offset by proceeds of $61 million from the BCE Sale.  See Note 20.  The difference between APS’s and Pinnacle West’s net cash used for investing activities primarily relates to the BCE Sale and investments into the Captive Insurance Cell VIE.  See Note 17.\n77\nTable of Contents \nCapital Expenditures.\n  The following table summarizes the estimated capital expenditures for the next three years: \n \nCapital Expenditures\n(dollars in millions)\nEstimated for the Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\nAPS\nGeneration:\nClean:\nNuclear Generation\n$\n150 \n$\n165 \n$\n185 \nRenewables and Energy Storage Systems (“ESS”)\n335 \n165 \n430 \nOther Generation (a)\n420 \n540 \n335 \nDistribution\n665 \n670 \n675 \nTransmission\n450 \n675 \n750 \nOther\n380 \n335 \n275 \nTotal APS\n$\n2,400 \n$\n2,550 \n$\n2,650 \n(a)\nIncludes gas generation and environmental projects.\n \nThe table above does not include capital expenditures related to PNW Power projects.\nGeneration capital expenditures are comprised of various additions and improvements to APS’s clean resources, including nuclear plants, renewables and ESS, as well as additions and improvements to existing fossil plants.  We are monitoring the status of environmental matters, which, depending on their final outcome, could require modification to our planned environmental expenditures.\nDistribution and transmission capital expenditures are comprised of infrastructure additions and upgrades, capital replacements, and new customer construction.  Examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include power lines, substations, and line extensions to new residential and commercial developments.\nCapital expenditures will be funded with internally generated cash and external financings, which may include issuances of long-term debt and Pinnacle West common stock.\n \nFinancing Cash Flows and Liquidity\n \n2024 Compared with 2023. \n Pinnacle West’s consolidated net cash provided by financing activities was $323 million in 2024 compared to $487 million in 2023, a decrease of $164 million in net cash provided primarily due to $842 million higher long-term debt repayments and a net decrease in short-term debt borrowings of $283 million, partially offset by $624 million in higher issuances of long-term debt and an equity issuance of $345 million.\n APS’s consolidated net cash provided by financing activities was $375 million in 2024 compared to $412 million in 2023, a decrease of $37 million in net cash provided primarily due to a net decrease in \n78\nTable of Contents \nshort-term borrowings of $374 million, $250 million higher long-term debt repayments and $50 million in lower issuances of long-term debt, partially offset by $645 million in higher equity infusions.\nSignificant Financing Activities.\n  On December 11, 2024, the Pinnacle West Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.895 per share of common stock, payable on March 3, 2025, to shareholders of record on February 3, 2025.  During 2024, Pinnacle West increased its indicated annual dividend from $3.52 per share to $3.58 per share.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, Pinnacle West’s total dividends paid per share of common stock were $3.54 per share, which resulted in dividend payments of $395 million.\nAvailable Credit Facilities\n.  \nPinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities in order to enhance liquidity and provide credit support for their commercial paper.  See Note 5 for more information on available credit facilities.\nEquity Offerings\n.\n  Pinnacle West has an ATM program under which Pinnacle West may offer and sell Pinnacle West common stock and enter into equity forward sale agreements from time to time, subject to market conditions and other factors.  \nOn \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Pinnacle West could have settled the outstanding November 2024 ATM Forward Sale Agreement with the physical delivery of \n552,833\n shares of Pinnacle West common stock in exchange for cash of approximately \n$50 million\n.  As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Pinnacle West has not received any proceeds relating to the November 2024 Forward Sale Agreement.  \nIn addition to the ATM program, Pinnacle West entered into certain equity forward sale agreements in February 2024, which were partially settled in December 2024 with the issuance of \n \n5,377,115 shares of common stock.  In connection with the partial settlement, Pinnacle West received net proceeds of $345 million.  At December 31, 2024, Pinnacle West could have settled the remaining February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements with the issuance of 5,863,486 shares of common stock in exchange for cash of $377 million.  See Note 13.\nOther Financing Matters.\n  See Note 15 for information related to the change in our margin and collateral accounts.\n \nDebt Provisions\n \nPinnacle West’s and APS’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios.  Pinnacle West and APS comply with these covenants.  For both Pinnacle West and APS, these covenants require that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed 65%.  At December 31, 2024, the ratio was approximately 59% for Pinnacle West and 49% for APS.  Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could “cross-default” other debt.  See further discussion of “cross-default” provisions below.\n \nNeither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade.  However, our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings.\n \nAll of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  All of APS’s bank agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank \n79\nTable of Contents \nagreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings.\nOn December 17, 2024, the ACC issued a financing order reaffirming the short-term debt authorization equal to the sum of (i) 7% of APS’s capitalization and (ii) $500 million (which is required to be used for costs relating to purchases of natural gas and power) and approving an increase of the long-term debt limit to $9.5 billion and a limit of permitted annual equity infusions into APS equal to 2.5% of APS’s total assets each calendar year on a three-year rolling average basis, subject to APS’s equity ratio remaining below the most recently approved rate case capital structure plus 50 basis points.  See Note 6 for additional long-term debt provisions and further discussions of liquidity matters.\nCredit Ratings\nThe ratings of securities of Pinnacle West and APS as of February 18, 2025, are shown below.  We are disclosing these credit ratings to enhance understanding of our cost of short-term and long-term capital and our ability to access the markets for liquidity and long-term debt.  The ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies, from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained.  There is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period.  The ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies if, in their respective judgments, circumstances so warrant.  Any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of Pinnacle West’s or APS’s securities and/or result in an increase in the cost of, or limit access to, capital.  Such revisions may also result in substantial additional cash or other collateral requirements related to certain derivative instruments, insurance policies, natural gas transportation, fuel supply, and other energy-related contracts.  On March 7, 2024, S&P affirmed the ratings and revised Pinnacle West’s and APS’s outlooks from negative to stable.  On March 20, 2024, Moody’s downgraded both Pinnacle West’s and APS’s credit ratings by a notch and revised their outlooks from negative to stable.  On March 26, 2024, Fitch affirmed APS’s ratings and downgraded Pinnacle West’s ratings by a notch.  Fitch revised the outlook for both Pinnacle West and APS from negative to stable.  At this time, we believe we have sufficient available liquidity resources to respond to a potential downward revision to our credit ratings. \n \nMoody’s\n \nStandard & Poor’s\n \nFitch\nPinnacle West\n \n \n \n \n \nCorporate credit rating\nBaa2\nBBB+\nBBB\nSenior unsecured\nBaa2\nBBB\nBBB\nCommercial paper\nP-2\nA-2\nF3\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nAPS\n \n \n \n \n \nCorporate credit rating\nBaa1\nBBB+\nBBB+\nSenior unsecured\nBaa1\nBBB+\nA-\nCommercial paper\nP-2\nA-2\nF2\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\n \n80\nTable of Contents \nContractual Obligations\nPinnacle West has contractual obligations and other commitments that will need to be funded in the future, in addition to its capital expenditure programs.  Material contractual obligations and other commitments are as follows:\n•\nPinnacle West and APS have material long-term debt obligations that mature at various dates through 2050 and bear interest principally at fixed rates.  Interest on variable-rate long-term debt is determined by using average rates at December 31, 2024.  See Note 6.\n•\nPinnacle West and APS maintain committed revolving credit facilities.  See Note 5 for short-term debt details.\n•\nFuel and purchased power commitments include purchases of coal, electricity, natural gas, renewable energy, nuclear fuel, and natural gas transportation.  See Notes 3 and 10.  Purchase obligations include capital expenditures and other obligations.  See Note 10.  Commitments related to purchased power lease contracts are also considered fuel and purchased power commitments.  See Note 8.\n•\nAPS holds certain contracts to purchase renewable energy credits in compliance with the RES.  See Notes 3 and 10.\n•\nAPS is required to make payments to the noncontrolling interests related to the Palo Verde sale leaseback through 2033.  See Note 17.\n•\nAPS must reimburse certain coal providers for final and contemporaneous coal mine reclamation.  See Note 10.\n•\nPinnacle West’s equity forward sale agreements, which may be settled by Pinnacle West with common stock or cash.  Pinnacle West has classified these agreements as equity transactions in accordance with GAAP.  See Note 13.\n \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n \nIn preparing the financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period.  Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and actual results could differ from those estimates.  We consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties, judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved.\nRegulatory Accounting\nRegulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators, such as the ACC and FERC, to be reflected in our financial statements.  Their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies.  Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers.  \n81\nTable of Contents \nManagement judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets and/or a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction.  This determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in Arizona and is subject to change in the future.  If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings, except for pension benefits, which would be charged to OCI and result in lower future earnings.  Management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential ACC- or FERC-ordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities.  We had $1,810 million of regulatory assets and $2,062 million of regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024.  See Notes 1 and 3 for more information.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Accounting\nChanges in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit assets, liabilities and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position.  We review these assumptions on an annual basis and adjust them as necessary.  The most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets (“EROA”), and the assumed healthcare cost trend rates.  Differences between these actuarial assumptions and actual plan results may create volatility in pension and other postretirement benefit expense.  To reduce this volatility, these differences are accumulated and amortized (subject to a corridor of 10% of the greater of plan assets or obligations) as part of the expense over a period of approximately 11 years.  Following are the most relevant actuarial assumptions: \nDiscount Rate.\n  The discount rate is used to measure the plan liability and net periodic cost.  For this assumption, we utilize a yield curve produced by our actuary as of December 31st and employ their projections of the future benefit payments to estimate the projected benefit obligation for each plan.  This process also yields a single equivalent discount rate that produces the same present value for the projection of estimated benefit payments that is generated by discounting each year’s benefit payments by a spot rate to that year.  The spot rates are derived from a yield curve composed of domestic AA rated corporate bonds. \nEROA\n.  The EROA is used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long-term.  For this assumption, we consider historical experience and future expectations of asset classes utilized in the portfolio. \nHealthcare Cost Trend Rates.\n  We consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs, and our actuary provides the Company with a medical trend recommendation based on national medical trend, historical claims performance, benchmarking, and plan design changes.\n82\nTable of Contents \nThe following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the December 31, 2024, reported pension assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and our 2024 reported pension expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants, on the Consolidated Statements of Income (dollars in millions):\n \nIncrease (Decrease)\nActuarial Assumption (a)\nImpact on\nPension\nPlans\nImpact on\nPension\nExpense\nDiscount rate (b):\n \n \nIncrease 1%\n$\n(231)\n$\n(11)\nDecrease 1%\n271 \n11 \nEROA:\nIncrease 1%\n— \n(24)\nDecrease 1%\n— \n24 \n(a)\nEach fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point.\n(b)\nIn general, changes in the discount rate will not typically have symmetrical effects for increases and decreases of the rate.  Further, a 1% change in a low discount rate environment will have a larger impact than a 1% change in a high discount rate environment.  Therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated.  Additionally, the Pension Plan utilizes a liability-driven strategy for its pension asset portfolio, and the obligation and expense sensitivities shown above do not reflect the offsetting impact that a change in interest rates may have on pension asset values. \nThe following chart reflects the sensitivities that a change in certain actuarial assumptions would have had on the December 31, 2024, other postretirement benefit obligation on the Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and our 2024 reported other postretirement benefit expense, after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants, on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income (dollars in millions): \n \nIncrease (Decrease)\nActuarial Assumption (a)\nImpact on Other\nPostretirement \nBenefit Plans\nImpact on Other\nPostretirement\nBenefit Expense\nDiscount rate (b):\n \n \nIncrease 1%\n$\n(32)\n$\n(2)\nDecrease 1%\n38 \n3 \nHealthcare cost trend rate (c):\nIncrease 1%\n12 \n5 \nDecrease 1%\n(10)\n(5)\nEROA – pretax:\nIncrease 1%\n— \n(6)\nDecrease 1%\n— \n6 \n83\nTable of Contents \n(a)\nEach fluctuation assumes that the other assumptions of the calculation are held constant while the rates are changed by one percentage point.\n(b)\nIn general, changes in the discount rate will not typically have symmetrical effects for increases and decreases of the rate.  Further, a 1% change in a low discount rate environment will have a larger impact than a 1% change in a high discount rate environment.  Therefore, the discount rate sensitivities above cannot necessarily be extrapolated. \n(c)\nThis assumes a 1% change in the initial and ultimate healthcare cost trend rate.\nSee Note 7 for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe account for derivative instruments, investments held in our nuclear decommissioning trusts fund, investments held in our other special use funds, certain cash equivalents, and plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans at fair value on a recurring basis.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  We use inputs, or assumptions that market participants would use, to determine fair market value.  We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  The significance of a particular input determines how the instrument is classified in a fair value hierarchy.  The determination of fair value sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment.  Our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to fair value measurement may affect the valuation of the instruments and their placement within a fair value hierarchy.  Actual results could differ from our estimates of fair value.  See Note 1 for a discussion of accounting policies and Note 12 for fair value measurement disclosures.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe recognize an ARO for the future decommissioning or retirement of our tangible long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists.  The ARO liability represents an estimate of the fair value of the current obligation related to decommissioning and the retirement of those assets.  ARO measurements inherently involve uncertainty in the amount and timing of settlement of the liability.  We use an expected cash flow approach to measure the amount we recognize as an ARO.  This approach applies probability weighting to discounted future cash flow scenarios that reflect a range of possible outcomes.  The scenarios consider settlement of the ARO at the expiration of the asset’s current license or lease term and expected decommissioning dates.  The fair value of an ARO is recognized in the period in which it is incurred.  The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long-lived asset and are depreciated over the life of the related assets.  In addition, we accrete the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time.  Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the amount of the recorded ARO for these assets.  In accordance with GAAP accounting, APS accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets, even if there is no legal obligation for removal. \nAROs as of December 31, 2024 are described further in Note 11.\n84\nTable of Contents \nOTHER ACCOUNTING MATTERS\nWe adopted new accounting standard, ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, on December 31, 2024.  We will adopt new accounting standard, ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, on December 31, 2025.  We are currently evaluating the disclosure impacts of the pending adoption of the new accounting standard, ASU 2024-03, Income Statement Reporting: Expense Disaggregation Disclosures, effective for us on   December 31, 2027.  See Note 21 for additional information relating to new accounting standards. \nMARKET AND CREDIT RISKS\n \nMarket Risks\n \nOur operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates, commodity prices, investments held by our nuclear decommissioning trusts, other special use funds and benefit plan assets.\n \nInterest Rate and Equity Risk\n \nWe have exposure to changing interest rates.  Changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable-rate debt and the market value of fixed income securities held by our nuclear decommissioning trust, other special use funds (see Notes 12 and 18), and benefit plan assets.  The nuclear decommissioning trust, other special use funds and benefit plan assets also have risks associated with the changing market value of their equity and other non-fixed income investments.  Nuclear decommissioning, coal reclamation, and benefit plan costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices.\nThe tables below present contractual balances of our consolidated long-term and short-term debt at the expected maturity dates, as well as the fair value of those instruments on December 31, 2024, and 2023.  If variable interest rates were to increase by 10% from the December 31, 2024, levels, it would not have a material effect on Pinnacle West Consolidated or APS Consolidated annual interest expense.

fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity and natural gas.  Our risk management committee, consisting of officers and key management personnel, oversees company-wide energy risk management activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management policies.  We manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity instruments that may qualify as derivatives, including futures, forwards, options, and swaps.  As part of our risk management program, we use such instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas.  The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities.\nThe following table shows the net pretax changes in

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions \nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based \n91\nTable of Contents \non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Accounting — Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements — Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nArizona Public Service Company (“APS”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is subject to rate regulation by the Arizona Corporation Commission (the “ACC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates charged by public service utilities in Arizona. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; fuel and purchased power; operations and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense.\nThe ACC’s rate-making policies are premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the ACC in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable deferred costs and \n92\nTable of Contents \nreturn on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the ACC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. If future recovery of regulatory assets ceases to be probable or a disallowance becomes probable, it would result in a charge to earnings.   \nWe identified Regulatory Accounting, specifically the impact of rate regulation on the financial statements, as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory rate orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets and/or a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, and recent rate orders specific to APS and to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction. Management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential ACC-ordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the ACC, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the impact of rate regulation on the financial statements included the following, among others: \n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs of recently completed plant and costs deferred as regulatory assets and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to regulatory accounting, specifically the impact of rate regulation on the financial statements, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory rate orders issued by the ACC for APS and other public utilities in Arizona, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the ACC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information, regulatory orders and filings, and compared to management’s recorded regulatory assets and liabilities for completeness.\n◦\nWe read the ACC’s approved decision regarding the 2022 Retail Rate Case. \n◦\nWe obtained the Company’s internally prepared memo concluding on the impacts of the ACC’s approved decision regarding the 2022 Retail Rate Case on rates and recorded regulatory balances.\n◦\nWe read and analyzed the minutes of the Boards of Directors of the Company for discussions of changes in legal, regulatory, or business factors which could impact \n93\nTable of Contents \nmanagement’s conclusions with respect to the financial statement impacts of rate regulation.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s assessment of the probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory orders or precedents set by the ACC under similar circumstances. We read the minutes of the Boards of Directors of the Company for discussions of changes in legal, regulatory, or business factors which could impact management’s assessment.\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions \nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based \n102\nTable of Contents \non the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Accounting – Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements — Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the Arizona Corporation Commission (the “ACC”), which has jurisdiction with respect to the rates charged by public service utilities in Arizona. Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as property, plant and equipment; regulatory assets and liabilities; operating revenues; fuel and purchased power; operations and maintenance expense; and depreciation expense.\nThe ACC’s rate-making policies are premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the ACC in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable deferred costs and \n103\nTable of Contents \nreturn on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the ACC will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. If future recovery of regulatory assets ceases to be probable or a disallowance becomes probable, it would result in a charge to earnings.\nWe identified Regulatory Accounting, specifically the impact of rate regulation on the financial statements, as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory rate orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets and/or a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, and recent rate orders specific to APS and to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction. Management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential ACC-ordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the ACC, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the impact of rate regulation on the financial statements included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs of recently completed plant and costs deferred as regulatory assets and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to regulatory accounting, specifically the impact of rate regulation on the financial statements, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory rate orders issued by the ACC for the Company and other public utilities in Arizona, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the ACC’s treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information, regulatory orders and filings, and compared to management’s recorded regulatory assets and liabilities for completeness.\n◦\nWe read the ACC’s approved decision regarding the 2022 Retail Rate Case.\n◦\nWe obtained the Company’s internally prepared memo concluding on the impacts of the ACC’s approved decision regarding the 2022 Retail Rate Case on rates and recorded regulatory balances.\n◦\nWe read and analyzed the minutes of the Boards of Directors of the Company for discussions of changes in legal, regulatory, or business factors which could impact \n104\nTable of Contents \nmanagement’s conclusions with respect to the financial statement impacts of rate regulation.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s assessment of the probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities based on applicable regulatory orders or precedents set by the ACC under similar circumstances. We read the minutes of the Boards of Directors of the Company for discussions of changes in legal, regulatory, or business factors which could impact management’s\n \nassessment.\n/s/ \nDeloitte &

Presentation\n \nPinnacle West is a holding company that conducts business through its subsidiaries, APS, El Dorado and PNW Power.  APS, our wholly-owned subsidiary, is a vertically-integrated electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to substantially all of the state of Arizona, with the major exceptions of about one-half of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the Tucson metropolitan area and Mohave County in northwestern Arizona.  APS accounts for essentially all of our revenues and earnings and is expected to continue to do so.  El Dorado is a wholly-owned subsidiary that invests in energy-related and Arizona community-based ventures.  PNW Power is a wholly-owned subsidiary that was created in September 2023 to hold certain investments in wind and transmission joint projects.  See Note 20 for more information on PNW Power. \n \nBCE was a Pinnacle West subsidiary that was formed in 2014.  On August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement pursuant to which all of our equity interest in BCE was sold. The sale was completed on January 12, 2024.  See Note 20 for more information relating to the sale of BCE.\nPinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries, including APS, El Dorado, and PNW Power, as well as our former subsidiary BCE until its sale.  Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Financial Statements also include the accounts of a VIE relating to a Captive Insurance Cell (“Captive”).  APS’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of APS and certain VIEs relating to the Palo Verde sale leaseback.  Intercompany accounts and transactions between the consolidated companies have been eliminated.\n \nWe consolidate Variable Interest Entities (each a “VIE”) for which we are the primary beneficiary.  We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE through a qualitative analysis that identifies which variable interest holder has the controlling financial interest in the VIE.  In performing our primary beneficiary analysis, we consider all relevant facts and circumstances, including the design and activities of the VIE, the terms of the contracts the VIE has entered into, and which parties participated significantly in the design or redesign of the entity.  We continually evaluate our primary beneficiary conclusions to determine if changes have occurred which would impact our primary beneficiary assessments.  We have determined that APS is the primary beneficiary of certain VIE lessor trusts relating to the Palo Verde sale leaseback, and therefore APS consolidates these entities.  We have also determined that Pinnacle West is the primary beneficiary of a protected captive insurance cell VIE, and therefore Pinnacle West consolidates this insurance cell.  See Note 17 for additional information.\n \nAccounting Records and Use of Estimates\n \nOur accounting records are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \n112\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nRegulatory Accounting\n \nAPS is regulated by the ACC and FERC.  The accompanying financial statements reflect the rate-making policies of these commissions.  As a result, we capitalize certain costs that would be included as expense in the current period by unregulated companies.  Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred and are refundable to customers. \n \nManagement judgments include continually assessing the likelihood of future recovery of regulatory assets and/or a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant, by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction.  This determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in Arizona and is subject to change in the future.  If future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, the assets would be written off as a charge in current period earnings.  Management judgments also include assessing the impact of potential commission-ordered refunds to customers on regulatory liabilities.\n \n \nSee Note 3 for additional information.\n \nElectric Revenues\n \nRevenues primarily consist of activities that are classified as revenues from contracts with customers.  Our electric revenues generally represent a single performance obligation delivered over time.  We have elected to apply the practical expedient that allows us to recognize revenue based on the amount to which we have a right to invoice for services performed. \nWe derive electric revenues primarily from sales of electricity to our regulated retail customers.  Revenues related to the sale of electricity are generally recognized when service is rendered or electricity is delivered to customers.  Unbilled revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue/kWh by customer class to the number of estimated kWhs delivered but not billed.  Differences historically between the actual and estimated unbilled revenues are immaterial.  We exclude sales taxes and franchise fees on electric revenues from both revenue and taxes other than income taxes. \n \nRevenues from our regulated retail customers and non-derivative instruments are reported on a gross basis on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Statements of Income.  In the electricity business, some contracts to purchase electricity are netted against other contracts to sell electricity.  This is called a “book-out” and usually occurs for contracts that have the same terms (quantities, delivery points and delivery periods) and for which power does not flow.  We net these book-outs, which reduces both wholesale revenues and fuel and purchased power costs.\nCertain cost recovery mechanisms may qualify as alternative revenue programs.  For alternative revenue programs that meet specified accounting criteria, we recognize revenues when the specific events permitting billing of the additional revenues have been completed.\nSee Notes 2 and 3 for additional information.\n113\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\n \nThe allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues that will ultimately be uncollectible due to credit loss risk.  The allowance includes a write-off component that is calculated by applying an estimated write-off factor to retail electric revenues.  The write-off factor used to estimate uncollectible accounts is based upon consideration of historical collections experience, the current and forecasted economic environment, changes to our collection policies, and management’s best estimate of future collections success.  \nSee Note 2 for additional information.\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\n \nUtility plant is the term we use to describe the business property and equipment that supports electric service, consisting primarily of generation, transmission, and distribution facilities.  We report utility plant at its original cost, which includes:\n•\nmaterial and labor;\n•\ncontractor costs;\n•\ncapitalized leases;\n•\nconstruction overhead costs (where applicable); and\n•\nAFUDC.\nPinnacle West’s property, plant and equipment included in the December 31, 2024, and 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheets is composed of the following (dollars in thousands):\nProperty, Plant and Equipment:\n2024\n2023\nGeneration\n$\n11,111,915\n \n$\n10,446,291\n \nTransmission\n4,135,970\n \n3,773,253\n \nDistribution\n9,016,843\n \n8,448,293\n \nGeneral plant\n1,596,222\n \n1,543,330\n \nPlant in service and held for future use\n25,860,950\n \n24,211,167\n \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n(\n9,027,426\n)\n(\n8,408,040\n)\nNet\n16,833,524\n \n15,803,127\n \nConstruction work in progress\n1,592,659\n \n1,724,004\n \nPalo Verde sale leaseback, net of accumulated depreciation\n82,556\n \n86,426\n \nIntangible assets, net of accumulated amortization\n591,310\n \n267,110\n \nNuclear fuel, net of accumulated amortization\n97,850\n \n99,490\n \nTotal property, plant and equipment\n$\n19,197,899\n \n$\n17,980,157\n \nProperty, plant and equipment balances and classes for APS are not materially different than Pinnacle West.  \nWe expense the costs of plant outages, major maintenance and routine maintenance as incurred.  We charge retired utility plant to accumulated depreciation.  Liabilities associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets are recognized at fair value as incurred and capitalized as part of the related tangible long-lived assets.  Accretion of the liability due to the passage of time is an operating expense, and \n114\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nthe capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the long-lived asset.  See Note 11 for additional information.\nAPS records a regulatory liability for the excess that has been recovered in regulated rates over the amount calculated in accordance with guidance on accounting for AROs.  APS believes it is probable it will recover in regulated rates, the costs calculated in accordance with this accounting guidance.\n \nWe record depreciation and amortization on utility plant on a straight-line basis over the remaining useful life of the related assets.  The approximate remaining average useful lives of our utility property at December 31, 2024, were as follows:\n•\nSteam generation — \n11\n years;\n•\nNuclear plant — \n25\n years;\n•\nOther generation — \n18\n years;\n•\nTransmission — \n38\n years;\n•\nDistribution — \n33\n years; and\n•\nGeneral plant — \n7\n years.\n \nDepreciation of utility property, plant and equipment is computed on a straight-line, remaining-life basis.\n  Depreciation expense was $\n723\n million in 2024, $\n669\n million in 2023, and $\n632\n million in 2022.  For the years 2022 through 2024, the depreciation rates ranged from a low of \n1.37\n% to a high of \n12.15\n%.  The weighted-average depreciation rate was \n3.13\n% in 2024, \n2.98\n% in 2023, and \n3.03\n% in 2022.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAPS has AROs for its Palo Verde nuclear facilities and certain other generation assets.  The Palo Verde ARO primarily relates to final plant decommissioning.  This obligation is based on the NRC’s requirements for disposal of irradiated property or plant and agreements APS reached with the ACC for final decommissioning of the plant.  The non-nuclear generation AROs primarily relate to requirements for removing portions of those plants at the end of the plant life or lease term and coal ash pond closures.  Some of APS’s transmission and distribution assets have AROs because they are subject to right of way and easement agreements that require final removal.  These agreements have a history of uninterrupted renewal that APS expects to continue.  As a result, APS cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the ARO related to such transmission and distribution assets.  Additionally, APS has aquifer protection permits for some of its generation sites that require the closure of certain facilities at those sites.\nSee Note 11 for further information on Asset Retirement Obligations.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction\n \nAFUDC represents the approximate net composite interest cost of borrowed funds and an allowed return on the equity funds used for construction of regulated utility plant.  Both the debt and equity components of AFUDC are non-cash amounts within the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Plant construction costs, including AFUDC, are recovered in authorized rates through depreciation when completed projects are placed into commercial operation.\n \n115\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nAFUDC was calculated by using a composite rate of \n6.23\n% for 2024, \n6.29\n% for 2023, and \n5.75\n% for 2022.  APS compounds AFUDC semi-annually and ceases to accrue AFUDC when construction work is completed and the property is placed in service.\nOn June 30, 2020, \nFERC \nissued an order granting a waiver request related to the existing AFUDC rate calculation beginning March 1, 2020, through February 28, 2021.  On February 23, 2021, this waiver was extended until September 30, 2021.  On September 21, 2021, it was further extended until March 31, 2022.  The order provided a simplified approach that companies may elect to implement in order to minimize the significant distorted effect on the AFUDC formula resulting from increased short-term debt financing during the COVID-19 pandemic.  APS adopted this simplified approach to computing the AFUDC composite rate by using a simple average of the actual historical short-term debt balances for 2019, instead of current period short-term debt balances, and left all other aspects of the AFUDC formula composite rate calculation unchanged.  This change impacted the AFUDC composite rate in 2021 and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2022.  Furthermore, the change in the composite rate calculation did not impact our accounting treatment for these costs.  The change did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nMaterials and Supplies\n \nAPS values materials, supplies and fossil fuel inventory using a weighted-average cost method.  APS materials, supplies and fossil fuel inventories are carried at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value, unless evidence indicates that the weighted-average cost (even if in excess of market) will be recovered.\n \nFair Value Measurements\n \nWe apply recurring fair value measurements to cash equivalents, derivative instruments, investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trust and other special use funds.  On an annual basis, we apply fair value measurements to plan assets held in our retirement and other benefits plans.  Due to the short-term nature of short-term borrowings, the carrying values of these instruments approximate fair value.  Fair value measurements may also be applied on a nonrecurring basis to other assets and liabilities in certain circumstances such as impairments.  We also disclose fair value information for our long-term debt, which is carried at amortized cost.  See Note 6 for additional information.\n \nFair value is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market which we can access for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between willing market participants on the measurement date.  Inputs to fair value may include observable and unobservable data.  We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.\n \nWe determine fair market value using observable inputs such as actively-quoted prices for identical instruments when available.  When actively-quoted prices are not available for the identical instruments, we use other observable inputs, such as prices for similar instruments, other corroborative market information, or prices provided by other external sources.  For options, long-term contracts, and other contracts for which observable price data are not available, we use models and other valuation methods, which may incorporate unobservable inputs to determine fair market value.\n116\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nThe use of models and other valuation methods to determine fair market value often requires subjective and complex judgment.  Actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods.\nSee Note 12 for additional information about fair value measurements.\nDerivative Accounting\n \nWe are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the commodity price and transportation costs of electricity, natural gas, coal and in interest rates.  We manage risks associated with market volatility by utilizing various physical and financial instruments including futures, forwards, options, and swaps.  As part of our overall risk management program, we may use derivative instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas as well as interest rate risk.  The changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged transactions.  We also enter into derivative instruments for economic hedging purposes.  Contracts that have the same terms (quantities, delivery points and delivery periods) and for which power does not flow are netted, which reduces both revenues and fuel and purchased power expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income, but does not impact our financial condition, net income, or cash flows.\n \nWe account for our derivative contracts in accordance with derivatives and hedging guidance, which requires all derivatives not qualifying for a scope exception to be measured at fair value on the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities.  Transactions with counterparties that have master netting arrangements are reported net on the balance sheet.\n  \nSee Note 15 for additional information about our derivative instruments.\n \nLoss Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities\n \nPinnacle West and APS are involved in certain legal and environmental matters that arise in the normal course of business.  Contingent losses and environmental liabilities are recorded when it is determined that it is probable that a loss has occurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  When a range of the probable loss exists and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, Pinnacle West and APS record a loss contingency at the minimum amount in the range.  Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are expensed as incurred.\n \nThe Captive’s contingent losses may include an amount for losses incurred but not reported (“IBNR”).  A reserve for IBNR is based upon a loss analysis prepared using actuarial assumptions and techniques.  Such liabilities are necessarily based on estimates and the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amount provided.  The methods for making such estimates and for establishing the resulting liability are continually reviewed, and any adjustments for the review process as well as differences between estimates and ultimate payments are reflected in earnings currently.\n  As of     December 31, 2024, no IBNR reserve relating to our captive insurance cell has been recorded.  See Note 17. \n117\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nRetirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\n \nPinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries, in addition to a non-qualified pension plan.  We also sponsor another postretirement benefit plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries that provides medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees.  Pension and other postretirement benefit expense are determined by actuarial valuations, based on assumptions that are evaluated annually.\n  \nSee Note 7 for additional information on pension and other postretirement benefits.\n \nNuclear Fuel\n \nAPS amortizes nuclear fuel by using the unit-of-production method.  The unit-of-production method is based on actual physical usage.  APS divides the cost of the fuel by the estimated number of thermal units it expects to produce with that fuel.  APS then multiplies that rate by the number of thermal units produced within the current period.  This calculation determines the current period nuclear fuel expense.\n \nAPS also charges nuclear fuel expense for the interim storage and permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel.  The DOE is responsible for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and charged APS $\n0.001\n per kWh of nuclear generation through May 2014, at which point the DOE reduced the fee to zero.  In accordance with a settlement agreement with the DOE in August 2014 for interim storage, we accrued a receivable and an offsetting regulatory liability through the settlement period ended December of 2024.\n  See Note 10 for information on spent nuclear fuel disposal costs.\n \nIncome Taxes\n \nIncome taxes are provided using the asset and liability approach prescribed by guidance relating to accounting for income taxes and are based on currently enacted tax rates.  We file our federal income tax return on a consolidated basis, and we file our state income tax returns on a consolidated or unitary basis.  In accordance with our intercompany tax sharing agreement, federal and state income taxes are allocated to each first-tier subsidiary as though each first-tier subsidiary filed a separate income tax return.  Any difference between that method and the consolidated (and unitary) income tax liability is attributed to the parent company.  The income tax accounts reflect the tax and interest associated with management’s estimate of the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than \n50\n% likely of being realized upon settlement for all known and measurable tax exposures.\n  See Note 4 for additional discussion. \n118\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nCash and Cash Equivalents\n     We consider cash equivalents to be highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at acquisition.\n \nThe following table summarizes supplemental Pinnacle West cash flow information for each of the last three years (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash paid during the period for:\nIncome taxes, net of refunds\n$\n133,968\n \n$\n8,788\n \n$\n46,227\n \nInterest, net of amounts capitalized\n360,349\n \n310,996\n \n245,271\n \nSignificant non-cash investing and financing activities:\nAccrued capital expenditures\n$\n257,494\n \n$\n206,269\n \n$\n114,999\n \nDividends accrued but not yet paid\n106,592\n \n99,813\n \n97,895\n \nBCE Sale non-cash consideration (Note 20)\n—\n \n28,262\n \n—\n \nThe following table summarizes supplemental APS cash flow information for each of the last three years (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash paid during the period for:\nIncome taxes, net of refunds\n$\n179,013\n \n$\n21,734\n \n$\n95,985\n \nInterest, net of amounts capitalized\n299,799\n \n267,261\n \n227,159\n \nSignificant non-cash investing and financing activities:\nAccrued capital expenditures\n$\n257,494\n \n$\n206,269\n \n$\n116,533\n \nDividends accrued but not yet paid\n107,200\n \n99,800\n \n97,900\n \nIntangible Assets\n \nWe have separately disclosed intangible assets on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The intangible assets relate primarily to APS’s internal-use software.  We have no goodwill recorded.  The intangible assets are amortized over their finite useful lives.\n  Amortization expense was $\n136\n million in 2024, $\n90\n million in 2023, and $\n84\n million in 2022.  Estimated amortization expense on existing intangible assets over the next five years is $\n106\n million in 2025, $\n77\n million in 2026, $\n43\n million in 2027, $\n25\n million in 2028, and $\n14\n million in 2029.  At December 31, 2024, the weighted-average remaining amortization period for intangible assets was \n5\n years.\n \nInvestments\n \nEl Dorado holds investments in both debt and equity securities.  Investments in debt securities are generally accounted for as held-to-maturity and investments in equity securities are accounted for using either the equity method (if significant influence) or the measurement alternative for investments without readily determinable fair values (if less than \n20\n% ownership and no significant influence).\n119\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nPNW Power holds investments in equity securities.  Investments in equity securities are accounted for using either the equity method (if significant influence) or the measurement alternative for investments without readily determinable fair values (if less than \n20\n% ownership and no significant influence).\n \nOur investments in the nuclear decommissioning trusts, and other special use funds, are accounted for in accordance with guidance on accounting for investments in debt and equity securities.  See Notes 12 and 18 for more information on these investments.\nLeases\nWe determine if an agreement is a lease at contract inception.  A lease is defined as a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  To control the use of an identified asset an entity must have both a right to obtain substantially all of the benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset.  If we determine an agreement is a lease, and we are the lessee, we recognize a right-of-use lease asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date.  Lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the fixed lease payments over the lease term.  To present value lease liabilities we use the implicit rate in the lease if the information is readily available, otherwise we use our incremental borrowing rate determined at lease commencement.  Our incremental borrowing rate is based on the rate of interest we would have to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.  When measuring right-of-use assets and lease liabilities we exclude variable lease payments, other than those that depend on an index or rate or are in-substance fixed payments.  For short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less, we do not recognize a right-of-use lease asset or lease liability.  We recognize operating lease expense using a straight-line pattern over the periods of use. \nAPS enters into purchased power contracts that may contain leases.  This occurs when a purchased power agreement designates a specific power plant or facility, APS obtains substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the facility and has the right to direct the use of the facility.  Purchased power lease contracts may also include energy storage facilities.  Lease costs relating to purchased power lease contracts are reported in fuel and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Income and are subject to recovery under the PSA or RES.  See Note \n3\n.  We also may enter into lease agreements related to vehicles, office space, land, and other equipment.  See Note \n8\n for information on our lease agreements.\nBusiness Segments\n \nPinnacle West’s reportable business segment is our regulated electricity segment, which consists of traditional regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses (primarily electric service to Native Load customers) and related activities and includes electricity generation, transmission, and distribution.  Our reportable segment activities are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, APS.  All other operating segment activities are insignificant to Pinnacle West.\n120\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nFor segment reporting purposes, Pinnacle West’s Chief Executive Officer performs the function of chief operating decision maker (“CODM”).  The CODM uses net income to measure an operating segment’s profitability.    When assessing the performance of an operating segment, and making decisions about allocating resources, the CODM evaluates net income actual results compared to budget.  Net income is also used when implementing strategic initiatives and selecting projects to meet business objectives.  Our reportable segment’s revenue streams are dependent upon regulated rate recovery, which is a primary factor in how we identify operating segments. \n For information on our reportable business segment’s revenues, significant expenses, net income, assets, and other reportable segment items, see the APS’s Consolidated Income Statements, APS Consolidated Balance Sheets, and APS Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n \nThe following tables reconcile our reportable segment’s revenues, significant expenses, net income, and assets to the Pinnacle West Consolidated amounts (dollars in millions): \nYear Ended December 31,  \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRegulated Electricity Segment\nOther \nPinnacle West Consolidated\nRegulated Electricity Segment\nOther \nPinnacle West Consolidated\nRegulated Electricity Segment\nOther \nPinnacle West Consolidated\nOperating Revenues\n$\n5,125\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5,125\n \n$\n4,696\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4,696\n \n$\n4,324\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4,324\n \nFuel & Purchase Power \n(\n1,823\n)\n—\n \n(\n1,823\n)\n(\n1,793\n)\n—\n \n(\n1,793\n)\n(\n1,629\n)\n—\n \n(\n1,629\n)\nOperations & Maintenance\n(\n1,159\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n1,165\n)\n(\n1,044\n)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n1,059\n)\n(\n974\n)\n(\n13\n)\n(\n987\n)\nDepreciation & Amortization \n(\n895\n)\n—\n \n(\n895\n)\n(\n794\n)\n—\n \n(\n794\n)\n(\n753\n)\n—\n \n(\n753\n)\nTaxes other than income taxes \n(\n227\n)\n—\n \n(\n227\n)\n(\n224\n)\n—\n \n(\n224\n)\n(\n220\n)\n—\n \n(\n220\n)\nPension and other postretirement non-service credits, net\n49\n \n—\n \n49\n \n42\n \n(\n1\n)\n41\n \n99\n \n(\n1\n)\n98\n \nOther income and expenses, net (a)\n28\n \n22\n \n50\n \n60\n \n—\n \n60\n \n22\n \n(\n23\n)\n(\n1\n)\nInterest expense and costs\n(\n312\n)\n(\n65\n)\n(\n377\n)\n(\n285\n)\n(\n46\n)\n(\n331\n)\n(\n236\n)\n(\n20\n)\n(\n256\n)\nIncome Taxes\n(\n127\n)\n16\n \n(\n111\n)\n(\n94\n)\n17\n \n(\n77\n)\n(\n91\n)\n16\n \n(\n75\n)\nLess: income related to noncontrolling interest\n(\n17\n)\n—\n \n(\n17\n)\n(\n17\n)\n—\n \n(\n17\n)\n(\n17\n)\n—\n \n(\n17\n)\nNet Income (loss) \n$\n642\n \n$\n(\n33\n)\n$\n609\n \n$\n547\n \n$\n(\n45\n)\n$\n502\n \n$\n525\n \n$\n(\n41\n)\n$\n484\n \n(a)      See Note 16 for additional details regarding other income and other expenses.

These activities primarily consist of managing fuel and purchased power risks in connection with the cost of serving our retail customers’ energy requirements.  We may also sell into the wholesale markets generation that is not needed for APS’s retail load.  Our wholesale activities and tariff rates are regulated by FERC.\nRevenue Activities\nOur revenues primarily consist of activities that are classified as revenues from contracts with customers.  We derive our revenues from contracts with customers primarily from sales of electricity to our regulated retail customers.  Revenues from contracts with customers also include wholesale and transmission activities.  Our revenues from contracts with customers for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n5,073\n million, $\n4,651\n million, and $\n4,302\n million, respectively.\n122\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nWe have certain revenues that do not meet the specific accounting criteria to be classified as revenues from contracts with customers.  For the year ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 our revenues that do not qualify as revenue from contracts with customers were $\n52\n million, $\n45\n million, and $\n22\n million, respectively.  This amount includes revenues related to certain regulatory cost recovery mechanisms that are considered alternative revenue programs.  We recognize revenue associated with alternative revenue programs when specific events permitting recognition are completed.  Certain amounts associated with alternative revenue programs will subsequently be billed to customers; however, we do not reclassify billed amounts into revenue from contracts with customers.  See Note 3 for a discussion of our regulatory cost recovery mechanisms.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\n \nThe allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues that will ultimately be uncollectible due to credit loss risk.  The allowance includes a write-off component that is calculated by applying an estimated write-off factor to retail electric revenues.  The write-off factor used to estimate uncollectible accounts is based upon consideration of historical collections experience, the current and forecasted economic environment, changes to our collection policies, and management’s best estimate of future collections success.  We continue to monitor the impacts of our disconnection policies, payment arrangements, among other considerations impacting our estimated write-off factor, and allowance for doubtful accounts. \nThe following table provides a rollforward of Pinnacle West’s allowance for doubtful accounts (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at beginning of period\n$\n22,433\n \n$\n23,778\n \n$\n25,354\n \nBad debt expense\n35,799\n \n23,399\n \n17,006\n \nActual write-offs\n(\n33,383\n)\n(\n24,744\n)\n(\n18,582\n)\nBalance at end of period\n$\n24,849\n \n$\n22,433\n \n$\n23,778\n \n3.    \nRegulatory Matters\nAPS expects to file an application with the ACC for its next general rate case mid-year 2025 and is continuing to evaluate the timing of such filing.\n2022 Retail Rate Case \nAPS filed an application with the ACC on October 28, 2022 (the “2022 Rate Case”) seeking an increase in annual retail base rates.\nOn January 25, 2024, an Administrative Law Judge issued a Recommended Opinion and Order (“ROO”) in the 2022 Rate Case, as corrected on February 6, 2024 (the “2022 Rate Case ROO”).  The 2022 Rate Case ROO recommended, among other things, (i) a $\n523.1\n million increase in the annual base rate revenue requirement, (ii) a \n9.55\n% return on equity, (iii) a \n0.25\n% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of \n4.36\n%, (v) 12 months of post-\n123\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \ntest year plant and the inclusion of the Four Corners Effluent Limitations Guideline (“ELG”) project, (vi) the approval of APS’s System Reliability Benefit (“SRB”) proposal with certain procedural and other modifications, (vii) no additional Coal Community Transition (“CCT”) funding, (viii) a \n5.0\n% return on the prepaid pension asset and a return of \n5.35\n% on the OPEB liability, and (ix) no disallowances on APS’s coal contracts.  \nThe 2022 Rate Case ROO also recommended a number of changes to existing adjustors, including (i) the approval of modified DSM performance incentives and the requested DSM transfer to base rates, (ii) the retention of $\n1.9\n million of Renewable Energy Adjustment Charge (“REAC”) in the adjustor rather than base rates, (iii) a partial transfer of $\n27.1\n million of LFCR funds to base rates, and (iv) the adoption of an increase in the annual PSA cap to $\n0.006\n/kWh.  \nOn February 22, 2024, the ACC approved a number of amendments to the 2022 Rate Case ROO that resulted in, among other things, (i) an approximately $\n491.7\n million increase in the annual base revenue requirement, (ii) a \n9.55\n% return on equity, (iii) a \n0.25\n% return on the increment of fair value rate base greater than original cost, (iv) an effective fair value rate of return of \n4.39\n%, (v) a return set at the Company’s weighted average cost of capital on the net prepaid pension asset and net other post-employment benefit liability in rate base, (vi) an adjustment to generation maintenance and outage expense to reflect a more reasonable level of test year costs, (vii) approval of the SRB mechanism with modifications to customer notifications, procedural timelines and the inclusion of any qualifying technology and fuel source bid received through an all-source request for proposal (“ASRFP”), and (viii) recovery of all DSM costs through the DSM Adjustment Charge (“DSMAC”) rather than through base rates.\nThe ACC’s decision results in an expected total net annual revenue increase for APS of approximately $\n253.4\n million and a roughly \n8\n% increase to the typical residential customer’s bill.  The ACC issued the final order for the 2022 Rate Case on March 5, 2024, with the new rates becoming effective for all service rendered on or after March 8, 2024.\nSix intervenors and the Attorney General of Arizona requested rehearing on various issues included in the ACC’s decision, such as the grid access charge (“GAC”) for solar customers, the SRB, and CCT funding.  On April 15, 2024, the ACC granted, in part, the rehearing applications of the Attorney General, Arizona Solar Energy Industries Association, Solar Energy Industries Association, and Vote Solar specifically to review whether the GAC rate is just and reasonable, including whether it should be higher or lower, whether the GAC rate constitutes a discriminatory fee to solar customers, and whether omission of a GAC charge is discriminatory to non-solar customers.  All other applications for rehearing were denied.    A limited rehearing was held October 28 through November 1.  Following the limited rehearing, an Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO (the “Limited Rehearing ROO”) on December 3, 2024.  The Limited Rehearing ROO recommended affirming the GAC as just and reasonable and that the GAC is not discriminatory to solar customers and the absence of a GAC is not discriminatory to non-solar customers.  On December 17, 2024, the ACC approved the Limited Rehearing ROO with an amendment that requires APS in its next rate case to propose a revenue allocation based on a site-load cost of service study in order to bring further parity in revenue collection between solar and non-solar customers.  SEIA, AriSEIA, Vote Solar, the Arizona Attorney General, and two individual customers have filed requests for rehearing of the Commission’s December 17, 2024 decision on the rehearing.  The Commission has taken no action on these requests.  In addition, each of these parties have subsequently filed notices of appeal to the Arizona Court of Appeals seeking review of the Commission’s decisions regarding the GAC and on rehearing.  APS cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings.\n124\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \n2019 Retail Rate Case \nOn October 31, 2019, APS filed an application with the ACC for an annual increase in retail base rates (the “2019 Rate Case”).  On August 2, 2021, an Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO in the 2019 Rate Case (the “2019 Rate Case ROO”) and issued corrections on September 10 and September 20, 2021.\nOn November 2, 2021, the ACC approved the 2019 Rate Case ROO, with various amendments, that resulted in, among other things, (i) a return on equity of \n8.70\n%, which included a \n20\n basis points penalty; (ii) the recovery of the deferral and rate base effects of the operating costs and construction of the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”) project, with the exception of $\n215.5\n million (see “Four Corners SCR Cost Recovery” below); (iii) the CCT plan including the following components: (a) a payment of $\n1\n million to the Hopi Tribe within \n60\n days of the 2019 Rate Case decision, (b) a payment of $\n10\n million over \nthree years\n to the Navajo Nation, (c) a payment of $\n0.5\n million to the Navajo County communities within \n60\n days of the 2019 Rate Case decision, (d) up to $\n1.25\n million for electrification of homes and businesses on the Hopi reservation, and (e) up to $\n1.25\n million for the electrification of homes and businesses on the Navajo Nation reservation; and (iv) a change in the residential on-peak time-of-use period from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. to 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.  The 2019 Rate Case ROO, as amended, resulted in a total annual revenue decrease for APS of $\n4.8\n million, excluding temporary payments and expenditures, under the CCT plan.  \nConsistent with the 2019 Rate Case decision, APS completed the following payments that are being recovered through rates related to the CCT: (i) $\n10\n million to the Navajo Nation; (ii) $\n0.5\n million to the Navajo County communities; and (iii) $\n1\n million to the Hopi Tribe.  Consistent with APS’s commitment to the impacted communities, APS has also completed the following payments: (i) $\n1.5\n million to the Navajo Nation for CCT; (ii) $\n1.1\n million to the Navajo County communities for CCT and economic development; and (iii) $\n1.25\n million to the Hopi Tribe for CCT and economic development.  The ACC also authorized $\n1.25\n million to be spent for electrification of homes and businesses on each of the Navajo Nation and Hopi reservations.  Expenditure of the recoverable funds for electrification of homes and businesses on the Navajo Nation and the Hopi reservations is contingent upon completion of a census of the unelectrified homes and businesses in each that are also within APS service territory.  The census work was completed in November 2022 and disbursement of the funds for electrification of homes and businesses is planned to be finalized after discussions with the Navajo Nation and the Hopi Tribe are completed.  On February 22, 2024, the ACC voted to not approve any further CCT funding.\nAPS filed a Notice of Direct Appeal to the Arizona Court of Appeals on December 17, 2021 requesting review of certain aspects of the 2019 Rate Case.  On March 6, 2023, the Court issued its opinion in this matter, affirming in part and reversing in part the ACC’s decision in the 2019 Rate Case.  The Court vacated the \n20\n basis points penalty included in the ACC’s allowed return on equity, as the Court determined the use of customer service metrics to justify the reduction exceeded the ACC’s ratemaking authority.  Additionally, the Court vacated the disallowance of $\n215.5\n million of APS’s Four Corners SCR investment.  The Court remanded the issue to the ACC for further proceedings.  \nOn June 14, 2023, APS and the ACC Legal Division filed a joint resolution with the ACC to allow recovery of the $\n215.5\n million in costs related to the installation of the Four Corners SCR, a reversal of the \n20\n basis points reduction to APS’s return on equity from \n8.9\n% to \n8.7\n% as a result of the 2019 Rate Case decision, and recovery of $\n59.6\n million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and June 20, 2023.\n \nOn June 21, 2023, the ACC approved the joint resolution and proposals therein for recovery through \n125\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nthe Court Resolution Surcharge (“CRS”) mechanism, which became effective on July 1, 2023.\n \nSee “Court Resolution Surcharge” below for more information.\n \nRegulatory Lag Docket\nOn January 5, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to explore the possibility of modifications to the ACC’s historical test year rules.  The ACC requested comments and held two workshops exploring ways to reduce regulatory lag, including alternative ratemaking structures such as future test years, hybrid test years, and formula rates.  On December 3, 2024, the ACC approved a policy statement regarding formula rate plans.  The policy statement allows regulated utilities to propose formula rate plans in future rate cases.  Proposed plans must be based on a historical test year, include an annual update with a true-up and an earnings test to ensure a utility earns within a 20 basis points band of its authorized return on equity.  Proposed plans should also include an annual meeting and challenge periods for stakeholder feedback.  Utilities that implement formula rates also must file a full rate case at least every five years unless an alternate schedule is set by the ACC.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nCost Recovery Mechanisms\n \nAPS has received regulatory decisions that allow for more timely recovery of certain costs outside of a general retail rate case through the following recovery mechanisms.\n \nSee “2022 Retail Rate Case”\n \nabove for modifications of adjustment mechanisms in the 2022 Rate Case.\n \nRenewable Energy Standard\n.\n  In 2006, the ACC approved the RES.  Under the RES, electric utilities that are regulated by the ACC must supply an increasing percentage of their retail electric energy sales from eligible renewable resources, including, for example, solar, wind, biomass, biogas and geothermal technologies.  In order to achieve these requirements, the ACC allows APS to include a RES surcharge as part of customer bills to recover the approved amounts for use on renewable energy projects.  Each year, APS is required to file a \nfive\n-year implementation plan with the ACC and seek approval for funding the upcoming year’s RES budget.\nIn June 2021, the ACC adopted a clean energy rules package which would require APS to meet certain clean energy standards and technology procurement mandates, obtain approval for its action plan included in its Integrated Resource Plan (“IRP”), and seek cost recovery in a rate process. \n \nSince the adopted clean energy rules differed substantially from the original ROO, supplemental rulemaking procedures were required before the rules could become effective.\n \nOn January 26, 2022, the ACC reversed its prior decision and declined to send the final draft energy rules through the rulemaking process.\n \nInstead, the ACC opened a new docket to consider ASRFP requirements and the IRP process.\n \nSee “Energy Modernization Plan” below for more information.\nOn July 1, 2021, APS filed its 2022 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $\n93.1\n million.\n \nAPS filed an amended 2022 RES Implementation Plan on December 9, 2021, with a proposed budget of $\n100.5\n million.\n \nThis budget included funding for programs to comply with the decision in the 2019 Rate Case, including the ACC authorizing spending $\n20\n million to $\n30\n million in capital costs for the continuation of the APS Solar Communities program each year for a period of \nthree years\n from the effective date of the 2019 Rate Case decision.\n \nAPS’s budget proposal supported existing approved projects and commitments and requested a waiver of the RES residential and non-residential distributed energy requirements for 2022.\n \nOn May 18, 2022, the ACC approved the 2022 \n126\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nRES Implementation Plan, including an amendment requiring a stakeholder working group convene to develop a community solar program for the ACC’s consideration at a future date.\n \nOn July 1, 2022, APS filed its 2023 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $\n86.2\n million, excluding any funding offsets.  This budget contained funding for programs to comply with ACC-approved initiatives, including the 2019 Rate Case decision.  APS’s budget proposal supported existing approved projects and commitments and requested a waiver of the RES residential and non-residential distributed energy requirements for 2023.  On November 10, 2022, the ACC approved the 2023 RES Implementation Plan, including APS’s requested waiver of the distributed energy requirement for 2023.\nOn June 30, 2023, APS filed its 2024 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $\n95.1\n million.\n \nAPS’s budget proposal supports existing approved projects and commitments and requests a waiver of the RES renewable energy credit requirements to demonstrate compliance with the Annual Renewable Energy Requirement for 2023.\n \nThe ACC has not yet ruled on the 2024 RES Implementation Plan.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.\nOn July 1, 2024, APS filed its 2025 RES Implementation Plan and proposed a budget of approximately $\n92.7\n million.\n \nAPS’s budget proposal supports existing approved projects and commitments and requests a waiver of the RES renewable energy credit requirements to demonstrate compliance with the Annual Renewable Energy Requirement for 2024.\n \nThe ACC has not yet ruled on the 2025 RES Implementation Plan.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. \nOn June 14, 2021, APS filed an application for approval of its Green Power Partners Program (“GPP”).  On September 1, 2021, the ACC approved the application.  On June 28, 2024, APS filed an application for approval of modifications to the GPP and requested a renewable generation renewable energy credits waiver.  The ACC has not yet ruled on the GPP application.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding. \nDemand Side Management Adjustor Charge\n.\n  The ACC Electric Energy Efficiency Standards require APS to submit a DSM Implementation Plan annually for review and approval by the ACC.\n \nVerified energy savings from APS’s resource savings projects can be counted toward compliance with the Electric Energy Efficiency Standards; however, APS is not allowed to count savings from systems savings projects toward determination of the achievement of performance incentives, nor may APS include savings from these system savings projects in the calculation of its LFCR mechanism.\n \nSee below for discussion of the LFCR.\nOn December 17, 2021, APS filed\n its 2022 D\nSM Implementation Plan in accordance with an extension granted in 2021.  The 2022 DSM Plan requested a budget of \n$\n78.4\n million and represents an increase of approximately $\n14\n million in DSM spending above 2021.\n \nOn November 10, 2022, the ACC approved the 2022 DSM Implementation Plan, including a proposed performance incentive.\nOn June 1, 2022, APS filed its 2023 Transportation Electrification Plan (“2023 TE Plan”).  The 2023 TE Plan detailed APS’s efforts to support transportation electrification in Arizona, including the Take Charge AZ Pilot Program and customer education and outreach related to transportation electrification.  Subsequently, APS filed an amended 2023 TE Plan on November 30, 2022, that included a request for a $\n5\n million budget.  On December 12, 2023, the ACC approved the 2023 TE Plan without including the \n127\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nTake Charge AZ Program and its budget going forward, but allowed APS to complete projects already underway.  Additionally, the ACC discontinued the residential EV SmartCharger rebate and approved modifications to the EV rate plan.\nOn November 30, 2022, APS filed its 2023 DSM Implementation Plan, which requested a budget of $\n88\n million.  On May 31, 2023, APS filed an amended 2023 DSM Implementation Plan.  The amended plan maintained the originally proposed budget of $\n88\n million.  Subsequent to filing the amended 2023 DSM Implementation Plan and prior to the ACC approving it, on November 30, 2023, APS filed its 2024 DSM Implementation Plan.  The 2024 DSM Implementation Plan requested a total budget of $\n91.5\n million and incorporated all elements of the amended 2023 DSM Implementation Plan as well as the 2024 TE Implementation Plan.  On April 26, 2024, APS filed an amendment to the 2024 DSM Implementation Plan.  The amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan includes an updated budget of $\n90.9\n million to reflect removal of incentive funds for the Level 2 Smart Charger rebate within the EV Charging Demand Management Pilot, an update on the performance incentive calculation, and the withdrawal of tranches two and three of the residential battery pilot.  The ACC has not yet ruled on the amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan.  In a letter filed May 31, 2024, APS said it would not file a 2025 DSM Implementation Plan pending ACC review of the amended 2024 DSM Implementation Plan.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this proceeding.\nPower Supply Adjustor Mechanism and Balance. \n The PSA provides for the adjustment of retail rates to reflect variations primarily in retail fuel and purchased power costs.  The PSA is subject to specified parameters and procedures, including the following:\n•\nAPS records deferrals for recovery or refund to the extent actual retail fuel and purchased power costs vary from the Base Fuel Rate;\n•\nan adjustment to the PSA rate is made annually each February 1 (unless otherwise approved by the ACC) and goes into effect automatically unless suspended by the ACC;\n•\nthe PSA uses a forward-looking estimate of fuel and purchased power costs to set the annual PSA rate, which is reconciled to actual costs experienced for each PSA Year (February 1 through January 31) (see the following bullet point);\n•\nthe PSA rate includes (a) a “forward component,” under which APS recovers or refunds differences between expected fuel and purchased power costs for the upcoming calendar year and those embedded in the Base Fuel Rate; (b) a “historical component,” under which differences between actual fuel and purchased power costs and those recovered or refunded through the combination of the Base Fuel Rate and the forward component are recovered during the next PSA Year; and (c) a “transition component,” under which APS may seek mid-year PSA changes due to large variances between actual fuel and purchased power costs and the combination of the Base Fuel Rate and the forward component; and\n•\nthe PSA rate may not be increased or decreased more than $\n0.006\n per kWh in a year without permission of the ACC.\n128\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nThe following table shows the changes in the deferred fuel and purchased power regulatory asset for 2024 and 2023 (dollars in thousands):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nBalance at beginning of period\n$\n463,195\n \n$\n460,561\n \nDeferred fuel and purchased power costs\n250,288\n \n549,877\n \nAmounts charged to customers\n(\n425,886\n)\n(\n547,243\n)\nBalance at end of period\n$\n287,597\n \n$\n463,195\n \nOn November 30, 2021, APS filed its PSA rate for the PSA year beginning February 1, 2022.\n \nThat rate was $\n0.007544\n per kWh, which consisted of a forward component of $(\n0.004842\n) per kWh and a historical component of $\n0.012386\n per kWh.\n \nThe 2022 PSA rate was a $\n0.004\n per kWh increase compared to the 2021 PSA year, which is the maximum permitted under the Plan of Administration for the PSA.\n \nThese rates went into effect as filed on February 1, 2022.\nOn April 1, 2022, the ACC filed a final report of its third-party audit findings regarding APS’s fuel and purchased power costs for the period January 2019 through January 2021.\n \nThe report contained an in-depth review of APS’s fuel and purchased power contracts, its monthly fuel accounting activities, its forecasting and dispatching procedures, and its monthly PSA filings, among other fuel-related activities.\n \nThe report found that APS’s fuel processing accounting practices, dispatching procedures, and procedures for hedging activity were reasonable and appropriate.\n \nThe report included several recommendations for the ACC’s consideration, including review of current contracts, maintenance schedules, and certain changes and improvements to the schedules in APS’s monthly PSA filings.\n \nOn December 27, 2022, ACC Staff filed a proposed order supporting adoption of the recommendations in the third-party audit report, and the ACC approved the proposed order on February 22, 2023.\nOn November 30, 2022, APS filed its PSA rate for the PSA year beginning February 1, 2023.  In this filing, APS also requested that one of three different options be adopted to address the growing undercollected PSA balance.  On February 23, 2023, the ACC approved an overall PSA rate of $\n0.019074\n per kWh, which consisted of a forward component of $(\n0.005527\n) per kWh, a historical component of $\n0.013071\n per kWh and a transition component of $\n0.011530\n per kWh, that will continue until further notice of the ACC.\n \nThe rate became effective with the first billing cycle in March 2023 and is designed to bring the PSA balancing account to near-zero over a \n24\n-month period.\n \nOn November 30, 2023, APS notified the ACC that it will be maintaining the current PSA rate of $\n0.019074\n per kWh and an updated PSA adjustment schedule would not be filed at that time.  In Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case, the ACC approved a permanent increase in the annual PSA adjustor rate cap from $\n0.004\n per kWh to $\n0.006\n per kWh and a requirement that APS report to the ACC for possible action when the overall PSA balance reaches $\n100\n million.  As part of the 2022 Rate Case decision, the ACC also approved an overall PSA rate of $\n0.011977\n per kWh, which consisted of a forward component of $(\n0.012624\n) per kWh, a historical component of $\n0.013071\n per kWh, and a transition component of $\n0.011530\n per kWh.  The overall PSA rate was reduced to offset an increase in base fuel prices.  The rate became effective on   March 8, 2024.\nOn November 27, 2024, APS filed its PSA rate for the PSA year beginning February 1, 2025.  The overall PSA rate of $\n0.013977\n per kWh consists of a forward component of $(\n0.000281\n) per kWh, a \n129\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nhistorical component of $\n0.008728\n per kWh, and a transition component of $\n0.005530\n.  This overall PSA rate is an increase of $\n0.002\n per kWh over the prior overall rate approved in the 2022 Rate Case decision, and it is below the annual PSA rate increase cap of $\n0.006\n per kWh.  On February 5, 2025, the ACC voted to approve this request, with a rate effective date of the first billing cycle in March 2025.\nEnvironmental Improvement Surcharge.\n  On March 5, 2024, the ACC approved the elimination of the EIS, and the surcharge is no longer in effect.  The EIS permitted APS to recover the capital carrying costs (rate of return, depreciation and taxes) plus incremental operations and maintenance expenses associated with environmental improvements made outside of a test year to comply with environmental standards set by federal, state, tribal, or local laws and regulations.  APS’s February 1, 2023, EIS application requested an increase in the charge to $\n14.7\n million, or $\n3.3\n million over the prior-period charge.\n \nOn March 10, 2023, APS filed an amended application requesting an EIS charge of $\n4.0\n million, a decrease of $\n10.7\n million from the February EIS request, and a decrease of $\n7.5\n million from the prior-period charge.\n \nThe revised 2023 EIS became effective with the first billing cycle in April 2023; however, with the elimination of the surcharge, it is no longer in effect, and any remaining amounts are being collected through base rates.\n \nTransmission Rates, Transmission Cost Adjustor and Other Transmission Matters\n. \n APS’s retail transmission charges’ formula rate is updated each year effective June 1 on the basis of APS’s actual cost of service, as disclosed in APS’s FERC Form 1 report for the previous fiscal year.  Items to be updated include actual capital expenditures made as compared with previous projections, transmission revenue credits and other items.  APS reviews the proposed formula rate filing amounts with the ACC Staff.  Any items or adjustments which are not agreed to by APS and the ACC Staff can remain in dispute until settled or litigated with FERC.  Settlement or litigated resolution of disputed issues could require an extended period of time and could have a significant effect on the Retail Transmission Charges because any adjustment, though applied prospectively, may be calculated to account for previously over- or under-collected amounts.\n \nThe resolution of proposed adjustments can result in significant volatility in the revenues to be collected. \nEffective June 1, 2022, APS’s annual wholesale transmission revenue requirement for all users of its transmission system decreased by approximately $\n33\n million for the 12-month period beginning June 1, 2022, in accordance with the FERC-approved formula.\n \nOf this net amount, wholesale customer rates decreased by approximately $\n6.4\n million and retail customer rates would have decreased by approximately $\n26.6\n million.\n \nHowever, since changes in Retail Transmission Charges are reflected through the TCA after consideration of transmission recovery in retail base rates and the ACC-approved balancing account, the retail revenue requirement decreased by $\n2.4\n million, resulting in a reduction to the residential rate and increases to commercial rates.\n \nAn adjustment to APS’s retail rates to recover FERC-approved transmission charges went into effect automatically on June 1, 2022.\nEffective June 1, 2023, APS’s annual wholesale transmission revenue requirement for all users of its transmission system increased by approximately $\n34.7\n million for the 12-month period beginning    June 1, 2023, in accordance with the FERC-approved formula.\n \nOf this net amount, wholesale customer rates increased by approximately $\n20.7\n million and retail customer rates would have increased by approximately $\n14\n million.\n \nHowever, since changes in Retail Transmission Charges are reflected through the TCA after consideration of transmission recovery in retail base rates and the ACC-approved balancing account, the retail revenue requirement decreased by $\n10\n million, resulting in reductions to the residential \n130\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nand commercial rates.\n \nAn adjustment to APS’s retail rates to recover FERC-approved transmission charges went into effect automatically on June 1, 2023.\nEffective June 1, 2024, APS’s annual wholesale transmission revenue requirement for all users of its transmission system increased by approximately $\n27.4\n million for the 12-month period beginning    June 1, 2024 in accordance with the FERC-approved formula.  Of this net amount, wholesale customer rates increased by approximately $\n16.6\n million and retail customer rates would have increased by approximately $\n10.8\n million. \n \nHowever, since changes in Retail Transmission Charges are reflected through the TCA after consideration of transmission recovery in retail base rates and the ACC-approved balancing account, the retail revenue requirement increased by $\n8.8\n million, resulting in an increase to residential and commercial rates over \n3\n MW and a decrease to commercial rates less than or equal to \n3\n MW.  An adjustment to APS’s retail rates to recover FERC-approved transmission charges went into effect automatically on June 1, 2024.\nLost Fixed Cost Recovery Mechanism\n.\n  The LFCR mechanism permits APS to recover on an after-the-fact basis a portion of its fixed costs that would otherwise have been collected by APS in the kWh sales lost due to APS energy efficiency programs and to DG such as rooftop solar arrays.  The adjustment to the LFCR has a year-over-year cap of \n1\n% of retail revenues.  Any amounts left unrecovered in a particular year because of this cap can be carried over for recovery in a future year.  The kWhs lost from energy efficiency are based on a third-party evaluation of APS’s energy efficiency programs.  DG sales losses are determined from the metered output from the DG units.\n \nOn February 15, 2022, APS filed its 2022 annual LFCR adjustment, requesting that effective    May 1, 2022, the annual LFCR recovery amount be increased to $\n59.1\n million (a $\n32.5\n million increase from previous levels, which was inclusive of a $\n11.8\n million balance from APS’s 2021 LFCR filing).\n \nOn May 9, 2022, the ACC Staff filed its revised report and proposed order regarding APS’s 2022 LFCR adjustment, concluding that APS calculated the adjustment in accordance with its Plan of Administration.\n \nOn May 18, 2022, the ACC approved the 2022 LFCR adjustment, with a rate effective date of June 1, 2022.\nOn February 15, 2023, APS filed a letter to the ACC docket stating that, in accordance with Decision No. 78585, APS and ACC Staff have agreed to move the filing date for the annual LFCR adjustment to July 31 each year.  On September 5, 2023, APS filed an updated LFCR Plan of Administration, which was approved by ACC Staff on December 8, 2023.  On July 31, 2023, APS filed its 2023 annual LFCR adjustment, requesting that the annual LFCR recovery amount be increased to $\n68.7\n million (a $\n9.6\n million increase from previous levels).  On October 19, 2023, a request for intervention was filed, which was granted.  Consistent with an October 25, 2023, Procedural Order, the parties met and conferred and conducted limited discovery.  As a result of Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case, APS transferred $\n27.1\n million from the LFCR to base rates.\nOn March 8, 2024, APS filed conforming LFCR schedules to incorporate changes required as a result of Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case.\n \nOn April 9, 2024, the ACC approved the 2023 annual LFCR adjustment, with new rates effective in the first billing cycle of May 2024.\nOn June 5, 2024, APS filed a revised LFCR Plan of Administration in accordance with Decision No. 79293.  The ACC approved the revised Plan of Administration on October 8, 2024.\n131\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nOn July 31, 2024, APS filed its 2024 annual LFCR adjustment, requesting that effective   November 1, 2024, the annual LFCR recovery amount be increased to $\n49.6\n million (an $\n8\n million increase from previous levels).  On December 3, 2024, the ACC approved the 2024 annual LFCR adjustment, with new rates effective in the first billing cycle of January 2025.\nTax Expense Adjustor Mechanism\n.  The TEAM helps address potential federal income tax reform and enable the pass-through of certain income tax effects to customers.\n \nThe TEAM expressly applies to APS’s retail rates with the exception of a small subset of customers taking service under specially-approved tariffs.\n \nAs part of the 2019 Rate Case decision, there remains small true up balances in the TEAM balancing account.  In the 2022 Rate Case, these true up balances are being recovered and amortized through 2032.\n \nCourt Resolution Surcharge.\n \nThe CRS mechanism permits APS to recover certain costs associated with investments and expenses for APS’s purchase and installation of SCR technology for Four Corners Units 4 and 5 and a change in APS’s allowable return on equity as required by the Arizona Court of Appeals and approved by the ACC in Decision No. 78979.\n \nThe CRS went into effect on July 1, 2023, at a rate of $\n0.00175\n per kWh.\n \nThe rate is designed to recover $\n59.6\n million in revenue lost by APS between December 2021 and June 20, 2023, and the prospective recovery of ongoing costs related to the SCR investments and expense and the allowable return on equity difference in current base rates.\n \nThe portion of the CRS representing the recovery of the $\n59.6\n million of lost revenue between December 2021 and     June 20, 2023, $\n26.2\n million of which has been collected as of December 31, 2024, will cease upon full collection of the lost revenue.\n \nAdditionally, the CRS tariff was updated to remove the return on equity component and account for SCR-related depreciation and deferral adjustments approved in Decision No. 79293 in the 2022 Rate Case.  See “2019 Retail Rate Case” above for more information.  \nNet Metering\nThe ACC’s decision from APS’s 2017 rate case (the “2017 Rate Case Decision”) provides that payments by utilities for energy exported to the grid from residential DG solar facilities will be determined using a Resource Comparison Proxy (“RCP”) methodology as determined in the ACC’s generic Value and Cost of Distributed Generation docket.\n \nRCP is a method that is based on the most recent five-year rolling average price that APS incurs for utility-scale solar photovoltaic projects.  The price established by this RCP method is updated annually (between general retail rate cases) but cannot be decreased by more than \n10\n% per year.\n \nOn April 29, 2022, APS filed an application to decrease the RCP price from \n9.4\n cents per kWh, which had been in effect since October 1, 2021, to \n8.46\n cents per kWh, reflecting a \n10\n% annual reduction, to become effective September 1, 2022.\n \nOn July 12, 2022, the ACC approved the RCP as filed.\nOn May 1, 2023, APS filed an application for revisions to the RCP.\n \nThis application would decrease the RCP price to \n7.619\n cents per kWh, reflecting a \n10\n% annual reduction, to become effective September 1, 2023.\n \nOn August 25, 2023, the ACC approved the RCP as filed.\nOn May 1, 2024, APS filed an application for revisions to the RCP.\n \nThis application would decrease the RCP price to \n6.857\n cents per kWh, reflecting a \n10\n% annual reduction, to become effective September 1, 2024.\n \nOn August 13, 2024, the ACC approved the RCP as filed.\n \n132\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nOn October 11, 2023, the ACC voted to open a new general docket to hold a hearing to explore potential future changes to the \n10\n% annual reduction cap in the solar export rate paid by utilities to distributed solar customers for exports to the grid and the \n10\n-year rate lock period for those customers that were approved in the ACC’s Value and Cost of Distributed Generation Docket.  A procedural conference was held on November 1, 2023, to discuss the process going forward.  As a result of the procedural conference, ACC Staff issued a request for information to investigate the issues related to this matter.  A status conference was held on March 20, 2024 to determine if ACC Staff is prepared to present a recommendation on this matter at that time.  Stakeholders provided responses to the ACC Staff’s request for information on March 21, 2024.  Another status conference took place on May 20, 2024 and ACC Staff issued a request for additional information to investigate the issues related to the matter on May 31, 2024.  Stakeholders provided responses to the ACC Staff’s request for additional information on July 1, 2024, and on October 15, 2024, the ACC Staff filed a report finding that the RCP is working as intended and recommending no changes to the RCP at this time.  The ACC Staff also recommended that the ACC close the docket without a hearing or further action.  The ACC has not yet acted on the ACC Staff’s recommendation, and APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nEnergy Modernization Plan \nOn May 26, 2023, the ACC opened a new docket to review articles within the Arizona Administrative Code related to Resource Planning, the Renewable Energy Standard and Tariff, and Electric Energy Efficiency Standards.  On January 9, 2024, the ACC approved a rulemaking process for this matter.  During the ACC Open Meeting on February 6, 2024, the ACC approved motions to direct ACC Staff to include recommendations to repeal the current Electric Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Standard rules during the rulemaking process.  On August 21, 2024, the ACC Staff filed separate reports for each set of rules, including its recommendations to repeal the Electric Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Standard rules along with required preliminary economic, small business, and consumer impact statements.  APS and other interested parties have filed comments about the ACC Staff reports.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter. \nIntegrated Resource Planning\nACC rules require utilities to develop triennial 15-year IRPs which describe how the utility plans to serve customer load in the plan time frame.  The ACC reviews each utility’s IRP to determine if it meets the necessary requirements and whether it should be acknowledged.  In February 2022, the ACC acknowledged APS’s 2020 IRP filed on June 26, 2020.  The ACC also approved certain amendments to the IRP process, including, setting an EES of 1.3% of retail sales annually (averaged over a three-year period) and a demand-side resource capacity of 35% of 2020 peak demand by January 1, 2030.  \nOn May 1, 2023, APS, Tucson Electric Power Company, and UNS Electric, Inc. filed a joint request for an extension to file the IRPs from August 1, 2023, to November 1, 2023.\n \nOn June 21, 2023, the ACC granted the extension.\n \nAs a result, APS filed its 2023 IRP on November 1, 2023.\n \n On January 31, 2024, stakeholders filed comments regarding the IRP, and APS filed its response to stakeholder comments on May 31, 2024.  On July 31, 2024, the ACC held an IRP workshop where utilities and stakeholders presented on the 2023 IRPs.  On October 8, 2024, the ACC acknowledged APS’s 2023 IRP and approved certain amendments to the IRP process, including requirements for APS to demonstrate resource adequacy prior to exiting Four Corners as well as analysis of impacts from western market participation and planned resource requirements in the next IRP.  See “Energy Modernization Plan” above for information regarding proposed changes to the IRP filings. \n133\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nEquity Infusions\nOn October 27, 2023, APS filed a notice of intent to increase Pinnacle West’s equity in APS in 2024.\n \nAPS sought approval to receive from Pinnacle West in 2024 up to $\n500\n million in additional equity infusions above the previously authorized limit of $\n150\n million annually.\n \nThe ACC approved the increased equity infusion limit for 2024 on January 9, 2024.\nOn April 19, 2024, APS submitted a request to the ACC to permanently modify Pinnacle West’s permitted yearly equity infusions to equal up to \n2.5\n% of APS’s consolidated assets each calendar year on a three-year rolling average basis.  On December 17, 2024, the ACC issued a financing order that approved an annual equity infusion allowance of \n2.5\n% of APS’s consolidated assets on a three-year rolling average basis.\nPublic Utility Regulatory Policies Act\nUnder the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (“PURPA”), qualifying facilities are provided the right to sell energy and/or capacity to utilities and are granted relief from certain regulatory burdens.\n \nOn December 17, 2019, the ACC mandated a minimum contract length of 18 years for qualifying facilities over 100 kW in Arizona and established that the rate paid to qualifying facilities must be based on the long-term avoided cost.\n \n“Avoided cost” is generally defined as the price at which the utility could purchase or produce the same amount of power from sources other than the qualifying facility on a long-term basis.\n \nResidential Electric Utility Customer Service Disconnections \nIn accordance with the ACC’s service disconnection rules, APS uses a calendar-based method to suspend the disconnection of customers for nonpayment from June 1 through October 15 each year (“Annual Disconnection Moratorium”).  Pursuant to an ACC order, customers with past due balances of $\n75\n or greater as of approximately one month prior to the end of the Annual Disconnection Moratorium are automatically placed on six-month payment arrangements.\n \nIn addition, APS voluntarily began waiving late payment fees of its customers (“Late Fee Waivers”) on March 13, 2020.\n \nEffective February 1, 2023, late payment fees for residential customers were reinstated.\n \nLate payment fees for commercial and industrial customers were reinstated effective May 1, 2022.\n \nSince the suspensions and moratoriums on disconnections began, APS has experienced an increase in bad debt expense and the related write-offs of delinquent customer accounts. \nRetail Electric Competition Rules\nOn November 17, 2018, the ACC voted to re-examine the facilitation of a deregulated retail electric market in Arizona.  On July 1 and July 2, 2019, ACC Staff issued a report and initial proposed draft rules regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules.  On February 10, 2020, two ACC Commissioners filed two sets of draft proposed retail electric competition rules.  On February 12, 2020, ACC Staff issued its second report regarding possible modifications to the ACC’s retail electric competition rules.  During a July 15, 2020, ACC Staff meeting, the ACC Commissioners discussed the possible development of a retail competition pilot program, but no action was taken.  In April 2022, the Arizona Legislature passed, and the Governor signed a bill that repealed the electric deregulation law that \n134\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nhad been in place in Arizona since 1998.  On August 27, 2024, the ACC administratively closed this docket due to inactivity and obsolescence.\n \nFour Corners SCR Cost Recovery\nOn December 29, 2017, in accordance with the 2017 Rate Case Decision, APS filed a Notice of Intent to file its SCR Adjustment to permit recovery of costs associated with the installation of SCR equipment at Four Corners Units 4 and 5.  APS filed the SCR Adjustment request in April 2018.  The SCR Adjustment request provided that there would be a $\n67.5\n million annual revenue impact that would be applied as a percentage of base rates for all applicable customers.  Also, as provided for in the 2017 Rate Case Decision, APS requested that the adjustment become effective no later than January 1, 2019.  The hearing for this matter occurred in September 2018.  At the hearing, APS accepted ACC Staff’s recommendation of a lower annual revenue impact of approximately $\n58.5\n million.\n \nThe Administrative Law Judge issued a ROO finding that the costs for the SCR project were prudently incurred and recommending authorization of the $\n58.5\n million annual revenue requirement related to the installation and operation of the SCRs.\n \nThe ACC did not issue a decision on this matter.  APS included the costs for the SCR project in the retail rate base in its 2019 Rate Case filing with the ACC.\n \nOn November 2, 2021, the 2019 Rate Case decision was approved by the ACC allowing approximately $\n194\n million of SCR related plant investments and cost deferrals in rate base and to recover, depreciate and amortize in rates based on an end-of-life assumption of July 2031.\n \nThe decision also included a partial and combined disallowance of $\n215.5\n million on the SCR investments and deferrals.\n \nAPS believes the SCR plant investments and related SCR cost deferrals were prudently incurred, and on December 17, 2021, APS filed its Notice of Direct Appeal at the Arizona Court of Appeals requesting review of the $\n215.5\n million disallowance.  The Arizona Court of Appeals heard oral arguments on November 30, 2022.\n \nOn March 6, 2023, the Court of Appeals issued its order in the matter, vacating the ACC’s disallowance of the SCR investment and remanding the matter back to the ACC for further review in accordance with ACC rules and the order of the Court of Appeals.\n \nOn June 21, 2023, the ACC approved a joint settlement filed by APS and the ACC’s Legal Division that resolved all issues relating to the 2019 Rate Case decision, including recovery of the cost of the Four Corners SCRs.\n \nSee above for further discussion on the 2019 Rate Case decision.\n \nCholla \nOn September 11, 2014, APS announced that it would close Unit 2 of the Cholla Power Plant (“Cholla”) and cease burning coal at the other APS-owned units (Units 1 and 3) at the plant by the mid-2020s, if the EPA approved a compromise proposal offered by APS to meet required environmental and emissions standards and rules.\n \nOn April 14, 2015, the ACC approved APS’s plan to retire Unit 2, without expressing any view on the future recoverability of APS’s remaining investment in the unit.\n \nAPS closed Unit 2 on October 1, 2015.\n \nIn early 2017, EPA approved a final rule incorporating APS’s compromise proposal, which took effect on April 26, 2017.\n \nIn December 2019, PacifiCorp notified APS that it planned to retire Cholla Unit 4 by the end of 2020 and the unit ceased operation in December 2020.\n \nAPS is required to cease burning coal at its remaining Cholla units by April 2025.\nPreviously, APS estimated Cholla Unit 2’s end of life to be 2033.\n \nAPS has been recovering a return on and of the net book value of the unit in base rates.\n \nAPS is allowed continued recovery of the net book value of the unit and the unit’s decommissioning and other retirement-related costs, $\n28.1\n million as \n135\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nof December 31, 2024, in addition to a return on its investment.\n \nIn accordance with GAAP, in the third quarter of 2014, Unit 2’s remaining net book value was reclassified from property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset.\n \nIn accordance with the 2019 Rate Case decision, the regulatory asset is being amortized through 2033.\nOn August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order associated with unrecovered book value and closure costs of the remaining Cholla units.  This order would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, both the expenses necessary to close and decommission coal-fired power plant infrastructure at Cholla, including legally required site environmental remediation, CCR corrective actions, the closure of CCR management facilities, and any unrecovered plant investment and operating costs incurred through and after April 2025.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nNavajo Plant \nThe Navajo Plant ceased operations in November 2019.\n \nThe co-owners and the Navajo Nation executed a lease extension on November 29, 2017, that allows for decommissioning activities to begin after the plant ceased operations.\n \nIn accordance with GAAP, in the second quarter of 2017, APS’s remaining net book value of its interest in the Navajo Plant was reclassified from property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset. \nAPS has been recovering a return on and of the net book value of its interest in the Navajo plant in base rates over its previously estimated life through 2026.\n \nPursuant to the 2019 Rate Case decision described above, APS will be allowed continued recovery of the book value of its remaining investment in the Navajo plant, $\n33.4\n million as of December 31, 2024, in addition to a return on the net book value, with the exception of \n15\n% of the annual amortization expense in rates.\n \nIn addition, APS will be allowed recovery of other costs related to retirement and closure, including the Navajo coal reclamation regulatory asset, $\n7.9\n million as of December 31, 2024.  The disallowed recovery of \n15\n% of the annual amortization does not have a material impact on APS financial statements.\nFire Mitigation\nOn August 14, 2024, APS filed a request with the ACC for a deferral order that would authorize APS to defer, for future recovery in rates, operations and maintenance expenses associated with wildfire management, including increased insurance costs.  APS cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n136\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe detail of regulatory assets is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nDecember 31,\nAmortization Through\n2024\n2023\nPension\n(a)\n$\n750,976\n \n$\n696,476\n \nDeferred fuel and purchased power (b) (c)\n2025\n287,597\n \n463,195\n \nIncome taxes — AFUDC equity\n2054\n192,936\n \n189,058\n \nOcotillo deferral\n2034\n114,775\n \n128,636\n \nSCR deferral (e)\n2038\n83,123\n \n89,477\n \nLease incentives\n(g)\n70,541\n \n46,615\n \nRetired power plant costs\n2033\n68,380\n \n83,536\n \nDeferred fuel and purchased power — mark-to-market (Note 15)\n2027\n42,275\n \n120,214\n \nFERC Transmission true up\n2026\n35,159\n \n616\n \nIncome taxes — investment tax credit basis adjustment\n2056\n34,834\n \n34,230\n \nDeferred compensation\n2036\n33,108\n \n33,972\n \nDeferred property taxes\n2027\n23,918\n \n32,488\n \nPalo Verde VIEs (Note 17)\n2046\n20,611\n \n20,772\n \nPower supply adjustor - interest\n2025\n11,525\n \n19,416\n \nActive Union Medical Trust\n(f)\n9,673\n \n12,747\n \nMead-Phoenix transmission line contributions in aid of construction (“CIAC”)\n2050\n8,384\n \n8,716\n \nNavajo coal reclamation\n2026\n7,905\n \n10,883\n \nLoss on reacquired debt\n2038\n6,682\n \n7,965\n \nTax expense adjustor mechanism (b)\n2031\n4,534\n \n5,190\n \nFour Corners cost deferral\n2024\n—\n \n7,922\n \nOther\nVarious\n3,522\n \n3,912\n \nTotal regulatory assets (d)\n$\n1,810,458\n \n$\n2,016,036\n \nLess: current regulatory assets\n$\n420,969\n \n$\n625,757\n \nTotal non-current regulatory assets\n$\n1,389,489\n \n$\n1,390,279\n \n(a)\nThis asset represents the future recovery of pension benefit obligations and expense through retail rates.  If these costs are disallowed by the ACC, this regulatory asset would be charged to OCI and result in lower future revenues.  As a result of the 2019 Rate Case decision, the amount authorized for inclusion in rate base was determined using an averaging methodology, which resulted in a reduced return in retail rates.  The 2022 Rate Case decision allows for the full return on the pension asset in rate base.

See Note 20 for more information about the BCE Sale.\nAs a part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), a new PTC for nuclear energy produced by existing nuclear energy plants (“Nuclear PTC”) was enacted.  Energy produced and sold by APS from Palo Verde between 2024 and 2032 is eligible for this credit subject to a credit phase out based upon APS’s gross receipts from nuclear sales.  The Company continues to await guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department related to the definition of “gross receipts from nuclear sales” for purposes of the credit phase-out.  Without such guidance, the Company is unable to accurately determine the benefit the Nuclear PTC may provide.  Due to the lack of guidance, \nno\n income tax benefits have been recognized related to the Nuclear PTC as of December 31, 2024.\nNet income associated with the Captive and Palo Verde sale leaseback VIEs is not subject to tax.  As a result, there is \nno\n income tax expense associated with the VIEs recorded on the Pinnacle West Consolidated and APS Consolidated Statements of Income.

The proceeds were received on January 6, 2023, and used for general corporate purposes.  We recognized the term loan facility as long-term debt upon settlement on January 6, 2023.  On June 10, 2024 Pinnacle West repaid the full $\n175\n million term loan, that matured on December 16, 2024. \nOn February 28, 2024, Pinnacle West entered into equity forward sale agreements (the “February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements”), which may be settled with Pinnacle West common stock or cash.  \nIn December 2024, Pinnacle West partially settled the 2024 Forward Sale Agreements by issuing \n5,377,115\n shares of common stock and receiving net proceeds of \n$\n345\n million\n.  The proceeds were recorded in equity.  \nAt December 31, 2024, Pinnacle West could have settled the remaining February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements with the issuance of \n5,863,486\n shares of common stock, which would have provided cash liquidity to Pinnacle West of approximately $\n377\n million.  See Note 13.\nOn November 8, 2024, Pinnacle West entered into an equity forward sale agreement under the ATM program (the “November 2024 ATM Forward Sale Agreement”), which may be settled with Pinnacle West common stock or cash.  At December 31, 2024, Pinnacle West could have settled the November 2024 ATM Forward Sale Agreement with the issuance of \n552,833\n shares of common stock, which would have provided cash liquidity to Pinnacle West of approximately $\n50\n million.  See Note 13.\n146\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nConvertible Senior Notes.  \nIn June 2024, Pinnacle West issued $\n525\n million of \n4.75\n% convertible senior notes due 2027 (the “Convertible Notes”), which are senior unsecured obligations of Pinnacle West, and will mature on June 15, 2027.  The Convertible Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of \n4.75\n% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2024.  Proceeds from the Convertible Notes were used to repay APS’s \n364\n-day $\n350\n million term loan facility that matured on December 10, 2024 and commercial paper borrowings. \nPrior to March 15, 2027, the holders of the Convertible Notes may elect at their option to convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes under the following limited circumstances:\n•\nduring any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter), if the sale price of Pinnacle West common stock for at least \n20\n trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of \n30\n consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is greater than or equal to \n130\n% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; \n•\nduring the \nfive\n business day period after any \n10\n consecutive trading day period (“Measurement Period”) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than \n98\n% of the product of the last reported sale price of Pinnacle West common stock and the conversion rate on such trading day; or\n•\nupon the occurrence of certain corporate events, as defined in the Convertible Notes’ indenture.\nOn or after March 15, 2027, until the maturity date, the holders of the Convertible Notes may elect at their option to convert all or any portion of their notes.  Upon conversion, Pinnacle West will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes converted and at Pinnacle West’s sole discretion, pay or deliver cash, shares of Pinnacle West common stock or a combination of both, in respect to the remainder, if any, of Pinnacle West’s conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted.  The initial conversion rate, which is subject to certain adjustments as set forth in the indenture, is 10.8338 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $\n92.30\n per share of Pinnacle West’s common stock.  The conversion rate is not subject to adjustment for any accrued and unpaid interest.  \n If Pinnacle West undergoes a fundamental change, as defined in the Convertible Notes’ indenture, then, subject to certain conditions, holders of the Convertible Notes may require Pinnacle West to repurchase for cash all or any portion of its Convertible Notes at a repurchase price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the conditions allowing holders to convert their Convertible Notes were not met, and as a result, the Convertible Notes were classified as long term debt on Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets with a carrying amount of $\n525\n million, including unamortized debt issuance costs of $\n8\n million.  The estimated fair value of the Convertible Notes as of December 31, 2024 was $\n552\n million (Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy).  \n147\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nAs of December 31, 2024, based on Pinnacle West’s average stock price and the relevant terms of the Convertible Notes, there were no shares of Pinnacles West’s common stock included in basic or diluted EPS relating to the potential conversion of the Convertible Notes.  See Note 13.\nFloating Rate Notes.  \nIn June 2024, Pinnacle West completed the sale of $\n350\n million Floating Rate Notes due 2026 (the “Floating Rate Notes”).  The Floating Rate Notes are senior unsecured obligations of Pinnacle West and will mature on June 10, 2026.  The Floating Rate Notes bear a variable interest rate of Compounded SOFR (as defined in the Fifth Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 10, 2024) plus \n82\n basis points per year.  Proceeds were used to repay a portion of Pinnacle West’s $\n450\n million term loan that matured in December 2024 and the full amount of Pinnacle West’s $\n175\n million term loan that matured in December 2024. \nOn June 10, 2024, Pinnacle West repaid $\n250\n million of its $\n450\n million term loan which matured in December 2024.  On December 20, 2024, Pinnacle West repaid the remaining $\n200\n million of the term loan. \nOn June 10, 2024 Pinnacle West repaid the full $\n175\n million term loan, that matured on   December 16, 2024. \nAPS\nAPS was previously authorized to receive up to $\n150\n million annually in equity infusions from Pinnacle West without seeking ACC approval.  In 2023, APS sought approval for an additional $\n500\n million in equity infusions and received approval in early 2024.  Subsequently, APS requested and the ACC issued a new financing order that approved a limit on yearly equity infusions equal to \n2.5\n% of APS’s total assets each calendar year on a three-year rolling average basis, subject to APS’s equity ratio remaining below the most recently approved rate case capital structure plus \n50\n basis points.\nOn June 12, 2024, Pinnacle West contributed $\n450\n million into APS in the form of an equity infusion.  APS used this contribution to repay short-term indebtedness.  On December 23, 2024, Pinnacle West contributed $\n345\n million into APS in the form of an equity infusion.  APS used this contribution to repay a portion of commercial paper borrowings and for other general corporate purposes. \nOn May 9, 2024, APS issued $\n450\n million of \n5.7\n% senior unsecured notes that mature August 15, 2034.  The net proceeds from the sale were used to repay short-term indebtedness consisting of commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. \nOn June 17, 2024, APS repaid its $\n250\n million \n3.35\n% senior unsecured notes at maturity from commercial paper borrowings. \nSee “Lines of Credit and Short-Term Borrowings” in Note 5 and “Financial Assurances” in Note 10 for discussion of APS’s separate outstanding letters of credit.\nBCE\nOn February 11, 2022, a special purpose subsidiary of BCE entered into a credit agreement to finance capital expenditures and related costs for the development of a \n31\n megawatt (“MW”) solar and \n20\n megawatt hour (“MWh”) battery storage project in Los Alamitos, California (“Los Alamitos”).  The credit \n148\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nagreement consisted of an equity bridge loan facility, a non-recourse construction facility, a letter of credit facility, and a related interest rate swap.  On August 4, 2023, Pinnacle West entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Ameresco, Inc. (“Ameresco”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell all our equity interest in BCE to Ameresco (the “BCE Sale”).  See Note 20.  As a part of the BCE Sale closing, the $\n36\n million construction facility, the letter of credit facility, and the interest rate swap were transferred to Ameresco.  On August 4, 2023, concurrent with the BCE Sale, Pinnacle West paid in full the outstanding  $\n31\n million equity bridge loan balance.  As of December 31, 2024, there is \nno\n outstanding balance on our Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to this credit agreement.  \nOn April 18, 2023, and on December 29, 2023, Pinnacle West issued performance guarantees in connection with BCE’s Kūpono Solar investment project financing.  BCE held an equity method investment relating to the Kūpono Solar project that was included in the BCE Sale relating to the stage of the BCE Sale that closed on January 12, 2024.  The performance guarantees did not transfer in the BCE Sale, and Pinnacle West continues to retain these performance guarantees.  See Note 10.\n \nDebt Provisions\n \nPinnacle West’s and APS’s debt covenants related to their respective bank financing arrangements include maximum debt to capitalization ratios.  Pinnacle West and APS comply with this covenant.  For both Pinnacle West and APS, this covenant requires that the ratio of consolidated debt to total consolidated capitalization not exceed \n65\n%.  At December 31, 2024, the ratio was approximately \n59\n% for Pinnacle West and \n49\n% for APS.  Failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default, which, generally speaking, would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants and could cross-default other debt.  See further discussion of “cross-default” provisions below.\n \nNeither Pinnacle West’s nor APS’s financing agreements contain “rating triggers” that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a rating downgrade.  However, our bank credit agreements contain a pricing grid in which the interest rates we pay for borrowings thereunder are determined by our current credit ratings.\n \nAll of Pinnacle West’s loan agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if Pinnacle West or APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  All of APS’s bank agreements contain “cross-default” provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if APS were to default under certain other material agreements.  Pinnacle West and APS do not have a material adverse change restriction for credit facility borrowings.\nAlthough provisions in APS’s articles of incorporation and ACC financing orders establish maximum amounts of preferred stock and debt that APS may issue, APS does not expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements. \nOn April 19, 2024, APS submitted an application to the ACC requesting to increase the long-term debt limit from $\n8.0\n billion to $\n9.5\n billion and to increase Pinnacle West’s permitted yearly equity infusions to equal up to \n2.5\n% of APS’s consolidated assets each calendar year on a three-year rolling average basis.  On December 17, 2024, the ACC issued a financing order approving the increase of the long-term debt limit to $\n9.5\n billion and the permitted yearly equity infusions to equal to \n2.5\n% of APS’s total assets each calendar year on a three-year rolling average basis, subject to APS’s equity ratio \n149\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nremaining below the most recently approved rate case capital structure plus 50 basis points.  See Note 5 for additional short-term debt provisions.\n \n \n7.    \nRetirement Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits \nPinnacle West sponsors a qualified defined benefit and account balance pension plan (The Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Retirement Plan) and a non-qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries.  All new employees participate in the account balance plan.  Defined benefit plans specify the amount of benefits a plan participant is to receive using information about the participant.  The pension plan covers nearly all employees.  The supplemental excess benefit retirement plan covers officers of the Company and highly compensated employees designated for participation by the Board of Directors.  Our employees do not contribute directly to the plans.  We calculate the benefits based on age, years of service and pay.\nPinnacle West also sponsors other postretirement benefit plans (Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Group Life and Medical Plan and Pinnacle West Capital Corporation Post-65 Retiree Health Reimbursement Arrangement “HRA”) for the employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries.  These plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees.  Employees must retire to become eligible for these retirement benefits, which are based on years of service and age.  For the medical insurance plan, retirees make contributions to cover a portion of the plan costs.  For the life insurance plan, retirees do not make contributions.  We retain the right to change or eliminate these benefits.\nPinnacle West uses a December 31 measurement date each year for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans.  The market-related value of our plan assets is their fair value at the measurement date.  See Note 12 for further discussion of how fair values are determined.  Due to subjective and complex judgments, which may be required in determining fair values, actual results could differ from the results estimated through the application of these methods.\nA significant portion of the changes in the actuarial gains and losses of our pension and postretirement plans is attributable to APS and are recoverable in rates.  Accordingly, these changes are recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability.  Our retail rates provide for the inclusion of annual benefit expense, which allows for recovery or return of this regulatory asset/liability. \n S\nee Note 3.\n150\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nThe following table provides details of the plans’ net periodic benefit costs and the portion of these costs charged to expense (including administrative costs and excluding amounts capitalized as overhead construction or billed to electric plant participants) (dollars in thousands):\nPension Plans\nOther Benefits Plans\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nService cost-benefits earned during the period\n$\n43,641\n \n$\n39,461\n \n$\n55,473\n \n$\n9,955\n \n$\n8,567\n \n$\n16,470\n \nNon-service costs (credits):\nInterest cost on benefit obligation\n148,643\n \n153,561\n \n107,492\n \n22,169\n \n22,509\n \n17,491\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n188,651\n)\n(\n182,938\n)\n(\n185,775\n)\n(\n46,834\n)\n(\n43,486\n)\n(\n46,042\n)\nAmortization of:\nPrior service credit (a)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n37,789\n)\n(\n37,789\n)\n(\n37,789\n)\nNet actuarial loss (gain)\n41,915\n \n38,420\n \n17,515\n \n(\n8,676\n)\n(\n9,614\n)\n(\n12,835\n)\nNet periodic benefit costs (credits)\n$\n45,548\n \n$\n48,504\n \n$\n(\n5,295\n)\n$\n(\n61,175\n)\n$\n(\n59,813\n)\n$\n(\n62,705\n)\nPortion of costs (credits) charged to expense\n$\n23,652\n \n$\n27,029\n \n$\n(\n16,431\n)\n$\n(\n45,557\n)\n$\n(\n43,408\n)\n$\n(\n45,042\n)\n(a)    Prior-service costs or credits reflect the impact of modifications to the pension or postretirement plan benefits.

The investment strategies for these plans include external management of plan assets.\n \nThe overall strategy of the pension plan’s IPS is to achieve an adequate level of trust assets relative to the benefit obligations.  To achieve this objective, the plan’s investment policy provides for mixes of investments including long-term fixed income assets and return-seeking assets.  The target allocation between return-seeking and long-term fixed income assets is defined in the IPS.  The plan’s funded status is reviewed on at least a monthly basis.\n \nChanges in the value of long-term fixed income assets, also known as liability-hedging assets, are intended to offset changes in the benefit obligations due to changes in interest rates.  Long-term fixed income assets consist primarily of fixed income debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury and other government agencies, U.S. Treasury futures contracts, and fixed income debt securities issued by corporations.  Long-term fixed income assets may also include interest rate swaps, and other instruments.\n \n153\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nReturn-seeking assets are intended to provide a reasonable long-term rate of investment return with a prudent level of volatility.  Return-seeking assets are composed of U.S. equities, international equities, and alternative investments.  International equities include investments in both developed and emerging markets.  Alternative investments may include investments in real estate, private debt and various other strategies.  The plan may also hold investments in return-seeking assets by holding securities in partnerships, common and collective trusts, and mutual funds.\nBased on the IPS, the target and actual allocation for the pension plan at December 31, 2024, are as follows:\n \nTarget Allocation\nActual Allocation\nLong-term fixed income assets\n80\n \n%\n79\n \n%\nReturn-seeking assets\n20\n \n%\n21\n \n%\nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\nThe permissible range is within +/-5% of the target allocation shown in the above table, and also considers the plan’s funded status. \nThe following table presents the additional target allocations, as a percent of total pension plan assets, for the return-seeking assets:\nTarget Allocation\nEquities in US and other developed markets\n12\n \n%\nEquities in emerging markets\n4\n \n%\nAlternative investments\n4\n \n%\nTotal\n20\n \n%\nThe pension plan IPS does not provide for a specific mix of long-term fixed income assets but does expect the average credit quality of such assets to be investment grade.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, the asset allocation for other postretirement benefit plan assets is governed by the IPS for those plans, which provides for different asset allocation target mixes depending on the characteristics of the liability.  \nThe following table presents the actual allocations of the investment for the other postretirement benefit plan at December 31, 2024:\nActual Allocation\nLong-term fixed income assets\n61\n \n%\nReturn-seeking assets\n39\n \n%\nTotal\n100\n \n%\n \nSee Note 12 for a discussion on the fair value hierarchy and how fair value methodologies are applied.  The plans invest directly in fixed income, U.S. Treasury Futures Contracts, and equity securities, in addition to investing indirectly in fixed income securities, equity securities and real estate through the use of mutual funds, partnerships and common and collective trusts.  Equity securities held directly by the plans are valued using quoted active market prices from the published exchange on which the equity security trades and are classified as Level 1.  U.S. Treasury Futures Contracts are valued using the quoted active market prices from the exchange on which they trade and are classified as Level 1.  Fixed income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury held directly by the plans are valued using quoted active market \n154\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nprices and are classified as Level 1.  Fixed income securities issued by corporations, municipalities, and other agencies are primarily valued using quoted inactive market prices, or quoted active market prices for similar securities, or by utilizing calculations which incorporate observable inputs such as yield, maturity, and credit quality.  These instruments are classified as Level 2.\n \nMutual funds, partnerships, and common and collective trusts are valued utilizing a net asset value (“NAV”) concept or its equivalent.  Mutual funds, which includes exchange traded funds (“ETFs”), are classified as Level 1, and valued using a NAV that is observable and based on the active market in which the fund trades.\nCommon and collective trusts are maintained by banks or investment companies and hold certain investments in accordance with a stated set of objectives (such as tracking the performance of the S&P 500 Index).  The trust’s shares are offered to a limited group of investors and are not traded in an active market.  Investments in common and collective trusts are valued using NAV as a practical expedient and, accordingly, are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.  The NAV for trusts investing in exchange traded equities, and fixed income securities is derived from the market prices of the underlying securities held by the trusts.  The NAV for trusts investing in real estate is derived from the appraised values of the trust’s underlying real estate assets.  \nInvestments in partnerships are also valued using the concept of NAV as a practical expedient and, accordingly, are not classified in the fair value hierarchy.  The NAV for these investments is derived from the value of the partnerships’ underlying assets.  The plan’s partnerships holdings relate to investments in high-yield fixed income instruments.  Certain partnerships also include funding commitments that may require the plan to contribute up to $\n50\n million to these partnerships; as of December 31, 2024, approximately $\n38\n million of these commitments have been funded. \n \nThe plans’ trustee provides valuation of our plan assets by using pricing services that utilize methodologies described to determine fair market value.  We have internal control procedures to ensure this information is consistent with fair value accounting guidance.  These procedures include assessing valuations using an independent pricing source, verifying that pricing can be supported by actual recent market transactions, assessing hierarchy classifications, comparing investment returns with benchmarks, and obtaining and reviewing independent audit reports on the trustee’s internal operating controls and valuation processes.\n155\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nThe fair value of Pinnacle

The expected minimum required cash contributions for the pension plan are \nzero\n for the next three years and we do not expect to make any voluntary contributions in 2025, 2026 or 2027.  With regard to contributions to our other postretirement benefit plan, we did not make a contribution in 2024 or 2023 and do not expect to make any contributions in 2025, 2026 or 2027. The Company was reimbursed $\n27\n million in 2024, $\n23\n million in 2023, and $\n26\n million in 2022 for prior years retiree medical claims from the other postretirement benefit plan trust assets.\n \n157\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\n \nBenefit payments, which reflect estimated future employee service, for the next five years and the succeeding five years thereafter, are estimated to be as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear\nPension Plans\nOther Benefits Plans\n2025\n$\n241,762\n \n$\n28,753\n \n2026\n223,562\n \n28,747\n \n2027\n230,335\n \n28,276\n \n2028\n233,617\n \n27,880\n \n2029\n232,591\n \n27,645\n \nYears 2030-2034\n1,147,273\n \n137,301\n \n \nElectric plant participants contribute to the above amounts in accordance with their respective participation agreements.\nEmployee Savings Plan Benefits\n \nPinnacle West sponsors a defined contribution savings plan for eligible employees of Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries.  In 2024, costs related to APS’s employees represented \n99\n% of the total cost of this plan.  In a defined contribution savings plan, the benefits a participant receives result from regular contributions participants make to their own individual account, the Company’s matching contributions and earnings or losses on their investments.  Under this plan, the Company matches a percentage of the participants’ contributions in cash which is then invested in the same investment mix as participants elect to invest their own future contributions.  Pinnacle West recorded expenses for this plan of approximately $\n14\n million for 2024, $\n12\n million for 2023, and $\n12\n million for 2022.\n8.    \nLeases \n \nWe lease certain land, buildings, vehicles, equipment, and other property through operating rental agreements with varying terms, provisions, and expiration dates.  APS also has certain purchased power and energy storage agreements that qualify as lease arrangements.  Our leases have remaining terms that expire in 2025 through 2073.  Substantially all of our leasing activities relate to APS. \nIn 1986, APS entered into agreements with \nthree\n separate lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2 and related common facilities.  These lessor trust entities have been deemed VIEs for which APS is the primary beneficiary.  As the primary beneficiary, APS consolidated these lessor trust entities.  The impacts of these sale leaseback transactions are excluded from our lease disclosures as lease accounting is eliminated upon consolidation.  See Note 17 for a discussion of VIEs.\nAPS has purchased power lease agreements that allow APS the right to the generation capacity from certain natural-gas fueled generators during certain months of each year throughout the term of the arrangements.  As APS only has rights to use the assets during certain periods of each year, the leases have non-consecutive periods of use.  APS does not operate or maintain the leased assets.  APS controls the dispatch of the leased assets during the months of use and is required to pay a fixed monthly capacity payment during these periods of use.  For these types of leased assets, APS has elected to combine both the \n158\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nlease and non-lease payment components and accounts for the entire fixed payment as a lease obligation.  In addition to the fixed monthly capacity payments, APS must also pay variable charges based on the actual production volume of the assets.  The variable consideration is not included in the measurement of our lease obligation. \nAPS has executed various energy storage purchased power lease agreements that allow APS the right to charge and discharge energy storage facilities.  APS pays a fixed monthly capacity price for rights to use the lease assets.  The agreements generally have \n20\n-year lease terms and provide APS with the exclusive use of the energy storage assets through the lease term.  APS does not operate or maintain the energy storage facilities and has no purchase options or residual value guarantees relating to these lease assets.  For this class of energy storage lease assets, APS has elected to separate the lease and non-lease components.  These leases are accounted for as operating leases, with lease terms that commenced between September 2023 and August 2024.  \nThe following table provides information related to our lease costs (dollars in thousands):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating Lease Cost - Purchased Power & Energy Storage Lease Contracts\n$\n147,313\n \n$\n126,655\n \n$\n104,001\n \nOperating Lease Cost - Land, Property, and Other Equipment\n20,120\n \n19,235\n \n18,061\n \nTotal Operating Lease Cost\n167,433\n \n145,890\n \n122,062\n \nVariable Lease Cost (a)\n144,108\n \n135,007\n \n122,040\n \nShort-term Lease Cost\n20,653\n \n21,530\n \n9,928\n \nTotal Lease Cost\n$\n332,194\n \n$\n302,427\n \n$\n254,030\n \n(a)     Primarily relates to purchased power lease contracts.\nLease costs are primarily included as a component of operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  Lease costs relating to purchased power and energy storage lease contracts are recorded in fuel and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Income and are subject to recovery under the PSA or RES.  See Note 3.  The tables above reflect the lease cost amounts before the effect of regulatory deferral under the PSA and RES.  Variable lease costs are recognized in the period the costs are incurred, and primarily relate to renewable purchased power lease contracts.  Payments under most renewable purchased power lease contracts are dependent upon environmental factors, and due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reliability of the fuel source, the payments are considered variable and are excluded from the measurement of lease\n \nliabilities and right-of-use lease assets.  Certain of our lease agreements have lease terms with non-consecutive periods of use.  For these agreements, we recognize lease costs during the periods of use.  Leases with initial terms of 12 months or less are considered short-term leases and are not recorded on the balance sheets. \n159\nTable of Contents\nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS            \nThe following table provides information related to the maturity of our operating lease liabilities (dollars in thousands):  \nDecember 31, 2024\nYear\nPurchased Power & Energy Storage Lease Contracts\nLand, Property & Equipment Leases\nTotal\n2025 \n$\n158,363\n \n$\n16,834\n \n$\n175,197\n \n2026\n172,087\n \n14,830\n \n186,917\n \n2027\n198,007\n \n12,249\n \n210,256\n \n2028\n201,804\n \n9,591\n \n211,395\n \n2029\n205,741\n \n7,465\n \n213,206\n \nThereafter\n1,140,971\n \n61,855\n \n1,202,826\n \nTotal lease commitments\n2,076,973\n \n122,824\n \n2,199,797\n \nLess imputed interest\n536,948\n \n41,605\n \n578,553\n \nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n1,540,025\n \n$\n81,219\n \n$\n1,621,244\n \n    \nWe recognize lease assets and liabilities upon lease commencement.  At December 31, 2024, we have various lease arrangements that have been executed, but have not yet commenced.  We expect the total fixed consideration paid for these arrangements, which includes both lease and non-lease payments, will approximate $\n16.7\n billion over the terms of the agreements.  These arrangements primarily relate to energy storage assets.  We expect lease commencement dates ranging from March 2025 through June 2028, with lease terms expiring through June 2048.  The lease commencement dates for certain arrangements have experienced delays.  As a result of these delays and other events, APS has received cash proceeds from certain lessors prior to lease commencement.  Proceeds received from lessors relating to energy storage PPA leases are accounted for as lease incentives on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and upon lease commencement are amortized over the associated lease term.  For regulatory purposes, the proceeds received by APS relating to these PPA leases are treated as a reduction to fuel and purchased power costs through the PSA in the period proceeds are received.

For these agreements we use our incremental borrowing rate to measure the present value of lease liabilities.  We determine our incremental borrowing rate at lease commencement based on the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.  We use the implicit rate when it is readily determinable.\n \n161\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n9.    \nJointly-Owned Facilities  \n \nAPS shares ownership of some of its generating and transmission facilities with other companies.  We are responsible for our share of operating costs which are included in the corresponding operating expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Income.  We are also responsible for providing our own financing.  Our share of operating expenses and utility plant costs related to these facilities is accounted for using proportional consolidation.  \nThe following table shows APS’s interests in those jointly-owned facilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2024 (dollars in thousands):\n \nPercent\nOwned\n \nPlant in\nService\nAccumulated\nDepreciation\nConstruction\nWork in\nProgress\nGenerating facilities:\n \n \n \n \n \nPalo Verde Units 1 and 3\n29.1\n \n%\n$\n2,010,346\n \n$\n1,081,321\n \n$\n20,694\n \nPalo Verde Unit 2 (a)\n16.8\n \n%\n709,414\n \n397,235\n \n9,076\n \nPalo Verde Common\n28.0\n \n%\n(b)\n898,401\n \n366,027\n \n47,962\n \nPalo Verde Sale Leaseback\n \n(a)\n351,050\n \n268,494\n \n—\n \nFour Corners Generating Station \n63.0\n \n%\n1,848,412\n \n705,667\n \n56,226\n \nCholla Common Facilities (c)\n50.5\n \n%\n301,035\n \n231,170\n \n1,743\n \nTransmission facilities:\n \n \n \n \n \nArizona Nuclear Power Project 500kV System\n33.3\n \n%\n(b)\n134,713\n \n60,174\n \n7,174\n \nNavajo Southern System\n24.7\n \n%\n(b)\n88,528\n \n38,797\n \n626\n \nPalo Verde — Yuma 500kV System\n25.5\n \n%\n(b)\n24,260\n \n8,120\n \n142\n \nFour Corners Switchyards\n58.0\n \n%\n(b)\n84,367\n \n23,886\n \n309\n \nPhoenix — Mead System\n17.1\n \n%\n(b)\n39,788\n \n21,173\n \n330\n \nPalo Verde — Rudd 500kV System\n50.0\n \n%\n95,785\n \n34,254\n \n1,808\n \nMorgan — Pinnacle Peak System\n63.2\n \n%\n(b)\n117,500\n \n29,013\n \n287\n \nRound Valley System\n50.0\n \n%\n548\n \n213\n \n—\n \nPalo Verde — Morgan System\n87.5\n \n%\n(b)\n266,547\n \n46,327\n \n208\n \nHassayampa — North Gila System\n80.0\n \n%\n154,330\n \n27,739\n \n—\n \nCholla 500kV Switchyard\n85.7\n \n%\n8,454\n \n2,859\n \n35\n \nSaguaro 500kV Switchyard\n60.0\n \n%\n29,850\n \n15,768\n \n101\n \nKyrene — Knox System\n50.0\n \n%\n578\n \n349\n \n—\n \nAgua Fria Switchyard\n10.0\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n82\n \n(a)\nSee Note 17.\n(b)\nWeighted-average of interests.\n(c)\nPacifiCorp owns Cholla Unit 4 (see Note 3 for additional information), and APS operated the unit for PacifiCorp.  Cholla Unit 4 was retired on December 24, 2020.

On October 31, 2024, APS filed its \neleven\nth claim pursuant to the terms of the August 15, 2014, settlement agreement in the amount of \napproximately \n$\n18\n million (APS’s share is \napproximately \n$\n5.3\n million).  In February 2025, the DOE approved \napproximately \n$\n17.6\n million of this claim.\nNuclear Insurance \n \nPublic liability for incidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity Act (“Price-Anderson Act”), which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both commercial sources and an industry-wide retrospective payment plan.\n  This insurance limit is subject to an adjustment every five years based upon the aggregate percentage change in the Consumer Price Index.\n \nThe most recent adjustment took effect on January 1, 2024.\n \nAs of that date, in accordance with the Price-Anderson Act, the Palo Verde participants are insured against public liability for a nuclear incident up to approximately $\n16.3\n billion per occurrence.\n \nPalo Verde maintains the maximum available nuclear liability insurance in the amount of $\n500\n million, which is provided by American Nuclear Insurers.  The remaining balance of approximately $\n15.8\n billion \nof liability coverage is provided through a mandatory, industry-wide retrospective premium program.  If losses at any nuclear power plant covered by the program exceed the accumulated funds, APS could be responsible for retrospective premiums.  The maximum retrospective premium per reactor under the program for each nuclear liability incident is approximately\n $\n165.9\n million, subject to a maximum annual premium of approximately $\n24.7\n million per incident.  Based on APS’s ownership interest in the \nthree\n Palo Verde units, APS’s maximum retrospective premium per incident for all \nthree\n units is approximately $\n144.9\n million, with a maximum annual retrospective premium of approximately $\n21.6\n million.\n163\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Palo Verde participants maintain insurance for property damage to, and decontamination of, property at Palo Verde in the aggregate amount of\n $\n2.8\n billion.  APS has also secured accidental outage insurance for a sudden and unforeseen accidental outage of any of the \nthree\n units.  The property damage, decontamination, and accidental outage insurance are provided by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (“NEIL”).  APS is subject to retrospective premium adjustments under all NEIL policies if NEIL’s losses in any policy year exceed accumul\nated funds.  Th\ne maximum amount APS could incur under the current NEIL policies totals approximately \n$\n23.1\n million\n for each retrospective premium assessment declared by NEIL’s Board of Directors due to losses.  Additionally, at the sole discretion of the NEIL Board of Directors, APS would be liable to provide approximately $\n64.1\n million in deposit premium within \n20\n days of request as assurance to satisfy any site obligation of retrospective premium assessment.  The insurance coverage discussed in this, and the previous paragraph, is subject to certain policy conditions, sublimits, and exclusions.\n \nCaptive Insurance Cell\nPinnacle West has established a captive insurance program to supplement third-party insurance coverage for certain risks.  The Captive insures Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries for terrorism coverage, excess liability including certain wildfire coverage, excess property insurance, and excess employment practice liability.  These coverages may be supplemented with third-party insurance policies.  The Captive policies exclude nuclear liability at Palo Verde.  See Note 10.  The Captive may hold investment assets in cash, cash equivalents, and equity and fixed income instruments, which in the event of an insured loss would be available to pay covered claims.  In the event of an insured loss event, Pinnacle West may be required to provide additional funding to the Captive.  The Captive is a VIE, and Pinnacle West is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and consolidates the assets and liabilities of the Captive.  See Note 17 for additional details. \nFuel and Purchased Power Commitments and Purchase Obligations\nAPS is party to various fuel and purchased power contracts and purchase obligations with terms expiring between 2025 and 2048 that include required purchase provisions.  APS estimates the contract requirements to be approximately $\n1,540\n million in 2025; $\n1,742\n million in 2026; $\n1,973\n million in 2027; $\n2,142\n million in 2028; $\n2,115\n million in 2029; and $\n27.2\n billion thereafter.  However, these amounts may vary significantly pursuant to certain provisions in such contracts that permit us to decrease required purchases under certain circumstances.  These amounts include estimated commitments relating to purchased power lease contracts.  See Note 8. \n \nOf the various fuel and purchased power contracts mentioned above, some of those contracts for coal supply include take-or-pay provisions.  The current coal contracts with take-or-pay provisions have terms expiring through 2031.\n \n164\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table summarizes our estimated coal take-or-pay commitments (dollars in thousands):\n \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter (b)\nCoal take-or-pay commitments (a)\n$\n208,984\n \n$\n214,090\n \n$\n212,529\n \n$\n217,820\n \n$\n223,291\n \n$\n463,752\n \n \n(a)\nTotal take-or-pay commitments are approximately $\n1.5\n billion.  The total net present value of these commitments using a \n4.81\n% discount rate is approximately $\n1.3\n billion.\n(b)\nThrough 2031.\n \n    APS may spend more to meet its actual fuel requirements than the minimum purchase obligations in our coal take-or-pay contracts.  \nThe following table summarizes actual amounts purchased under the coal contracts which include take-or-pay provisions for each of the last three years (dollars in thousands): \n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal purchases\n$\n237,821\n \n$\n255,219\n \n$\n305,502\n \n \nRenewable Energy Credits\n \nAPS has entered into contracts to purchase renewable energy credits to comply with the RES.  APS estimates the contract requirements to be approximately $\n27\n million in 2025; $\n24\n million in 2026; $\n21\n million in 2027; $\n18\n million in 2028; $\n16\n million in 2029; and $\n36\n million thereafter.  These amounts do not include purchases of renewable energy credits that are bundled with energy.\n \nCoal Mine Reclamation Obligations\nAPS must reimburse certain coal providers for final and contemporaneous coal mine reclamation.  We account for contemporaneous reclamation costs as part of the cost of the delivered coal.  We utilize site-specific studies of costs expected to be incurred in the future to estimate our final reclamation obligation.  These studies utilize various assumptions to estimate the future costs.  Based on the most recent reclamation studies, APS recorded an obligation for the coal mine final reclamation of approximately $\n171\n million at December 31, 2024, and $\n184\n million at December 31, 2023.  Under our current coal supply agreements, APS expects to make payments for the final mine reclamation as follows:  $\n20\n million in 2025; $\n21\n million in 2026; $\n22\n million in 2027; $\n23\n million in 2028; and $\n2\n million thereafter.  These funds are held in an escrow account and will be distributed to certain coal providers under the terms of the applicable coal supply agreements.  Any amendments to current coal supply agreements may change the timing of the contribution or cost of final reclamation.  The annual payments to the escrow account and final distribution to certain coal providers may be subject to adjustments based on escrow earnings.\n \nSuperfund and Other Related Matters\n \nThe Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“Superfund” or “CERCLA”) establishes liability for the cleanup of hazardous substances found contaminating the soil, water or air.  Those who released, generated, transported to or disposed of hazardous substances at a \n165\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncontaminated site are among the parties who are potentially responsible (each a “PRP”).  PRPs may be strictly, jointly, and severally liable for clean-up.  On September 3, 2003, EPA advised APS that EPA considers APS to be a PRP in the Motorola 52nd Street Superfund Site, Operable Unit 3 (“OU3”) in Phoenix, Arizona.  APS has facilities that are within this Superfund site.  APS and Pinnacle West have agreed with EPA to perform certain investigative activities of the APS facilities within OU3.  In addition, on September 23, 2009, APS agreed with EPA and one other PRP to voluntarily assist with the funding and management of the site-wide groundwater remedial investigation and feasibility study (“RI/FS”).  The RI/FS for OU3 was finalized and submitted to EPA at the end of 2022.  EPA notified APS that the RI/FS was approved on September 11, 2024.  APS’s estimated costs related to this investigation and study is approximately \n$\n3\n million.  \nAPS anticipates incurring additional expenditures in the future, but because the final costs associated with remediation requirements set forth in the RI/FS are not yet finalized, at the present time expenditures related to this matter cannot be reasonably estimated. \n \nIn connection with APS’s status as a PRP for OU3, since 2013 APS and at least two dozen other parties have been defendants in various CERCLA lawsuits stemming from allegations that contamination from OU3 and elsewhere has impacted groundwater wells operated by the Roosevelt Irrigation District (“RID”).  At this time, only one active lawsuit remains pending in the U.S. District Court for Arizona, which concerns\n \n$\n8.3\n million in remediation legal expenses.  APS is unable to predict the outcome of any further litigation related to this claim or APS’s share of liability related to that claim; however, APS does not expect the outcome to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. \nOn February 28, 2022, EPA provided APS with a request for information under CERCLA related to APS’s Ocotillo power plant site located in Tempe, Arizona.\n \nIn particular, EPA seeks information from APS regarding APS’s use, storage, and disposal of substances containing per-and polyfluoroalkyl (“PFAS”) compounds at the Ocotillo power plant site in order to aid EPA’s investigation into actual or threatened releases of PFAS into groundwater within the South Indian Bend Wash (“SIBW”) Superfund site.\n \nThe SIBW Superfund site includes the APS Ocotillo power plant site.\n \nAPS filed its response to this information request on April 29, 2022.\n \nOn January 17, 2023, EPA contacted APS to inform APS that it would be commencing on-site investigations within the SIBW site, including the Ocotillo power plant, and performing a remedial investigation and feasibility study related to potential PFAS impacts to groundwater over the next two to three years.\n \nAPS estimates that its costs to oversee and participate in the remedial investigation work will be approximately $\n1.7\n million.\n \nAt the present time, we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter, and any further expenditures related to necessary remediation, if any, or further investigations cannot be reasonably estimated. \nEnvironmental Matters\nAPS is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of its present and future operations, including air emissions of both conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste, hazardous waste, and CCRs.  These laws and regulations can change from time to time, imposing new obligations on APS resulting in increased capital, operating, and other costs.  Associated capital expenditures or operating costs could be material.  APS intends to seek recovery of any such environmental compliance costs through our rates but cannot predict whether it will obtain such recovery.  The following proposed and final rules could involve material compliance costs to APS.\n \n166\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCoal Combustion Waste\n.\n \nOn December 19, 2014, EPA issued its final regulations governing the handling and disposal of CCR, such as fly ash and bottom ash.\n \nThe rule regulates CCR as a non-hazardous waste under Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new CCR landfills and surface impoundments and all lateral expansions.\n \nThese criteria include standards governing location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring and corrective action, closure requirements and post closure care, and recordkeeping, notification, and internet posting requirements.\n \nThe rule generally requires any existing unlined CCR surface impoundment to stop receiving CCR and either retrofit or close, and further requires the closure of any CCR landfill or surface impoundment that cannot meet the applicable performance criteria for location restrictions or structural integrity.\n \nSuch closure requirements are deemed “forced closure” or “closure for cause” of unlined surface impoundments and are the subject of the regulatory and judicial activities described below.\nSince these regulations were finalized, EPA has taken steps to substantially modify the federal rules governing CCR disposal.\n \nWhile certain changes have been prompted by utility industry petitions, others have resulted from judicial review, court-approved settlements with environmental groups, and statutory changes to RCRA.\n \nThe following lists the pending regulatory changes that, if finalized, could have a material impact as to how APS manages CCR at its coal-fired power plants:\n•\nFollowing the passage of the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (“WIIN”) Act in 2016, EPA possesses authority to either authorize states to develop their own permit programs for CCR management or issue federal permits governing CCR disposal both in states without their own permit programs and on tribal lands.  At this time, Arizona Department of Environmental Quality (“\nADEQ”)\n has taken steps to develop a CCR permitting program and plans to propose state regulations governing CCR permitting over the summer of 2024.  It remains unclear when EPA would approve that permitting program pursuant to the WIIN Act.  On December 19, 2019, EPA proposed its own set of regulations governing the issuance of CCR management permits, which would impact facilities like Four Corners located on the Navajo Nation.  The proposal remains pending. \n•\nOn March 1, 2018, as a result of a settlement with certain environmental groups, EPA proposed adding boron to the list of constituents that trigger corrective action requirements to remediate groundwater impacted by CCR disposal activities.\n \nApart from a subsequent proposal issued on August 14, 2019, to add a specific, health-based groundwater protection standard for boron, EPA has yet to take action on this proposal.\n \n•\nWith respect to APS’s Cholla facility, APS’s application for alternative closure was submitted to EPA on November 30, 2020.\n \nWhile EPA has deemed APS’s application administratively “complete,” the Agency’s approval remains pending.\n \nIf granted, this application would allow the continued disposal of CCR within Cholla’s existing unlined CCR surface impoundments until the required date for ceasing coal-fired boiler operations in April 2025.\n \nThis application will be subject to public comment and, potentially, judicial review.\n \nWe expect to have a proposed decision from EPA regarding Cholla in 2025.\n \nWe cannot predict the outcome of these regulatory proceedings or when EPA will take final action on those matters that are still pending.\n \nDepending on the eventual outcome, the costs associated with \n167\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPS’s management of CCR could materially increase, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOn April 25, 2024, EPA took final action on a proposal to expand the scope of federal CCR regulations to address the impacts from historical CCR disposal activities that would have ceased prior to 2015.  This new class of CCR management units (“CCRMUs”), which contain at least 1,000 tons of CCR, broadly encompass any location at an operating coal-fired power plant where CCR would have been placed on land.  As proposed, this would include not only historically closed landfills and surface impoundments but also prior applications of CCR beneficial use (with exceptions for historical roadbed and embankment applications).  Existing CCR regulatory requirements for groundwater monitoring, corrective action, closure, post-closure care, and other requirements will be imposed on such CCRMUs.  At this time, APS is still evaluating the impacts of this final regulation on its business, with initial CCRMU site surveys due to be completed by February 2026 and final site investigation reports to be finalized by February 2027.  Based on the information available to APS at this time, APS cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the entire CCRMU asset retirement obligation.  Depending on the outcome of those evaluations and site investigations, the costs associated with APS’s management of CCR could materially increase, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nAPS currently disposes of CCR in ash ponds and dry storage areas at Cholla and Four Corners.  The Navajo Plant disposed of CCR only in a dry landfill storage area.\n \nAdditionally, the CCR rule requires ongoing, phased groundwater monitoring.  As of October 2018, APS has completed the statistical analyses for its CCR disposal units that triggered assessment monitoring.\n \nAPS determined that several of its CCR disposal units at Cholla and Four Corners will need to undergo corrective action.\n \nIn addition, under the current regulations, all such disposal units must have ceased operating and initiated closure as of April 11, 2021 (except for those disposal units subject to alternative closure).\n \nAPS completed the assessments of corrective measures on June 14, 2019; however, additional investigations and engineering analyses that will support the remedy selection are still underway.\n \nIn addition, APS has also solicited input from the public and hosted public hearings as part of this process.\n  APS’s estimates for its share of corrective action and monitoring costs at Four Corners and Cholla are captured within the Asset Retirement Obligations.  \nAs APS continues to implement the CCR rule’s corrective action assessment process, the current cost estimates may change.\n \nGiven uncertainties that may exist until we have fully completed the corrective action assessment and final remedy selection process, we cannot predict any ultimate impacts to APS; however, at this time APS does not believe that any potential changes to the cost estimate from the CCR rule’s corrective action assessment process for Four Corners or Cholla would have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEPA Power Plant Carbon Regulations.\n  EPA’s regulation of carbon dioxide emissions from electric utility power plants has proceeded in fits and starts over most of the last decade.  Starting on August 3, 2015, EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, which was the Agency’s first effort at such regulation through system-wide generation dispatch shifting.  Those regulations were subsequently repealed by the EPA on June 19, 2019 and replaced by the Affordable Clean Energy (“ACE”) regulations, which were a far narrower set of rules.  While the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit subsequently vacated the ACE regulations on January 19, 2021, and ordered a remand for EPA to develop replacement regulations consistent with the original 2015 Clean Power Plan, the U.S. Supreme Court subsequently reversed that decision on June 30, 2022, holding that the Clean Power Plan exceeded EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.\n168\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn the final regulations governing power plant carbon dioxide emissions, released April 25, 2024, EPA issued emission standards and guidelines for various subcategories of new and existing power plants.  Unlike EPA’s Clean Power Plan regulations from 2015, which took a broad, system-wide approach to regulating carbon emissions from electric utility fossil-fuel burning power plants, these new federal regulations are limited to measures that can be installed at individual power plants to limit planet-warming carbon-dioxide emissions.  \nAs such, for new natural gas-fired combustion turbine power plants, EPA is proposing that carbon emission performance standards apply based on the annual capacity factors.  For the highest utilization combustion turbines, EPA is therefore proposing that such facilities be retrofitted for carbon capture and sequestration or utilization controls (“CCS”) by 2032.  For intermediate or low-load natural gas fired combustion turbines, those with 40% or less capacity factors, EPA’s regulations would not require add-on pollution controls.  Instead, natural gas-fired combustion turbines with capacity factors of up to 20% would be effectively unregulated, while such turbines with capacity factors over 20% and up to 40% would be subject to carbon dioxide emission rate limitations.  EPA did not finalize standards for existing natural gas-fired combustion turbines but has indicated that it will propose a new set of standards, initiating a separate rulemaking, for these existing gas-fired power plants within the next year.\nFor coal-fired power plants, instead of imposing regulations based on capacity and utilization, EPA has finalized subcategories based on planned retirement dates.  This means that facilities retiring before 2032 are effectively exempt from regulation, those that retire between 2032 and 2038 must co-fire with natural gas starting in 2030, and those that retire in 2039 or later must install CCS controls by 2032.  \nAs of May 10, 2024, several states, electric utility companies, affiliated trade associations, and other entities filed petitions for review of these regulations in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.  APS is participating in that litigation as part of an ad hoc coalition of electric utility companies, independent power producers, and trade groups, called Electric Generators for a Sensible Transition.  We cannot predict the outcome of the litigation challenging EPA’s latest carbon emission standards for power plants.  In addition, the Trump administration has stated that it intends to reverse or substantially revise these standards.  We cannot predict the outcome of future rulemaking or other regulatory proceedings aimed at changing or eliminating the current EPA emission standards for power plants.\nIf this regulation remains in effect, it will likely lead to a material increase in APS’s costs to build, operate, and maintain new, frequently operated gas-fired power plants.  The regulatory deadlines in 2032 by which new, frequently operated gas-fired power plants must install carbon capture and sequestration and achieve 90% capture efficiency may not be feasible.  Future resource plans and procurement efforts implicating the development of such new generation remains pending and, as such, at this time APS is not able to quantify the financial impact associated with EPA’s GHG regulations for power plants.\nEffluent Limitation Guidelines. \n \nEPA published effluent limitation guidelines (“ELG”) on  October 13, 2020, and, based off those guidelines, APS completed a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permit modification for Four Corners on December 1, 2023.  The ELG standards finalized in October 2020 relaxed the “zero discharge” standard for bottom ash transport waters EPA finalized in September 2015.  However, on April 25, 2024, EPA finalized new ELG regulations that once again require “zero discharge” standards for flows of bottom ash transport water at power plants like Four Corners.  Nonetheless, for power plants that permanently cease operations by December 31, 2034, such facilities can continue to comply with the 2020 ELG standards.  APS is currently evaluating its \n169\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncompliance options for Four Corners based on the ELG regulations finalized in April 2024 and is assessing what impacts the new standards will have on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nEPA Good Neighbor Proposal for Arizona\n. \n On March 15, 2023, EPA issued its final Good Neighbor Plan for 23 states in order to ensure that the cross-state transport of ozone forming emissions does not interfere with downwind state compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”).  Thermal power plant emission limitations are a key aspect of these regulations, which involve emission allowance trading for nitrogen oxide (“NOx”) emissions.  While Arizona was not among the 23 states subject to EPA’s March 2023 final action, EPA announced on January 23, 2024, that it was proposing to add Arizona and New Mexico (along with two other additional states) to EPA’s NOx emission allowance trading program finalized last year.  That proposal involves adding these states to the Good Neighbor Plan and disapproving the corresponding provisions of each state’s State Implementation Plan.  Because APS operates thermal power plants within Arizona and those portions of the Navajo Nation within New Mexico, APS’s power plants would be subject to EPA’s Good Neighbor Plan upon finalization of this proposal.  EPA’s final Good Neighbor Plan is subject to ongoing judicial review in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  On June 27, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a motion to stay the effectiveness of EPA’s final Good Neighbor Plan pending the resolution of the litigation.  As such, APS will not be impacted by the Good Neighbor Plan until the outcome of this litigation is finalized.  In addition, on December 19, 2024, EPA announced that it was withdrawing its proposal to add Arizona (along with other western states) to the federal Good Neighbor Plan.  As such, while EPA may elect to resume work on and finalize this proposal in the future, it is unlikely to do so over a near-term horizon.  APS cannot predict the outcome of any future EPA efforts to add Arizona to the federal Good Neighbor Plan (which depends on action disapproving the Arizona State Implementation Plan) or whether the Good Neighbor Plan itself will remain in effect pending the outcome of judicial review in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.  Should the Good Neighbor Plan ultimately be imposed on APS and its operations in Arizona and New Mexico, it would have material impact on both the costs to operate current APS power plants and APS’s ability to develop new thermal generation to serve load.  At this time, APS cannot predict the impact on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nRevised Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (“MATS”) Proposal.\n  On April 25, 2024, EPA finalized revisions to the existing MATS regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollution from existing coal-fired power plants.  The final regulations increase the stringency of filterable particulate matter limits used to demonstrate compliance with MATS and require the use of continuous emissions monitoring systems to ensure compliance (as opposed to periodic performance testing).  These final regulations will take effect for existing coal-fired power plants, such as Four Corners, within three years of publication in the Federal Register.  Based on APS’s assessment of the revised MATS regulations, this final rule is unlikely to have a material impact on plant operations or require significant capital expenditures to ensure compliance.\nOther environmental rules that could involve material compliance costs include those related to effluent limitations, the ozone national ambient air quality standard and other rules or matters involving the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act, Endangered Species Act, RCRA, Superfund, the Navajo Nation, and water supplies for our power plants.  The financial impact of complying with current and future environmental rules could jeopardize the economic viability of APS’s fossil-fuel powered plants or the willingness or ability of power plant participants to fund any required equipment upgrades or continue their participation in these plants.  The economics of continuing to own certain resources, particularly our coal plants, may deteriorate, warranting early retirement of those plants, which may result in asset impairments.  \n170\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAPS would seek recovery in rates for the book value of any remaining investments in the plants, as well as other costs related to early retirement, but cannot predict whether it would obtain such recovery.\n \nFour Corners National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) Permit\nThe latest NPDES permit for Four Corners was issued on September 30, 2019.\n \nBased upon a November 1, 2019, filing by several environmental groups, the Environmental Appeals Board (“EAB”) took up review of the Four Corners NPDES Permit.\n \nThe EAB denied the environmental group petition on\n \nSeptember 30, 2020.\n \nWhile on January 22, 2021, the environmental groups filed a petition for review of the EAB’s decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the parties to the litigation (including APS) finalized a settlement on May 2, 2022.\n \nThis settlement requires investigation of thermal wastewater discharges from Four Corners, administratively closes the litigation filed in January 2021, and APS does not expect the outcome to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nBCE Kūpono Solar\nBCE and Ameresco jointly owned a special purpose entity that sponsored the Kūpono Solar Project.  This project is a \n42\n MW solar and battery storage facility in Oʻahu, Hawaii that supplies energy and capacity under a \n20\n-year power purchase agreement with Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc.  The Kūpono Solar Project achieved commercial operations in June 2024.  On April 18, 2023, the Kūpono special purpose entity entered into a $\n140\n million non-recourse construction financing agreement.  On August 14, 2024, the construction financing converted into long-term financing in the form of a sale-leaseback.  In connection with the project financing, Pinnacle West issued performance guarantees relating to the Kūpono Solar Project.  Investments in the Kūpono Solar Project were included in the BCE Sale which closed on January 12, 2024, and as a result of the BCE Sale, Pinnacle West holds no equity or ownership interest in the Kūpono Solar Project.  As of December 31, 2024, Pinnacle West continues to maintain performance guarantees relating to the Kūpono Solar Project sale-leaseback financing (see additional information below regarding these guarantees).  See Note 20 for information relating to the BCE Sale.\nFinancial Assurances\n \nIn the normal course of business, we obtain standby letters of credit and surety bonds from financial institutions and other third parties.  These instruments guarantee our own future performance and provide third parties with financial and performance assurance in the event we do not perform.  These instruments support commodity contract collateral obligations and other transactions.  As of December 31, 2024, standby letters of credit totaled approximately $\n18\n million and surety bonds totaled approximately $\n23\n million; both will expire through 2025.  The underlying liabilities insured by these instruments are reflected on our balance sheets, where applicable.  Therefore, no additional liability is reflected for the letters of credit and surety bonds themselves. \n \nWe enter into agreements that include indemnification provisions relating to liabilities arising from or related to certain of our agreements.  Most significantly, APS has agreed to indemnify the equity participants and other parties in the Palo Verde sale leaseback transactions with respect to certain tax matters.  Generally, a maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in the indemnification provisions and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnification provisions cannot be \n171\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nreasonably estimated.  Based on historical experience and evaluation of the specific indemnities, we do not believe that any material loss related to such indemnification provisions is likely.\n \nPinnacle West has issued parental guarantees and has provided indemnification under certain surety bonds for APS which were not material at December 31, 2024.  In connection with the sale of 4C Acquisition, LLC’s \n7\n% interest to Navajo Transitional Energy Corporation (“NTEC”), Pinnacle West is guaranteeing certain obligations that NTEC will have to the other owners of Four Corners.  Pinnacle West has not needed to perform under this guarantee.  A maximum obligation is not explicitly stated in the guarantee and, therefore, the overall maximum amount of the obligation under such guarantee cannot be reasonably estimated; however, we consider the fair value of this guarantee, including expected credit losses, to be immaterial.\nIn connection with PNW Power’s investments in minority ownership positions in the Clear Creek wind farm in Missouri and Nobles 2 wind farm in Minnesota, Pinnacle West has guaranteed the obligations of PNW Power to make production tax credit funding payments to borrowers of the projects (the “PTC Guarantees”).\n \nThe amounts guaranteed by Pinnacle West are reduced as payments are made under the respective guarantee agreements. \n \nAs of December 31, 2024, there is approximately $\n29\n million of remaining guarantees relating to these PTC Guarantees that are expected to terminate by 2031. \nPinnacle West has issued various performance guarantees in connection with the Kūpono Solar Project investment financing and is exposed to losses relating to these guarantees upon the occurrence of certain events that we consider to be remote. \n \nSubsequent to the BCE Sale, Pinnacle West continues to maintain these guarantees.  See Note 20.  Pinnacle West has not needed to perform under these guarantees.  Maximum obligations are not explicitly stated in the guarantees and cannot be reasonably estimated.  Ameresco is obligated to reimburse Pinnacle West for any payments made by Pinnacle West under such guarantees.  We consider the fair value of these guarantees, including expected credit losses, to be immaterial.  The details of the guarantees are as follows: \n•\nPinnacle West committed to certain performance guarantees tied to the Kūpono Solar Project achieving certain construction and operation milestones.  These performance guarantees expired in August 2024.  Pinnacle West has no on-going exposure under these construction-related guarantees.\n \n•\nUnder the Kūpono Solar Project sale-leaseback financing, Pinnacle West has committed to certain performance guarantees that may apply upon the occurrence of specified events, such as uninsured loss events.  Ameresco has agreed to make efforts to refinance the project and eliminate these guarantees prior to 2030.\n \n11.     \nAsset Retirement Obligations \n \nIn\n \n2024\n, the Company revised its cost estimates for existing AROs for the following:\n•\nCholla coal-fired power plant related to the closure of ponds and facilities, which resulted in an increase to the ARO of approximately\n $\n63\n million, \nprimarily due to cost estimates associated with the CCR Rule.\n•\nFour Corners coal-fired power plant, which resulted in an increase of approximately\n $\n82\n million, \nprimarily due to cost estimates associated with the CCR Rule.\n172\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n•\nNavajo, a decommissioned coal-fired power plant, which resulted in an increase of\n \napproximately \n$\n8\n million.\n•\nPalo Verde nuclear plant, which resulted in an increase of approximately $\n1\n million.\n•\nSolar, which resulted in a decrease to the ARO of approximately $\n11\n million, primarily due to the reduced cost of solar panel disposal.\nAPS has also recorded the initial investigation and assessment costs related to the newly signed EPA rule for Legacy Impoundments and CCRMUs.  At this time, APS is still estimating the financial impacts of this final regulation on its business, with initial CCRMU site surveys due to be completed by February 2026 and final site investigation reports to be finalized by February 2027.  Based on the information available to APS at this time, APS cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the entire CCRMU asset retirement obligation.  Depending on the outcome of those evaluations and site investigations, the costs associated with APS’s management of CCR could materially increase, which could affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn \n2023\n, the Company revised its cost estimates for existing ARO for the following:\n•\nCholla coal-fired power plant related to the closure of ponds and facilities, which resulted in an increase to the ARO of approximately $\n71\n million, primarily due to changes in the planned pond closure methodology and increased corrective action cost estimates associated with the CCR Rule. \n•\nFour Corners coal-fired power plant, which resulted in a decrease of approximately $\n7\n million.\n•\nNavajo coal-fired plant, a decommissioned coal-fired power plant, which resulted in an increase of approximately $\n8\n million.\n•\nPalo Verde received a new decommissioning study, which resulted in an increase to the ARO in the amount of $\n63\n million, an increase in the plant in service of $\n59\n million and a decrease in the regulatory liability of $\n4\n million.\nSee additional details in Notes \n3\n and \n10\n.\nThe following table shows the change in our asset retirement obligations (dollars in thousands):\n \n2024\n2023\nAsset retirement obligations at the beginning of year\n$\n966,001\n \n$\n797,762\n \nChanges attributable to:\n \n \nAccretion expense\n56,143\n \n44,269\n \nSettlements\n(\n18,379\n)\n(\n14,039\n)\nEstimated cash flow revisions\n142,821\n \n135,323\n \nNewly incurred obligation\n—\n \n2,686\n \nAsset retirement obligations at the end of year\n$\n1,146,586\n \n$\n966,001\n \n \nIn accordance with regulatory accounting, APS accrues removal costs for its regulated utility assets, even if there is no legal obligation for removal.  See Note 3 for detail of regulatory liabilities.\n173\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12.    \nFair Value Measurements  \n \nWe classify our assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value within the fair value hierarchy.  This hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the inputs used to determine fair values, which are then classified and disclosed in one of three categories.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\n \nLevel 1 — Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. \nLevel 2 — Other significant observable inputs, including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable (such as yield curves).  \n \nLevel 3 — Valuation models with significant unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity.  Instruments in this category may include long-dated derivative transactions where valuations are unobservable due to the length of the transaction, options, and transactions in locations where observable market data does not exist.  The valuation models we employ utilize spot prices, forward prices, historical market data and other factors to forecast future prices.\n \nAssets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Thus, a valuation may be classified in Level 3 even though the valuation may include significant inputs that are readily observable.  We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  We rely primarily on the market approach of using prices and other market information for identical and/or comparable assets and liabilities.  If market data is not readily available, inputs may reflect our own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use.  Our assessment of the inputs and the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities as well as their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.  We assess whether a market is active by obtaining observable broker quotes, reviewing actual market activity, and assessing the volume of transactions.  We consider broker quotes observable inputs when the quote is binding on the broker, we can validate the quote with market activity, or we can determine that the inputs the broker used to arrive at the quoted price are observable.\nCertain instruments have been valued using the concept of Net Asset Value (“NAV”) as a practical expedient.  These instruments are typically structured as investment companies offering shares or units to multiple investors for the purpose of providing a return.  These instruments are similar to mutual funds; however, their NAV is generally not published and publicly available, nor are these instruments traded on an exchange.  Instruments valued using NAV as a practical expedient are included in our fair value disclosures; however, in accordance with GAAP are not classified within the fair value hierarchy levels.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\n \nWe apply recurring fair value measurements to cash equivalents, derivative instruments, and investments held in the nuclear decommissioning trusts and other special use funds.  On an annual basis, we apply fair value measurements to plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans.  See Note 7 for fair value discussion of plan assets held in our retirement and other benefit plans.\n \n174\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash Equivalents\n \nCash equivalents represent certain investments in money market funds that are valued using quoted prices in active markets.\nRisk Management Activities — Energy Derivative Instruments\n \nExchange traded commodity contracts are valued using unadjusted quoted prices.  For non-exchange traded commodity contracts, we calculate fair value based on the average of the bid and offer price, discounted to reflect net present value.  We maintain certain valuation adjustments for a number of risks associated with the valuation of future commitments.  These include valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risks.  The liquidity valuation adjustment represents the cost that would be incurred if all unmatched positions were closed out or hedged.  The credit valuation adjustment represents estimated credit losses on our net exposure to counterparties, taking into account netting agreements, expected default experience for the credit rating of the counterparties and the overall diversification of the portfolio.  We maintain credit policies that management believes minimize overall credit risk.\n \nCertain non-exchange traded commodity contracts are valued based on unobservable inputs due to the long-term nature of contracts, characteristics of the product, or the unique location of the transactions.  Long-dated energy transactions may consist of observable valuations for the near-term portion and unobservable valuations for the long-term portions of the transaction.  We rely primarily on broker quotes to value these instruments.  When our valuations utilize broker quotes, we perform various control procedures to ensure the quote has been developed consistent with fair value accounting guidance.  These controls include assessing the quote for reasonableness by comparison against other broker quotes, reviewing historical price relationships, and assessing market activity.  When broker quotes are not available, the primary valuation technique used to calculate the fair value is the extrapolation of forward pricing curves using observable market data for more liquid delivery points in the same region and actual transactions at more illiquid delivery points.\n \nWhen the unobservable portion is significant to the overall valuation of the transaction, the entire transaction is classified as Level 3. \n \nInvestments Held in Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts and Other Special Use Funds\n \nThe nuclear decommissioning trusts and other special use funds invest in fixed income and equity securities.  Other special use funds include the coal reclamation escrow account, the active union employee medical account, and the Captive.  See Note 18 for additional discussion about our investment accounts.\nWe value investments in fixed income and equity securities using information provided by our trustees and escrow agent.  Our trustees and escrow agent use pricing services that utilize the valuation methodologies described below to determine fair market value.  We have internal control procedures designed to ensure this information is consistent with fair value accounting guidance.  These procedures include assessing valuations using an independent pricing source, verifying that pricing can be supported by actual recent market transactions, assessing hierarchy classifications, comparing investment returns with benchmarks, and obtaining and reviewing independent audit reports on the trustees’ and escrow agent’s internal operating controls and valuation processes.\n175\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFixed Income Securities\nFixed income securities issued by the U.S. Treasury are valued using quoted active market prices and are typically classified as Level 1.  Fixed income securities issued by corporations, municipalities, and other agencies, including mortgage-backed instruments, are valued using quoted inactive market prices, quoted active market prices for similar securities, or by utilizing calculations which incorporate observable inputs such as yield curves and spreads relative to such yield curves.  These fixed income instruments are classified as Level 2.  Whenever possible, multiple market quotes are obtained which enables a cross-check validation.  A primary price source is identified based on asset type, class, or issue of securities.\nFixed income securities may also include short-term investments in certificates of deposit, variable rate notes, time deposit accounts, U.S. Treasury and Agency obligations, U.S. Treasury repurchase agreements, commercial paper, and other short-term instruments.  These instruments are valued using active market prices or utilizing observable inputs described above.  \nEquity Securities\nThe nuclear decommissioning trusts’ equity security investments are held indirectly through commingled funds.  The commingled funds are valued using the funds’ NAV as a practical expedient.  The funds’ NAV is primarily derived from the quoted active market prices of the underlying equity securities held by the funds.  We may transact in these commingled funds on a semi-monthly basis at the NAV.  The commingled funds are maintained by a bank and hold investments in accordance with the stated objective of tracking the performance of the S&P 500 Index.  Because the commingled funds’ shares are offered to a limited group of investors, they are not considered to be traded in an active market.  As these instruments are valued using NAV, as a practical expedient, they have not been classified within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe nuclear decommissioning trusts and other special use funds may also hold equity securities that include exchange traded mutual funds and money market accounts for short-term liquidity purposes.

See Note 3.\n \n178\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBecause our forward commodity contracts classified as Level 3 are currently in a net purchase position, we would expect price increases of the underlying commodity to result in increases in the net fair value of the related contracts.  Conversely, if the price of the underlying commodity decreases, the net fair value of the related contracts would likely decrease.\nOther unobservable valuation inputs include credit and liquidity reserves which do not have a material impact on our valuations; however, significant changes in these inputs could also result in higher or lower fair value measurements.\nThe following tables provide information regarding our significant unobservable inputs used to value our risk management derivative Level 3 instruments at December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023:\nDecember 31, 2024\n Fair Value (thousands) \nValuation\nSignificant\nWeighted-Average\nCommodity Contracts\nAssets\nLiabilities\nTechnique\nUnobservable Input\nRange\n (b)\nElectricity Forward Contracts (a)\n$\n708\n \n$\n21,890\n \nDiscounted cash flows\nElectricity forward price (per MWh)\n$\n25.25\n-\n$\n151.11\n$\n106.06\nNatural Gas Forward Contracts (a)\n6,468\n \n325\n \nDiscounted cash flows\nNatural gas forward price (per MMBtu)\n$(\n0.89\n)\n-\n$\n1.47\n$\n0.71\nTotal\n$\n7,176\n \n$\n22,215\n \n(a)\nIncludes swaps and physical and financial contracts.\n(b)\nUnobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instrument. \nDecember 31, 2023\n Fair Value (thousands) \nValuation\nSignificant\nWeighted-Average\nCommodity Contracts\nAssets\nLiabilities\nTechnique\nUnobservable Input\nRange\n(b)\nElectricity Forward Contracts (a)\n$\n6,587\n \n$\n658\n \nDiscounted cash flows\nElectricity forward price (per MWh)\n$\n37.79\n \n-\n$\n259.04\n$\n158.08\nNatural Gas Forward Contracts (a)\n29\n \n1,037\n \nDiscounted cash flows\nNatural gas forward price (per MMBtu)\n$\n0.00\n-\n$\n0.08\n$\n0.03\nTotal\n$\n6,616\n \n$\n1,695\n \n(a)\nIncludes swaps and physical and financial contracts.\n(b)\nUnobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the instrument.\n179\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table shows the changes in fair value for our risk management activities’ assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 inputs (dollars in thousands):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nCommodity Contracts\n2024\n2023\nBalance at beginning of period\n$\n4,921\n \n$\n(\n4,888\n)\nTotal net losses realized/unrealized:\nDeferred as a regulatory asset or liability\n(\n60,965\n)\n(\n70,214\n)\nSettlements\n44,156\n \n69,706\n \nTransfers into Level 3 from Level 2\n(\n4,635\n)\n(\n1,289\n)\nTransfers from Level 3 into Level 2\n1,484\n \n11,606\n \nBalance at end of period\n$\n(\n15,039\n)\n$\n4,921\n \nNet unrealized gains/losses included in earnings related to instruments still held at end of period\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n             Transfers in or out of Level 3 are typically related to our long-dated energy transactions that extend beyond available quoted periods.\nFinancial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value\n \nThe carrying value of our short-term borrowings approximate fair value and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  See Note 6 for our long-term debt fair values.\n \n 13.    \nCommon Stock Equity and Earnings Per Share  \nATM Program\nOn November 8, 2024, Pinnacle West entered into an equity distribution sales agreement, pursuant to which Pinnacle West may sell, from time to time, up to $\n900\n million of its common stock through an ATM program, which includes the ability to enter into forward sale agreements.  As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, approximately $\n850\n million of common stock is available to be issued under the ATM Program, which takes into account the forward sale agreement in effect as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n. \n \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Pinnacle West had an outstanding forward sale agreement under the ATM program relating to approximately $\n50\n million of common stock (the “November 2024 ATM Forward Sale Agreement”).  The November 2024 ATM Forward Sale Agreement may be settled at Pinnacle West’s discretion no later than June 30, 2026.  On a given settlement date, Pinnacle West will issue shares of common at the then-applicable forward sales price.  The terms of the November 2024 ATM Forward Sale Agreement also allow Pinnacle West, at its option, to settle the agreements with the counterparties by delivering cash, in lieu of shares. \nThe initial forward sales price for the November 2024 ATM Forward Sale Agreement was approximately \n$\n89.73\n, subject to certain adjustments.  On \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Pinnacle West could have settled the outstanding November 2024 ATM Forward Sale Agreement with the physical delivery of \n552,833\n shares of Pinnacle West common stock in exchange for cash of approximately \n$\n50\n million\n.  As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Pinnacle West has not received any proceeds relating to the November 2024 Forward \n180\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSale Agreement.  Pinnacle West will receive proceeds, if any, when settlement occurs, and will record the proceeds, if any, in equity. \nNon-ATM February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements\nOn February 28, 2024, Pinnacle West executed equity forward sale agreements, relating to  \n11,240,601\n shares of Pinnacle West common stock (“February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements”). \n \nThe February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements may be settled at our discretion no later than September 4, 2025, and were not issued under the ATM program discussed above.  \nOn a settlement date, Pinnacle West will issue shares of Pinnacle West common stock and receive cash, if any,\n \nat the then-applicable forward sales price.\n \nThe terms of the February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements also allow Pinnacle West, at its option, to settle the agreements with the counterparties by delivering cash, in lieu of shares.\nThe initial forward sales price for the February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements was initially, approximately $\n64.51\n per share and is subject to adjustment based on the terms of the agreements.  In December 2024, Pinnacle West partially settled the February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements with the issuance of\n \n5,377,115\n shares of common stock and received net proceeds of $\n345\n million.  The proceeds were recorded in equity. \n \nAt December 31, 2024, Pinnacle West could have settled the remaining February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements with the issuance of \n5,863,486\n shares of common stock in exchange for cash of $\n377\n million.\n \nWe will not receive any additional proceeds, if any, from the February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements until settlement occurs. \n \nConvertible Notes\nIn June 2024, Pinnacle West issued $\n525\n million of \n4.75\n% convertible senior notes that will mature on June 15, 2027.\n  The Convertible Notes conversion options are indexed to Pinnacle West’s common stock.  See Note \n5\n.\n181\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table presents the calculation of Pinnacle West’s basic and diluted EPS (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income attributable to common shareholders\n$\n608,806\n \n$\n501,557\n \n$\n483,602\n \nWeighted average common shares outstanding — basic\n113,846\n \n113,442\n \n113,196\n \nNet effect of dilutive securities:\n \n \n \nContingently issuable performance shares and restricted stock units\n480\n \n362\n \n220\n \nDilutive shares related to equity forward sale agreements (a)\n1,906\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal contingently issuable shares\n2,386\n \n362\n \n220\n \nWeighted average common shares outstanding — diluted\n116,232\n \n113,804\n \n113,416\n \nEarnings per weighted-average common share outstanding\nNet income attributable to common shareholders — basic\n$\n5.35\n \n$\n4.42\n \n$\n4.27\n \nNet income attributable to common shareholders — diluted\n$\n5.24\n \n$\n4.41\n \n$\n4.26\n \n(a)    For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, diluted weighted average common shares excludes \n1,038,463\n, \n0\n and \n0\n shares, respectively, relating to the Convertible Notes and the ATM equity forward.  These potentially issuable shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted shares as their inclusion would have been antidilutive.\n \nThe November 2024 ATM Forward Sale Agreements and the February 2024 Forward Sale Agreements are classified as equity transactions, and are not recorded on the Pinnacle West Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Delivery of shares to settle equity forward agreements result in dilution to basic earnings per share (EPS) upon settlement.  Prior to settlement, the potentially issuable shares are reflected in our diluted EPS calculations using the treasury stock method.  Under this method, the number of shares, if any, that would be issued upon settlement less that number of shares that could be purchased by Pinnacle West in the market with the proceeds received from issuance (based on the average market price during the reporting period).  Share dilution occurs when the average market price of our stock during the reporting period is higher than the adjusted forward sale price as of the end of the reporting period.\n \n14.    \nStock-Based Compensation \n \nPinnacle West has incentive compensation plans under which stock-based compensation is granted to officers, key employees, and non-officer members of the Board of Directors.  Awards granted under the 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended (“2021 Plan”), may be in the form of stock grants, restricted stock units, stock units, performance shares, restricted stock, dividend equivalents, performance share units, performance cash, incentive and non-qualified stock options, and stock appreciation rights.  The 2021 Plan authorizes up to \n4.3\n million common shares to be available for grant.  As of December 31, 2024, \n2.9\n million common shares were available for issuance under the 2021 Plan.  During 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company granted awards in the form of restricted stock units, stock units, stock grants, and performance shares.  Awards granted from 2012 to May 2021 were issued under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2012 Plan”), and awards granted from 2007 to 2011 were issued under the 2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (“2007 Plan”).  No new awards may be granted under the 2012 or 2007 Plans.\n182\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nStock-Based Compensation Expense and Activity\n \nCompensation cost included in net income for stock-based compensation plans was $\n24\n million in 2024, $\n17\n million in 2023, and $\n16\n million in 2022.  The compensation cost capitalized is immaterial for all years.  Income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements were $\n6\n million in 2024, $\n3\n million in 2023, and $\n2\n million in 2022. \nAs of December 31, 2024, there were approximately $\n38\n million of unrecognized compensation costs related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements.  We expect to recognize these costs over a weighted-average period of \ntwo\n years.  \nThe total fair value of shares vested was $\n24\n million in 2024, $\n24\n million in 2023, and $\n25\n million in 2022. \n \nThe following table is a summary of awards granted and the weighted-average grant date fair value for each of the last three years:\nRestricted Stock Units, Stock Grants, and Stock Units (a)\nPerformance Shares (b)\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nUnits granted\n261,808\n \n192,295\n \n174,791\n \n225,516\n \n202,562\n \n208,736\n \nWeighted-average grant date fair value\n$\n71.10\n \n$\n74.32\n \n$\n69.66\n \n$\n72.89\n \n$\n79.61\n \n$\n77.63\n \n(a)\nThe Units granted does not include awards that will be cash settled in 2024, 2023 or 2022.

This includes cash used to settle restricted stock units of $\n2\n \n183\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nmillion, $\n3\n million, and $\n3\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Restricted stock units that are cash settled are classified as liability awards.  All performance shares are classified as equity awards.  \n \nRestricted Stock Units, Stock Grants, and Stock Units \n \nRestricted stock units are granted to officers and key employees and typically vest and settle in equal annual installments over a \n4\n-year period after the grant date.  Vesting is typically dependent upon continuous service during the vesting period.\nBeginning in 2022, restricted stock unit awards are issued in stock.  Awards include a dividend equivalent feature that allows each award to accrue dividends and treat them as reinvested, from the date of grant until the applicable vesting date.  If the award is forfeited the employee is not entitled to the accrued reinvested dividends on those shares.  Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees will vest on a pro-rata basis upon the employee’s retirement. \n \nPrior to 2022, awardees typically elected to receive payment in either \n100\n% stock, \n100\n% cash, or \n50\n% in cash and \n50\n% in stock.  Awards included a dividend equivalent feature that accrued dividend rights from the date of grant until the applicable vesting date, plus interest compounded quarterly.  If the award was forfeited, the employee was not entitled to the accrued dividends on those shares.  Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees typically vested upon the employee’s retirement.\nCompensation cost for restricted stock unit awards is based on the fair value of the award, with the fair value being the market price of our stock on the measurement date.  Restricted stock unit awards that will be settled in cash are accounted for as liability awards, with compensation cost initially calculated on the date of grant using the Company’s closing stock price and remeasured at each balance sheet date.  Restricted stock unit awards that will be settled in shares are accounted for as equity awards, with compensation cost calculated using the Company’s closing stock price on the date of grant.  Compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period based on the fair value of the award. \n \nStock grants are issued to non-officer members of the Board of Directors.  They may elect to receive the stock grant, or to defer receipt until a later date and receive stock units in lieu of the stock grant.  Beginning in 2023, payments for stock units are issued in stock and include a dividend equivalent feature that allows each award to accrue dividends and treat them as reinvested, from the date of grant until the applicable vesting date.  Prior to 2023, members of the Board of Directors who elected to defer could elect to receive payment in either \n100\n% stock, \n100\n% cash, or \n50\n% in cash and \n50\n% in stock.  The stock units prior to 2023 included a dividend equivalent feature that accrues dividend rights from the date of grant to the date of payment, plus interest compounded quarterly.\n \nPerformance Share Awards\n \nPerformance share awards are granted to officers and key employees.  The awards contain separate performance metric criteria that affect the number of shares that may be received if, after the end of a \n3\n-year performance period, the performance criteria are met. \nBeginning in 2022, performance share awards contain \nthree\n separate, unrelated performance criteria.\n \nThe first performance criteria is based upon Pinnacle West’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) in relation to the TSR of other companies in a specified utility index (i.e., the TSR component).\n \nThe second performance criteria is based upon Pinnacle West’s earnings per share (“EPS”) performance relative to an \n184\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\napproved target (i.e., the EPS component).\n \nThe third performance criteria is based upon APS’s clean MW installed of renewable or other carbon free resources compared to the approved target (i.e., the Clean component).\n \nThe exact number of shares issued is calculated separately for each performance component and can vary from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of the target award for each separate performance criteria.  Shares received include a dividend equivalent feature that treats accrued dividends as reinvested, from the date of grant until the date of payment, equal to the number of vested performance shares.  If the award is forfeited or if the performance criteria are not achieved, the employee is not entitled to the dividends on those shares.  Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees will vest on a pro-rata basis upon the employee’s retirement.\n \n Prior to 2022, performance share awards had \ntwo\n performance criteria.  The first performance criteria was based upon non-financial performance metrics (i.e., the Metric component).  The second performance criteria was based upon Pinnacle West’s TSR in relation to the TSR of other companies in a specified utility index (i.e., the TSR component).  The exact number of shares issued will vary from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of the target award.  Shares received included a dividend equivalent feature that allows accrued dividend rights from the date of grant until the date of payment, plus interest compounded quarterly, equal to the number of vested performance shares.  If the award was forfeited, the employee was not entitled to the accrued dividends on those shares.  Awards granted to retirement-eligible employees typically vested upon the employee’s retirement.\n \nPerformance share awards are accounted for as equity awards, with compensation cost based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.  Compensation cost relating to the EPS and Clean metric component of the respective awards is based on the Company’s closing stock price on the date of grant, with compensation cost recognized over the requisite service period based on the number of shares expected to vest.  Management evaluates the probability of meeting the EPS and Clean metric component at each balance sheet date.  If the EPS and Clean metric component criteria are not ultimately achieved, no compensation cost is recognized relating to the EPS and Clean metric component, and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.  Compensation cost relating to the TSR component of the respective awards is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model, with compensation cost recognized ratably over the requisite service period, regardless of the number of shares that actually vest.\n \n15.    \nDerivative Accounting  \n \nDerivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to commodity price and transportation costs of electricity, natural gas, emissions allowances, and interest rates.  Risks associated with market volatility are managed by utilizing various physical and financial derivative instruments, including futures, forwards, options, and swaps.  As part of our overall risk management program, we may use derivative instruments to hedge purchases and sales of electricity and natural gas.  Derivative instruments that meet certain hedge accounting criteria may be designated as cash flow hedges and are used to limit our exposure to cash flow variability on forecasted transactions.  The changes in market value of such instruments have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged transactions.  Derivative instruments are also entered into for economic hedging purposes.  While economic hedges may mitigate exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices, these instruments have not been designated as accounting hedges.  Contracts that have the same terms (quantities, delivery points and delivery periods) and for which power does not flow are netted, which reduces both revenues and fuel and purchased power costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income, but does not impact our financial condition, net income, or cash flows.\n  \n185\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOur derivative instruments, excluding those qualifying for a scope exception, are recorded on the balance sheets as an asset or liability and are measured at fair value.  See Note 12 for a discussion of fair value measurements.  Derivative instruments may qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception if they require physical delivery, and the quantities represent those transacted in the normal course of business.  Derivative instruments qualifying for the normal purchases and sales scope exception are accounted for under the accrual method of accounting and excluded from our derivative instrument discussion and disclosures below.\nSee Note 13 for details relating to Pinnacle West’s equity forward sale agreements and Note 5 for Pinnacle West’s Convertible Notes.  These equity-linked transactions are indexed to Pinnacle West common stock and qualify for a derivative scope exception, and as such, are not subject to mark-to-market accounting and are excluded from the derivative disclosures below. \nEnergy Derivatives\nFor its regulated operations, APS defers for future rate treatment \n100\n% of the unrealized gains and losses on energy derivatives pursuant to the PSA mechanism that would otherwise be recognized in income.  Realized gains and losses on energy derivatives are deferred in accordance with the PSA to the extent the amounts are above or below the Base Fuel Rate.  See Note 3.  Gains and losses from energy derivatives in the following tables represent the amounts reflected in income before the effect of PSA deferrals.\nThe following table shows the outstanding gross notional volume of energy derivatives, which represent both purchases and sales (does not reflect net position):\nQuantity\nCommodity\nUnit of Measure\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nPower\nGWh\n1,051\n \n1,212\n \nGas\nBillion cubic feet\n235\n \n200\n \n \nGains and Losses from Energy Derivative Instruments\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, APS had no energy derivative instruments in designated accounting hedging relationships.\n     \nThe following table provides information about gains and losses from energy derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedging instruments (dollars in thousands):\nFinancial Statement \nYear Ended December 31,\nCommodity Contracts\nLocation\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet Gain (Loss) Recognized in Income\nFuel and purchased power (a)\n(\n88,522\n)\n(\n370,145\n)\n307,287\n \n(a)\nAmounts are before the effect of PSA deferrals.\n186\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEnergy Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nOur energy derivative transactions are typically executed under standardized or customized agreements, which include collateral requirements and, in the event of a default, would allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.  Agreements that allow for the offsetting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty are considered master netting arrangements.  Transactions with counterparties that have master netting arrangements are offset and reported net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Transactions that do not allow for offsetting of positive and negative positions are reported gross on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe do not offset a counterparty’s current energy derivative contracts with the counterparty’s non-current energy derivative contracts, although our master netting arrangements would allow current and non-current positions to be offset in the event of a default.  These types of transactions may include non-derivative instruments, derivatives qualifying for scope exceptions, trade receivables and trade payables arising from settled positions, and other forms of non-cash collateral (such as letters of credit).  These types of transactions are excluded from the offsetting tables presented below.\nThe following tables provide information about the fair value of APS’s risk management activities reported on a gross basis and the impacts of offsetting.  These amounts relate to commodity contracts and are located in the assets and liabilities from risk management activities lines of APS’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2024:\n (dollars in thousands) \nGross \nRecognized \nDerivatives\n (a)\nAmounts \nOffset\n(b)\nNet\n Recognized\n Derivatives\nOther\n (c)\nAmounts \nReported on \nBalance Sheets\nCurrent assets\n$\n13,718\n \n$\n(\n3,158\n)\n$\n10,560\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n10,578\n \nInvestments and other assets\n6,610\n \n(\n630\n)\n5,980\n \n—\n \n5,980\n \nTotal assets\n20,328\n \n(\n3,788\n)\n16,540\n \n18\n \n16,558\n \nCurrent liabilities\n(\n52,527\n)\n3,158\n \n(\n49,369\n)\n(\n2,971\n)\n(\n52,340\n)\nDeferred credits and other\n(\n10,076\n)\n630\n \n(\n9,446\n)\n—\n \n(\n9,446\n)\nTotal liabilities\n(\n62,603\n)\n3,788\n \n(\n58,815\n)\n(\n2,971\n)\n(\n61,786\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n42,275\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n42,275\n)\n$\n(\n2,953\n)\n$\n(\n45,228\n)\n(a)\nAll of our gross recognized derivative instruments were subject to master netting arrangements.\n(b)\nNo\n cash collateral has been provided to counterparties, or received from counterparties, that is subject to offsetting. \n(c)\nRepresents cash collateral and cash margin that is not subject to offsetting.

As of December 31, 2024, we have one counterparty for which our exposure represents approximately \n26\n% of Pinnacle West’s $\n16.6\n million of risk management assets.  This exposure relates to an ISDA master agreement with the respective counterparty.  The counterparty is rated as investment grade by Standard & Poor’s.  Our risk management process assesses and monitors the financial exposure of all counterparties.  Despite the fact that the great majority of our trading counterparties’ debt is rated as investment grade by the credit rating agencies, there is still a possibility that one or more of these counterparties could default, resulting in a material impact on consolidated earnings for a given period.  Counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of financial institutions, major energy companies, municipalities and local distribution companies.  We maintain credit policies that we believe minimize overall credit risk to within acceptable limits.  Determination of the credit quality of our counterparties is based upon a number of factors, including credit ratings and our evaluation of their financial condition.  To manage credit risk, we employ collateral requirements and standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty.  Valuation adjustments are established representing our estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to counterparties.\n \nCertain of our energy derivative instrument contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features including, among other things, investment grade credit rating provisions, credit-related cross-default provisions, and adequate assurance provisions.  Adequate assurance provisions allow a counterparty with reasonable grounds for uncertainty to demand additional collateral based on subjective events and/or conditions.  For those energy derivative instruments in a net liability position, with investment grade credit contingencies, the counterparties could demand additional collateral if our debt credit rating were to fall below investment grade (below BBB- for Standard & Poor’s or Fitch or Baa3 for Moody’s).\n \n188\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides information about our energy derivative instruments that have credit-risk-related contingent features (dollars in thousands):\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nAggregate fair value of derivative instruments in a net liability position\n$\n62,603\n \nAdditional collateral in the event credit-risk related contingent features were fully triggered (a)\n32,728\n \n(a)\nThis amount is after counterparty netting and includes those contracts which qualify for scope exceptions, which are excluded from the derivative details above.\n \nWe also have energy related non-derivative instrument contracts, including energy storage lease contracts, with investment grade credit-related contingent features, which could also require us to post additional collateral of approximately $\n416\n million if our debt credit ratings were to fall below investment grade.\n16.    \nOther Income and Other Expense \n \nThe following table provides detail of Pinnacle West’s Consolidated other income and other expense for 2024, 2023, and 2022 (dollars in thousands):\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nOther income:\n \n \n \nInterest income\n$\n24,322\n \n(a)\n$\n27,242\n \n(a)\n$\n7,326\n \nGain on sale of BCE (Note 20)\n22,988\n \n6,205\n \n—\n \nMiscellaneous\n1,304\n \n219\n \n590\n \nTotal other income\n$\n48,614\n \n$\n33,666\n \n$\n7,916\n \nOther expense:\nNon-operating costs\n$\n(\n27,370\n)\n(b)\n$\n(\n15,260\n)\n$\n(\n18,619\n)\nInvestment losses — net\n(\n1,418\n)\n(\n3,402\n)\n(\n20,537\n)\n(c)\nMiscellaneous\n(\n5,348\n)\n(\n6,394\n)\n(\n13,229\n)\nTotal other expense\n$\n(\n34,136\n)\n$\n(\n25,056\n)\n$\n(\n52,385\n)\n(a)\nThe 2023 and 2024 Interest income is primarily related to PSA Interest.

Pinnacle West obtains all the benefits from the Captive and makes all the primary controlling decisions that economically impact the Captive. \n \nAs a separate protected cell, Pinnacle West is the Captive’s only participant.  The Captive is a VIE for which Pinnacle West is the primary beneficiary. \n \nAccordingly, Pinnacle West consolidates the Captive. \n \nUnder a mutual business program participation agreement between the Captive and EISI, EISI will issue policies, make claim disbursements, claim expenses and other underwriting fees on behalf of the Captive, as necessary.\nThe Captive insures Pinnacle West and its subsidiaries for terrorism coverage, excess liability including certain wildfire coverage, excess property insurance, and excess employment practice liability.  The Captive policies exclude nuclear liability at Palo Verde.  See Note 10 for details regarding nuclear liability insurance.  Claim payments to the insureds can only be made up to the amount of the Captive’s available assets.  In the event that claims exceed the Captive’s available assets, Pinnacle West may be required to provide additional funding to the Captive.  In addition to policies obtained through the Captive, Pinnacle West also has insurance policies purchased through third-party insurers that may provide coverage if a loss event occurs.  \nAs a result of consolidation, we eliminate intercompany transactions between Pinnacle West and the Captive and record the Captive’s assets, liabilities and third-party operating activities.  In consolidation, \n190\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nthe Captive’s insurance premium revenues derived from Pinnacle West policies is eliminated against the insurance premium expense recorded by Pinnacle West and our subsidiaries relating to insurance policy coverage provided by the Captive.  Consolidation primarily resulted in Pinnacle West reflecting the Captive’s investment holdings on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the Captive’s investment gains and losses reflected through earnings on our Consolidated Income Statements. \nConsolidation of the Captive resulted in an increase in Pinnacle West net income of $\n5\n million for 2024, and \nzero\n for 2023 and 2022.  These amounts are fully attributable to Pinnacle West shareholders.  Consolidation impacts Pinnacle West Consolidated Income Statement’s operations and maintenance expense and other income line items. \n Pinnacle West’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024 include $\n34\n million of assets relating to the Captive that is reported within the other special use funds line item.  See Notes 12 and 18 for additional details on these investment holdings.  Our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023, include $\n5\n million of assets relating to the Captive that is reported within the other assets line item. \nAPS’s financial statements are not impacted by Pinnacle West’s consolidation of the Captive VIE. \nAPS\nPalo Verde Sale Leaseback VIEs\nIn 1986, APS entered into agreements with \nthree\n separate VIE lessor trust entities in order to sell and lease back interests in Palo Verde Unit 2 and related common facilities.  APS will retain the assets through 2033 under all \nthree\n lease agreements.  \nAPS will be required to make payments relating to the \nthree\n \nleases in total of approximately \n$\n21\n million \nannually for the period 2025 through 2033.  At the end of the lease period, APS will have the option to purchase the leased assets at their fair market value, extend the leases for up to \ntwo years\n, or return the assets to the lessors.\n \nThe leases’ terms give APS the ability to utilize the assets for a significant portion of the assets’ economic life, and therefore provide APS with the power to direct activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance.  Predominantly due to the lease terms, APS has been deemed the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and therefore consolidates the VIEs.\n \nAs a result of consolidation, we eliminate lease accounting and instead recognize depreciation expense, resulting in an increase in net income of $\n17\n million for each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.  The increase in net income is entirely attributable to the noncontrolling interests.  Income attributable to Pinnacle West shareholders is not impacted by the consolidation.\n \n191\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOur Consolidated Balance Sheets include the following amounts relating to these VIEs (dollars in thousands):\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nPalo Verde sale leaseback property, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation\n$\n82,556\n \n$\n86,426\n \nEquity — Noncontrolling interests\n103,167\n \n107,198\n \n \nAssets of the VIEs are restricted and may only be used for payment to the noncontrolling interest holders.  These assets are reported on our consolidated financial statements. \n \nAPS is exposed to losses relating to these VIEs upon the occurrence of certain events that APS does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur.  Under certain circumstances (for example, the NRC issuing specified violation orders with respect to Palo Verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events), APS would be required to make specified payments to the VIEs’ noncontrolling equity participants and take title to the leased Unit 2 interests, which, if appropriate, may be required to be written-down in value.  If such an event were to occur during the lease periods, APS may be required to pay the noncontrolling equity participants approximately $\n345\n million beginning in 2025, and up to $\n501\n million over the lease extension terms.\n \nFor regulatory ratemaking purposes, the agreements continue to be treated as operating leases and, as a result, we have recorded a regulatory asset relating to the arrangements.\n18.    \nInvestments in Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts and Other Special Use Funds \n \nWe have investments in debt and equity securities held in Nuclear Decommissioning Trusts and Other Special Use funds.  Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale securities.  We record both debt and equity security investments at their fair value on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  See Note 12 for a discussion of how fair value is determined and the classification of the investments within the fair value hierarchy.  The investments in each trust or account are restricted for use and are intended to fund specified costs and activities as further described for each fund below.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trusts — \nAPS established external decommissioning trusts in accordance with NRC regulations to fund the future costs APS expects to incur to decommission Palo Verde.  Third-party investment managers are authorized to buy and sell securities per stated investment guidelines.  The trust funds are invested in fixed income securities and equity securities.  Earnings and proceeds from sales and maturities of securities are reinvested in the trusts.  Because of the ability of APS to recover decommissioning costs in rates, and in accordance with the regulatory treatment, APS has deferred realized and unrealized gains and losses (including credit losses) in other regulatory liabilities.\nCoal Reclamation Escrow Account — \nAPS has investments restricted for the future coal mine reclamation funding related to Four Corners.  This escrow account is primarily invested in fixed income securities.  Earnings and proceeds from sales of securities are reinvested in the escrow account.  Because of the ability of APS to recover coal reclamation costs in rates, and in accordance with the regulatory treatment, APS has deferred realized and unrealized gains and losses (including credit losses) in other regulatory liabilities.  Activities relating to APS coal mine reclamation escrow account investments are included within the other special use funds in the table below.\n192\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nActive Union Employee Medical Account — \nAPS has investments restricted for paying active union employee medical costs.  These investments may be used to pay active union employee medical costs incurred in the current and future periods.  In 2024 and 2023, APS was reimbursed $\n14\n million for each year, for prior year active union employee medical claims from the active union employee medical account.  The account is invested primarily in fixed income securities.  In accordance with the ratemaking treatment, APS has deferred the unrealized gains and losses (including credit losses) in other regulatory assets and liabilities.

The net assets transferred includes $\n41\n million of liabilities that have been assumed by Ameresco.  The consideration received by Pinnacle West includes both cash and interest-bearing promissory notes.  The stages of the BCE Sale and timing of net assets transferring to Ameresco and related gain recognition are as follows: \n•\nThe first stage of the BCE Sale was completed on August 4, 2023.  In the first stage, the net assets transferred to Ameresco totaled $\n44\n million, which included a $\n36\n million construction term loan.  The assets and liabilities transferred in the first stage related to the BCE Los Alamitos project and were previously primarily classified as construction work in progress and current maturities of long-term debt, respectively.  A gain of $\n6\n million was recognized on our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2023, relating to the first stage of the BCE Sale. \n•\nThe final stage of the BCE Sale was completed on January 12, 2024.  In the final stage, the net assets transferred to Ameresco totaled $\n35\n million.  The assets transferred in the final stage related primarily to equity method investments in the Kūpono Solar Project and other development stage projects.  These assets were previously classified as assets held for sale on our December 31, 2023, Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2024, include a $\n23\n million gain relating to the final stage of the BCE Sale.  \nAs of January 12, 2024, all stages of the BCE Sale have been completed.  As partial consideration for the BCE Sale, Pinnacle West received a $\n46\n million interest-bearing promissory note from Ameresco.  The note required Ameresco to make cash payments to Pinnacle West throughout 2024 and Pinnacle West received payment in full of the note receivable during the fourth quarter of 2024.  As the note receivable has been paid in full, our December 31, 2024 Consolidated Balance Sheets do not include any amounts relating to the promissory note.\n On January 30, 2024, Pinnacle West entered into a tax credit transfer agreement to purchase from Ameresco $\n23\n million of investment tax credits from the BCE Los Alamitos project for $\n21\n million.  See Note 4. \n196\nTable of Contents \nCOMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAdditionally, Pinnacle West continues to maintain certain guarantees relating to the Kūpono Solar Project sale-leaseback financing, which were not transferred in the BCE Sale transaction.\n \nSee Note 10.\n \n21.    \nNew Accounting Standards \n \nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, a new standard was issued that modifies segment reporting disclosure requirements.  The disclosure changes include information about a reportable segment’s significant expenses, details relating to the entity’s chief operating decision maker, and other disclosures.  We adopted this standard on December 31, 2024, using a retrospective approach.  The adoption of the new standard results in changes to our reportable segment disclosures, but does not impact how we identify reportable segments or our financial statement results.  See Note 1.\nASU 2023-09, Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, a new accounting standard was issued that expands disclosures relating to income taxes.  The expanded disclosures include a tabular income tax rate reconciliation, disclosure of specific reconciliation categories and reconciling items, the amount of income taxes paid by jurisdiction, and other disclosures.  We will adopt this standard on December 31, 2025, using a prospective approach.  The adoption of the new standard will result in changes to our income tax disclosures, but will not impact our accounting for income taxes or our financial statement results.   \nASU 2024-03, Income Statement: Expense Disaggregation Disclosures\nIn November 2024, a new accounting standard was issued that requires specific disclosures related to certain costs and expenses.  Companies will be required to disclose the amounts of certain cost and expense categories, such as: purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and amortization, among other disclosures.  The new disclosures may be provided in the notes to the financial statements, and will not require changes to the face of the income statement.  The standard is effective for us on December 31, 2027, using either a prospective or retrospective approach, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption of the new standard will result in disclosure changes, but will not impact our accounting for such costs and expenses or our financial statement results.\n197\nPINNACLE WEST CAPITAL

Under Equity Compensation Plans \n \nThe following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2024, with respect to the 2021 Plan, 2012 Plan, the 2007 Plan, under which our equity securities are outstanding or currently authorized for issuance.\nEquity Compensation Plan

amount includes shares subject to outstanding performance share awards and restricted stock unit awards at the maximum amount of shares issuable under such awards.  However, payout of the performance share awards is contingent on the Company reaching certain levels of performance during a three-year performance period.  If the performance criteria for these awards are not fully satisfied, the award recipient will receive less than the maximum number of shares available under these grants and may receive nothing from these grants.\n(b)    The weighted-average exercise price in this column does not take performance share awards or restricted stock unit awards into account, as those awards have no exercise price.\n(c)    Awards under the 2021 Plan, as amended, can take the form of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares, performance share units, performance cash, stock grants, stock units, dividend equivalents, and restricted stock units.  Additional shares cannot be awarded under the 2012 Plan, as amended, and the 2007 Plan.  However, if an award under the 2012 Plan, as amended, or the 2007 Plan is forfeited, terminated or canceled or expires, the shares subject to such award, to the extent of the forfeiture, termination, cancellation, or expiration, may be added back to the shares available for issuance under the 2021 Plan.\nEquity Compensation Plans Approved By Security Holders \n \nAmounts in column (a) in the table above include shares subject to awards outstanding under three equity compensation plans that were previously approved by our shareholders:  (a) the 2007 Plan, which was approved by our shareholders at our 2007 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, under which no new stock awards may be granted; (b) the 2012 Plan, which was approved by our shareholders at our 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as amended by the First Amendment to the 2012 Plan, which was approved by our shareholders at our 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, under which no new stock awards may be granted; and (c) the 2021 Plan, which was approved by our shareholders at our 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, as amended by the First Amendment to the 2021 Plan, which was approved by our shareholders at our 2023 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.  See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these plans.\n204\nTable of Contents \nEquity Compensation Plans Not Approved by Security Holders\n \nThe Company does not have any equity compensation plans under which shares
