    "item1": "Item 1, Our Business and Our Strategy, Financial Strength, for additional discussion of our financial strength ratings.\n \nInternational operations subject us to additional regulation and expose us to additional investment, political and economic risks.\nInternational risks include restrictions such as price controls, capital controls, currency exchange limits, ownership limits and other restrictive or anti-competitive governmental actions or requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. Our business activities outside the U.S., including in the U.K., subject us to political and economic risks, including foreign currency and credit risk. Cincinnati Global in particular is subject to continued political and economic disruptions in the U.K. from its withdrawal from the European Union.\nBusiness activities outside the U.S. subject us to additional domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar laws in other countries that prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials. In addition, insurers in the U.K. (including managing agents and members of Lloyd’s of London) are subject to Solvency II and the U.K. regulatory regime, which itself includes rules promulgated by Lloyd's. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulatory requirements, if those controls are ineffective and an employee or intermediary fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties and our business and reputation could be adversely affected. Some countries have laws and regulations that lack clarity and, even with local expertise and effective controls, it can be difficult to determine the exact requirements of, and potential liability under, the local laws. Failure to comply with local laws in a particular market may result in substantial liability and could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally.\nBusiness activities at Cincinnati Global are subject to Lloyd's approval of a business plan each year. There is risk that Cincinnati Global's plan will not be approved or will be limited. As a Lloyd’s managing agent and syndicate, Cincinnati Global is exposed to various risks and their associated uncertainties, including Lloyd’s rating agency \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 35\nTable of Contents\nratings and reputation. Cincinnati Global also has an obligation to maintain funds at Lloyd’s to support its underwriting activities and periodic assessment of its capital, governance and other aspects of its business.\n \nRisks related to investments or other financial matters\nFinancial disruption or a prolonged economic downturn could affect our investment performance.\nEvents, such as global supply chain disruptions, an increasing interest rate environment and inflationary pressures, have contributed to significant disruption and volatility for financial markets and decreased economic activity. In the event that these conditions occur or continue, recur or result in a prolonged economic downturn or recession, they could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These market conditions have in the past, and could in the future, cause our investment income or the value of securities we own to decrease. Additionally, the companies we invest in might be severely affected by a severe catastrophic event, terrorist attack, or epidemic event, which could in turn lower their stock value and affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n \nOur ability to achieve our performance objectives could be affected by changes in the financial, credit and capital markets or the general economy. \nWe invest premiums received from policyholders and other available cash to generate investment income and capital appreciation, while also maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay covered claims and operating expenses, service our debt obligations and pay dividends. The value of our invested assets is an important component of shareholders’ equity or book value per share and changes in their valuation can have a significant impact. Changes in book value per share is a key performance objective as discussed in Item 7, Executive Summary of Management’s Discussion and Analysis.\nFor fixed-maturity investments such as bonds, which represented 58.4% of the fair value of our investment portfolio at the end of 2024, the inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices leads to falling bond values during periods of increasing interest rates. Significant increases in the general level of interest rates, such as we experienced during recent periods, have an adverse effect on our shareholders’ equity.\nInvestment income is an important component of our revenues and net income. The ability to increase investment income and generate longer-term growth in book value is affected by factors beyond our control, such as: inflation, economic growth, interest rates, world political conditions, changes in laws and regulations, future actions or inactions of the U.S. government, epidemic events, terrorism attacks or threats, war, adverse events affecting other companies in our industry or the industries in which we invest, market events leading to credit constriction, and other widespread unpredictable events. These events have in the past and may in the future adversely affect the economy generally and cause our investment income or the value of securities we own to decrease. Wars can occur anywhere in the world and have an adverse effect on our investment portfolio, especially if effects of wars expand over time and space. We do not have material exposure to investments based in Russia, Ukraine, Israel or Gaza. If there is significant expansion of wars beyond these regions, it may have adverse effects on our investment performance. Any significant decline in our investment income will have an adverse effect on our net income, and thereby on our shareholders’ equity and our statutory capital and surplus. For a more detailed discussion of risks associated with our investments, refer to Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nWe have issued universal life contracts with guaranteed minimum returns, referred to as bank-owned life insurance contracts (BOLIs). A BOLI is designed with the bank as the policy owner and the policy beneficiary. We legally segregate and record as separate accounts the assets and liabilities for certain BOLIs, when required by the specific contract provisions. Minimum investment returns, account values and death benefits are guaranteed by us for our separate account BOLIs. We could incur losses in the performance of these guarantees.\nWe also have life policy reserves established for traditional life policies including term, whole life and other products. Reserve variability can occur as reserves are based on certain cash flow assumptions as well as a discount rate assumption. Life policy reserves are required to be recorded using a discount rate assumption that is updated quarterly. As the discount rate increases during the quarter, life policy reserves decrease and accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) increases. Conversely, as the discount rate decreases during the quarter, life policy reserves increase and AOCI decreases. A significant decrease in discount rates, relative to the prior quarter, would have an adverse effect on shareholders' equity.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 36\nTable of Contents\nOur investment performance also could suffer because of the types of investments, industry groups and/or individual securities in which we choose to invest. Market value changes related to these choices could cause a material change in our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur investments in private equity, private credit, real property assets, private limited partnerships, and other alternative investments are subject to a higher level of illiquidity, economic volatility and real estate market deterioration. They lack quoted prices and active trade markets, and are subject to changing tax laws and an increased focus from the SEC and other regulators. These alternative investments have in the past, and may in the future result in reduced net investment returns, losses on sales of these investments, and/or the writing down the value of these investments, which would result in an adverse impact on operating results.\nWe also are exposed to credit risk related to guarantee and indemnification arrangements, which support our alternative investments and insurance operations. Our exposure to these guarantee and indemnification risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nAt year-end 2024, common stock holdings made up 39.2% of our investment portfolio. Adverse news or events affecting the global or U.S. economy or the equity markets, such as we experienced during recent years, will affect our net income, book value and overall results, and could affect our ability to pay our common stock dividend. See Item 7, Investments Results, and Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, for a discussion of our investment activities.\nDeterioration in the banking sector or in banks with which we have relationships could affect our results of operations. Our ability to maintain or obtain short-term lines of credit could be affected if the banks from which we obtain these lines are acquired, fail or are otherwise negatively affected. We may lose premium revenue if a bank that owns appointed agencies were to change its strategies. We could experience increased losses in our director and officer liability line of business if claims were made against insured financial institutions.\nA deterioration of credit and market conditions could also impair our ability to access credit markets and could affect existing or future lending arrangements. In addition, a failure to comply with covenants and other requirements under our credit facilities, senior debt and other debt obligations could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to access the credit markets.\nOur overall results are affected if a significant portion of our commercial lines or personal lines policyholders are adversely affected by marked or prolonged economic downturns and events such as a downturn in construction and related sectors, tightening credit markets and higher fuel costs experienced during recent periods. Such events make it more difficult for policyholders to finance new projects, complete projects or expand their businesses, and can lead to lower premiums from reduced payrolls and sales and lower purchases of equipment and vehicles. These events could also cause claims, including surety claims, to increase due to a policyholder’s inability to secure necessary financing to complete projects or to collect on underlying lines of credit in the claims process. Such economic downturns and events have a greater impact in the construction sector where we have a concentration of risks and in geographic areas that are hardest hit by economic downturns.\nDeteriorating economic conditions could also increase the degree of credit risk associated with amounts due from independent agents who collect premiums for payment to us and could hamper our ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.\nOur status as an insurance holding company with no direct operations could affect our ability to pay dividends in the future.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation is a regulated holding company that transacts substantially all of its business through its subsidiaries. Our primary assets are the stock in our operating subsidiaries and our investments. Consequently, our cash flow to pay cash dividends and interest on our long-term debt depends on dividends we receive from our operating subsidiaries and income earned on investments held at the parent-company level.\nDividends received from our lead insurance subsidiary are restricted by the insurance laws of Ohio, its domiciliary state. These laws establish minimum solvency and liquidity thresholds and limits. Generally, the maximum dividend that may be paid is limited to the greater of 10% of statutory capital and surplus or 100% of statutory net income for the prior calendar year. Dividends exceeding these limitations may be paid only with prior approval of the Ohio Department of Insurance. Meanwhile, other subsidiaries are also limited in their payment of dividends to the lead \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 37\nTable of Contents\ninsurance subsidiary under applicable insurance laws. We might not be able to receive dividends in the amounts necessary to meet our debt obligations or to pay dividends on our common stock without liquidating securities. See Item 1, Regulation, and Item 8, Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, for a discussion of insurance holding company dividend regulations.\n \nGeneral risk factors\nThe effects of changes in industry practices, laws and regulations on our business are uncertain.\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, legislative, regulatory, political, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to insurance pricing, claims and coverage emerge. There has been increased regulatory scrutiny of the use of machine learning and AI, and it is likely that we will be subject to new regulations that could materially adversely affect our operations or ability to write business profitably in one or more jurisdictions. These issues, and others, may adversely affect our business by impeding our ability to obtain adequate rates for covered risks or otherwise extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent, by increasing the number or size of claims, by varying assumptions underlying our critical accounting estimates or by increasing duties owed to policyholders beyond contractual obligations. In some instances, unforeseeable emerging and latent claim and coverage issues and court decisions or legislative changes may not become apparent until sometime after we have issued the insurance policies that could be affected by the changes. As a result, the full extent of liability under our insurance contracts may not be known for many years after a policy is issued and our pricing and reserve estimates may not accurately reflect its effect.\nSome of our existing or potential shareholders, policyholders, associates, regulators, and other stakeholders will evaluate our business practices according to a variety of sustainability guidelines and expectations, including those related to climate change, inclusive diversity and equity, data privacy, and the well-being of our employees. Our business practices and disclosures are evaluated against sustainability guidelines, which are continually evolving and not always well defined or readily measurable today. Our practices may not change in the particular ways or at the rate stakeholders expect, leading to business or reputational challenges. \nWe are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative organizations, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the SEC. Future changes required to be adopted could change the current accounting treatment that we apply and could result in material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOur investment income benefits from tax rate preferences for municipal bond interest and dividend income from equity securities. Market valuations for these securities also benefit from the tax-preference aspect of current tax laws, affecting the value of our investment portfolio and also shareholders’ equity. Future changes in tax laws, or other changes such as regulations for applicability of alternative minimum taxes, could result in material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe NAIC, state insurance regulators and state legislators continually re-examine existing laws and regulations governing insurance companies and insurance holding companies, specifically focusing on modifications to statutory accounting principles, interpretations of existing laws, regulations relating to product forms and pricing methodologies and the development of new laws and regulations that affect a variety of financial and nonfinancial components of our business. Any proposed or future legislation, regulation or NAIC initiatives, if adopted, may be more restrictive on our ability to conduct business than current regulatory requirements or may result in higher costs. The loss or significant restriction on the use of a particular variable, such as credit, in pricing and underwriting our products could lead to future unprofitability and increased costs.\nFederal laws and regulations and the influence of international laws and regulations, including those that may be enacted in the wake of the financial and credit crises, may have adverse effects on our business, potentially including a change from a state-based system of regulation to a system of federal regulation, the repeal of the McCarran Ferguson Act, and/or measures under the Dodd-Frank Act that established the Federal Insurance Office and Financial Stability Oversight Council. The expansion of federal measures that change the scope of insurance and financial regulation may restrict our ability to conduct our insurance business, govern our corporate affairs or increase our cost of doing business.\nIn addition, climate change and climate change transitions may continue to lead to new or enhanced regulation, which may be difficult or costly to comply with, or impact assets that we invest in, which may result in realized and \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 38\nTable of Contents\nunrealized losses in future periods that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial position. It is not possible to foresee the impacts of potential future climate regulation, or which, if any, assets, industries or markets may be materially and adversely affected by global climate change and global climate change transitions, nor is it possible to foresee the magnitude of such effects. The effects of such changes could adversely affect our results of operations. See Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Property Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves and Life Insurance Policy Reserves, for a discussion of our reserving practices.\nElevated inflation negatively impacts profit and the value of investments.\nInflation in various forms, such as we experienced in recent periods, reduces underwriting profitability due to higher losses and loss expenses to repair damaged autos or other property that we insure. Inflationary volatility has and may in the future have an increased impact on us due to the three-year rates offered on some of our commercial lines policies. Elevated inflation can also be in the form of social inflation of litigation costs, jury awards and settlement expectations. In addition to adverse effects on the fair value of our equity portfolio, inflationary pressures can also cause or contribute to, or are the result of, increases in interest rates, which reduces the fair value of our fixed-maturity portfolio. \nManaging technology initiatives and meeting data security requirements are significant challenges.\nWe use technology to process, store, retrieve, evaluate and use customer and company data and information. Our information technology and telecommunications systems, in turn, interface with and rely upon third-party systems. We must be able to access our systems to provide insurance quotes, process premium payments, make changes to existing policies, file and pay claims, provide customer support, manage our investment portfolios, report on financial results and perform other necessary business functions. Systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform these business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers. In the event of a disaster such as a natural catastrophe, a pandemic, civil unrest, an industrial accident, a cyberattack, a blackout, a terrorist attack (including conventional, nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological) or war, systems upon which we rely may be inaccessible to our associates or independent agents for an extended period of time. Even if our associates and independent agents are able to report to work, they may be unable to perform their duties for an extended period of time if our data or systems used to conduct our business are disabled or destroyed. While technology can streamline many business processes and reduce the costs of operations, technology initiatives present short-term cost and also have implementation and operational risks. In addition, we may have inaccurate expense projections, implementation schedules or expectations regarding the effectiveness and user acceptance of the end product. These issues could escalate over time. If we were unable to find and retain associates with key technical knowledge, our ability to develop and deploy key technology solutions could be hampered.\nOur systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to viruses or other malicious code, unauthorized access, cyberattacks, cyber frauds or other computer-related penetrations. Increasing sophistication of cyber criminals and terrorists make keeping up with new threats difficult and could result in a breach. Patching and other measures to protect existing systems and servers could be inadequate, especially on systems that are being retired. Controls employed by our U.S., off-shore and cloud vendors could prove inadequate. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of associates or other internal or external sources. Independent agencies with access to our systems and servers expose us to additional cyber threats. Our systems and those of third-party vendors may become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, viruses, ransomware and malware.\nA breach of our security or the security of a vendor that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs and reputational damage. From time to time we have had to, and in the future we may need to, increase or expend resources to investigate or remediate vulnerabilities as a result of data security incidents. Such resources are costly in time and expense, and detract from resources spent on or are otherwise devoted to our core operations. In addition, depending on the nature of an incident, we may not be able to detect an incident readily, assess its severity or impact, or appropriately respond in a timely manner, which could increase our risk and exposures.

    "item1c": "ITEM 1C.     \nCybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nAs discussed further in Item 1, Regulation, Enterprise Risk Management, \nwe manage cybersecurity as part of our overall enterprise risk programs\n. \nAs part of this program to keep our systems and data secure and to assist in understanding, assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, we take various measures through internal risk management efforts and testing by third-party experts. Those measures assess our cybersecurity program structure and capabilities and include blocking attempted cyber intrusions, defending against service disruptions, performing frequent vulnerability assessments and maintaining procedures to ensure timely notification of critical cybersecurity incidents and performance of related disclosure controls. We also have developed procedures and reporting processes when we identify an attempted cyber intrusion to the systems of one of our independent agents.\n \nAdditionally, \nthe company uses third-party service providers, or vendors, in the course of conducting its operations\n.  As such, \nthe company has measures in place to help identify material risks from cybersecurity threats associated with the use of those vendors.\n When work with a vendor is evaluated, we consider, among other items, the availability of system and organization control reports, the use of artificial intelligence, interactions with our systems, the data involved and its level of sensitivity, the amount of data the vendor will process, where the data will be stored, what they will do with the data and destruction of data. Once a vendor is approved by the appropriate personnel, expectations regarding incident reporting are established and followed. \nWe are not aware of having experienced a material cybersecurity incident and we take commercially reasonable measures, described above and below, to monitor and respond to threats to keep our systems and data secure.\n However, we acknowledge that administrative, technical and internal accounting controls as well as other preventative actions may be insufficient to prevent security breaches to our systems or those of third parties with whom we do business due to, among other factors, changing technologies as well as criminal and state-sponsored cybercrime and cyber threats. Further, a material breach of our security or the security of a vendor that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, significant increases in compliance costs and reputational damage and could affect the company's strategy, results of operations or financial condition.

We also are subject to public and regulatory initiatives that can affect the market value for our common stock, such as measures affecting corporate financial reporting and governance. The ultimate changes and eventual effects, if any, of these initiatives are uncertain.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 111\nTable of Contents\nI\nTEM\n 7\nA\n.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nIntroduction\nMarket risk is the potential for a decrease in securities value resulting from broad yet uncontrollable forces such as inflation, economic growth, interest rates, world political conditions or other widespread unpredictable events. It is comprised of many individual risks that, when combined, create a macroeconomic impact. The company accepts and manages risks in its investment portfolio as part of the means of achieving portfolio objectives. Some of the risks are:\n•\nPolitical – the potential for a decrease in value due to the real or perceived impact of governmental policies or conditions\n•\nRegulatory – the potential for a decrease in value due to the impact of legislative proposals or changes in laws or regulations\n•\nEconomic – the potential for a decrease in value due to changes in general economic factors (recession, inflation, deflation, etc.)\n•\nRevaluation – the potential for a decrease in value due to a change in relative value (change in market multiple) of the market brought on by general economic factors\n•\nInterest-rate – the potential for a decrease in value of a security or portfolio due to its sensitivity to changes (increases or decreases) in the general level of interest rates\nCompany-specific risk is the potential for a particular issuer to experience a decline in value due to the impact of sector or market risk on the holding or because of issues specific to the firm:\n•\nFraud – the potential for a negative impact on an issuer’s performance due to actual or alleged illegal or improper activity of individuals it employs\n•\nCredit – the potential for deterioration in an issuer’s financial profile due to specific company issues, problems it faces in the course of its operations or industry-related issues\n•\nDefault – the possibility that an issuer will not make a required payment (interest payment or return of principal) on its debt. Generally this occurs after its financial profile has deteriorated (credit risk) and it no longer has the means to make its payments\nThe investment committee of the board of directors monitors the investment risk management process primarily through its executive oversight of our investment activities. We take an active approach to managing market and other investment risks, including the accountabilities and controls over these activities. Actively managing these market risks is integral to our operations and could require us to change the character of future investments purchased or sold or require us to shift the existing asset portfolios to manage exposure to market risk within acceptable ranges.\n \nSector risk is the potential for a negative impact on a particular industry due to its sensitivity to factors that make up market risk. Market risk affects general supply or demand factors for an industry and affects companies within that industry to varying degrees.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 112\nTable of Contents\nRisks associated with the asset classes described in Item 1, Our Segments, Investments Segment, can be summarized as follows (H – high, A – average, L – low):\n \n \nTaxable\nfixed maturities\n \nTax-exempt\nfixed maturities\n \nCommon\nequities\n \nNonredeemable preferred\nequities\nShort-term investments\nPolitical\n \nA\n \nH\n \nA\n \nA\nL\nRegulatory\n \nA\n \nA\n \nA\n \nA\nL\nEconomic\n \nA\n \nA\n \nH\n \nA\nL\nRevaluation\n \nH\n \nH\n \nH\n \nH\nL\nInterest rate\n \nA\n \nA\n \nA\n \nA\nL\nFraud\n \nA\n \nL\n \nA\n \nA\nL\nCredit\n \nA\n \nL\n \nA\n \nA\nL\nDefault\n \nA\n \nL\n \nA\n \nA\nL\n \n \nFixed-Maturity Securities Investments\nFor fixed-maturity securities, the inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices leads to falling bond values during periods of increasing interest rates. We address this risk by attempting to construct a generally laddered maturity schedule that allows us to reinvest cash flows at prevailing rates. Although the potential for a worsening financial condition, and ultimately default, does exist with investment-grade corporate bonds, we address this risk by performing credit analysis and monitoring as well as maintaining a diverse portfolio of holdings.\n \nThe primary risk related to high-yield corporate bonds is credit risk. A weak financial profile can lead to rating downgrades from the credit rating agencies, which can put further downward pressure on bond prices. Interest rate risk, while significant, is less of a factor with high-yield corporate bonds, as valuation is related more directly to underlying operating performance than to general interest rates. This puts more emphasis on the financial results achieved by the issuer rather than on general economic trends or statistics within the marketplace. We address this concern by analyzing issuer- and industry-specific financial results and by closely monitoring holdings within this asset class.\n \nThe primary risks related to tax-exempt bonds are interest rate risk and political risk associated with the specific economic environment within the political boundaries of the issuing municipal entity. We address these concerns by focusing on municipalities’ general-obligation debt and on essential-service bonds. Essential-service bonds derive a revenue stream from municipal services that are vital to the people living in the area (water service, sewer service, etc.). Another risk related to tax-exempt bonds is regulatory risk or the potential for legislative changes that would negate the benefit of owning tax-exempt bonds. We monitor regulatory activity for situations that may negatively affect current holdings and our ongoing strategy for investing in these securities.\n \nThe final, less significant risk is our exposure to credit risk for a portion of the tax-exempt portfolio that has support from corporate entities. Examples are bonds insured by corporate bond insurers or bonds with interest payments made by a corporate entity through a municipal conduit or authority. Our decisions regarding these investments primarily consider the underlying municipal situation. The existence of third-party insurance is intended to reduce risk in the event of default. In circumstances in which the municipality is unable to meet its obligations, risk would be increased if the insuring entity were experiencing financial duress. Because of our diverse exposure and selection of higher-rated entities with strong financial profiles, we do not believe this is a material concern as we discuss in Item 1, Our Segments, Investments Segment.\n \nInterest Rate Sensitivity Analysis\nBecause of our strong shareholders’ equity, long-term investment horizon and ability to hold most fixed-maturity investments to maturity, we believe the company is well-positioned if interest rates were to rise. A higher rate environment would provide the opportunity to invest cash flow in higher-yielding securities, while reducing the likelihood of untimely redemptions of currently callable securities. While higher interest rates would be expected to increase the number of fixed-maturity holdings fair valued below 100% of amortized cost, we believe lower fixed-maturity security values due solely to interest rate changes would not signal a decline in credit quality.\n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 113\nTable of Contents\nOur dynamic financial planning model uses analytical tools to assess market risks. As part of this model, the effective duration of the fixed-maturity portfolio is continually monitored by our investment department to evaluate the theoretical impact of interest rate movements.\n \nThe table below summarizes the effect of an instantaneous hypothetical change in interest rates on the fair value of our fixed-maturity portfolio.\n(Dollars in millions)\nEffect from interest rate change in basis points\n \n-200\n-100\n—\n100\n200\nAt December 31, 2024\n$\n17,750\n \n$\n16,967\n \n$\n16,182\n \n$\n15,317\n \n$\n14,433\n \nAt December 31, 2023\n$\n14,962 \n$\n14,375 \n$\n13,791 \n$\n13,179 \n$\n12,543 \n \nThe effective duration of the fixed-maturity portfolio was 5.0 years at year-end 2024, up from 4.3 years at year-end 2023. A 100-basis-point movement in interest rates would result in an approximately 5.1% change in the fair value of the fixed-maturity portfolio. Generally speaking, the higher a bond is rated, the more directly correlated movements in its fair value are to changes in the general level of interest rates, exclusive of call features. The fair values of average- to lower-rated corporate bonds are additionally influenced by the expansion or contraction of credit spreads.\n \nIn the dynamic financial planning model, the selected interest rate change of 100 to 200 basis points represents our views of a shift in rates that is quite possible over a one-year period. The rates modeled should not be considered a prediction of future events as interest rates may be much more volatile in the future. The analysis is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in rates on our results or financial condition, nor does it take into account any actions that we might take to reduce exposure to such risks.\nShort-Term Investments\nOur short-term investments consist of commercial paper purchased within one year of maturity. We make short-term investments primarily with funds to be used to make upcoming cash payments, such as dividends, taxes or other corporate purposes. At year-end 2024, we had $298 million of short-term investments compared with none at year-end 2023. \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 114\nTable of Contents\nEquity Securities Investments\nOur equity portfolio is subject to a variety of risk factors encompassed under the umbrella of market risk. General economic swings influence the performance of the underlying industries and companies within those industries. Industry- and company-specific risks also have the potential to substantially affect the value of our portfolio. Our investment guidelines help address these risks by diversifying the portfolio and establishing parameters to help manage exposures. \nThe table below summarizes the effect of hypothetical changes in market prices on the fair value of our equity portfolio.\n(Dollars in millions)\nEffect from market price change in percent\n \n-30%\n-20%\n-10%\n—\n10%\n20%\n30%\nAt December 31, 2024\n$\n7,830\n \n$\n8,948\n \n$\n10,067\n \n$\n11,185\n \n$\n12,304\n \n$\n13,422\n \n$\n14,541\n \nAt December 31, 2023\n$\n7,692 \n$\n8,791 \n$\n9,890 \n$\n10,989 \n$\n12,088 \n$\n13,187 \n$\n14,286 \nOur equity holdings represented $11.185 billion in fair value at year-end 2024. No holding had a fair value greater than 8.3% of our $10.836 billion common stock portfolio. We had 38 holdings (among nine different sectors) each with a fair value greater than $100 million. See Item 1, Our Segments, Investments Segment and Item 8, Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, for additional details on our holdings.\nThe primary risks related to preferred stocks are similar to those related to investment-grade corporate bonds. Rising interest rates adversely affect market values due to the normal inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices. Credit risk exists due to the subordinate position of preferred stocks in the capital structure. We minimize this risk by primarily purchasing investment-grade preferred stocks of issuers with a strong history of paying a common stock dividend.\n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 115\nTable of Contents\nApplication of Asset Impairment Policy\nAs discussed in Item 7, Critical Accounting Estimates, Asset Impairment, our fixed-maturity investment portfolio is evaluated for \ncredit-related impairments\n. The company’s asset impairment committee monitors a number of significant factors for indications of investments with a fair value below the carrying amount that may not be recoverable. The application of our impairment policy resulted in \nwrite-downs of impaired securities intended to be sold \nthat reduced our income before income taxes by less than $1 million in 2024, $4 million in 2023 and $5 million in 2022. Impairments are discussed in Item 7, Investments Results.\n \nWe expect the number of fixed-maturity and short-term securities with a fair value below 100% of amortized cost to fluctuate as interest rates rise or fall and credit spreads expand or contract due to prevailing economic conditions. Further, amortized cost for some securities have been revised due to impairment charges recognized in prior periods. At year-end 2024, 3,723 of the 5,090 fixed-maturity and short-term securities we owned had a fair value below 100% of amortized cost compared with 2,840 of the 4,738 at year-end 2023 and 3,272 of the 4,521 at year-end 2022.\n \nThe 3,723 holdings fair valued below amortized cost at year-end 2024 represented 75.9% of our fixed-maturity and short-term investments portfolio and $631 million in unrealized losses.\n•\n2,874 of these holdings were fair valued between 90% and 100% of amortized cost. The value of these securities fluctuates primarily because of changes in interest rates. The fair value of these 2,874 securities was $10.993 billion at year-end 2024, and they accounted for $272 million in unrealized losses.\n•\n830 of these holdings were fair valued between 70% and 90% of amortized cost. The fair value of these holdings was $1.485 billion, and they accounted for $344 million in unrealized losses.\n•\n19 of these holdings had a fair value below 70% of amortized cost. The fair value of these holdings was $28 million, and they accounted for $15 million in unrealized losses.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 116\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the length of time securities in the investment portfolio have been in a continuous unrealized loss position.\n(Dollars in millions)\nLess than 12 months\n12 months or more\nTotal\nAt December 31, 2024\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized\nlosses\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized\nlosses\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized\nlosses\nFixed-maturity:\nCorporate \n$\n2,815\n \n$\n78\n \n$\n3,634\n \n$\n255\n \n$\n6,449\n \n$\n333\n \nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions\n1,513\n \n25\n \n1,898\n \n245\n \n3,411\n \n270\n \nGovernment-sponsored enterprises\n1,876\n \n8\n \n92\n \n1\n \n1,968\n \n9\n \nAsset-backed\n331\n \n10\n \n96\n \n7\n \n427\n \n17\n \nUnited States government\n48\n \n—\n \n100\n \n2\n \n148\n \n2\n \nForeign government\n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \nTotal fixed-maturity\n6,583\n \n121\n \n5,823\n \n510\n \n12,406\n \n631\n \nShort-term\n100\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n100\n \n—\n \nTotal fixed-maturity and short-term investments\n$\n6,683\n \n$\n121\n \n$\n5,823\n \n$\n510\n \n$\n12,506\n \n$\n631\n \nAt December 31, 2023\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFixed-maturity:\nCorporate \n$\n379 \n$\n13 \n$\n5,560 \n$\n441 \n$\n5,939 \n$\n454 \nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions\n313 \n2 \n1,932 \n206 \n2,245 \n208 \nGovernment-sponsored enterprises\n652 \n3 \n113 \n3 \n765 \n6 \nAsset-backed \n5 \n— \n172 \n16 \n177 \n16 \nUnited States government\n32 \n— \n129 \n3 \n161 \n3 \nForeign government\n3 \n— \n6 \n— \n9 \n— \nTotal fixed-maturity\n1,384 \n18 \n7,912 \n669 \n9,296 \n687 \nShort-term\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nTotal fixed-maturity and short-term investments\n$\n1,384 \n$\n18 \n$\n7,912 \n$\n669 \n$\n9,296 \n$\n687 \n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation -

The amounts, presented on an accrual basis, reflect our best estimates and judgment. These statements are consistent in all material aspects with other financial information in the Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our accounting system and related internal controls are designed to assure that our books and records accurately reflect the company’s transactions in accordance with established policies and procedures as implemented by qualified personnel.\n \nOur board of directors has established an audit committee of independent outside directors. We believe these directors are free from any relationships that could interfere with their independent judgment as audit committee members.\n \nThe audit committee meets periodically with management, our independent registered public accounting firm and our internal auditors to discuss how each is handling its respective responsibilities. The audit committee reports its findings to the board of directors. The audit committee recommends to the board the annual appointment of the independent registered public accounting firm. The audit committee reviews with this firm the scope of the audit assignment and the adequacy of internal controls and procedures.\n \nDeloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, audited the consolidated financial statements of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2024. Deloitte & Touche LLP met with our audit committee to discuss the results of its audit. They have the opportunity to discuss the adequacy of internal controls and the quality of financial reporting without management present.\n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 119\nTable of Contents\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Cincinnati Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\nPertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n•\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the company; and\n•\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls. Accordingly, even effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time.\n \nThe company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Management’s assessment was based on the criteria established in the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and was designed to provide reasonable assurance that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The assessment led management to conclude that, as of December 31, 2024, the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\n \nThe company’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. \n \n/S/ Stephen M.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 121\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nProperty and Casualty Insurance Loss and Loss Expense Reserves — Refer to Note 4 to the financial statements\n.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s property and casualty insurance loss and loss expense reserves for long-tailed lines of business, such as workers’ compensation, commercial casualty and certain other liability lines (referred to as “loss and loss expense reserves”), are determined by the Company using actuarial methods, models, assumptions, and judgment to estimate the reserves (“actuarial estimates”) required to pay for and settle all outstanding insured claims, including incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims, as of the financial statement date. The actuarial estimates of loss and loss expense reserves are subject to review and adjustment by Company management.\nLoss and loss expense reserves are inherently uncertain as to timing and amount and the recorded loss and loss expense reserves may vary materially from the actual ultimate cost of claims. Given the subjectivity in estimating ultimate loss and loss expense reserves, due to uncertainties concerning the future emergence of loss and loss expenses, inflation trends, and the judicial environment, among other factors, auditing loss and loss expense reserves involved an especially high degree of auditor judgment, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to loss and loss expense reserves included the following, among others: \n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to loss and loss expense reserves, including those over the review of actuarial methods, models, assumptions and judgments used, and management’s review of the estimates.\n•\nWe tested the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analyses, including historical claims data, to test the reasonableness of key inputs to the actuarial estimates.\n•\nWith the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we used the Company’s claims data and other inputs, to develop a range of independent estimates for the loss and loss expense reserves.  We used these independent estimates to assess the reasonableness of the Company’s reserves by comparing our estimates to the Company’s recorded loss and loss expense reserves.\n•\nWe compared the Company’s prior year estimates of expected incurred losses to actual experience during the current year to identify potential bias in the determination of loss and loss expense reserves.\n/S/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n \nCincinnati, Ohio\nFebruary 24, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1980.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation -

2024 10-K - Page 127\nTable of Contents\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNOTE 1 – \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n \nNature of Operations\nCincinnati Financial Corporation (CFC) operates through The Cincinnati Insurance Company and Cincinnati Global Underwriting Ltd.\nSM\n (Cincinnati Global) insurance subsidiaries and \ntwo\n complementary subsidiary companies. \nThe Cincinnati Insurance Company leads our insurance group that also includes \ntwo\n subsidiaries: The Cincinnati Casualty Company and The Cincinnati Indemnity Company. This group markets a broad range of standard market commercial and personal policies. The group focuses on delivery of quality customer service to our select group of \n2,175\n independent insurance agencies with \n3,355\n reporting locations across \n46\n states. Other subsidiaries of The Cincinnati Insurance Company include: The Cincinnati Life Insurance Company, which markets life insurance and fixed annuities; and The Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company, which offers excess and surplus lines property casualty insurance products. The Cincinnati Insurance Company also conducts the business of our reinsurance assumed operations, Cincinnati Re\n®\n. \n \nThe \ntwo\n CFC complementary subsidiaries are CSU Producer Resources Inc., which provides insurance brokerage services to our independent agencies so their clients can access our excess and surplus lines insurance products, and CFC Investment Company, which offers commercial leasing and financing services to our agents, their clients and other customers.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent and its wholly owned subsidiaries and are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Foreign exchange rates related to Cincinnati Global's operations did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n \nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \nInvestments\nOur portfolio investments are primarily in publicly traded fixed-maturity, equity security and short-term investments. Fixed-maturity (taxable bonds, including redeemable preferred equities, tax-exempt bonds and asset-backed securities) and short-term (commercial paper purchased within one year of maturity) investments classified as available for sale and equity security investments (common and nonredeemable preferred equities) are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. Changes in fair value of fixed-maturity and short-term investments are reported in other comprehensive income while changes in fair value of equity securities are reported in net income. The number of fixed-maturity securities with fair values below 100% of amortized cost can be expected to fluctuate as interest rates rise or fall. Because of our strong capital and long-term investment horizon, our general intent is to hold fixed-maturity investments until maturity, regardless of short-term fluctuations in fair values.\n \nAn available for sale fixed maturity is impaired if the fair value of the security is below amortized cost. The impaired loss is charged to net income when we have the intent to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost. For impaired securities we intend to hold, an allowance for credit related losses is recorded in investment losses when the company determines a credit loss has been incurred based on certain factors such as adverse conditions, credit rating downgrades or failure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments.  A credit loss is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis by comparing the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis, limited to the difference between fair value and amortized cost. Noncredit losses are recognized in other comprehensive income as a change in unrealized gains and losses on investments. As securities are sold, we recognize the gain or loss in net income based on the trade date.  \n \n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 128\nTable of Contents\nIncluded within our other invested assets were $\n567\n million and $\n434\n million of private equity investments, $\n94\n million and $\n66\n million of real estate through direct property ownership and development projects in the United States, $\n36\n million and $\n33\n million of life policy loans and $\n16\n million and $\n44\n million held on deposit at Lloyd's at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The private equity investments provide their financial statements to us and generally report investments on their balance sheets at fair value. We use the equity method of accounting for private equity and real estate development investments. Lloyd's deposits primarily consist of highly liquid short-term investment instruments. Life policy loans are carried at the receivable value.\nInvestment income, net of expenses, consists mainly of interest and dividends. We record interest on an accrual basis and record dividends at the ex-dividend date. We amortize premiums and discounts on fixed-maturity securities using the effective interest method over the expected life of the security.\n \nFair Value Disclosures\nFair value is defined as the exit price or the amount that would be (1) received to sell an asset or (2) paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date. When determining an exit price, we rely upon observable market data whenever possible. We primarily base fair value for investments in equity, fixed-maturity and short-term securities (including assets held in separate accounts) on quoted market prices or on prices from the company’s nationally recognized pricing vendors, outside resources that supply global securities pricing, dividend, corporate action and descriptive information to support fund pricing, securities operations, research and portfolio management. The company obtains and reviews the pricing services' valuation methodologies and related inputs and validates these prices by replicating a sample across each asset class using a discounted cash flow model. When a price is not available from these sources, as in the case of securities that are not publicly traded, we determine the fair value using various inputs including quotes from independent brokers. The fair value of investments not priced by the company’s nationally recognized pricing vendors is immaterial.\nFor the purpose of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 825, \nFinancial Instruments\n disclosure, we estimate the fair value of our long-term senior notes on market pricing of similar debt instruments that are actively trading. We estimate the fair value of our note payable on the year-end outstanding balance because it is short term and tied to a variable interest rate. We estimate the fair value of liabilities for investment contracts and annuities using discounted cash flow calculations across a wide range of economic interest rate scenarios with a provision for our nonperformance risk. We estimate the fair value for policyholder loans on insurance contracts using a discounted cash flow model. Determination of fair value for structured settlements assumes the discount rates used to calculate the present value of expected payments are the risk-free spot rates plus an A3 rated bond spread for financial issuers at December 31, 2024, to account for nonperformance risk. See Note 3, Fair Value Measurements, for further details.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents are highly liquid instruments that include liquid debt instruments with original maturities of less than three months. These are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\n \n \nProperty Casualty Insurance\nThe consolidated property casualty companies actively write property casualty insurance through independent agencies in \n46\n states. Our 10 largest states generated \n50.1\n% of total earned premiums in 2024 and 2023. Ohio, our largest state, accounted for \n13.1\n% and \n13.4\n% of total earned premiums in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Illinois, New York, North Carolina and Pennsylvania each accounted for between \n4\n% and \n6\n% of total earned premiums in 2024. Our largest single agency relationship accounted for approximately \n0.5\n% of our total property casualty earned premiums in 2024. No aggregate agency relationship locations under a single ownership structure accounted for more than \n8\n% of our total property casualty earned premiums in 2024. We record revenues for installment charges as fee revenues in the consolidated statements of income. \n \nProperty casualty written premiums are deferred and recorded as earned premiums primarily on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies. We record as unearned premiums the portion of written premiums that applies to unexpired policy terms. Expenses associated with successfully acquiring insurance policies – commissions, premium taxes and underwriting costs – are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies. We assess recoverability of deferred acquisition costs at a level consistent with the way we acquire, service and manage insurance policies and measure profitability. We analyze our acquisition cost assumptions to reflect actual experience, and we evaluate potential premium deficiencies.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 129\nTable of Contents\nCertain property casualty policies are not entered into policy underwriting systems as of the effective date of coverage. An estimate is recorded for these unprocessed written premiums. A large majority of the estimate is unearned and has no material impact on earned premiums.\nAn allowance for credit losses on uncollectible property casualty premiums is updated and reviewed on a quarterly basis. The allowance for credit losses was $\n18\n million, $\n16\n million and $\n13\n million at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Changes in the amount for each period were immaterial.\n \nWe establish reserves to cover the expected cost of claims, losses and expenses related to investigating, processing and resolving claims. Although the appropriate amount of reserves is inherently uncertain, we base our decisions on past experience and current facts. Reserves are based on claims reported prior to the end of the year and estimates of incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims. We regularly review and update reserves using the most current information available. Any resulting adjustments are reflected in current calendar year insurance losses and policyholder benefits. We estimate that we may recover some of our costs through salvage and subrogation.\n \nPolicyholder Dividends\nCertain workers’ compensation policies include the possibility of a policyholder earning a return of a portion of premium in the form of a policyholder dividend. The dividend generally is calculated by determining the profitability of a policy year along with the associated premium. We reserve for all probable future policyholder dividend payments. We record policyholder dividends as other underwriting expenses.\n \nLife Insurance\nWe offer several types of life insurance and we account for each according to the duration of the contract. Short-duration life and health contracts are written to cover claims that arise during a short, fixed term of coverage. We generally have the right to change the amount of premium charged or cancel the coverage at the end of each contract term. We record premiums for short-duration life and health contracts similarly to property casualty contracts.\n \nLong-duration contracts are written to provide coverage for an extended period of time. Traditional long-duration contracts require policyholders to pay scheduled gross premiums, generally not less frequently than annually, over the term of the coverage. Premiums for these contracts, such as whole life insurance, are recognized as revenue when due. Some traditional long-duration contracts, such as ten-pay whole life insurance, have premium payment periods shorter than the period over which coverage is provided. For these contracts, the excess of premium over the amount required to pay expenses and benefits is recognized over the term of the coverage rather than over the premium payment period. \nWe establish reserves for traditional long-duration contracts, including term, whole life and other products, based on th\ne present value of future benefits and claim expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Net premium is the portion of gross premium required to provide for all benefits and claim expenses. We estimate future benefits and claim expenses and net pr\nemium using certain cash flow assumptions including mortality, morbidity and lapse rates as well as a discount rate assumption. The cash flow assumptions are established based on our current expectations and are reviewed annually to determine any necessary updates. These assumptions are also updated on an interim basis if evidence suggests that they should be revised. We use both our own experience and industry experience, adjusted for historical trends, in arriving at our cash flow assumptions. The discount rate assumption is based on upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument yields (market value discount rates) and is updated quarterly. Certain assumptions, including the mortality, lapse and long-term interest rate reversion targets, were updated in 2024 as part of our annual assumption unlocking. See Note 5, Life Policy and Investment Contract Reserves, for further detail regarding the measurement impact on traditional long-duration contract reserves due to changes in the inputs, judgments and assumptions during the period.\n \nWe also offer universal life, deferred annuity and other investment contracts. Universal life contracts are long-duration contracts for which contractual provisions are not fixed, unlike whole life insurance. Universal life contracts allow policyholders to vary the amount of premium, within limits, without our consent. \nHowever, we may vary the mortality, expense charges and the interest crediting rate, within limits, used to accumulate policy values. We do not record universal life premiums as revenue. Instead we recognize as revenue the mortality charges, administration charges and surrender charges when assessed. Some of our universal life contracts assess administration charges in the early years of the contract that are compensation for services we will provide in the later years of the contract. These administrati\non charges are deferred and are recognized over the period when we provide those future \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 130\nTable of Contents\nservices. Deferred annuities provide regular income payments to annuitants once certain criteria are met. During the deferral period, payments made by the annuitants under the contract accumulate at the crediting rate declared by the company but not less than a contract-specified guaranteed minimum interest rate. We also do not record deferred annuity premiums as revenue. \nWe establish reserves for our universal life, deferred annuity and other investment contracts equal to the cumulative account balances, which include premium deposits plus credited interest less charges and withdrawals. Some of our universal life insurance policies contain no-lapse guarantee provisions. For these policies, we establish a reserve in addition to the account balance based on expected no-lapse guarantee benefits and expected policy assessments.\n \nWe capitalize acquisition costs associated with successfully acquiring traditional and universal life long-duration contracts. We charge these capitalized costs to expenses on a constant-level basis that approximates \nstraight-line\n amortization over the expected term of the related contracts.\n \nAn allowance for credit losses on uncollectible life insurance premiums is updated and reviewed on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the allowance, including changes in the amount for each period, was immaterial.\n \n \nSeparate Accounts\nWe have issued universal life contracts with guaranteed minimum returns, referred to as bank-owned life insurance contracts (BOLIs). A BOLI is designed so the bank is the policy owner and the policy beneficiary. We legally segregate and record as separate accounts the assets and liabilities for certain BOLIs, when required by the specific contract provisions. We guarantee minimum investment returns, account values and death benefits for our separate account BOLIs. Our other BOLIs are general account products.\n \nWe carry the assets of separate account BOLIs at fair value. The liabilities on separate account BOLIs primarily are carried at an amount equal to the contract holders’ account value, plus any cumulative unrealized gains on the related assets impacting separate account liabilities. The contract holders’ account value exceeded the current fair value of the BOLI invested assets and cash by approximately $\n42\n million and $\n43\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nGenerally, investment income and investment gains and losses of the separate accounts accrue directly to the contract holder, and we do not include them in the consolidated statements of income. Revenues and expenses related to separate accounts consist of contractual fees and mortality, surrender and expense risk charges. Also, each separate account BOLI includes a negotiated capital gain and loss sharing arrangement between the company and the bank. A percentage of each separate account’s investment gains and losses representing contract fees and assessments accrues to us and is transferred from the separate account to our general account and is recognized as revenue or expense. We record as revenues separate account investment management fees in fee revenues of the consolidated statements of income.\n \nReinsurance \nThe Cincinnati Insurance Company offers reinsurance assumed for casualty (predominantly domestic exposure), specialty and property (worldwide exposure). Treaties are written on a pro rata and excess of loss basis. We also continue to assume risk with limited exposure as a reinsurer for involuntary state pools. \nWritten premium is recorded, net of contract specific retrocessions, on an ultimate estimate basis and primarily earned on a pro rata basis over the coverage period of the treaty. Expenses are recorded as per contract terms and deferred over the earning period of the premium.\nWe establish known loss reserves when reported. We establish reserves for losses in excess of reported activity in the form of IBNR. Reserves are established using actuarial analysis, which includes models and methods traditionally used for the types of exposures written. We establish reserves for event specific occurrences using modeling data and company specific data when available.\nWe enter into other reinsurance transactions to reduce risk and uncertainty by buying property casualty reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance as well as life reinsurance. Reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance contracts do \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 131\nTable of Contents\nnot relieve us from our obligation to policyholders, but rather help protect our financial strength to perform that duty. All of these ceded reinsurance contracts transfer the economic risk of loss. \nPremiums that we cede are deferred and recorded as earned premiums on a pro rata basis over the terms of the contracts. We estimate loss amounts recoverable from our reinsurers based on the reinsurance policy terms.  Historically, our claims with reinsurers have been paid. \nAn allowance for credit losses on uncollectible reinsurance premiums and recoverable assets is updated and reviewed on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the allowances, including changes in the amount for each period, were immaterial.\nIncome Taxes\nWe calculate deferred income tax liabilities and assets using tax rates in effect when temporary differences in taxable income and financial statement income are expected to reverse. We recognize deferred income taxes for numerous temporary differences between our taxable income and financial statement income and other changes in shareholders’ equity. Such temporary differences relate primarily to unrealized gains and losses on investments and differences in the recognition of deferred acquisition costs, unearned premiums, insurance reserves, international earnings and basis differences in the carrying value of investments held. We charge deferred income taxes associated with balances that impact other comprehensive income, such as unrealized gains and losses of fixed-maturity investments, to shareholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI). We charge deferred taxes associated with other differences to income. \nSee Note 11, Income Taxes, for further detail on our uncertain tax positions and other income tax items. Although \nno\n Internal Revenue Service (IRS) penalties currently are accrued, if incurred, they would be recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nEarnings per Share\nNet income per common share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each of the respective years. We calculate net income per common share (diluted) assuming the exercise or conversion of share‑based awards using the treasury stock method.\nLand, Building and Equipment\nWe record land at cost, and record building and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. Equipment held under finance leases also is classified as property and equipment with the related lease obligations recorded as liabilities. We capitalize and amortize costs for internally developed computer software during the application development stage. These costs generally consist of external consulting fees and internal payroll-related costs. Our depreciation is based on estimated useful lives (ranging from \nthree\n to \n39.5\n years) using straight-line and accelerated methods. Depreciation expense was $\n34\n million for 2024, $\n30\n million for 2023 and $\n33\n million for 2022. We review our accumulated depreciation for our building, equipment and software assets and write off fully depreciated assets for obsolescence and nonuse.\n \nWe monitor land, building and equipment and software assets for potential impairments. Indicators of potential impairments may include a significant decrease in the fair values of the assets, considerable cost overruns on projects, a change in legal factors or business climate or other factors that indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or useful. There were \nno\n recorded land, building and equipment impairments for 2024, 2023 or 2022.\n \nFinance Receivables\nOur leasing subsidiary provides auto and equipment direct financing (leases and loans) to commercial and individual clients. We generally transfer ownership of the property to the client as the terms of the leases expire. Our lease contracts contain bargain purchase options. We account for these leases and loans as sales-type leases. We capitalize and amortize lease or loan origination costs over the life of the financing, using the effective interest method. These costs may include, but are not limited to finder fees, broker fees, filing fees and the cost of credit reports. We record income as other revenues over the financing term using the effective interest method in the consolidated statements of income. An allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is updated and reviewed on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the allowance, including changes in the amount for each period, was immaterial.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 132\nTable of Contents\nEmployee Benefit Pension Plan\nWe sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan that was modified during 2008. We closed entry into the pension plan, and only participants \n40\n years of age or older could elect to remain in the plan. Our pension expenses are based on certain actuarial assumptions and also are composed of several components that are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. Refer to Note 13, Employee Retirement Benefits, for more information about our defined benefit pension plan.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe grant qualified and nonqualified share-based compensation under authorized plans. The stock options generally vest on a graded scale over \nthree years\n following the date of grant and are exercisable over \n10\n-year periods. We grant service-based restricted stock units that cliff vest \nthree years\n after the date of grant as well as service-based\n \nrestricted stock units that vest ratably over the \nthree\n-year vesting term. We also grant performance-based restricted stock units that vest if certain market conditions are attained. In 2024, the CFC compensation committee approved share-based awards including incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, service-based restricted and performance-based restricted stock units. See Note 17, Share-Based Associate Compensation Plans, for further details.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe recognize goodwill and intangible assets generated through acquisitions within other assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill arises when the fair value of consideration transferred exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired at the acquisition date. Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are not amortized. Intangible assets with a definite life are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows: broker relationships, over \n15\n years; internally developed technology, over \nfive years\n, \nand which became fully amortized during 2024. \nWe test for impairments on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The company performed its annual impairment test on goodwill and intangibles at September 30, which did not result in the recognition of an impairment los\ns. Within Cincinnati Global, and included in Other, the company held goodwill of $\n30\n million and intangible assets with an indefinite life of $\n31\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nSubsequent Events\nIn January 2025, a series of wildfires began to spread in southern California, particularly in areas surrounding Los Angeles.  \nRelated to these wildfires, we currently estimate first quarter 2025 pretax catastrophe losses of approximately $\n450\n million to $\n525\n million, net of reinsurance recoveries, with approximately \n73\n% of the impact to our personal lines insurance segment, \n24\n% to Cincinnati Re and \n3\n% to our Cincinnati Global operations. On a gross basis, these first quarter 2025 pretax catastrophe losses are estimated to be approximately $\n950\n million to $\n1.15\n billion. This estimate includes assessments from the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plan. \nWe reinstated the applicable layers of our primary property catastrophe reinsurance treaty coverage and our reinsurance program for Cincinnati Re only. As a result, we will cede additional premiums to our reinsurers. The payments for additional ceded premiums will be partially offset by additional premiums received by Cincinnati Re from treaties reinstated for its reinsurance assumed operations. The estimated net effect on first quarter earned premiums is a decrease of $\n50\n million to $\n60\n million.\nAfter reinstating coverage for reinsurance to provide coverage for catastrophic events, our primary property catastrophe reinsurance treaty provides the same coverage that was effective on January 1, 2025. The remaining coverage from our reinsurance program for Cincinnati Re provides a total available aggregate limit up to $\n38\n million in excess of $\n80\n million per occurrence.\nThere were no subsequent events requiring adjustment to the 2024 consolidated financial statements and, with the exception of the above disclosure, no additional disclosures required in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 133\nTable of Contents\nAdopted Accounting Updates\nASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures. \nASU 2023-07 enhances reportable segment disclosures by requiring entities to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within the reported measure of profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the title and position of the CODM as well as a description of how the reported measure of profit or loss is used to assess segment performance and allocate resources. The effective date of ASU 2023-07 is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim reporting periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. We retrospectively adopted this ASU effective December 31, 2024. The adoption did not have a material impact on our company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, but the ASU required additional disclosure in Note 18, Segment Information, to these consolidated financial statements and will require additional disclosure in our interim financial statements in 2025.\nPending Accounting Updates\nASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. \nASU 2023-09 enhances the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures by requiring entities to disclose specific categories within their rate reconciliation as well as additional items within those categories above a prescribed threshold. This ASU also requires disclosure of the amount of income taxes paid (net of refunds received) disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes as well as additional items within those categories above a prescribed threshold. The effective date of ASU 2023-09 is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and should be applied prospectively with retrospective application permitted. The ASU has not yet been adopted and will not have a material impact on our company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, but the ASU will require additional disclosures in our annual financial statements.\nASU 2024-03, Income Statement  - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nIncome Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. \nASU 2024-03 requires increased quantitative disclosure of certain categories of expenses contained within relevant expense captions. A relevant expense caption is an expense caption presented on the face of the income statement that contains employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization and other captions. The ASU also requires a qualitative description of the remaining amount of relevant expense captions as well as total selling expenses on an interim basis and how selling expenses are defined on an annual basis. The effective date of ASU 2024-03 is for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The ASU should be applied prospectively with retrospective application and early adoption permitted. The ASU has not yet been adopted and will not have a material impact on our company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, but the ASU will require additional disclosures in our annual and interim financial statements.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 134\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 2 – \nInvestments \nThe following table provides amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses and fair value for our fixed-maturity and short-term investments:\n(Dollars in millions)\nAmortized\ncost\nGross unrealized\n Fair\nvalue\nAt December 31, 2024\ngains\nlosses\nFixed-maturity:\n \n \n \n \nCorporate \n$\n8,652\n \n$\n61\n \n$\n333\n \n$\n8,380\n \nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions\n4,976\n \n15\n \n270\n \n4,721\n \nGovernment-sponsored enterprises\n2,282\n \n1\n \n9\n \n2,274\n \nAsset-backed\n567\n \n1\n \n17\n \n551\n \nUnited States government\n228\n \n—\n \n2\n \n226\n \nForeign government\n30\n \n—\n \n—\n \n30\n \nTotal fixed-maturity\n16,735\n \n78\n \n631\n \n16,182\n \nShort-term\n298\n \n—\n \n—\n \n298\n \nTotal fixed-maturity and short-term investments\n$\n17,033\n \n$\n78\n \n$\n631\n \n$\n16,480\n \nAt December 31, 2023\n \n \n \n \nFixed-maturity:\n \n \n \n \nCorporate \n$\n7,836\n \n$\n70\n \n$\n454\n \n$\n7,452\n \nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions\n4,867\n \n44\n \n208\n \n4,703\n \nGovernment-sponsored enterprises\n1,227\n \n3\n \n6\n \n1,224\n \nAsset-backed \n203\n \n—\n \n16\n \n187\n \nUnited States government\n203\n \n—\n \n3\n \n200\n \nForeign government\n25\n \n—\n \n—\n \n25\n \nTotal fixed-maturity\n14,361\n \n117\n \n687\n \n13,791\n \nShort-term\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal fixed-maturity and short-term investments\n$\n14,361\n \n$\n117\n \n$\n687\n \n$\n13,791\n \n \nThe decrease in net unrealized investment losses in our fixed-maturity portfolio at December 31, 2024, is primarily due to a tightening of corporate credit spreads as well as realized losses on sales of some lower-yielding fixed maturities.\n \nOur asset-backed securities had an average rating of Aa1/AA and Aa3/AA- at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 135\nTable of Contents\nThe table below provides fair values and unrealized losses by investment category and by the duration of the  continuous unrealized loss positions:\n(Dollars in millions)\nLess than 12 months\n12 months or more\nTotal\nAt December 31, 2024\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized\nlosses\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized\nlosses\nFair\nvalue\nUnrealized\nlosses\nFixed-maturity:\nCorporate \n$\n2,815\n \n$\n78\n \n$\n3,634\n \n$\n255\n \n$\n6,449\n \n$\n333\n \nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions\n1,513\n \n25\n \n1,898\n \n245\n \n3,411\n \n270\n \nGovernment-sponsored enterprises\n1,876\n \n8\n \n92\n \n1\n \n1,968\n \n9\n \nAsset-backed \n331\n \n10\n \n96\n \n7\n \n427\n \n17\n \nUnited States government\n48\n \n—\n \n100\n \n2\n \n148\n \n2\n \nForeign government\n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \nTotal fixed-maturity\n6,583\n \n121\n \n5,823\n \n510\n \n12,406\n \n631\n \nShort-term\n100\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n100\n \n—\n \nTotal fixed-maturity and short-term investments\n$\n6,683\n \n$\n121\n \n$\n5,823\n \n$\n510\n \n$\n12,506\n \n$\n631\n \nAt December 31, 2023\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFixed-maturity:\nCorporate \n$\n379\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n5,560\n \n$\n441\n \n$\n5,939\n \n$\n454\n \nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions\n313\n \n2\n \n1,932\n \n206\n \n2,245\n \n208\n \nGovernment-sponsored enterprises\n652\n \n3\n \n113\n \n3\n \n765\n \n6\n \nAsset-backed \n5\n \n—\n \n172\n \n16\n \n177\n \n16\n \nUnited States government\n32\n \n—\n \n129\n \n3\n \n161\n \n3\n \nForeign government\n3\n \n—\n \n6\n \n—\n \n9\n \n—\n \nTotal fixed-maturity\n1,384\n \n18\n \n7,912\n \n669\n \n9,296\n \n687\n \nShort-term\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal fixed-maturity and short-term investments\n$\n1,384\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n7,912\n \n$\n669\n \n$\n9,296\n \n$\n687\n \n \nContractual maturity dates for our fixed-maturity and short-term investments were:\n(Dollars in millions)\nAmortized cost\nFair\nvalue\n% of fair value\nAt December 31, 2024\nMaturity dates:\n \n \n \nDue in one year or less\n$\n1,363\n \n$\n1,358\n \n8.2\n \n%\nDue after one year through five years\n3,933\n \n3,886\n \n23.6\n \nDue after five years through ten years\n3,701\n \n3,608\n \n21.9\n \nDue after ten years\n8,036\n \n7,628\n \n46.3\n \nTotal\n$\n17,033\n \n$\n16,480\n \n100.0\n \n%\n \nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities when there is a right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\n \nThe company had fixed-maturity securities with a fair value of $\n107\n million and $\n108\n million, on deposit with various states in compliance with regulatory requirements at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

When various inputs for measurement fall within different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the lowest observable input that has a significant impact on fair value measurement is used. Our valuation techniques have not changed from those used at December 31, 2023, and ultimately management determines fair value. Financial instruments reported at fair value in our consolidated financial statements are categorized based upon the following characteristics or inputs to the valuation techniques: \n•\nLevel 1 – Financial assets and liabilities for which inputs are observable and are obtained from reliable quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. This is the most reliable fair value measurement and includes, for example, active exchange-traded equity securities.\n•\nLevel 2 – Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which values are based on similar assets and liabilities that are actively traded. This also includes pricing models for which the inputs are corroborated by market data.\nThe technique used for the Level 2 fixed-maturity securities is the application of market-based modeling. The inputs used for all classes of fixed-maturity securities listed in the table below include relevant market information by asset class, trade activity of like securities, marketplace quotes, benchmark yields, spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates, U.S. Treasury or swap curves, yield to maturity and economic events. Specific to asset-backed securities, key inputs also include prepayment and default projections based on performance of the underlying collateral and current market data. Level 2 fixed-maturity securities are priced by a nationally recognized pricing vendor.\nThe Level 2 nonredeemable preferred equities technique used is the application of market-based modeling. The inputs used, similar to those used by the pricing vendor for our fixed-maturity securities, include relevant market information, trade activity of like securities, yield to maturity, corporate action notices and economic events. Level 2 nonredeemable preferred equities are priced by a nationally recognized pricing vendor.\n•\nLevel 3 – Financial assets and liabilities for which values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Level 3 inputs include the following:\n◦\nQuotes from brokers or other external sources that are not considered binding;\n◦\nQuotes from brokers or other external sources where it cannot be determined that market participants would in fact transact for the asset or liability at the quoted price; or\n◦\nQuotes from brokers or other external sources where the inputs are not deemed observable.\n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 138\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables illustrate the fair value hierarchy for those assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Fair value of the long-term debt was determined under the fair value measurements and disclosure accounting rules based on market pricing of similar debt instruments that are actively traded. We determine fair value for our debt the same way that we value corporate fixed maturities in our investment portfolio. Fair value can vary with macroeconomic conditions. Regardless of the fluctuations in fair value, the outstanding principal amount of our long-term debt was $\n793\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023. None of the long-term debt is encumbered by rating triggers. The note payable and long-term debt were classified as Level 2 as an active market does not exist, but fair value is determined based on observable inputs.\nThe following table shows the fair value of our life policy loans, included in other invested assets:\n(Dollars in millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAt December 31, 2024\nLife policy loans\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n41\n \n$\n41\n \nAt December 31, 2023\nLife policy loans\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n39\n \n$\n39\n \n \nOutstanding principal and interest for these life policy loans totaled $\n36\n million and $\n33\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. To determine the fair value, we make the following significant assumptions: (1) the discount rates used to calculate the present value of expected payments are the risk-free spot rates, as nonperformance risk is minimal; and (2) the loan repayment rate by which policyholders pay off their loan balances is in line with past experience.\n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 140\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows fair value of our deferred annuities and structured settlements included in life policy and investment contract reserves:\n(Dollars in millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAt December 31, 2024\nDeferred annuities\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n561\n \n$\n561\n \nStructured settlements\n—\n \n127\n \n—\n \n127\n \nTotal\n$\n—\n \n$\n127\n \n$\n561\n \n$\n688\n \nAt December 31, 2023\nDeferred annuities\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n603\n \n$\n603\n \nStructured settlements\n—\n \n141\n \n—\n \n141\n \nTotal\n$\n—\n \n$\n141\n \n$\n603\n \n$\n744\n \n \nRecorded reserves for the deferred annuities were $\n595\n million and $\n656\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Recorded reserves for the structured settlements were $\n116\n million and $\n123\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nFair values for deferred annuities were calculated based upon internally developed models because active markets and observable inputs do not exist. To determine the fair value, we made the following significant assumptions: (1) the discount rates used to calculate the present value of expected payments are the risk-free spot rates plus an A3 rated bond spread for financial issuers at December 31, 2024 and 2023, to account for nonperformance risk; (2) the rate of interest credited to policyholders is the portfolio net earned interest rate less a spread for expenses and profit; and (3) additional lapses occur when the credited interest rate is exceeded by an assumed competitor credited rate, which is a function of the risk-free rate of the economic scenario being modeled.\n \nFair values for structured settlements were calculated based on internally developed models which assume the discount rates used to calculate the present value of expected payments are the risk-free spot rates plus an A3 rated bond spread for financial issuers at December 31, 2024 and 2023, to account for nonperformance risk. The structured settlements were classified as Level 2, as an active market does not exist, but fair value is based on observable inputs.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 141\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 4 – \nProperty Casualty Loss and Loss Expenses\nWe use actuarial methods, models, assumptions and judgment to estimate, as of a financial statement date, the property casualty loss and loss expense reserves required to pay for and settle all outstanding insured claims, including IBNR claims, as of that date. The actuarial estimate is subject to review and adjustment by an inter-departmental committee that includes actuarial, claims, underwriting, loss prevention and finance management. This committee is familiar with relevant company and industry business, claims and underwriting trends, as well as general economic and legal trends that could affect future loss and loss expense payments. The amount we will actually have to pay for claims can be highly uncertain. This uncertainty, together with the size of our reserves, makes the loss and loss expense reserves our most significant estimate.\nOur reserving process takes into account known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including the type of claim, policy provisions pertaining to each claim, potential subrogation or salvage recoverable, large loss activity and trends, new business activity, judicial decisions, economic conditions, changes in law and regulation and product and underwriting changes. There have been no significant changes in methodologies and assumptions used in calculating loss and loss expense reserves for all years presented. There were no material additional premiums or return premiums accrued for as a result of prior-year effects.\n \nOur claims representatives establish case reserves when claims are reported to provide for our unpaid loss and loss expense obligation associated with individual claims.  \nFor events designated as natural catastrophes resulting in losses incurred related to direct premiums, we calculate IBNR reserves directly as a result of an estimated claim counts and estimated average dollar amount per claim for each event. Once individual case reserves are established for a catastrophe event, we reduce the IBNR reserves.\nOur actuarial staff uses generally accepted actuarial methods and models to derive ultimate loss and IBNR reserve estimates. The time interval between a claims occurrence and its settlement is one of the crucial attributes when estimating ultimate losses and IBNR reserves. \nDue to the uncertainties inherent with loss reserves, our ultimate loss experience could prove better or worse than what our carried reserves reflect. To the extent that reserves are inadequate and are required to be increased, the amount of the increase is a charge in that period, raising our loss and loss expense ratio and reducing earnings. To the extent that reserves are redundant and are required to be released, the amount of the release is a credit in that period, reducing our loss and loss expense ratio and increasing earnings. \nThis table summarizes activity for our consolidated property casualty loss and loss expense reserves:\n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nGross loss and loss expense reserves, January 1\n$\n8,975\n \n$\n8,336\n \n$\n7,229\n \nLess reinsurance recoverable\n362\n \n405\n \n327\n \nNet loss and loss expense reserves, January 1\n8,613\n \n7,931\n \n6,902\n \nNet incurred loss and loss expenses related to:\n \n \n \nCurrent accident year\n5,672\n \n5,173\n \n4,875\n \nPrior accident years\n(\n236\n)\n(\n215\n)\n(\n159\n)\nTotal incurred\n5,436\n \n4,958\n \n4,716\n \nNet paid loss and loss expenses related to:\n \n \n \nCurrent accident year\n1,951\n \n1,875\n \n1,592\n \nPrior accident years\n2,430\n \n2,401\n \n2,095\n \nTotal paid\n4,381\n \n4,276\n \n3,687\n \nNet loss and loss expense reserves, December 31\n9,668\n \n8,613\n \n7,931\n \nPlus reinsurance recoverable\n269\n \n362\n \n405\n \nGross loss and loss expense reserves, December 31\n$\n9,937\n \n$\n8,975\n \n$\n8,336\n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 142\nTable of Contents\nThe reserve for loss and loss expense in the consolidated balance sheets also included $\n66\n million,\n \n$\n75\n million and $\n64\n million, at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for certain life and health loss and loss expense reserves.

Within commercial lines, we recognized favorable development of $\n83\n million for the workers' compensation line and $\n74\n million for the commercial property line due to reduced uncertainty of prior accident year loss and loss expense for these lines. This was partially offset by unfavorable development of $\n26\n million for the commercial casualty line.

Within commercial lines, we recognized favorable development of $\n63\n million for the workers' compensation line and $\n44\n million for the commercial property line due to reduced uncertainty of prior accident year loss and loss expense for these lines. This was partially offset by unfavorable development of $\n25\n million for the commercial casualty line and $\n23\n million for the commercial auto line. Within personal lines, we recognized favorable reserve development of $\n54\n million for the homeowner line of business.  \nIncluded in our lines of business are asbestos and environmental claims. We carried $\n119\n million and $\n98\n million of net loss and loss expense reserves for asbestos and environmental claims at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The asbestos and environmental claims amounts for each respective year constituted less than \n2.0\n% of total net loss and loss expense reserves at these year-end dates. We believe our exposure to asbestos and environmental claims is limited, largely because our reinsurance retention was $\n500,000\n or below prior to 1987. We also were predominantly a personal lines company in the 1960s and 1970s. During the 1980s and early 1990s, commercial lines grew as a percentage of our overall business and our exposure to asbestos and environmental claims grew accordingly. Over that period, we included an asbestos and environmental exclusion in almost all policies or endorsed the exclusion to the policies. We have no exposure to asbestos and environmental claims related to our acquisition of Cincinnati Global. We continue to monitor our claims for evidence of material exposure to other mass tort classes but have found no such credible evidence to date.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 143\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the property casualty incurred losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) development and paid losses and ALAE development information at December 31, 2024. \n(Dollars in millions)\nCumulative incurred losses\nand ALAE\nas reported within the triangles, \nnet of reinsurance\nCumulative paid losses and ALAE as reported within the triangles, \nnet of reinsurance\nLiabilities for loss and ALAE for accident years not presented in the triangles, net of reinsurance\nTotal liabilities for loss and ALAE, net of reinsurance\nReinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses\nTotal liabilities for gross loss and loss expense reserves\nCommercial casualty\n$\n7,025\n \n$\n3,921\n \n$\n124\n \n$\n3,228\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n3,248\n \nWorkers' compensation\n1,746\n \n1,105\n \n326\n \n967\n \n53\n \n1,020\n \nCommercial auto\n2,514\n \n1,683\n \n40\n \n871\n \n3\n \n874\n \nCommercial property\n3,589\n \n3,134\n \n14\n \n469\n \n24\n \n493\n \nPersonal auto\n2,115\n \n1,739\n \n13\n \n389\n \n21\n \n410\n \nHomeowner\n2,946\n \n2,540\n \n8\n \n414\n \n9\n \n423\n \nExcess and surplus\n1,862\n \n855\n \n6\n \n1,013\n \n30\n \n1,043\n \nOther lines\n1,905\n \nTotal liabilities for loss and ALAE reserves\n9,416\n \nUnallocated loss adjustment expense reserves\n521\n \nGross loss and loss expense reserves\n$\n9,937\n \n \nFor all lines of business, the claim counts reported are primarily measured by insurance coverages that are triggered when a loss occurs and a reserve is established. For this purpose, coverages are defined as unique combinations of certain attributes such as line of business and cause of loss. Claims that are opened and closed without payment are included in the reported claim counts.

During 2008, we changed the form of retirement benefit we offer some associates to a company match on contributions to a 401(k) plan as further explained below. For participants remaining in the pension plan, we continue to fund future benefit obligations. Benefits for the defined benefit pension plan are based on years of credited service and compensation level. Contributions are based on the prescribed method defined in the Pension Protection Act. Our net periodic benefit cost is based on certain actuarial assumptions and also is composed of several components that are determined using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method. The qualified plan has been amended to allow for distribution of vested balances to terminated participants. \n \nWe sponsor a defined contribution plan (401(k) plan) for eligible associates with matching company contributions totaling $\n29\n million, $\n26\n million and $\n24\n million during the years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Associates who are not accruing benefits under the pension plan are eligible to receive the company match of up to \n6\n% of cash compensation. Participants vest in the company match for the 401(k) plan after \nthree years\n of eligible service.\n \nWe maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) with a benefit obligation of $\n13\n million at \nyear-end 2024 and $\n11\n million at year-end 2023, which is included in the projected benefit obligation. The company also makes available to a select group of associates the CFC Top Hat Savings Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, which had a fair value of $\n87\n million and $\n67\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Company matching contributions to the CFC Top Hat Savings Plan totaled approximately $\n1\n million for the years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n \nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Assumptions\nWe evaluate our pension plan assumptions annually and update them as necessary. \nThis is a summary of the weighted-average assumptions used to determine our benefit obligations at December 31 for the plans:\n \nQualified Pension Plan\nSERP\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nDiscount rate\n5.68\n \n%\n5.04\n \n%\n5.66\n \n%\n5.11\n \n%\nRate of compensation increase\n4.00\n \n4.00\n \n4.00\n \n4.00\n \n \nTo determine the discount rate for each plan, a theoretical settlement portfolio of high-quality rated corporate bonds was chosen to provide payments approximately matching the plan’s projected benefit payments. A single interest rate for each plan was determined resulting in a discounted value of the plan's benefit payments that equates to the market value of the selected bonds. The discount rate is reflective of current market interest rate conditions and our plan's liability characteristics. Based on this analysis, we increased the rate from the prior year by \n0.64\n percentage points for the qualified pension plan and by \n0.55\n percentage points for the SERP. Compensation increase assumptions reflect anticipated rates of inflation, real return on wage growth and merit and promotional increases. The mortality assumption is updated annually to reflect the updated mortality scales. The Pri-2012 tables with Scale MP-2021 was used for the years 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nThis is a summary of the weighted-average assumptions used to determine our net periodic benefit cost for the plans:\n \nQualified Pension Plan\nSERP\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n5.04\n \n%\n5.34\n \n%\n2.97\n \n%\n5.11\n \n%\n5.42\n \n%\n2.90\n \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n7.00\n \n7.00\n \n7.00\n \nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nRate of compensation increase\n4.00\n \n4.50\n \n2.25\n-\n3.25\n4.00\n \n4.50\n \n2.25\n-\n3.25\n \nThe discount rate was decreased by \n0.30\n percentage points for the qualified pension plan and \n0.31\n percentage points for the SERP due to market interest rate conditions at the beginning of 2024. The discount rate assumptions for our benefit obligation generally track with high-quality rated corporate bond yields chosen in our theoretical settlement portfolio, and yearly adjustments reflect any changes to those bond yields. We believe the expected \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 167\nTable of Contents\nreturn on plan assets is representative of the expected long-term rate of return on these assets, which is consistent with 2024 expectations of interest rates and based partially on the fact that the plan’s common stock holdings pay dividends. We review historical actual return on plan assets when determining our expected long-term rate of return. Total portfolio return for 2024 was \n18.7\n% and for 2023 was \n11.8\n%. Our compensation increase assumptions in 2024 reflect anticipated rates of inflation, real return on wage growth and merit and promotional increases.\n \nBenefit obligation activity using an actuarial measurement date for our qualified pension plan and SERP at December 31 follows:\n(Dollars in millions)\nAt December 31,\n2024\n2023\nChange in projected benefit obligation:\n \n \nBenefit obligation, January 1\n$\n263\n \n$\n282\n \nService cost\n6\n \n6\n \nInterest cost\n13\n \n13\n \nActuarial loss (gain) \n(\n9\n)\n10\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n15\n)\n(\n48\n)\nProjected benefit obligation, December 31\n$\n258\n \n$\n263\n \nChange in plan assets:\n \n \nFair value of plan assets, January 1\n$\n317\n \n$\n332\n \nActual return on plan assets\n56\n \n33\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n15\n)\n(\n48\n)\nFair value of plan assets, December 31\n$\n358\n \n$\n317\n \nFunded status, December 31\n$\n100\n \n$\n54\n \nAccumulated benefit obligation\n$\n243\n \n$\n247\n \n \nOur funded status for 2024 compared to 2023 improved primarily due to higher year over year return on plan assets and increases in the actuarial gain resulting from increases in discount rates.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 168\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation follows of the funded status for our qualified plan and SERP at the end of the measurement period to the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31:\n(Dollars in millions)\nAt December 31,\n2024\n2023\nPension amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets:\nOther assets\n$\n100\n \n$\n54\n \nTotal\n$\n100\n \n$\n54\n \nPension amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income:\n \n \nNet actuarial gain\n$\n(\n76\n)\n$\n(\n31\n)\nPrior service cost\n1\n \n1\n \nTotal\n$\n(\n75\n)\n$\n(\n30\n)\n \nBelow are the components of our net periodic benefit cost, as well as other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income for our qualified plan and SERP at December 31:\n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet periodic benefit cost:\nService cost\n$\n6\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n9\n \nNon-service costs (benefit):\nInterest cost\n13\n \n13\n \n10\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n21\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n22\n)\nAmortization of actuarial (gain) loss and prior service cost\n1\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \nOther\n—\n \n(\n6\n)\n(\n3\n)\nNet periodic benefit \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n(\n10\n)\n$\n(\n6\n)\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other\n   comprehensive income:\nCurrent year actuarial gain \n$\n(\n44\n)\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n(\n12\n)\nAmortization and recognition of actuarial gain (loss)\n(\n1\n)\n8\n \n3\n \nTotal recognized in other comprehensive (income) loss\n$\n(\n45\n)\n$\n6\n \n$\n(\n9\n)\nTotal recognized in net periodic benefit and other comprehensive income\n$\n(\n46\n)\n$\n(\n4\n)\n$\n(\n15\n)\n \nThe 2024 change in the amount recognized in other comprehensive income from 2023 is largely due to higher year over year return on plan assets and increases in actuarial gain resulting from increases in discount rates. \nService costs and non-service costs (benefit) are allocated in the same proportion primarily to underwriting, acquisition and insurance expenses line item with the remainder allocated to the insurance losses and contract holders' benefits line item on the consolidated statements of income for 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \nDefined Benefit Pension Plan Assets\nThe pension plan assets are managed to maximize total return over the long term while providing sufficient liquidity and current return to satisfy the cash flow requirements of the plan. The plan’s day-to-day investment decisions are managed by our internal investment department; however, overall investment strategies are discussed with our employee benefits committee. Our investment strategy is to weight our portfolio towards large-cap, high-quality, dividend-growing equities that we have historically favored. As our plan matures and interest rates normalize, we expect a greater allocation to fixed-income securities to better align asset and liability market risks. Our fixed-maturity bond portfolio is investment grade. The plan does not engage in derivative transactions. \n \nIncluding cash, during 2024 we held approximately \n83\n% of our pension portfolio in domestic common equity investments. The remainder of the portfolio consisted of \n10\n% percent in cash, \n4\n% in United States \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 169\nTable of Contents\ngovernment fixed-maturity investments, \n2\n% in domestic corporate fixed-maturity investments, and \n1\n% in states, municipalities and taxable political subdivisions fixed-maturity investments. Our common equity portfolio consisted of \n31\n% in the information technology sector, \n20\n% in the financial sector, \n17\n% in the industrials sector, and \n12\n% in the healthcare sector, at year-end 2024. No additional sectors accounted for \n10\n% or more of our common equity portfolio balance at year-end 2024. \n \nInvestments in securities are valued based on the fair value hierarchy outlined in Note 3, Fair Value Measurements. The pension plan did not have any liabilities carried at fair value during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The following table shows the fair value hierarchy for those assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2024 and 2023.

Insurance companies use statutory accounting practices (SAP) as recognized by various states. We have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners’ (NAIC) \nAccounting Practices and Procedures\n manual, version effective January 1, 2001, and updates through the current year as a component of prescribed or permitted practices by laws of the state of domicile. The primary differences between SAP and GAAP include the valuation of investment gains and losses, expensing of policy acquisition costs, actuarial assumptions for life insurance reserves and deferred income taxes based on differences in statutory and taxable income.\n \nStatutory net income and capital and surplus are determined in accordance with SAP prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities for five legal entities, our lead insurance subsidiary and its four insurance  subsidiaries. Statutory capital and surplus for our insurance subsidiary, The Cincinnati Insurance Company, includes capital and surplus of its four insurance subsidiaries. All capital and surplus amounts exceed statutory risk-based capital requirements. \nThe statutory net income and statutory capital and surplus are presented below:\n(Dollars in millions)\nNet income \nCapital and surplus\n \nYears ended December 31,\nAt December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\nThe Cincinnati Insurance Company\n$\n1,245\n \n$\n607\n \n$\n520\n \n$\n8,603\n \n$\n7,294\n \nThe Cincinnati Casualty Company\n28\n \n13\n \n14\n \n555\n \n517\n \nThe Cincinnati Indemnity Company\n6\n \n3\n \n4\n \n138\n \n130\n \nThe Cincinnati Specialty Underwriters Insurance Company\n86\n \n76\n \n61\n \n699\n \n611\n \nThe Cincinnati Life Insurance Company\n96\n \n90\n \n64\n \n508\n \n414\n \n \nNOTE 15 – \nTransactions With Affiliated Parties\nWe paid certain officers and directors, or insurance agencies of which they are shareholders, commissions of $\n10\n million, $\n9\n million and $\n9\n million on premium volume of $\n55\n million, $\n51\n million and $\n47\n million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 171\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 16 – \nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\nThe company, through its insurance subsidiaries, is involved in claims litigation arising in the ordinary course of conducting its business, both as a liability insurer defending or providing indemnity for third-party claims brought against insureds and as an insurer defending coverage claims brought against it. The company accounts for such activity through the establishment of unpaid loss and loss expense reserves. Subject to the uncertainties discussed in Note 4, Property Casualty Loss and Loss Expenses, and in the discussion in the balance of this Note, we believe that the ultimate liability, if any, with respect to such ordinary-course claims litigation, after consideration of provisions made for potential losses, costs of defense, and reinsurance recoveries, is immaterial to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe company and its subsidiaries also are occasionally involved in other legal and regulatory proceedings, some of which assert claims for substantial amounts. These actions include, among others, putative class actions seeking certification of state or national classes. Such proceedings have alleged, for example, improper depreciation of labor costs in repair estimates. The company’s insurance subsidiaries also are occasionally parties to individual actions in which extra-contractual damages, punitive damages or penalties are sought, such as claims alleging bad faith handling of insurance claims or writing unauthorized coverage or claims alleging discrimination by former or current associates.\nOn a quarterly basis, we review these outstanding matters. Under current accounting guidance, we establish accruals when it is probable that a covered loss has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate its potential exposure.  The company accounts for such probable and estimable losses, if any, through the establishment of legal expense reserves. Based on our quarterly review, we believe that our accruals for probable and estimable losses are reasonable and that the amounts accrued do not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. However, if any one or more of these matters results in a judgment against us or settlement for an amount that is significantly greater than the amount accrued, the resulting liability could have a material effect on the company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Based on our most recent review, our estimate for any other matters for which the risk of loss is not probable, but more than remote, is immaterial.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 172\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 17 – \nShare-Based Associate Compensation Plans\nFour\n equity compensation plans currently permit us to grant various types of equity awards. We currently grant incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, service-based restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units to associates, including some with market-based performance objectives under our shareholder-approved plans. We also have a Holiday Stock Plan that permits annual awards of one share of common stock to each full-time associate for each full calendar year of service up to a maximum of \n10\n shares. One of our equity compensation plans permits us to grant stock to our outside directors as a component of their annual compensation. We used treasury shares for share-based compensation award issues or exercises during 2024 and 2023.\nShare-based compensation cost after tax was $\n37\n million, $\n32\n million and $\n29\n million for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The related income tax benefit recognized was $\n9\n million,$\n8\n million and $\n7\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, had intrinsic value of $\n32\n million, $\n14\n million and $\n21\n million, respectively. Intrinsic value is the market price less the exercise price. Options vested during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022 had total intrinsic value of $\n12\n million and $\n2\n million, respectively. Options vested during the year ended December 31, 2023 had \nno\n intrinsic value because the weighted average exercise price was greater than the market price on the reporting date. \n \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $\n44\n million of unrecognized total compensation cost related to nonvested stock options and restricted stock unit awards. That cost will be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n1.7\n years.\n \nStock Options\nStock options are granted to associates at an exercise price equal to the fair value as determined by the average high and low sales price reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the grant date and are exercisable over \n10\n-year periods. The stock options generally vest ratably over a \nthree\n-year period. In determining the share-based compensation amounts, we estimate the fair value of each option granted on the date of grant using the Black Scholes pricing model. We make the following assumptions to develop the Black Scholes pricing model as follows:\n•\nWeighted-average expected term is based on historical experience of similar awards with consideration for current exercise trends.\n•\nExpected volatility is based on our stock price over a historical period that approximates the expected term.\n•\nDividend yield is determined by dividing the annualized per share dividend by the stock price on the date of grant.\n•\nRisk-free rates are the implied yield currently available on zero-coupon U.S. Treasury issues with a remaining term approximating the expected term.\n \nThe following weighted average assumptions were used in determining fair value for option grants issued:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted-average expected term\n \n8\n-\n9\n years\n8\n-\n9\n years\n7\n-\n9\n years\nExpected volatility\n28.94\n-\n29.98\n%\n28.25\n-\n29.61\n%\n26.34\n-\n28.87\n%\nDividend yield\n2.88\n%\n2.39\n%\n2.23\n%\nRisk-free rates\n4.38\n-\n4.41\n%\n3.98\n-\n3.99\n%\n1.90\n-\n1.92\n%\nWeighted-average fair value of options granted during the period\n$\n33.05\n$\n38.22\n$\n30.34\n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 173\nTable of Contents\nBelow is a summary of option information for the year 2024:\n(Dollars in millions, except exercise price.

We acquired \n259,224\n, \n72,549\n and \n80,538\n shares totaling \n$\n33\n million, $\n8\n million and $\n10\n million, respectively, from associates in consideration for option exercises during 2024, 2023 and 2022. The weighted-average remaining contractual life for options expected to vest as of December 31, 2024, was \n8.54\n years. \nUnder all active shareholder approved plans, a total of \n19.3\n million shares were authorized to be granted. At December 31, 2024, \n11.4\n million shares remained available for future issuance under the plans. During 2024, we granted \n9,779\n shares of common stock to our directors for 2023 board service fees. \n \nRestricted Stock Units\nService-based restricted stock units granted to associates are valued at fair value of the shares on the date of grant less the present value of the dividends that holders of restricted stock units do not receive on the shares underlying the restricted stock units during the vesting period. Service-based restricted stock units generally cliff vest \nthree years\n after the date of grant. We also grant restricted stock units which vest on a \nthree\n year ratable vesting schedule. Service-based restricted stock units vested during the year had an intrinsic value of $\n23\n million,  $\n22\n million and $\n32\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n \nWe have performance-based awards that vest on the first day of March after a \nthree\n-calendar-year performance period. These awards vest according to the level of \nthree\n-year total shareholder return achieved compared with a peer group over a \nthree\n-year performance period with payouts ranging from \n0\n% to \n200\n% for awards granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nThree\n-year total shareholder return is calculated by using annualized total return of a stock to an investor due to capital gain appreciation plus reinvestment of all dividends. \nFor the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2024, our total shareholder return exceeded \nthree\n of our \nnine\n peers. We expect \n30\n% payout of these shares to occur in March 2025. During 2024 and 2023, \nno\n shares of performance-based restricted stock units were issued for the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, as our total shareholder return exceeded \ntwo\n of \neight\n peers in our 2021 peer group and \none\n of \neight\n peers in our 2020 peer group. Performance-based awards vested during the year end December 31, 2022 had an intrinsic value of $\n6\n million. \nThese performance-based awards are valued using a Monte-Carlo valuation on the date of grant, which uses a  risk-neutral framework to model future stock price movements based upon the risk-free rate of return, the volatility of each peer and the pairwise correlations of each peer being modeled. Compensation cost is recognized regardless of whether the market-based performance objective has been satisfied. We make assumptions to develop the Monte-Carlo model as follows: \n•\nCorrelation coefficients are based upon the stock price data used to calculate the historical volatilities. The correlation coefficients are used to model the way the price of each entity's stock tends to move in relation to each other.\n•\nExpected volatility is based on each company's historical volatility using daily stock price observations with the period commensurate with the performance measurement period. \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 174\nTable of Contents\n•\nDividend yield assumption is based on our current expected annual cash dividend and the valuation date stock price. \n•\nRisk-free rates are equal to the yield, as of the measurement date, of the zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bill that is commensurate with the performance measurement period. \nT\nhe following assumptions were used in determining fair value for performance-based grants issued:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nExpected term\n2.86\n years\n2.86\n years\n2.86\n years\nExpected volatility\n21.33\n-\n42.97\n%\n25.98\n-\n47.73\n%\n30.09\n-\n49.28\n%\nDividend yield\n2.88\n%\n2.37\n%\n2.19\n%\nRisk-free rates\n4.41\n%\n4.32\n%\n1.64\n%\nB\nelow is a summary of service-based and performance-based share information, assuming a target payout for performance-based shares, for the year 2024:\n(Shares in thousands)\nService-based\nshares\nWeighted-\naverage grant\ndate fair value\nPerformance-based\nshares\nWeighted-\naverage grant\ndate fair value\nNonvested at January 1, 2024\n496\n \n$\n106.52\n \n187\n \n$\n144.05\n \nGranted\n219\n \n103.40\n \n92\n \n101.29\n \nVested\n(\n204\n)\n91.91\n \n—\n \n—\n \nForfeited or canceled\n(\n13\n)\n110.58\n \n(\n49\n)\n112.68\n \nNonvested at December 31, 2024\n498\n \n111.03\n \n230\n \n133.60\n \n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 175\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 18 – \nSegment Information\nWe operate primarily in \ntwo\n industries, property casualty insurance and life insurance.

Fee revenues for the life insurance segment represent separate account investment management fees.\n•\nOur investments’ revenues consist of pretax net investment income and investment gains and losses.\n•\nOther revenues are primarily finance income and earned premiums of Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global.\nIncome or loss before income taxes for each segment are reported based on the nature of that business area’s operations:\n•\nIncome or loss before income taxes for the insurance segments is defined as underwriting profit or loss.\n◦\nFor commercial lines, personal lines and excess and surplus lines insurance segments, we calculate underwriting profit or loss as premiums earned and fee revenue minus loss and loss expenses and underwriting expenses incurred.\n◦\nFor the life insurance segment, we calculate underwriting profit or loss as premiums earned and fee revenue, minus contract holders’ benefits and expenses incurred, plus investment interest credited to contract holders.\n•\nIncome or loss before income taxes for the investments segment is net investment income plus investment gains and losses for investments of the entire company, minus investment interest credited to contract holders of the life insurance segment.\n•\nIncome or loss before income taxes for the Other category is primarily due to Cincinnati Re and Cincinnati Global premiums earned minus loss and loss expenses and underwriting expenses incurred. It also includes interest expense from debt of the parent company as well as operating expenses of our headquarters. \nFor all segments, the CODM uses income or loss before income taxes, and its components, to allocate resources (including associate, financial and capital resources) primarily during the annual budgeting and forecasting process and throughout the year as necessary. For the commercial lines, personal lines, excess and surplus and life segments, the CODM uses this metric to assess performance by analyzing the relationship between premium revenue and loss and loss expenses and underwriting expenses. As part of this analysis, the drivers and components of those revenue and expense items, such as pricing, exposure growth and inflation, are also considered as necessary. For the investments segment, the CODM considers overall investment performance as well as current conditions to invest available cash flow in both fixed-maturity and equity securities in a manner that balances current income needs with longer-term investment growth goals. \nWe do not separately report the identifiable assets of property casualty insurance for the commercial, personal and excess and surplus lines segments or for Cincinnati Re because we do not use that measure to analyze performance. We include all investment portfolio assets, regardless of ownership, in the investments segment.\nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 176\nTable of Contents\nSegment information is summarized in the following table:\n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCommercial lines insurance\n \n \n \nCommercial lines insurance premiums\n$\n4,486\n \n$\n4,264\n \n$\n4,024\n \nFee revenues\n4\n \n4\n \n4\n \nTotal commercial lines insurance revenues\n4,490\n \n4,268\n \n4,028\n \nLoss and loss expenses\n2,795\n \n2,787\n \n2,761\n \nUnderwriting expenses\n1,384\n \n1,313\n \n1,229\n \nTotal commercial lines income before income taxes\n311\n \n168\n \n38\n \nPersonal lines insurance\n \n \n \nPersonal lines insurance premiums\n2,623\n \n2,044\n \n1,689\n \nFee revenues\n5\n \n4\n \n4\n \nTotal personal lines insurance revenues\n2,628\n \n2,048\n \n1,693\n \nLoss and loss expenses\n1,795\n \n1,442\n \n1,166\n \nUnderwriting expenses\n762\n \n610\n \n509\n \nTotal personal lines income (loss) before income taxes\n71\n \n(\n4\n)\n18\n \nExcess and surplus lines insurance\nExcess and surplus lines insurance premiums\n615\n \n542\n \n485\n \nFee revenues\n3\n \n3\n \n2\n \nTotal excess and surplus lines insurance revenues\n618\n \n545\n \n487\n \nLoss and loss expenses\n411\n \n350\n \n315\n \nUnderwriting expenses\n167\n \n141\n \n124\n \nTotal excess and surplus lines income before income taxes\n40\n \n54\n \n48\n \nLife insurance\nLife insurance premiums\n321\n \n313\n \n301\n \nFee revenues\n5\n \n10\n \n4\n \nTotal life insurance revenues\n326\n \n323\n \n305\n \nContract holders' benefits incurred\n301\n \n316\n \n303\n \nInvestment interest credited to contract holders\n(\n125\n)\n(\n121\n)\n(\n109\n)\nUnderwriting expenses incurred\n93\n \n87\n \n84\n \nTotal life insurance income before income taxes\n57\n \n41\n \n27\n \nInvestments\n \n \n \nInvestment income, net of expenses\n1,025\n \n894\n \n781\n \nInvestment gains and losses, net\n1,391\n \n1,127\n \n(\n1,467\n)\nTotal investment revenue\n2,416\n \n2,021\n \n(\n686\n)\nInvestment interest credited to contract holders\n125\n \n121\n \n109\n \nTotal investment income (loss) before income taxes\n2,291\n \n1,900\n \n(\n795\n)\nReconciliation to consolidated income (loss) before income taxes\nTotal segment revenues\n10,478\n \n9,205\n \n5,827\n \nOther earned premiums\n844\n \n795\n \n726\n \nOther revenues\n15\n \n13\n \n10\n \nTotal revenues\n11,337\n \n10,013\n \n6,563\n \nTotal segment benefits and expenses\n7,708\n \n7,046\n \n6,491\n \nOther loss and loss expenses\n435\n \n379\n \n474\n \nOther underwriting expenses\n251\n \n233\n \n216\n \nOther benefits and expenses\n85\n \n79\n \n76\n \nTotal benefits and expenses\n8,479\n \n7,737\n \n7,257\n \nTotal income (loss) before income taxes\n$\n2,858\n \n$\n2,276\n \n$\n(\n694\n)\n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 177\nIdentifiable assets by segment are summarized in the following table: \n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nIdentifiable assets:\nProperty casualty insurance\n$\n5,927\n \n$\n5,294\n \nLife insurance\n1,658\n \n1,562\n \nInvestments\n27,887\n \n24,999\n \nOther\n1,029\n \n914\n \nTotal\n$\n36,501\n \n$\n32,769\n \nCincinnati Financial Corporation - 2024 10-K - Page 178\nTable of Contents\nI\nTEM\n 9.

The company’s management, with the participation of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures provided reasonable assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that:\n•\ninformation required to be disclosed in the company’s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and\n•\nsuch information is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting – During the three months ended December 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We are continually monitoring and assessing any potential impact on the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting related to the alternating of associate schedules between working at our headquarters and working from remote locations.
