Information contained herein relating to any individual company is filed by such company on its own behalf.\n \n\n\nPSEG’s business consists of two reportable segments, PSE&G and PSEG Power LLC (PSEG Power) & Other, primarily comprised of our principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are:\n\n\n•\nPSE&G\n—which is a public utility engaged principally in the transmission of electricity and distribution of electricity and natural gas in certain areas of New Jersey. PSE&G is subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and other federal and New Jersey state regulators. PSE&G also invests in regulated solar generation projects and energy efficiency (EE) and related programs in New Jersey, which are regulated by the BPU, and\n\n\n•\nPSEG Power\n—which is an energy supply company that consists of the operations of merchant nuclear generating assets and fuel supply functions engaged in competitive energy sales via its principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries. PSEG Power’s subsidiaries are subject to regulation by FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and other federal regulators and state regulators in the states in which they operate. \n\n\nThe PSEG Power & Other reportable segment also includes amounts related to the parent company as well as PSEG’s other direct wholly owned subsidiaries, which are: PSEG Long Island LLC (PSEG LI), which operates the Long Island Power Authority’s (LIPA) transmission and distribution (T&D) system under an Operations Services Agreement (OSA); PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), which primarily holds legacy lease investments and competitively bid, FERC regulated transmission; and PSEG Services Corporation (Services), which provides certain management, administrative and general services to PSEG and its subsidiaries at cost.\n\n\nOur business discussion in Item 1.

    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors provides information about factors that could have a material adverse impact on our businesses. The following discussion provides an overview of the significant events and business developments that have occurred during 2024 and key factors that we expect may drive our future performance. This discussion refers to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Statements) and the related Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements (Notes). This discussion should be read in conjunction with such Statements and Notes.\n\n\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW OF 2\n024 AND FUTURE OUTLOOK\n\n\nWe are a public utility holding company that, acting through our wholly owned subsidiaries, is a predominantly regulated electric and gas utility and a nuclear generation business. Our business plan focuses on achieving growth by allocating capital primarily toward regulated investments in an effort to continue to improve the sustainability and predictability of our business and realizing the value of the consistent and reliable carbon free generation from our nuclear units. We are focused on investing to meet growing energy demand, modernize our energy infrastructure, improve reliability and resilience, increase EE and deliver clean energy to meet customer expectations and be well aligned with public policy objectives. With these investments and higher working capital recovery approved in the distribution rate case, our regulated rate base increased from approximately $30 billion as of December 31, 2023 to approximately $34 billion as of December 31, 2024. In addition, the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) established a production tax credit (PTC) for existing nuclear facilities from 2024 through 2032. The PTC is designed to provide downside price protection for our nuclear generation fleet as the tax credit value is directly linked to a nuclear facility’s gross receipts.\n \n\n\n40\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nFor the years 2025-2029, our regulated capital investment program is estimated to be in a range of $21 billion to $24 billion. We expect these capital investments to result in a compound annual growth rate in our regulated rate base in a range of 6% to 7.5% from year-end 2024 to year-end 2029. The regulated capital investments represent the majority of PSEG’s total capital investment program of $22.5 billion to $26 billion. The low end of the range includes an extension of our Gas System Modernization Program (GSMP) and Clean Energy Future (CEF)-EE program at their current average annual investment levels plus inflation, as these programs are expected to continue beyond their currently approved timeframes. The upper end of our capital investment range includes potential incremental investments to address continued demand growth and other investments to meet infrastructure needs and support New Jersey's clean energy goals.\n \n\n\nPSE&G\n\n\nAt PSE&G, our focus is on investing capital in T&D infrastructure and clean energy programs to meet growing demand, enhance the reliability and resiliency of our T&D system, meet customer expectations and support public policy objectives.\n\n\nIn October 2024, the BPU approved our CEF-EE II filing authorizing approximately $2.9 billion for energy efficiency projects committed between January 1, 2025 through June 30, 2027, and completed over an expected six-year period. The Order approved a program investment budget of approximately $1.9 billion, net of administrative expenses, and approximately $1 billion to continue our customer on-bill repayment program. This EE filing is a significant increase from our prior filings, driven by an increase in the savings targets required under the BPU Energy Efficiency Framework and higher costs to achieve those targeted savings.\n \n\n\nA remaining component of our CEF-Electric Vehicle (EV) program related to medium- and heavy-duty charging infrastructure has been the subject of a stakeholder process that the BPU began in 2021. In October 2024, the BPU released an Order that provided program guidance and minimum filing requirements for electric utility operated medium- and heavy-duty charging incentive programs. The Order provides for PSE&G’s program investment up to $30 million and requires electric utilities to submit program filings by February 2025. In November 2024, the BPU released an updated draft Storage Incentive Program proposal. Our proposed CEF-Energy Storage (ES) program for a $109 million investment is being held in abeyance until the BPU concludes its proceedings.\n \n\n\nIn 2023, the BPU also approved a two-year extension of our current GSMP program to replace at least 400 miles of cast iron and unprotected steel mains and services in our gas system. The GSMP program extension provides for main replacement through December 2025 plus trailing services replacement and paving costs into 2026 and totals approximately $900 million of investment. Of the $900 million, $750 million is recovered through three periodic rate updates with the balance recovered through a future distribution base rate case. Pursuant to that settlement, we commenced extension discussions for our GSMP program in January 2025 with the intent of beginning a new program in January 2026.\n \n\n\nPursuant to our GSMP II and Energy Strong II programs, PSE&G filed a distribution base rate case as required by the BPU. In October 2024, the BPU issued an Order approving the settlement of that case with new rates effective October 15, 2024. The Order provides for a $17.8 billion rate base, a 9.6% return on equity for PSE&G’s distribution business and a 55% equity component of its capitalization structure. For additional information, see Item 8. Note 6. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.\n\n\nPSEG Power\n \n\n\nAt PSEG Power, we seek to produce low-cost electricity by efficiently operating our nuclear generation assets, mitigate earnings volatility through the PTC mechanism and hedging, and support public policies that preserve these existing carbon-free base load nuclear generating plants. During 2024, our nuclear units generated approximately 31 terawatt hours and operated at a capacity factor of approximately 90%. Beginning in 2024, our hedging strategy incorporated an estimated range of risk reduction impacts from the PTCs on our nuclear generation portfolio while retaining the ability to benefit when market pricing exceeds the phase out threshold. As of December 31, 2024, we expect that our hedged position for 2025 in conjunction with the PTC and market price variability will result in the realized value of our nuclear generation output being at, or above, the PTC phase out. Our strategy will continue to evolve given PTC guidance uncertainty, and potential incremental changes upon final U.S. Treasury guidance. In addition, we are exploring opportunities for the potential sale of power and/or emission credits from our nuclear facilities pursuant to long-term agreements.\n \n\n\n41\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nClimate Strategy and Sustainability Efforts\n\n\nFor more than a century, our purpose has been to provide safe access to an around-the-clock supply of reliable, affordable energy. Today, our vision is to power a future where people use less energy, and it is cleaner, safer and delivered more reliably than ever. We have established a net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030 goal that includes direct GHG emissions (Scope 1) and indirect GHG emissions from operations (Scope 2) across our business operations, assuming advances in technology, public policy and customer behavior, which goal supports New Jersey's clean energy and climate goals.\n\n\nPSE&G has undertaken a number of initiatives that support the reduction of GHG emissions, including our implementation of New Jersey's EE program. PSE&G’s approved CEF-EE and EE II, CEF-Energy Cloud and CEF-EV programs and the proposed CEF-ES program are intended to support New Jersey’s Energy Master Plan (EMP) and Gubernatorial Executive Orders through programs designed to help customers use energy more efficiently, reduce GHG emissions, support the expansion of the EV infrastructure in New Jersey, install energy storage capacity to supplement solar generation and enhance grid resiliency, install smart meters and supporting infrastructure to allow for the integration of other clean energy technologies and to more efficiently respond to weather and other outage events.\n\n\nWe continue to assess physical risks of climate change and adapt our capital investment program to improve the reliability and resiliency of our system in an environment of increasing frequency and severity of weather events. PSE&G is committed to the safe and reliable delivery of natural gas to approximately 1.9 million customers throughout New Jersey and we are equally committed to reducing GHG emissions associated with such operations. The GSMP is designed to improve safety and reliability and significantly reduce natural gas leaks in our distribution system, which would reduce the release of methane, a potent GHG, into the air. Through GSMP II, from 2018 through 2024 we reduced reported methane emissions by over 30% system wide.\n \n\n\nWe also continue to focus on providing cleaner energy for our customers by working to preserve the economic viability of our nuclear units, which provide over 85% of the carbon-free energy in New Jersey. These efforts include reducing market risk by advocating for state and federal policies, such as the PTC established by the IRA, and capacity market reform and related generator interconnection policies at PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM) that recognize the value of our nuclear fleet’s carbon-free generation and its contribution to grid reliability, and potential long-term contracts that recognize the value of its consistent and reliable carbon-free energy.\n \n\n\nCompetitively Bid, FERC Regulated Transmission Projects\n\n\nPSEG continues to evaluate investment opportunities in regulated transmission beyond PSE&G. In December 2023, PJM awarded us an approximately $424 million project to address increasing load and reliability issues in Maryland and northern Virginia as part of its 2022 Window 3 competitive solicitation. PJM has directed that the project be placed in service in 2027.\n \n\n\nIn April 2024, PSE&G submitted bids to the BPU for what the BPU has termed the Pre-Build Infrastructure (PBI) project, which is a combination of onshore and near-shore underwater infrastructure. It is unclear when the BPU may take action on this initiative, or parallel processes it has considered for transmission projects to support New Jersey’s offshore wind goal.\n \n\n\nPSEG will continue to evaluate opportunities to participate in transmission solicitation processes and may decide to submit bids for these opportunities, some of which could be material investments.\n \n\n\nPSEG LI\n\n\nIn 2024, LIPA issued requests for two proposals - one for a service provider to operate its electrical transmission and distribution system and one for power supply and fuel management services, both of which are currently performed under contracts with PSEG that run through December 31, 2025. PSEG is negotiating its proposal with LIPA to continue as operations service provider for LIPA’s electrical transmission and distribution system, though the outcome of this process is uncertain. LIPA has selected another party for the power supply and fuel management services contract which will not have a material impact on PSEG's results of operations.\n\n\n42\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nFinancial Results\n\n\nThe financial results for PSEG, PSE&G and PSEG Power & Other for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions, except per share data\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSE&G\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,547\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,515\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Power & Other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n225\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,048\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Net Income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,772\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,563\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Net Income Per Share (Diluted)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.54\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5.13\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor a detailed discussion of our financial results, see Results of Operations.\n \n\n\nRegulatory, Legislative and Other Developments\n\n\nWe closely monitor and engage with stakeholders on significant regulatory and legislative developments.\n \n\n\nTransmission Rate Proceedings and Return on Equity (ROE)\n\n\nUnder current FERC rules, PSE&G continues to earn a 50 basis point adder to its base ROE for its membership in PJM as a transmission owner. In April 2021, FERC proposed eliminating this ROE adder for Regional Transmission Owner participation. FERC has not acted on the proposal. If the adder was eliminated, it would reduce PSE&G’s annual Net Income and annual cash inflows by approximately $40 million.\n\n\nNew Jersey Clean Energy Stakeholder Proceedings\n \n\n\nIn February 2023, the governor of New Jersey issued executive orders (EOs) that establish or accelerate previously established 2050 targets for clean-sourced energy, building decarbonization, and EV adoption goals, with new target dates of 2030 or 2035, as applicable. The EOs direct the BPU and other state agencies to collaborate with stakeholders to develop plans to reach the targets and the BPU has convened a stakeholder proceeding to develop a plan for gas distribution utilities to reach the target of 50% natural gas emissions reductions over 2006 levels by 2030. The BPU commenced proceedings to update the State’s EMP via public input hearings in May and June 2024. We are unable to predict the outcomes of this proceeding, but it could have a material impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\n \n\n\nEnvironmental Regulation\n\n\nWe are subject to liability under environmental laws for the costs and penalties of remediating contamination of property now or formerly owned by us and of property contaminated by hazardous substances that we generated. In particular, the historic operations of PSEG companies and the operations of numerous other companies along the Passaic and Hackensack Rivers are alleged by federal and state agencies to have discharged substantial contamination into the Passaic River/Newark Bay Complex in violation of various\n \nstatutes. In addition, PSEG Power has retained ownership of certain liabilities excluded from the sale of its fossil generation portfolio, primarily related to obligations under New Jersey and Connecticut state laws to investigate and remediate the sites. We are also currently involved in a number of proceedings relating to sites where other hazardous substances may have been discharged and may be subject to additional proceedings in the future, and the costs and penalties of any such remediation efforts could be material.\n\n\nFor further information regarding the matters described above, as well as other matters that may impact our financial condition and results of operations, see Item 8. Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.\n\n\nNuclear\n \n\n\nIn April 2021, PSEG Power’s Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants were awarded zero emission certificates (ZECs) for the three-year eligibility period starting June 2022 at the same approximate $10 per megawatt hour (MWh) received during the prior ZEC period through May 2025. Pursuant to a process established by the BPU, ZECs are purchased\n \n\n\n43\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nfrom selected nuclear plants and recovered through a non-bypassable distribution charge in the amount of $0.004 per kilowatt-hour used (which is equivalent to approximately $10 per MWh generated in payments to selected nuclear plants (ZEC payment)). As previously noted, in August 2022, the IRA was signed into law expanding incentives promoting carbon-free generation. The enacted legislation established a PTC for electricity generated using existing nuclear energy, which began January 1, 2024 and continues through 2032 and impacted PSEG Power's decision not to apply for the next ZEC three-year eligibility period starting June 2025. The expected PTC rate is up to $15/MWh subject to adjustment based upon a facility’s gross receipts. The PTC rate and the gross receipts threshold are subject to annual inflation adjustments. ZEC revenue recorded is reduced by the estimated PTCs generated from PSEG Power’s Salem 1, Salem 2, and Hope Creek nuclear plants. The PTC amounts recorded to date are subject to change based on several factors, including but not limited to, adjustments to estimated market prices and generation and the issuance of authoritative guidance by Treasury/the Internal Revenue Service, including clarification of the definition of “gross receipts” used to determine the phase out. Any adjustments to amounts previously recorded could be material. We continue to analyze the impact of the IRA on our nuclear units, and will analyze any future guidance from the U.S. Treasury to assess any impact of PTCs on expected ZEC payments and/or any future ZEC application periods.\n \n\n\nInterest Rate Matters\n \n\n\nPSEG’s long-term financing plan is designed to replace maturities and support funding its capital program. Given our financing needs, the prevailing interest rate environment will be a key factor in determining interest expense on variable-rate debt and long-term rates on future financing plans. In order to increase the predictability of interest expense, we may use interest rate hedges to help limit our exposure to fluctuating interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, PSEG had entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate hedges totaling $1.25 billion through March 2025 in order to reduce the volatility in interest expense related to PSEG Power’s variable rate term loan due June 2025. PSEG Power also entered into a 364-day variable rate term loan for $400 million in December 2024. In addition, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedges to fix a portion of our interest rate exposure for anticipated long-term financing plans at PSEG and PSEG Power.  PSE&G’s interest rate risk is moderated due to annual transmission rate filings and distribution recoveries through base rate filings and clause-based investment programs.\n \n\n\nTax Legislation\n\n\nThe enactment, amendment or repeal of federal or state tax legislation and/or the clarification of previously enacted tax laws could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and cash tax position.\n\n\nIn April 2023, the U.S. Treasury issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15 that provides a safe harbor method of accounting to determine the annual repair tax deduction for gas T&D property. The impact, if any, that this may have on PSEG and PSE&G’s financial statements has not yet been determined.\n \n\n\nThe IRA enacted a new 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT), which is based on adjusted financial statement income, a PTC for existing nuclear generation facilities, discussed above, and allows energy tax credits to be transferable. Many aspects of the IRA, including the CAMT and PTC, remain unclear and are in need of further guidance; therefore, we continue to analyze the impact the IRA will have on PSEG’s and PSE&G’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which could be material.\n \n\n\nFuture Outlook\n\n\nOur future success will be influenced by our ability to continue to maintain strong operational and financial performance, address regulatory and legislative developments that impact our business and respond to the issues and challenges described below. In order to do this, we will continue to:\n\n\n•\nseek approval of and execute on our utility capital investment program to modernize our infrastructure, improve the reliability and resilience of the service we provide to our customers, and align our sustainability and climate goals with New Jersey’s energy policy,\n\n\n•\nseek a fair return for our T&D investments through our transmission formula rate, existing rate incentives, distribution infrastructure and clean energy investment programs and periodic distribution base rate case proceedings,\n\n\n44\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nfocus on controlling costs while maintaining safety, reliability and customer satisfaction and complying with applicable standards and requirements,\n\n\n•\nmanage the risks and opportunities in federal and state clean energy policies, \n\n\n•\nadvocate for appropriate regulatory guidance on the PTC to ensure long-term support for New Jersey’s largest carbon-free generation resource, and adapt our hedging program accordingly, and realize the value of our consistent and reliable, carbon-free nuclear output, \n\n\n•\nengage constructively with our multiple stakeholders, including regulators, government officials, customers, employees, investors, suppliers and the communities in which we do business or are seeking to do business, and\n\n\n•\ndeliver on our human capital management strategy to attract, develop and retain a high-performing diverse workforce. \n\n\nIn addition to the risks described elsewhere in this Form 10-K for 2024 and beyond, the key issues and challenges we expect our business to confront include:\n\n\n•\nregulatory and political uncertainty, both with regard to transmission planning and rates policy, the role of distribution utilities and decarbonization impacts, future energy policy, tax regulations, design of energy and capacity markets, and environmental regulation, as well as with respect to the outcome of any legal, regulatory or other proceedings,\n\n\n•\nperformance of the financial markets, including the impact on our pension funding requirements and interest rates on our future financing plans, \n\n\n•\ncontinuing to manage costs and maintain affordable customer rates in an inflationary environment, which could impact customer collections and future regulatory proceedings, \n\n\n•\nthe increasing frequency, sophistication and magnitude of cybersecurity attacks against us and our respective vendors and business partners who may have our sensitive information and/or access to our environment, and the increasing frequency and magnitude of physical attacks on electric and gas infrastructure,\n\n\n•\nfuture changes in federal and state tax laws or any other associated tax guidance, and\n\n\n•\nthe impact of changes in energy demand, natural gas and electricity prices, PJM’s challenge to ensure resource adequacy to meet demand growth, and expanded efforts to decarbonize several sectors of the economy.\n\n\nWe continually assess a broad range of strategic options to maximize long-term shareholder value and address the interests of our multiple stakeholders. We consider a wide variety of factors when determining how and when to efficiently deploy capital, including the performance and prospects of our businesses; returns and the sustainability and predictability of future earnings streams; the views of investors, regulators, public policy initiatives, rating agencies, customers and employees; our existing indebtedness and restrictions it imposes; and tax considerations, among other things. Strategic options available to us include:\n\n\n•\ninvestments in PSE&G, including T&D facilities to enhance reliability, resiliency and modernize the system to meet the growing needs and increasingly higher expectations of customers, and clean energy investments, particularly our EE programs,\n\n\n•\ncontinued operation of our nuclear generation facilities that are expected to be supported by the PTC through 2032 and can enable certain investments to increase the capacity of the units as well as potential license extensions, transition from an 18-month to 24-month refueling cycle at our Hope Creek facility and energy and/or emission credit sales with potential customers seeking consistent and reliable carbon-free power, \n\n\n•\ninvestments in competitive, regulated transmission investments through PJM processes and BPU solicitations that provide revenue predictability and reasonable risk-adjusted returns, and\n\n\n•\nacquisitions, dispositions, development and other transactions involving our common stock, assets or businesses that could provide value to customers and shareholders.\n\n\nThere can be no assurance, however, that we will successfully develop and execute any of the strategic options noted above, or any additional options we may consider in the future. The execution of any such strategic plan may not have the expected benefits or may have unexpected adverse consequences.\n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nRESULTS OF O\nPERATIONS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEarnings (Losses)\n\n\n \n\n\nMillions, except per share data\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSE&G\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,547\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,515\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,565\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Power & Other (A)(B)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n225\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,048\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(534\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Net Income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,772\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,563\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,031\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Net Income Per Share (Diluted)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3.54\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5.13\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2.06\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(A)\nPSEG Power & Other results in 2023 include a $239 million after-tax pension charge due to the settlement of a portion of the qualified pension plans.

Due to PSE&G’s electric and gas distribution CIP decoupling mechanism, there is minimal impact from sales volumes on most distribution delivery revenues. Also included in delivery revenues are revenue credits to customers to flowback tax benefits realized by PSE&G.  These revenue credits are offset in Income Tax Expense.\n\n\nDelivery revenues increased $321 million due primarily to $170 million from increased electric and gas revenues primarily as a result of the recently settled distribution base rate case, $99 million  increase in transmission revenues due primarily to higher rate base investments, $26 million in increased revenues from Energy Strong II and IAP distribution rate roll ins, $42 million from increased GPRC revenues, $9 million from a reduction in revenue credits flowed back to customers as part of our TAC mechanism, offset by a decrease of $25 million in CIP decoupling revenues.\n \n\n\nClause Revenues\n are revenues from various pass through regulatory programs for which PSE&G earns no margin.  These revenues are entirely offset by the amortization of related costs in O&M, D&A and Interest and Income Tax Expense, which were originally recognized as regulatory assets.\n \n\n\nClause Revenues increased $141 million due primarily to a $132 million net increase in Tax Adjustment Credits (TAC) and Green Program Recovery Charge (GPRC) deferrals and $10 million in higher Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) collections.\n\n\nCommodity Revenues \nare revenues from customers choosing default electric (basic generation service or BGS) and gas supply (basic gas supply service of BGSS) from PSE&G.  PSE&G procures the BGS and BGSS on behalf of these retail customers and earns no margin on this service as all costs are passed back to the BGS and BGSS customers.  The changes in Commodity Revenues for both electric and gas are entirely offset by changes in Energy Costs.\n \n\n\nCommodity Revenues increased $143 million due to higher electric BGS revenues of $276 million from higher prices and sales volumes, offset by lower gas BGSS revenues of $133 million primarily from lower prices.\n \n\n\nOther Operating Revenues\n are primarily comprised of revenues derived from various GPRC programs including Transition Renewable Energy Certificates (TREC) revenues, Community Solar collections and the Successor Solar Incentive Program (SuSI).

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as filed with the SEC on February 26, 2024 for information related to the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to 2022, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\n\n\nLIQUIDITY AND C\nAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n\nThe following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis, noting the uses and contributions, where material, of our two direct major operating subsidiaries.\n\n\nFinancing Methodology\n\n\nWe expect our capital requirements to be met through internally generated cash flows and external financings, consisting of short-term debt for working capital needs and long-term debt for capital investments.\n\n\nPSE&G’s sources of external liquidity include a $1 billion multi-year revolving credit facility. PSE&G uses internally generated cash flow and its commercial paper program to meet seasonal, intra-month and temporary working capital needs. PSE&G does not engage in any intercompany borrowing or lending arrangements. PSE&G maintains a back-up credit facility in an amount sufficient to cover the commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding. PSE&G’s dividend payments to/capital contributions from PSEG are consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings. PSE&G’s long-term financing plan is designed to replace maturities, fund a portion of its capital program and manage short-term debt balances. Generally, PSE&G uses either secured medium-term notes or first mortgage bonds to raise long-term capital.\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG, PSEG Power, Energy Holdings, PSEG LI and Services participate in a corporate money pool, an aggregation of daily cash balances designed to efficiently manage their respective short-term liquidity needs, which are accounted for as intercompany loans. Servco does not participate in the corporate money pool. Servco’s short-term liquidity needs are met through an account funded and owned by LIPA.\n \n\n\nPSEG and PSEG Power have access through sub-limits to a revolving Master Credit Facility, which provides for $2.75 billion of multi-year credit capacity. The current PSEG sub-limit is $1.5 billion and current PSEG Power sub-limit is $1.25 billion. Sub-limits can be adjusted subject to the terms of the Master Credit Facility.\n \n\n\nPSEG’s available sources of external liquidity may include the issuance of long-term debt securities and the incurrence of additional indebtedness through our commercial paper program back-stopped by our credit facility. Our current sources of external liquidity include the Master Credit Facility. This facility is available to back-stop PSEG’s commercial paper program, issue letters of credit and for general corporate purposes. PSEG’s Master Credit Facility and the commercial paper program are available to support PSEG’s working capital needs and are also available to make equity contributions or provide liquidity support to its subsidiaries. Additionally, from time to time, PSEG enters into short-term loan agreements designed to enhance its liquidity position.\n \n\n\nPSEG Power’s sources of external liquidity include the Master Credit Facility and PSEG Power’s letter of credit facilities and may include the issuance of long-term debt securities and entering into short-term loan agreements. Credit capacity is primarily used to provide collateral in support of PSEG Power’s sales and purchases of electricity and natural gas as the market prices for energy and fuel fluctuate, and to meet potential collateral postings in the event that PSEG Power is downgraded to below investment grade by Standard & Poor’s\n (\nS&P) or Moody’s. PSEG Power’s dividend payments to PSEG are also designed to be consistent with its capital structure objectives which have been established to maintain investment grade credit ratings and provide sufficient financial flexibility.\n \n\n\nOperating Cash Flows\n \n\n\nWe continue to expect our operating cash flows combined with cash on hand and financing activities to be sufficient to fund planned capital expenditures and shareholder dividends.\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, our operating cash flow decreased $1,673 million, as compared to 2023. The net decrease was primarily due to an outflow of $131 million in net cash collateral postings in 2024 as compared to a $1,408 million inflow in 2023 at PSEG Power, partially offset by a net change at PSE&G, as discussed below.\n\n\nPSE&G\n \n\n\nPSE&G’s operating cash flow increased $185 million from $1,540 million to $1,725 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to 2023. The increase was due primarily to higher earnings, the absence of returning cash collateral postings in 2024, which had been returned to BGS suppliers in 2023, and decreases in materials and supplies to support our electric AMI and other infrastructure programs. This was partially offset by a net increase in regulatory deferrals and accounts receivable, as well as lower unbilled revenues due primarily to higher volumes and lower prices.\n \n\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\n\n\nPSEG meets its short-term liquidity requirements, as well as those of PSEG Power, primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and, from time to time, short-term loans. PSE&G maintains its own separate commercial paper program to meet its short-term liquidity requirements. Each commercial paper program is fully back-stopped by its own separate credit facility.\n\n\nEach of our credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed below; however, if necessary, the PSEG facilities can also be used to support our subsidiaries’ liquidity needs.\n\n\nPSEG Power has uncommitted credit facilities totaling $200 million, which can be utilized for letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, PSEG Power had $75 million in letters of credit outstanding under these uncommitted credit facilities. In addition, a subsidiary of PSEG Power has an uncommitted credit facility for $150 million, which can be utilized for cash collateral postings.\n \n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nOur total committed credit facilities and available liquidity as of December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompany/Facility\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\nFacility\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nUsage\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAvailable\nLiquidity\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n764\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n736\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSE&G\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n468\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n532\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Power\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,325\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n82\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,243\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,825\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,314\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,511\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor additional information, see Item 8. Note 14. Debt and Credit Facilities.\n\n\nWe continually monitor our liquidity and seek to add capacity as needed to meet our liquidity requirements, including to satisfy any additional collateral requirements. As of December 31, 2024, our liquidity position, including our credit facilities and access to external financing, was expected to be sufficient to meet our projected stressed requirements over our 12-month planning horizon. PSEG analyzes its liquidity requirements using stress scenarios that consider different events, including changes in commodity prices and the potential impact of PSEG Power losing its investment grade credit rating from S&P or Moody’s, which would represent a two level downgrade from its current Moody’s and S&P ratings. In the event of a deterioration of PSEG Power’s credit rating, certain of PSEG Power’s agreements allow the counterparty to demand further performance assurance. The potential additional collateral that we would be required to post under these agreements if PSEG Power were to lose its investment grade credit rating was approximately $618 million and $751 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Note 14. Debt and Credit Facilities.\n\n\nNDT Fund Obligation\n\n\nThe NRC requires a biennial filing of the NDT fund balances against the decommissioning liability estimate. Any funding shortfalls are required to be cured prior to the next NDT reporting period. We do not currently expect to be required to provide supplemental funding of the NDT Fund.\n\n\nDebt Covenants\n \n\n\nOur credit agreements contain maximum debt to equity ratios and other restrictive covenants and conditions to borrowing. We are currently in compliance with all of our debt covenants. Continued compliance with applicable financial covenants will depend upon our future financial position, level of earnings and cash flows, as to which no assurances can be given.\n\n\nIn addition, under its First and Refunding Mortgage (Mortgage), PSE&G may issue new First and Refunding Mortgage Bonds against previous additions and improvements, provided that its ratio of earnings to fixed charges calculated in accordance with its Mortgage is at least 2 to 1, and/or against retired Mortgage Bonds. As of December 31, 2024, PSE&G’s Mortgage coverage ratio was 3.3 to 1 and the Mortgage would permit up to approximately $11 billion aggregate principal amount of new Mortgage Bonds to be issued against additions and improvements to its property.\n \n\n\nDefault Provisions\n\n\nOur bank credit agreements and indentures contain various, customary default provisions that could result in the potential acceleration of indebtedness under the defaulting company’s agreement.\n \n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nIn particular, PSEG’s bank credit agreement contains provisions under which certain events, including an acceleration of material indebtedness under PSE&G’s and PSEG Power’s respective financing agreements, a failure by PSEG, PSE&G or PSEG Power to satisfy certain final judgments and certain bankruptcy events by PSEG, PSE&G or PSEG Power, would constitute an event of default under the PSEG bank credit agreements. Under the PSEG bank credit agreements, it would also be an event of default if, in certain circumstances, either PSE&G or PSEG Power ceases to be wholly owned by PSEG. The PSE&G and PSEG Power bank credit agreements include certain similar default provisions; however, such provisions only relate to the respective borrower under such agreement and its subsidiaries and do not contain cross default provisions to each other. The PSE&G and PSEG Power bank credit agreements do not include cross default provisions relating to PSEG. Each of PSEG's, PSE&G’s and PSEG Power’s bank credit agreements also contain limitations on the incurrence of liens by it and certain of its subsidiaries and PSEG Power’s bank credit agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of certain subsidiary debt.\n \n\n\nPSEG’s existing notes include a cross acceleration provision that may be triggered upon the acceleration of more than $75 million of indebtedness incurred by PSEG. Such provision does not extend to an acceleration of indebtedness by any of PSEG’s subsidiaries. Under PSE&G’s medium-term note indenture, an event of default under PSE&G’s mortgage indenture and acceleration of the mortgage bonds would constitute an event of default.\n\n\nRatings Triggers\n \n\n\nOur debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any material “ratings triggers” that would cause an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade. However, in the event of a downgrade, any one or more of the affected companies may be subject to increased interest costs on certain bank debt and certain collateral requirements. In the event that we are not able to affirm representations and warranties on credit agreements, lenders would not be required to make loans.\n \n\n\nIn accordance with BPU requirements under the BGS contracts, PSE&G is required to maintain an investment grade credit rating. If PSE&G were to lose its investment grade rating, it would be required to file a plan to assure continued payment for the BGS requirements of its customers.\n \n\n\nFluctuations in commodity prices or a deterioration of PSEG Power’s credit rating to below investment grade could increase PSEG Power’s required margin postings under various agreements entered into in the normal course of business. PSEG Power believes it has sufficient liquidity to meet the required posting of collateral which would result from a credit rating downgrade to below investment grade by S&P or Moody’s at today’s market prices.\n\n\nCommon Stock Dividends\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDividend Payments on Common Stock\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPer Share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2.40\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2.28\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2.16\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nin Millions\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,196\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,137\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,079\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOn February 11, 2025, our Board of Directors approved a $0.63 per share common stock dividend for the first quarter of 2025. This reflects an indicative annual dividend rate of $2.52 per share. We expect to continue to pay cash dividends on our common stock; however, the declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements of our businesses, alternate investment opportunities, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. For additional information related to cash dividends on our common stock, see Item 8. Note 22. Earnings Per Share (EPS) and Dividends.\n\n\nCredit Ratings\n \n\n\nIf the rating agencies lower or withdraw our credit ratings, such revisions may adversely affect the market price of our securities and serve to materially increase our cost of capital and limit access to capital.

The Other Comprehensive Income was due primarily to $33 million of unrealized gains on derivative contracts accounted for as hedges, $26 million related to pension and other postretirement benefits, offset by $13 million of net unrealized losses related to available-for-sale debt securities. See Item 8. Note 21. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax for additional information.\n \n\n\nCAPITAL REQ\nUIREMENTS\n \n\n\nWe expect that all of our capital requirements over the next three years will come from a combination of internally generated funds and external debt financing. Projected capital construction and investment expenditures, excluding nuclear fuel purchases, for the next three years are presented in the following table. These projections include Allowance for Funds Used During Construction for PSE&G and Interest Capitalized During Construction for PSEG’s other subsidiaries. These amounts are subject to change, based on various factors. Amounts shown below for PSE&G include currently approved programs. We intend to continue to invest in infrastructure modernization and will seek to extend these and related programs as appropriate.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSE&G:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTransmission\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n735\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n890\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n920\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nElectric Distribution\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,190\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,235\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,325\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGas Distribution\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,050\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,050\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nClean Energy\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n745\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n840\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n935\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal PSE&G\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,720\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,990\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,230\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompetitively Bid, FERC Regulated Transmission\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n265\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n115\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Power & Other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n280\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n305\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n290\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal PSEG\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,030\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,560\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,635\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nPSE&G\n\n\nPSE&G’s projections for future capital expenditures include material additions and replacements to its T&D systems to meet expected growth and to manage reliability. As project scope and cost estimates develop, PSE&G will modify its current projections to include these required investments. PSE&G’s projected expenditures for the various items reported above are primarily comprised of the following:\n \n\n\n•\nTransmission—investments focused on growing demand, reliability improvements and replacement of aging infrastructure.\n\n\n•\nElectric and Gas Distribution—investments for new business and demand, reliability improvements and modernization and replacement of equipment that has reached the end of its useful life.\n\n\n•\nClean Energy—investments associated with customer EE programs, infrastructure supporting EVs and grid-connected solar. \n\n\nIn 2024, PSE&G made $2,921 million of capital expenditures, primarily for T&D system reliability. In addition, PSE&G had cost of removal, net of salvage, of $170 million associated with capital replacements, and expenditures for EE programs of approximately $544 million, which are included in operating cash flows.\n\n\nCompetitively Bid, FERC Regulated Transmission\t\n\n\nIn December 2023, PJM awarded us an approximately $424 million project to address increasing load and reliability issues in Maryland and northern Virginia as part of its 2022 Window 3 competitive solicitation. PJM has directed that the project be placed in service in 2027.\n \n\n\nPSEG Power & Other\n\n\nPSEG’s other projected expenditures are primarily comprised of investments to maintain and enhance current nuclear operations and opportunities to increase nuclear generation at PSEG Power and to purchase hardware, software and office equipment at Services.\n\n\nIn 2024, PSEG Power & Other made capital expenditures of $251 million, excluding $208 million for nuclear fuel, primarily related to various nuclear projects at PSEG Power and various IT projects at Services.\n \n\n\nOther Material Cash Requirements\n \n\n\nThe following table reflects our other material cash requirements which include debt maturities and interest payments, operating lease payments and energy related purchase commitments in the respective periods in which they are due.

Because of this, differences between the actual measure realized versus the estimate can have a material impact on results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We have determined that the following estimates are considered critical to the application of rules that relate to the respective businesses.\n\n\nAccounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB)\n\n\nThe market-related value of plan assets held for PSEG’s qualified pension and OPEB plans is equal to the fair value of these assets as of year-end. The plan assets are comprised of investments in both debt and equity securities which are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Plan assets also include investments in unlisted real estate which is valued via third-party appraisals. We calculate pension and OPEB costs using various economic and demographic assumptions.\n\n\nAssumptions and Approach Used\n:\n Economic assumptions include the discount rate and the expected rate of return on plan assets. Demographic pension and OPEB assumptions include projections of future mortality rates, pay increases and retirement patterns, as well as projected health care costs for OPEB.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAssumption\n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPension\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDiscount Rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.68\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.02\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.20\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpected Rate of Return on Plan Assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.10\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.10\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.20\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOPEB\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDiscount Rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.59\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.96\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5.16\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpected Rate of Return on Plan Assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.10\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8.10\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7.20\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nThe discount rate used to calculate PSEG’s pension and OPEB obligations is determined as of December 31 each year, our measurement date. The discount rate is determined by developing a spot rate curve based on the yield to maturity of a universe of high quality corporate bonds with similar maturities to the plan obligations. The spot rates are used to discount the estimated plan distributions. The discount rate is the single equivalent rate that produces the same result as the full spot rate curve.\n \n\n\nOur expected rate of return on plan assets reflects current asset allocations, historical long-term investment performance and an estimate of future long-term returns by asset class, long-term inflation assumptions and a premium for active management.\n\n\nWe utilize a corridor approach that reduces the volatility of reported costs/credits. The corridor requires differences between actuarial assumptions and plan results be deferred and amortized as part of the costs/credits. This occurs only when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets as of each year-end. For one of PSEG’s qualified pension plans, the excess would be amortized over the average remaining expected life of inactive participants, which is approximately eighteen years. For PSEG’s other qualified pension plan, the excess would be amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees, which is approximately fifteen years.\n\n\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\n: As part of the business planning process, we have modeled future costs assuming an 8.10% expected rate of return and a 5.68% discount rate for 2025 pension costs/credits and a 5.59% discount rate for 2025 OPEB costs/credits. Based upon these assumptions, we have estimated a net periodic pension expense in 2025 of approximately $37 million, or $0 million, net of amounts capitalized, and a net periodic OPEB expense in 2025 of approximately $3 million, or $2 million, net of amounts capitalized. Beginning in 2023, our net periodic pension amounts include the impact of the accounting order approved by the BPU authorizing PSE&G to modify its pension accounting for ratemaking purposes. Actual future pension costs/credits and funding levels will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, funding levels relative to our projected benefit obligation and accumulated benefit obligation and various other factors related to the populations participating in the pension plans. Actual future OPEB costs/credits will depend on future investment performance, changes in discount rates, market conditions, and various other factors.\n\n\nThe following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in certain assumptions.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n% Change\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nImpact on Benefit Obligation as of December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIncrease to\nCosts\nin 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nIncrease to\nCosts, net\nof Amounts\nCapitalized\nin 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAssumption\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPension\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDiscount Rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1\n\n\n)%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n467\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n20\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n14\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpected Rate of Return on Plan Assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1\n\n\n)%\n\n\n \n\n\nN/A\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n38\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n38\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOPEB\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDiscount Rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1\n\n\n)%\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n61\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExpected Rate of Return on Plan Assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(1\n\n\n)%\n\n\n \n\n\nN/A\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSee Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information.\n\n\nDerivative Instruments\n\n\nThe operations of PSEG, PSEG Power and PSE&G are exposed to market risks from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices that could affect their results of operations and financial condition. Exposure to these risks is managed through normal operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through executing derivative transactions. Derivative instruments are used to create a relationship in which changes to the value of the assets, liabilities or anticipated transactions exposed to market risks are expected to be offset by changes in the value of these derivative instruments.\n \n\n\nCurrent accounting guidance requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at their fair value, except for derivatives that qualify for and are designated as normal purchases and normal sales contracts.\n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nAssumptions and Approach Used\n:\n In general, the fair value of our derivative instruments is determined primarily by end of day clearing market prices from an exchange, such as the Intercontinental Exchange and Nodal Exchange, among others, or auction prices.\n \n\n\nFor our wholesale energy business, many of the forward sale, forward purchase, option and other contracts are derivative instruments that hedge commodity price risk, but do not meet the requirements for, or are not designated as, either cash flow or fair value hedge accounting. The changes in value of such derivative contracts are marked to market through earnings as the related commodity prices fluctuate. As a result, our earnings may experience significant fluctuations depending on the volatility of commodity prices.\n\n\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\n:\n Any significant changes to the fair market values of our derivatives instruments could result in a material change in the value of the assets or liabilities recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and could result in a material change to the unrealized gains or losses recorded in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\n\nFor additional information regarding Derivative Financial Instruments, see Item 8. Note 1. Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 16. Financial Risk Management Activities and Note 17. Fair Value Measurements.\n\n\nLong-Lived Assets\n \n\n\nManagement evaluates long-lived assets for impairment and reassesses the reasonableness of their related estimated useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant assessment. Such events or changes in circumstances may be as a result of significant adverse changes in regulation, business climate, counterparty credit worthiness, market conditions, or a determination that it is more-likely-than-not that an asset or asset group will be sold or retired before the end of its estimated useful life.\n \n\n\nAssumptions and Approach Used:\n In the event certain triggers exist indicating an asset/asset group may not be recoverable, an undiscounted cash flow test is performed to determine if an impairment exists. When the carrying value of a long-lived asset/asset group exceeds the undiscounted estimate of future cash flows associated with the asset/asset group, an impairment may exist to the extent that the fair value of the asset/asset group is less than its carrying amount.\n\n\nFor PSEG Power, cash flows for long-lived assets and asset groups are determined at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The cash flows from the nuclear generation units are evaluated at the portfolio level. These tests require significant estimates and judgment when developing expected future cash flows. Significant inputs may include, but are not limited to, forward power prices, the impact of PTCs, ZEC payments for the New Jersey nuclear assets, fuel costs, other operating and capital expenditures, the cost of borrowing and asset sale prices and probabilities associated with any potential sale prior to the end of the estimated useful life or the early retirement of assets\n. \nThe assumptions used by management incorporate inherent uncertainties that are at times difficult to predict and could result in impairment charges or accelerated depreciation in future periods if actual results materially differ from the estimated assumptions utilized in our forecasts.\n \n\n\nIn addition, long-lived assets are depreciated under the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives. An asset’s operating useful life is generally based upon operational experience with similar asset types and other non-operational factors. In the ordinary course, management, together with an asset’s co-owners in the case of certain of our jointly-owned assets, make a number of decisions that impact the operation of our generation assets beyond the current year. These decisions may have a direct impact on the estimated remaining useful lives of our assets and will be influenced by the financial outlook of the assets, including future market conditions such as forward energy, capacity prices, and long-term agreements to supply large power users, such as data centers, operating and capital investment costs and any state or federal legislation and regulations, among other items.\n \n\n\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used:\n The above cash flow tests, and fair value estimates and estimated remaining useful lives may be impacted by a change in the assumptions noted above and could significantly impact the outcome, triggering additional impairment tests, write-offs or accelerated depreciation.\n \n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nAsset Retirement Obligations (ARO)\n\n\nPSE&G, PSEG Power and Services recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists. These AROs are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred and are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets. PSE&G, as a rate-regulated entity, recognizes Regulatory Assets or Liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recording of costs and costs recovered through the rate-making process. We accrete the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time with the corresponding expense recorded in O&M Expense.\n\n\nAssumptions and Approach Used\n:\n Because quoted market prices are not available for AROs, we estimate the initial fair value of an ARO by calculating discounted cash flows that are dependent upon various assumptions, including:\n\n\n•\nestimation of dates for retirement, which can be dependent on environmental and other legislation,\n\n\n•\namounts and timing of future cash expenditures associated with retirement, settlement or remediation activities,\n\n\n•\ndiscount rates,\n\n\n•\ncost escalation rates,\n\n\n•\nmarket risk premium,\n\n\n•\ninflation rates, and\n\n\n•\nif applicable, past experience with government regulators regarding similar obligations.\n\n\nWe obtain updated nuclear decommissioning cost studies triennially unless new information necessitates more frequent updates. The most recent cost study was done in 2024. When we revise any assumptions used to calculate fair values of existing AROs, we adjust the ARO balance and corresponding long-lived asset which generally impacts the amount of accretion and depreciation expense recognized in future periods.\n \n\n\nNuclear Decommissioning AROs\n\n\nAROs related to the future decommissioning of PSEG Power’s nuclear facilities comprised approximately 100% or $1,035 million of PSEG’s total AROs as of December 31, 2024. PSEG Power determines its AROs for its nuclear units by assigning probability weighting to various discounted cash flow outcomes for each of its nuclear units that incorporate the assumptions above as well as:\n\n\n•\npotential retirement dates including the probability of license renewals,\n\n\n•\nSAFSTOR alternative, which assumes the nuclear facility can be safely stored and subsequently decommissioned in a period within 60 years after operations,\n\n\n•\nDECON alternative, which assumes decommissioning activities begin after operations, and\n\n\n•\nrecovery from the federal government of assumed specific\n \ncosts incurred for spent nuclear fuel.\n\n\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\n: \nChanges in the assumptions could result in a material change in the ARO balance sheet obligation and the period over which we accrete to the ultimate liability. Had the following assumptions been applied, our estimates of the approximate impacts on the Nuclear ARO as of December 31, 2024 are as follows:\n\n\n•\nA decrease of 1% in the discount rate would result in a $73 million increase in the Nuclear ARO.\n\n\n•\nAn increase of 1% in the inflation rate would result in a $346 million increase in the Nuclear ARO. \n\n\n•\nIf we were not reimbursed by the federal government for the spent costs, as prescribed under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the Nuclear ARO would increase by $105 million. \n\n\nAccounting for Regulated Businesses\n \n\n\nPSE&G prepares its financial statements to comply with GAAP for rate-regulated enterprises, which differs in some respects from accounting for non-regulated businesses. In general, accounting for rate-regulated enterprises should reflect the economic effects of regulation. As a result, a regulated utility is required to defer the recognition of costs (Regulatory Asset)\n \n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nor recognize obligations (Regulatory Liability) if the rates established are designed to recover the costs and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged or collected. This accounting results in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than that of enterprises that are not regulated.\n\n\nAssumptions and Approach Used\n: \nPSE&G recognizes Regulatory Assets where it is probable that such costs will be recoverable in future rates from customers and Regulatory Liabilities where it is probable that refunds will be made to customers in future billings. The highest degree of probability is an order from the BPU either approving recovery of the deferred costs over a future period or requiring the refund of a liability over a future period.\n\n\nVirtually all of PSE&G’s Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities are supported by BPU orders. In the absence of an order, PSE&G will consider the following when determining whether to record a Regulatory Asset or Liability:\n\n\n•\npast experience regarding similar items with the BPU,\n\n\n•\ntreatment of a similar item in an order by the BPU for another utility,\n\n\n•\npassage of new legislation, and\n\n\n•\nrecent discussions with the BPU.\n\n\nAll deferred costs are subject to prudence reviews by the BPU. When the recovery of a Regulatory Asset or payment of a Regulatory Liability is no longer probable, PSE&G charges or credits earnings, as appropriate.\n\n\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used\n:\n A change in the above assumptions may result in a material impact on our results of operations or our cash flows. See Item 8. Note 6. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for a description of the amounts and nature of regulatory balance sheet amounts.\n\n\nUncertain Tax Positions - Nuclear Production Tax Credits (PTCs)\n\n\nWe are required to make judgments in developing our provision for income tax expense (benefit), including those related to the uncertainty of tax positions taken, or expected to be taken, on a tax return. Our most significant uncertain tax position relates to the estimated benefit associated with PTCs.\n\n\nAssumptions and Approach Used:\n We account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold.\n\n\nManagement uses judgments in determining the amount of income tax benefit to recognize due to the uncertainties associated with the technical merits of each position and with consideration to the amount of benefit to be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. The estimated PTC benefits for the year ended December 31, 2024, are subject to change based on the issuance of authoritative guidance by the U.S. Treasury. Specifically, clarification of the definition of “gross receipts”, which is used to determine the reduction amount of the PTC, by the U.S. Treasury could affect the amount to be recognized.\n \n\n\nEffect if Different Assumptions Used: \nWhile we believe the amount of PTCs recognized for the year ended December 31, 2024, is more-than-likely to be sustained upon examination, the ultimate outcome could result in material favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our consolidated financial statements. Guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury supporting or not supporting our tax position could result in an additional income tax benefit (expense) between approximately $89 million and $(89) million, respectively. Further, ZEC revenue has been reduced by the estimated PTCs generated from PSEG Power’s Salem 1, Salem 2, and Hope Creek nuclear plants for the year ended December 31, 2024. ZEC revenue will be adjusted based upon the actual value of the PTCs generated which is dependent on the U.S. Treasury issuing additional guidance. This would result in an additional adjustment to Net Income between $(29) million and $44 million if our tax position discussed above is, or is not supported, respectively. See Item 8. Note 20. Income Taxes and Note 2. Revenues for more information.\n\n\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND Q\nUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\n\nThe risk inherent in our market-risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in commodity prices, equity security prices and interest rates as discussed in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. It is our policy to use derivatives to manage risk consistent with business plans and prudent practices. We have a Risk Management Committee comprised of executive officers who utilize a risk oversight function to ensure compliance with our corporate policies and risk management practices.\n\n\nAdditionally, we are exposed to counterparty credit losses in the event of non-performance or non-payment. We have a credit management process, which is used to assess, monitor and mitigate counterparty exposure. In the event of non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows.\n\n\nCommodity Contracts\n\n\nThe availability and price of energy-related commodities are subject to fluctuations from factors such as weather, environmental policies, changes in supply and demand, state and federal regulatory policies, market rules and other events. To reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations, we enter into supply contracts and derivative contracts, including forwards, futures, swaps, and options with approved counterparties. These contracts, in conjunction with physical sales and other services, help reduce risk and optimize the value of owned electric generation capacity.\n\n\nValue-at-Risk (VaR) Models\n\n\nVaR represents the potential losses, under normal market conditions, for instruments or portfolios due to changes in market factors, for a specified time period and confidence level. We estimate VaR across our commodity businesses.\n\n\nMTM VaR consists of MTM derivatives that are economic hedges. The calculation does not include market risks associated with activities that are subject to accrual accounting, primarily our generating facilities and some load-serving activities.\n \n\n\nThe VaR models used are variance/covariance models adjusted for the change of positions with 95% and 99.5% confidence levels and a one-day holding period for the MTM activities. The models assume no new positions throughout the holding periods; however, we actively manage our portfolio.\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMTM VaR\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n95% Confidence Level, Loss could exceed VaR one day in 20 days\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeriod End\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n36\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n48\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAverage for the Period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n44\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n56\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHigh\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n152\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n127\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLow\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n25\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n24\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n99.5% Confidence Level, Loss could exceed VaR one day in 200 days\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPeriod End\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n57\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n75\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAverage for the Period\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n69\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n87\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHigh\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n238\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n198\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLow\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n39\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n38\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSee Item 8. Note 16. Financial Risk Management Activities for a discussion of credit risk.\n\n\nInterest Rates\n\n\nPSEG, PSE&G and PSEG Power are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Exposure to this risk is managed by targeting a balanced debt maturity profile which limits refinancing in any given period or\n \n\n\n62\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\ninterest rate environment. PSEG, PSE&G and PSEG Power may also use a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate hedges.\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would result in an additional $4 million in pre-tax annual interest costs related to either the current or the long-term portion of long-term debt, and term loan agreements.\n\n\nDebt and Equity Securities\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $4.4 billion of net assets in trust for our pension and OPEB plans. Although fluctuations in market prices of securities within this portfolio do not directly affect our earnings in the current period, changes in the value of these investments could affect\n\n\n•\nour future contributions to these plans,\n\n\n•\nour financial position if our accumulated benefit obligation under our pension plans exceeds the fair value of the pension trust funds, and\n\n\n•\nfuture earnings, as we could be required to adjust pension expense and the assumed rate of return.\n\n\nThe NDT Fund is comprised primarily of fixed income and equity securities. As of December 31, 2024, the portfolio included $1.4 billion of equity securities inclusive of $0.3 billion of investments in listed real assets, and $1.3 billion in fixed income securities. The fair market value of the assets in the NDT Fund will fluctuate primarily depending upon the performance of equity markets. As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 10% change in the equity market would impact the value of the equity securities in the NDT Fund by approximately $138 million.\n\n\nWe use duration to measure the interest rate sensitivity of the fixed income portfolio. Duration is a summary statistic of the effective average maturity of the fixed income portfolio. The benchmark for the fixed income component of the NDT Fund currently has a duration of 6.08 years and a yield of 4.91%. The portfolio’s value will appreciate or depreciate by the duration with a 1% change in interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates would result in a decline in the market value for the fixed income portfolio of approximately $77 million.\n\n\nITEM 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\nAccounting for the Effects of Regulation – Refer to Notes 1 and 6 to the financial statements\n\n\nCritical Audit Matter Description\n \n\n\nPSEG’s subsidiary, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G), prepares its financial statements to comply with GAAP for rate-regulated enterprises, which differs in some respects from accounting for non-regulated businesses. Management believes that PSE&G’s transmission and distribution businesses continue to meet the accounting requirements for rate-regulated entities, and PSE&G’s financial statements reflect the economic effects of regulation. PSE&G has deferred certain costs based on rate orders issued by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (“BPU”) or Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) or based on PSE&G’s experience with prior rate proceedings.\n \n\n\n64\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nPSE&G defers the recognition of costs as a regulatory asset or records the recognition of obligations as a regulatory liability if it is probable that, through the rate-making process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates. This accounting results in the recognition of revenues and expenses in different time periods than that of enterprises that are not regulated. Regulatory assets and other investments and costs incurred under various infrastructure filings and clause mechanisms are subject to prudence reviews and can be disallowed in the future by regulatory authorities. To the extent that collection of any infrastructure or clause mechanism revenue, regulatory assets or payments of regulatory liabilities is no longer probable, the amounts would be charged or credited to income.\n\n\nWe identified the accounting for the effects of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in assessing the probable recovery of regulatory assets and incurred costs or the likelihood of refunds of regulatory liabilities. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities.\n \n\n\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n \n\n\nOur audit procedures to evaluate the accounting for the effects of cost-based rate regulation, including the probable recovery or refund of regulatory assets and liabilities, included the following, among others:\n \n\n\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n\n\n•\nWe obtained and read relevant regulatory orders issued by the BPU and FERC for PSE&G and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness. \n\n\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected associated documents and testimony filed with the BPU or FERC for any evidence that might contradict management's assertions.\n\n\n•\nWe evaluated the financial statement presentation and disclosures related to the impacts of cost-based rate-regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorristown, New Jersey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFebruary 25, 2025\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1934.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Sole Stockholder of\n \n\n\nPublic Service Electric and Gas Company\n \n\n\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n \n\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Public Service Electric and Gas Company and subsidiaries (the “Company” or \"PSE&G\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, common stockholder’s equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(B)(b) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).

STATEMENTS\n\n\n \n\n\nNote 1. Organization, Basis of P\nresentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n \nOrganization\nPublic Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (PSEG) is a public utility holding company that, acting through its wholly owned subsidiaries, is a predominantly regulated electric and gas utility and a nuclear generation business. PSEG’s principal operating subsidiaries are:\n•\nPublic Service Electric and Gas Company (PSE&G)\n—which is a public utility engaged principally in the transmission of electricity and distribution of electricity and natural gas in certain areas of New Jersey. PSE&G is subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and other federal and New Jersey state regulators. PSE&G also invests in regulated solar generation projects and energy efficiency (EE) and related programs in New Jersey, which are regulated by the BPU.\n•\nPSEG Power LLC (PSEG Power)\n—which is an energy supply company that consists of the operations of merchant nuclear generating assets and fuel supply functions engaged in competitive energy sales via its principal direct wholly owned subsidiaries. PSEG Power’s subsidiaries are subject to regulation by FERC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and other federal regulators and state regulators in the states in which they operate. \nPSEG’s other direct wholly owned subsidiaries are: PSEG Long Island LLC (PSEG LI), which operates the Long Island Power Authority’s (LIPA) electric transmission and distribution (T&D) system under an Operations Services Agreement (OSA); PSEG Energy Holdings L.L.C. (Energy Holdings), which primarily holds legacy lease investments and competitively bid, FERC regulated transmission; and PSEG Services Corporation (Services), which provides certain management, administrative and general services to PSEG and its subsidiaries at cost.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe respective financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) applicable to Annual Reports on Form 10-K and in accordance with accounting guidance generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). Certain line item reclassifications have been made to prior year financial statements to conform with current year presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on PSEG’s or PSE&G’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nEach company consolidates those entities in which it has a controlling interest or is the primary beneficiary. See Note 4. Variable Interest Entity. Entities over which the companies exhibit significant influence, but do not have a controlling interest and/or are not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Equity investments that do not qualify for consolidation or equity method accounting are recorded at fair value or, if fair value is not readily determinable, are initially recognized at cost and subsequently remeasured if there is an orderly transaction in an identical or similar investment of the same issuer or if the investment is impaired. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nPSE&G and PSEG Power also have undivided interests in certain jointly-owned facilities, with each responsible for paying its respective ownership share of construction costs, fuel purchases and operating expenses. PSE&G and PSEG Power consolidate their portion of any revenues and expenses related to their respective jointly-owned facilities in the appropriate revenue and expense categories.\nAccounting for the Effects of Regulation\nIn \naccordance with accounting guidance for rate-regulated entities, PSE&G’s financial statements reflect the economic effects of regulation. PSE&G defers the recognition of costs (a Regulatory Asset) or records the recognition of obligations (a Regulatory\n \n\n\n80\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nLiability) \nif it is probable that, through the rate-making process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future rates. Accordingly, PSE&G has deferred certain costs and recoveries, which are being amortized over various future periods. To the extent that collection of any such costs or payment of liabilities becomes no longer probable as a result of changes in regulation, the associated Regulatory Asset or Liability is charged or credited to income. Management believes that PSE&G’s T&D businesses continue to meet the accounting requirements for rate-regulated entities. For additional information, see Note 6. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nThe following\n \nprovides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Balance Sheets that sum to the total of the same such amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Restricted cash consists primarily of deposits received related to a construction project at PSE&G.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPSE&G\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Power & Other (A)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nConsolidated\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n79\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n125\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRestricted Cash in Other Current Assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRestricted Cash in Other Noncurrent Assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n108\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n154\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n24\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n54\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRestricted Cash in Other Current Assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRestricted Cash in Other Noncurrent Assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n75\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n24\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n99\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(A)\nIncludes amounts applicable to PSEG Power, Energy Holdings, Services and PSEG (parent company).\nDerivative Instruments\nEach company uses derivative instruments to manage risk pursuant to its business plans and prudent practices.\n \nWithin PSEG and its affiliate companies, PSEG Power has the most exposure to commodity price risk. PSEG Power is exposed to commodity price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity, natural gas and other commodities. Fluctuations in market prices result from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market conditions, weather, state and federal regulatory policies, environmental policies, transmission availability and other factors. PSEG Power uses a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments, such as financial options, futures and swaps to manage the exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and optimize the value of PSEG Power’s expected generation. Changes in the fair market value of the derivative contracts are recorded in earnings. Cash flows related to derivative instruments are included as a component of operating, investing or financing cash flows in PSEG’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, depending on the nature of hedges.\nDetermining whether a contract qualifies as a derivative requires that management exercise significant judgment, including assessing the contract’s market liquidity. PSEG has determined that contracts to purchase and sell certain products do not meet the definition of a derivative under the current authoritative guidance since they do not provide for net settlement, or the markets are not sufficiently liquid to conclude that physical forward contracts are readily convertible to cash.\nUnder current authoritative guidance, all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, except for derivatives that may be designated as normal purchases and normal sales (NPNS). Further, derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting can be designated as fair value or cash flow hedges.\nCertain offsetting derivative assets and liabilities are subject to a master netting or similar agreement. In general, the terms of the agreements provide that in the event of an early termination the counterparties have the right to offset amounts owed or owing under that and any other agreement with the same counterparty. Accordingly, these positions are offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of PSEG.\n\n\n81\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nFor cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated and qualifying as a cash flow hedge is deferred in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction.\n \nFor derivative contracts that do not qualify or are not designated as cash flow or fair value hedges or as NPNS, changes in fair value are recorded in current period earnings. PSEG does not currently elect hedge accounting on its commodity derivative positions.\nFor additional information regarding derivative financial instruments, see Note 16. Financial Risk Management Activities.\nRevenue Recognition\n \nPSE&G’s regulated electric and gas revenues are recorded primarily based on services rendered to customers. PSE&G records unbilled revenues for the estimated amount customers will be billed for services rendered from the time meters were last read and billed to the end of the respective accounting period. The unbilled revenue is estimated each month based on usage per day, the number of unbilled days in the period, estimated seasonal loads based upon the time of year and the variance of actual degree-days and temperature-humidity-index hours of the unbilled period from expected norms.\nRegulated revenues from the transmission of electricity are recognized as services are provided based on a FERC-approved annual formula rate mechanism. This mechanism provides for an annual filing of estimated revenue requirement with rates effective January 1 of each year. After completion of the annual period ending December 31, PSE&G files a true-up whereby it compares its actual revenue requirement to the original estimate to determine any over or under collection of revenue. PSE&G records the estimated financial statement impact of the difference between the actual and the filed revenue requirement as a refund or deferral for future recovery when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated in accordance with accounting guidance for rate-regulated entities.\nPSEG Power currently owns generation within PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), which facilitates the dispatch of energy and energy-related products. PSEG generally reports electricity sales and purchases conducted with the PJM Independent System Operator (ISO) at PSEG Power on a net hourly basis in either Revenues or Energy Costs in its Consolidated Statement of Operations, the classification of which depends on the net hourly activity. Capacity revenue and expense are also reported net based on PSEG Power’s monthly net sale or purchase position in PJM. PSEG Power also has revenues that relate to bilateral contracts, which are accounted for on the accrual basis as the energy is delivered. PSEG Power’s revenue also includes changes in the value of energy derivative contracts. See Note 16. Financial Risk Management Activities for further discussion.\nPSEG LI is the primary beneficiary of Long Island Electric Utility Servco, LLC (Servco). For transactions in which Servco acts as principal, Servco records revenues and the related pass-through expenditures separately in Operating Revenues and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Expense, respectively.

Income taxes are allocated to PSEG’s subsidiaries in accordance with a tax allocation agreement whereby each PSEG subsidiary’s current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis. Each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return, except for certain tax attributes and state apportionment results. Allocations between PSEG and its subsidiaries are recorded through intercompany accounts. Investment tax credits (ITC) deferred in prior years are being amortized over the useful lives of the related property.\nUncertain income tax positions are accounted for using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach, a more-likely-than-not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. If it is not more-likely-than-not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits, no benefit will be recorded. Uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold.\n \nIn 2024, PSEG recorded the benefit of the estimated PTCs generated by PSEG’s qualified nuclear generation facilities within Income Tax Expense in its Consolidated Statements of Operations in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, \nIncome Taxes\n. See Note 20. Income Taxes for further discussion.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nManagement evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as significant adverse changes in regulation, business climate, counterparty credit worthiness or market conditions, including prolonged periods of adverse commodity and capacity prices or a current expectation that a long-lived asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life, could potentially indicate an asset’s or asset group’s carrying amount may not be recoverable. In such an event, an undiscounted cash flow analysis is performed to determine if an impairment exists. When a long-lived asset’s or asset group’s carrying amount exceeds the associated undiscounted estimated future cash flows, the asset/asset group is considered impaired to the extent that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. An impairment would result in a reduction of the value of the long-lived asset/asset group through a non-cash charge to earnings.\nFor PSEG, cash flows for long-lived assets and asset groups are determined at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. The cash flows from the nuclear generation units are evaluated at the portfolio level. See Note 3. Asset Dispositions and Impairments for more information on impairment assessments performed on PSEG’s long-lived assets.\nAccounts Receivable—Allowance for Credit Losses\nPSE&G’s accounts receivable, including unbilled revenues, are primarily comprised of utility customer receivables for the provision of electric and gas service and appliance services, and are reported in the balance sheet as gross outstanding amounts adjusted for an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects PSE&G’s best estimate of losses on the account balances. The allowance is based on PSE&G’s projection of accounts receivable aging, historical experience, economic factors and other currently available evidence, including the estimated impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the outstanding balances as of\n \n\n\n83\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024. PSE&G’s electric bad debt expense is recovered through the Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) mechanism and incremental gas bad debt has been deferred for future recovery through the coronavirus (COVID-19) Regulatory Asset. See Note 2. Revenues and Note 6. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.\n \nAccounts receivable are charged off in the period in which the receivable is deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts receivable are recorded when it is known they will be received.\nMaterials and Supplies and Fuel\nPSEG and PSE&G’s materials and supplies are carried at average cost and charged to inventory when purchased and expensed or capitalized to Property, Plant and Equipment, as appropriate, when installed or used. Fuel inventory at PSEG is valued at the lower of average cost or market and primarily includes stored natural gas used to satisfy obligations under PSEG Power’s gas supply contracts with PSE&G. The costs of fuel, including initial transportation costs, are included in inventory when purchased and charged to Energy Costs when used or sold. The cost of nuclear fuel is capitalized within Property, Plant and Equipment and amortized to fuel expense using the units-of-production method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nPSE&G’s additions to and replacements of existing property, plant and equipment are capitalized at cost. The cost of maintenance, repair and replacement of minor items of property is charged to expense as incurred. At the time units of depreciable property are retired or otherwise disposed of, the original cost, adjusted for net salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation.\nPSEG capitalizes costs related to its generating assets, including those related to its jointly-owned facilities that increase the capacity, improve or extend the life of an existing asset; represent a newly acquired or constructed asset; or represent the replacement of a retired asset. The cost of maintenance, repair and replacement of minor items of property is charged to appropriate expense accounts as incurred. Environmental costs are capitalized if the costs mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination or if the costs improve existing assets’ environmental safety or efficiency. All other environmental expenditures are expensed as incurred. PSEG also capitalizes spare parts for its generating assets that meet specific criteria. Capitalized spare parts are depreciated over the remaining lives of their associated assets.\nLeases\n \nPSEG and its subsidiaries, when acting as lessee or lessor, determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. PSEG assesses contracts to determine if the arrangement conveys (i) the right to control the use of the identified property, (ii) the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the property, and (iii) the right to direct the use of the property.\nLessee\n—Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and Operating Lease Liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.\nThe current portion of Operating Lease Liabilities is included in Other Current Liabilities. Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets and noncurrent Operating Lease Liabilities are included as separate captions in Noncurrent Assets and Noncurrent Liabilities, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of PSEG and PSE&G. PSEG and its subsidiaries do not recognize Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities for leases where the term is twelve months or less.\nPSEG and its subsidiaries recognize the lease payments on a straight-line basis over the term of the leases and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligations for those payments are incurred.\nAs lessee, most of the operating leases of PSEG and its subsidiaries do not provide an implicit rate; therefore, incremental borrowing rates are used based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The implicit rate is used when readily determinable. PSE&G’s incremental borrowing rates are based on secured borrowing rates. PSEG’s incremental borrowing rates are generally unsecured rates. Having calculated simulated secured rates for each of PSEG and PSEG Power, it was determined that the difference between the unsecured borrowing rates and the simulated secured rates had an immaterial effect on their recorded Operating Lease Right-of-Use Assets and Operating Lease Liabilities. Services, PSEG LI and other subsidiaries of PSEG that do not borrow funds or issue debt may enter into leases. Since these\n \n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\ncompanies do not have credit ratings and related incremental borrowing rates, PSEG has determined that it is appropriate for these companies to use the incremental borrowing rate of PSEG, the parent company.\nLease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised.\nPSEG and its subsidiaries have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components. For real estate, equipment and vehicle leases, the lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component.\nLessor\n—Property subject to operating leases, where PSEG or one of its subsidiaries is the lessor, is included in Property, Plant and Equipment and rental income from these leases is included in Operating Revenues.\nPSEG and its subsidiaries have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are primarily related to domestic energy generation and real estate assets. PSEG and subsidiaries account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. See Note 7. Leases for detailed information on leases.\nEnergy Holdings is the lessor in leveraged leases. Leveraged lease accounting guidance is grandfathered for existing leveraged leases. Energy Holdings’ leveraged leases are accounted for in Operating Revenues and in Noncurrent Long-Term Investments. If modified after January 1, 2019, those leveraged leases will be accounted for as operating or financing leases. See Note 8. Long-Term Investments and Note 9. Financing Receivables.\nTrust Investments\nThese securities comprise the Nuclear Decommissioning Trust (NDT) Fund, a master independent external trust account maintained to provide for the costs of decommissioning upon termination of operations of PSEG’s nuclear facilities and amounts that are deposited to fund a Rabbi Trust which was established to meet the obligations related to non-qualified pension plans and deferred compensation plans.\nUnrealized gains and losses on equity security investments are recorded in Net Income. The debt securities are classified as available-for-sale with the unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Realized gains and losses on both equity and available-for-sale debt security investments are recorded in earnings and are included with the unrealized gains and losses on equity securities in Net Gains (Losses) on Trust Investments. Other-than-temporary impairments on NDT and Rabbi Trust debt securities are also included in Net Gains (Losses) on Trust Investments. See Note 10. Trust Investments for further discussion.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB) Plans\n \nThe market-related value of plan assets held for the qualified pension and OPEB plans is equal to the fair value of those assets as of year-end. Fair value is determined using quoted market prices and independent pricing services based upon the security type as reported by the trustee at the measurement date (December 31) as well as investments in unlisted real estate which are valued via third-party appraisals.\n \nPSEG recognizes a long-term receivable primarily related to future funding by LIPA of Servco’s recognized pension and OPEB liabilities. This receivable is presented separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of PSEG as a noncurrent asset. Pursuant to the OSA, Servco records expense for contributions to its pension plan trusts and for OPEB payments made to retirees.\n \nSee Note 12. Pension, Other Postretirement Benefits (OPEB) and Savings Plans for further discussion.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nRecent Accounting Standards\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures—Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07\nThis ASU requires disclosure of incremental segment information, including additional detail on certain significant segment expenses, on an annual and interim basis to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2024. PSEG and PSE&G \nadopted \nthis standard on \nDecember 31, 2024\n.  The adoption of this standard did \nno\nt have a material impact on the financial statements of PSEG and PSE&G.\n \nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures—ASU 2023-09\nThis ASU makes amendments to the current reconciliation disclosure to improve transparency by requiring consistent categories and greater jurisdictional disaggregation. The ASU also provides for the inclusion of an income taxes paid disclosure by jurisdiction. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. PSEG and PSE&G are currently analyzing the impact of this ASU on their future disclosures.\n \n \n      Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses and Effective Date Clarification—ASU 2024-03\n \nThis ASU requires additional annual and interim disclosure about certain expenses in the notes to financial statements that provide disaggregated information (within a new tabular disclosure, the amounts of specified natural expenses included in each relevant expense caption: (a) purchases of inventory, (b) employee compensation, (c) depreciation, (d) amortization, and (e) depletion) about an entity’s expense captions that are presented on the face of the income statement within continuing operations.\n \nThe ASU also requires certain expense related disclosures within the new tabular disclosure and disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses.  The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2027. PSEG and PSE&G are currently analyzing the impact of this ASU on their future disclosures.\n\n\nNote 2. R\nevenues\n \nNature of Goods and Services\nThe following is a description of principal activities by which PSEG and its subsidiaries generate their revenues.\nPSE&G\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nElectric and Gas Distribution and Transmission Revenues\n—PSE&G sells gas and electricity to customers under default commodity supply tariffs. PSE&G’s regulated electric and gas default commodity supply and distribution services are separate tariffs which are satisfied as the product(s) and/or service(s) are delivered to the customer. The electric and gas commodity and delivery tariffs are recurring contracts in effect until modified through the regulatory approval process as appropriate. Revenue is recognized over time as the service is rendered to the customer. Included in PSE&G’s regulated revenues are unbilled electric and gas revenues which represent the estimated amount customers will be billed for services rendered from the most recent meter reading to the end of the respective accounting period.\nPSE&G’s transmission revenues are earned under a separate tariff using a FERC-approved annual formula rate mechanism. The performance obligation of transmission service is satisfied and revenue is recognized as it is provided to the customer. The formula rate mechanism provides for an annual filing of an estimated revenue requirement with rates effective January 1 of each year and a true-up to that estimate based on actual revenue requirements. The true-up mechanism is an alternative revenue which is outside the scope of revenue from contracts with customers.\nOther Revenues from Contracts with Customers\nOther revenues from contracts with customers, which are not a material source of PSE&G revenues, are generated primarily from appliance repair services and solar generation projects. The performance obligations under these contracts are satisfied and revenue is recognized as control of products is delivered or services are rendered.\n\n\n86\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nRevenues Unrelated to Contracts with Customers\nOther PSE&G revenues unrelated to contracts with customers are derived from alternative revenue mechanisms recorded pursuant to regulatory accounting guidance. These revenues, which include the Conservation Incentive Program (CIP), green energy program true-ups and transmission formula rate true-ups, are not a material source of PSE&G revenues.\n \nPSEG Power & Other\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nElectricity and Related Products\n—PSEG Power owns generation solely within PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (PJM), which facilitates the dispatch of energy and energy-related products. PSEG Power primarily sells to the PJM Independent System Operator (ISO) energy and ancillary services which are separately transacted in the day-ahead or real-time energy markets. The energy and ancillary services performance obligations are typically satisfied over time as delivered and revenue is recognized accordingly. Also, revenue for wholesale load contracts is recognized over time as the bundled service is provided to the customer. PSEG generally reports electricity sales and purchases conducted with PJM net on an hourly basis in either Operating Revenues or Energy Costs in its Consolidated Statements of Operations. The classification depends on the net hourly activity.\n \nPSEG Power enters into capacity sales and capacity purchases through PJM. The transactions are reported on a net basis dependent on PSEG Power’s monthly net sale or purchase position through PJM. The performance obligations with PJM are satisfied over time upon delivery of the capacity and revenue is recognized accordingly. In addition to capacity sold through PJM, PSEG Power sells capacity through bilateral contracts and the related revenue is reported on a gross basis and recognized over time upon delivery of the capacity.\nPSEG Power’s Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants have been awarded zero emission certificates (ZECs) by the BPU through May 2025. These nuclear plants are expected to receive ZEC revenue from the electric distribution companies (EDCs) in New Jersey. PSEG Power recognizes revenue when the units generate electricity, which is when the performance obligation is satisfied. These revenues are considered variable consideration within the scope of revenue from contracts with customers and are included in PJM Sales in the following tables. ZEC revenue recorded has been reduced by the estimated production tax credits (PTCs) generated from PSEG Power’s Salem 1, Salem 2, and Hope Creek nuclear plants for the year ended December 31, 2024. ZEC revenue will be adjusted based upon the actual value of the PTCs generated by these nuclear plants and that adjustment could be material. See Note 20. Income Taxes for further discussion on the factors that could result in an adjustment to the value of the PTCs.\n \nGas Contracts\n—PSEG Power sells wholesale natural gas, primarily through an index based full-requirements Basic Gas Supply Service (BGSS) contract with PSE&G to meet the gas supply requirements of PSE&G’s customers. The BGSS contract remains in effect unless terminated by either party with a two-year notice. Based upon the availability of natural gas, storage and pipeline capacity beyond PSE&G’s daily needs, PSEG Power also sells gas and pipeline capacity to other counterparties under bilateral contracts. The performance obligation is primarily the delivery of gas which is satisfied over time. Revenue is recognized as gas is delivered or pipeline capacity is released.\n \nPSEG LI Contract\n—PSEG LI has a contract with LIPA which generates revenues. PSEG LI’s subsidiary, Long Island Electric Utility Servco, LLC (Servco) records costs which are recovered from LIPA and records the recovery of those costs as revenues when Servco is a principal in the transaction.\nOther Revenues from Contracts with Customers\nPSEG Power has entered into long-term contracts with LIPA for energy management and fuel procurement services. Revenue is recognized over time as services are rendered. This agreement expires in December 2025.\nRevenues Unrelated to Contracts with Customers\nPSEG Power’s revenues unrelated to contracts with customers include electric, gas and certain energy-related transactions accounted for in accordance with Derivatives and Hedging accounting guidance. See Note 16. Financial Risk Management Activities for further discussion.\n \nEnergy Holdings generates lease revenues which are recorded pursuant to lease accounting guidance.\n\n\n87\n\n\n\n\nTable of

Substantially all of PSE&G’s accounts receivable and unbilled revenues result from contracts with customers that are priced at tariff rates. Allowances represented approximately \n13\n% and \n18\n% of accounts receivable (including unbilled revenues) as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nAccounts Receivable\n—\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n \nPSE&G’s accounts receivable, including unbilled revenues, is primarily comprised of utility customer receivables for the provision of electric and gas service and appliance services, and are reported on the balance sheet as gross outstanding amounts adjusted for an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses reflects PSE&G’s best estimate of losses on the account balances. The allowance is based on PSE&G’s projection of accounts receivable aging, historical experience, economic factors and other currently available evidence. PSE&G’s electric bad debt expense is recoverable through its Societal Benefits Clause (SBC) mechanism. As of December 31, 2024\n, PSE&G had a deferred balance of $\n78\n million from electric bad debts recorded as a Regulatory Asset, which included approximately $\n78\n million of incremental bad debt due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, PSE&G had deferred incremental gas bad debt expense of $\n68\n million as a Regulatory Asset for future regulatory recovery due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In June 2024, the BPU approved recovery of the incremental electric and gas bad debt amounts of $\n78\n million and $\n68\n million charged to PSE&G’s electric SBC and deferred COVID-19 deferrals, respectively.

The majority of these accounts receivable are subject to master netting agreements. As a result, accounts receivable resulting from contracts with customers and receivables unrelated to contracts with customers are netted within Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPSEG Power’s accounts receivable consist mainly of revenues from energy and ancillary services sold directly to ISOs and other counterparties. In the wholesale energy markets in which PSEG Power operates, payment for services rendered and products transferred are typically due within 30 days of delivery. As such, there is little credit risk associated with these receivables. PSEG Power did not record an allowance for credit losses for these receivables as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. PSEG Power monitors the status of its counterparties on an ongoing basis to assess whether there are any anticipated credit losses.\n \nPSEG LI did not have any material contract balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \nRemaining Performance Obligations under Fixed Consideration Contracts\nPSEG primarily records revenues as allowed by the guidance, which states that if an entity has a right to consideration from a customer in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the entity’s performance completed to date, the entity may recognize revenue in the amount to which the entity has a right to invoice. PSEG has future performance obligations under contracts with fixed consideration as follows:\nCapacity Revenues from the PJM Annual Base Residual and Incremental Auctions\n—The Base Residual Auction is generally conducted annually three years in advance of the operating period. However, changes to capacity market rules have resulted in auction suspensions and delays so that recent auctions have been run closer in time to their operating periods. In February 2023, the results of the 2024/2025 auction were released and in July 2024 the results of the 2025/2026 auction were released. PSEG Power expects to realize the following average capacity prices resulting from the base and incremental auctions, including unit specific bilateral contracts for previously cleared capacity obligations.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDelivery Year\n\n\n \n\n\n$ per\nMW-Day\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMW\nCleared\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 2024 to May 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n61\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,700\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 2025 to May 2026\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n270\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAmended OSA\n—In April 2022, PSEG LI entered into an amended OSA with LIPA. The OSA remains a 12-year services contract ending in 2025 with annual fixed and variable components. The fixed fee for the provision of services thereunder in 2025 is approximately $\n45\n million and is updated each year based on the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).\n \n\n\n90\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nNote 3. Asset Disposit\nions and Impairments\n \nIn 2022, Energy Holdings recorded pre-tax impairments of $\n78\n million related to one of its domestic energy generating facilities and its real estate assets. In March 2023, Energy Holdings completed the sale of its domestic energy generating facility and recorded an immaterial pre-tax gain. In December 2023, Energy Holdings completed the sale of its real estate assets and recorded an immaterial pre-tax gain.\n \nIn February 2022, PSEG completed the sale of PSEG Power’s fossil generating portfolio. As defined in the agreements, adjustments were required as a result of any purchase price or working capital adjustments, including an adjustment for positive or negative cash flow of the fossil generating assets based on actual performance starting after December 31, 2021 through the closing dates. As a result, in 2022 PSEG Power recorded an additional pre-tax impairment of approximately $\n50\n million prior to completing the sale of this fossil generating portfolio in February 2022.\nPSEG Power has retained ownership of certain liabilities excluded from the transactions primarily related to obligations under certain environmental regulations, including remediation obligations under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act (ISRA) and the Connecticut Transfer Act (CTA). The amounts for any such environmental remediation are not currently estimable, but will likely be material in the aggregate.\n\n\nNote 4. Variable \nInterest Entity (VIE)\nVIE for which PSEG LI is the Primary Beneficiary\nPSEG LI consolidates Servco, a marginally capitalized VIE, which was created for the purpose of operating LIPA’s T&D system in Long Island, New York as well as providing administrative support functions to LIPA. PSEG LI is the primary beneficiary of Servco because it directs the operations of Servco, the activity that most significantly impacts Servco’s economic performance and it has the obligation to absorb losses of Servco that could potentially be significant to Servco. Such losses would be immaterial to PSEG.\nPursuant to the OSA, Servco’s operating costs are paid entirely by LIPA, and therefore, PSEG LI’s risk is limited related to the activities of Servco. PSEG LI has no current obligation to provide direct financial support to Servco. In addition to payment of Servco’s operating costs as provided for in the OSA, PSEG LI receives an annual contract management fee. PSEG LI’s annual contract management fee, in certain situations, could be partially offset by Servco’s annual storm costs that are denied reimbursement by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, limited contingent liabilities and penalties for failing to meet certain performance metrics.\nFor transactions in which Servco acts as principal and controls the services provided to LIPA, such as transactions with its employees for labor and labor-related activities, including pension and OPEB-related transactions, Servco records revenues and the related pass-through expenditures separately in Operating Revenues and Operation and Maintenance (O&M) Expense, respectively. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, Servco recorded $\n592\n million, $\n533\n million and $\n516\n million, respectively, of O&M expense, the full reimbursement of which was reflected in Operating Revenues. For transactions in which Servco acts as an agent for LIPA, it records revenues and the related expenses on a net basis, resulting in no impact on PSEG’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n \n\n\n91\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nNote 5.

The Regulatory Assets and Liabilities in the table above are defined as follows:\n \n•\nARO:\n These costs represent the differences between rate-regulated cost of removal accounting and asset retirement accounting under GAAP. These costs will be recovered in future rates as assets are retired.\n•\nBRC:\n Represents deferred costs, primarily comprised of storm costs incurred in the cleanup of major storms, approved for a five-year recovery pursuant to the 2024 Distribution Base Rate Case Settlement. \n•\nCEF-EC (AMI Meter Deployment): \nIn October 2024, the BPU approved recovery of PSE&G’s CEF-EC capital and operating costs associated with its electric smart meter deployment program. Included in the approved recovery was the return on and of the capital investments in AMI meters and infrastructure, incremental operating costs of the program and stranded costs associated with the accelerated retirement of the non-AMI electric meters. \n•\nCIP: \nThe CIP reduces the impact on electric and gas distribution revenues from changes in sales volumes and demand for most customers. The CIP provides for a true-up of current period revenue as compared to revenue established in PSE&G’s most recent distribution base rate proceeding. Recovery under the CIP is subject to certain limitations, including an actual versus allowed return on equity test and ceilings on customer rate increases. \n•\nCEF-EV (Electric Vehicles): \nIn October 2024, the BPU approved recovery of PSE&G’s CEF-EV capital and operating costs associated with its electric vehicle program, which provides incentives to customers related to EV charger installations.  Included in the approved recovery was the return on and of PSE&G’s capital investments and customer incentives, and recovery of incremental operating costs of the program, incurred through November 2024.  The BPU also approved annual filings for recovery of future EV investments and costs associated with the program.\n•\nCost of Removal:\n PSE&G accrues and collects in rates for the cost of removing, dismantling and disposing of its electric distribution, electric transmission and gas distribution upon retirement. The Regulatory Asset or Liability for non-legally required cost of removal represents the difference between amounts collected in rates and costs actually incurred.\n•\nCOVID-19 Deferral:\n These amounts represent incremental costs related to COVID-19 as approved for recovery by the BPU over a five-year period starting June 1, 2025. \n•\nDeferred Income Tax Regulatory Assets:\n These amounts relate to deferred income taxes arising from utility operations that have not been included in customer rates relating to depreciation, ITCs and other flow-through items, including the accumulated deferred income taxes related to tax repair and mixed service cost deductions. \nAs part of PSE&G's 2018 distribution base rate case settlement with the BPU and the establishment of the TAC mechanism, PSE&G agreed to a ten-year flowback to customers of its accumulated deferred income taxes from previously realized tax repair deductions which resulted in the recognition of a $\n581\n million Regulatory Asset and Regulatory Liability as of September 30, 2018. In addition, PSE&G agreed to the current flowback of tax benefits from ongoing tax repair deductions which results in the recording of a Regulatory Asset upon flowback each year.\n \n\n\n94\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nAs part of PSE&G’s 2024 base rate case settlement with the BPU, PSE&G agreed to an additional five-year flowback to customers of its accumulated deferred income taxes from previously realized mixed service cost deductions which resulted in the recognition of a $\n509\n million Regulatory Asset and Regulatory Liability as of September 30, 2024.  In addition, PSE&G agreed to the current flowback of tax benefits from ongoing mixed service cost deductions which results in the recording of a Regulatory Asset upon flowback each year.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024\n, 2023 and 2022, PSE&G had provided $\n81\n million, $\n80\n million and $\n35\n million, respectively, in current tax repair flowbacks to customers. The flowback of current mixed service costs commences in January 2025. The recovery and amortization of the tax repair and mixed service cost-related Deferred Income Tax Regulatory Assets is being recovered through the TAC regulatory mechanism, with the mixed service cost component commencing recovery in January 2025.\n \n•\nDeferred Income Tax Regulatory Liabilities:\n These liabilities primarily relate to amounts due to customers for excess deferred income taxes as a result of the reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate provided in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and accumulated deferred income taxes from previously realized distribution-related tax repair and mixed service cost deductions. As part of its settlement with its regulators, PSE&G agreed to refund the excess deferred income taxes as follows:\n•\nProtected distribution-related excess deferred income taxes are being refunded to customers over the remaining useful lives of distribution property, plant and equipment through PSE&G’s TAC mechanism. As of December 31, 2024\n, the balance remaining to be flowed back to customers was approximately $\n840\n million. \n•\nPreviously realized distribution-related tax repair deductions are being refunded to customers over ten years through PSE&G’s TAC mechanism. As of December 31, 2024\n, the balance remaining to be flowed back to customers was approximately $\n310\n million through 2028.\n•\nPreviously realized distribution-related mixed service cost deductions are being refunded to customers over five years through PSE&G’s TAC mechanism.  As of December 31, 2024, the balance to be flowed back to customers was approximatel\ny $\n509\n mi\nllion through 2029.\n•\nProtected transmission-related excess deferred income taxes are being refunded to customers over the remaining useful life of transmission property, plant and equipment through PSE&G’s transmission formula rate mechanism. As of December 31, 2024\n, the balance remaining to be flowed back to customers was approximately $\n928\n million.\n•\nElectric Energy Costs\n—\nBGS: \nThese costs represent the over or under recovered amounts associated with BGS, as approved by the BPU. Pursuant to BPU requirements, PSE&G serves as the supplier of last resort for electric customers within its service territory that are not served by another supplier. Pricing for those services are set by the BPU as a pass-through, resulting in no margin for PSE&G’s operations. Over or under recovered balances with interest are returned or recovered through monthly filings.\n•\nGas Costs\n—\nBGSS:\n These costs represent the over or under recovered amounts associated with BGSS, as approved by the BPU. Pursuant to BPU requirements, PSE&G serves as the supplier of last resort for gas customers within its service territory that are not served by another supplier. Pricing for those services are set by the BPU as a pass-through, resulting in no margin for PSE&G’s operations. Over or under collected balances are returned or recovered through an annual filing. Interest is accrued only on over recovered balances.\n•\nGPRC:\n PSE&G files an annual GPRC petition with the BPU for recovery of amounts associated with the BPU Board-approved energy efficiency (EE) and solar (renewable) energy (RE) programs that include a return on and of investments and capital assets, as well as recovery for deferred expenses and incremental costs. The GPRC investment program component is recovered over the lives of the underlying investments and capital assets which range from five to twenty years. \nThe approved GPRC components receiving recovery for the return on and of investments include: Carbon Abatement, Energy Efficiency Economic Stimulus Program (EEE), EEE Extension Program, EEE Extension II Program, Solar Generation Investment Program (Solar 4 All\n®\n), Solar 4 All\n®\n Extension, Solar 4 All\n®\n Extension II, Solar Loan II Program, Solar Loan III Program, EE 2017 Program, Clean Energy Future–Energy Efficiency (CEF-EE) and CEF-EE-II.\n \n\n\n95\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nIn addition, the GPRC components receiving cost recovery for deferred expenses include: the Transition Renewable Energy Certificate Program, Community Solar Energy Program and the Successor Solar Incentive Program.\n \nThe Regulatory Asset balances represent the deferred investment and related undercollected balances with a Regulatory Liability recorded for any overrecovered balance. Interest is accrued monthly on any over-or under- recovered balances. Amortization of deferred investment and expenses are recorded in O&M expense. The capital asset portion of GPRC investments primarily in company-owned solar facilities is included in Property, Plant and Equipment, with depreciation recorded in Depreciation and Amortization Expense.\n•\nMGP Remediation Costs:\n Represents the low end of the range for the remaining environmental investigation and remediation program cleanup costs for MGPs that are probable of recovery in future rates. Once these costs are incurred, they are recovered through the RAC in the SBC over a seven year period with interest.\n•\nNew Jersey Clean Energy Program:\n The BPU approved future funding requirements for EE and RE Programs. The BPU funding requirements are recovered through the SBC. \n•\nPension and OPEB Costs:\n PSE&G records the unrecognized costs for defined benefit pension and other OPEB plans on the balance sheet as Regulatory Assets pursuant to the adoption of accounting guidance for employers’ defined benefit pension and OPEB plans, and relevant BPU orders. These costs represent net actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs which have not been expensed. These costs are amortized and recovered in future rates.\n•\nRAC (Other SBC):\n Costs incurred to clean up MGPs which are recovered over seven years with interest through an annual filing.\n•\nSBC:\n The SBC, as authorized by the BPU and the New Jersey Electric Discount and Energy Competition Act, includes costs related to PSE&G’s electric and gas business as follows: (1) the Universal Service Fund; (2) EE & RE Programs; (3) Electric bad debt expense; and (4) the RAC for incurred MGP remediation expenditures. Over or under recovered balances with interest are to be returned or recovered through an annual filing.  \nSignificant 2024 regulatory orders received and currently pending rate filings with the BPU or FERC by PSE&G are as follows:\n•\nElectric and Gas Distribution Base Rate Case Filings \n–\n In October 2024, the BPU issued an Order approving the settlement of PSE&G’s distribution base rate case with new rates effective October 15, 2024.  The Order provides for a $\n17.8\n billion rate base, a \n9.6\n% return on equity for PSE&G’s distribution business and a \n55\n% equity component of its capitalization structure. The settlement results in a net increase in annual revenues of approximately $\n505\n million, comprised of a $\n711\n million increase in base revenues, offset by the return of tax benefits of approximately $\n206\n million. \n \nThe \nreturn of tax benefits includes the flowback to customers of excess accumulated deferred income taxes and the flowback of previously recovered deferred income taxes and current tax repair deductions under the Tax Adjustment Credit (TAC) mechanism approved by the BPU in PSE&G’s 2018 distribution base rate case. The settlement approves an additional flowback of previously recovered deferred income taxes and current mixed service cost deductions. As a result of the approval to flowback previously recovered deferred income taxes related to mixed service costs, PSE&G recognized a $\n509\n million regulatory liability and a corresponding regulatory asset as of September 30, 2024.\n \nThe settlement also approved the recovery of regulatory assets primarily associated with deferred storm costs, PSE&G’s electric vehicle charging program (CEF-EV) and electric meter AMI deployment program (CEF-EC), including stranded costs associated with the early retirement of legacy meters.\n \nIn addition, the Order approved mechanisms associated with the recovery of future storm costs as well as the recovery of annual pension and OPEB expenses beginning January 1, 2025.\n \n•\nBGSS—\nIn April 2024, the BPU gave final approval to PSE&G’s BGSS rate of approximately \n40\n cents per therm. \nIn September 2024, the BPU approved on a provisional basis, PSE&G's request to decrease its BGSS rate to approximately \n33\n cents per therm, with the new rate effective October 1, 2024.\n•\nCIP—\nIn April 2024, the BPU gave final approval to provisional gas CIP rates which were effective October 1, 2023. \n\n\n96\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nIn September 2024, BPU approved on a provisional basis, PSE&G's annual gas CIP petition to recover estimated deficient gas revenues of approximately $\n107\n million based on the 12-month period ended September 30, 2024 with new rates effective October 1, 2024.\n \nIn February 2025, the BPU gave final approval for PSE&G’s updated electric CIP petition to recover approximately $\n96\n million of deficient electric revenues over two years that resulted from the 12-month period ended May 31, 2024, with new rates effective August 1, 2024.\n \nIn February 2025, PSE&G filed its 2025 annual electric CIP petition seeking BPU approval to recover estimated deficient electric revenues of approximately $\n65\n Million based on the 12-month period ending May 31, 2025, with new rates proposed to be effective June 1, 2025.

As part of the \n\n\n97\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nCOVID-19 \nOrder approved by the BPU in June 2024, PSE&G will commence recovery of $\n78\n million electric bad debt \nexpense deferred within the Social Programs component over a five-year period effective with the approval of PSE&G’s next SBC filing.\n \nIn December 2024, PSE&G filed a petition to decrease its annual electric SBC and NGC rates by approximately $\n3\n million and increase its annual SBC gas rate by $\n38\n million based on PSE&G’s actual collections and expenses through November 30, 2024, and its projected collections and expenses through May 31, 2026 under the NGC and the Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy and Social Programs components of the SBC. This petition includes the commencement of recovery of the previously deferred electric bad debt expense over a five-year period via the Social Programs component of the SBC.\n•\nTax Adjustment Credit (TAC)—\nAs part of PSE&G’s distribution rate case settlement, PSE&G agreed to change the electric and gas TAC rates effectuating an annual revenue decrease of approximately $\n99\n million and $\n107\n million, respectively, effective October 15, 2024. The revenue decrease is primarily the result of higher TAC credits to customers due to the flow-back of additional tax benefits related to mixed service costs.  \nIn February 2024, the BPU approved PSE&G’s 2023 TAC filing to increase annual electric and gas revenues by approximately \n$\n61\n million and $\n40\n million, respectively, with new rates effective March 1, 2024.\n•\nTransmission Formula Rates— \nIn June 2024, in accordance with its transmission formula rate protocols, PSE&G filed with the FERC its 2023 true-up adjustment pertaining to its transmission formula rates in effect for calendar year 2023, as established by its 2023 annual forecast filing. The June 2024 true-up filing resulted in an approximate $\n12\n million increase in the 2023 annual revenue requirement from the revenue requirement numbers contained in the forecast filing. PSE&G had previously recognized the majority of the increased revenue requirement in 2023.\nIn October 2024, in accordance with its transmission formula rate protocols, PSE&G submitted with FERC its formula rate annual update for 2025. This 2025 update sets forth PSE&G’s annual transmission revenue requirement for the period commencing January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2025, which will result in a $\n64\n million increase in its annual transmission revenue, subject to true-up.\n•\nZEC Program—\nIn August 2024, the BPU approved the final ZEC price of $\n9.95\n per MWh for the Energy Year ended May 31, 2024. As a result, PSE&G purchased approximately $\n166\n million of ZECs including interest, from the eligible nuclear plants selected by the BPU with the final payment made in August 2024. As total customer collections equaled the required ZEC payments, there were no over-collected revenues from customers for the Energy Year ended May 31, 2024.  \n\n\nNote 7.

A leveraged lease is typically comprised of an investment by an equity investor and debt provided by a third-party debt investor. The debt is recourse only to the assets subject to lease and is not included on PSEG’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. As an equity investor, Energy Holdings’ equity investments in the leases are comprised of the total expected lease receivables over the lease terms, reduced for any income not yet earned on the leases. This amount is included in Long-Term Investments on PSEG’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The more rapid depreciation of the leased property for tax purposes creates tax cash flow that will be repaid to the taxing authority in later periods. As such, the liability for such taxes due is recorded in Deferred Income Taxes on PSEG’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nLeveraged leases outstanding as of December 31, 2024\n commenced in or prior to 2000.\nThe following table shows Energy Holdings’ gross and net lease investment as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and2023. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLease Receivables (net of Non-Recourse Debt)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n200\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n223\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEstimated Residual Value of Leased Assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal Investment in Rental Receivables\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n200\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n223\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUnearned and Deferred Income\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n50\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n62\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGross Investments in Leases\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n150\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n161\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nDeferred Tax Liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n33\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n36\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Investments in Leases\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n117\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n125\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nThe pre-tax income and income tax effects related to investments in leases were immaterial for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n.\n \n\n\n102\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nNote 9. Financ\ning Receivables\nPSE&G\nPSE&G’s Solar Loan Programs are designed to help finance the installation of solar power systems throughout its electric service area. Interest income on the loans is recorded on an accrual basis. The loans are paid back with SRECs generated from the related installed solar electric system. PSE&G uses collection experience as a credit quality indicator for its Solar Loan Programs and conducted a comprehensive credit review for all borrowers. As of December 31, 2024, none of the solar loans were impaired; however, in the event a loan becomes impaired, the basis of the solar loan would be recovered through a regulatory recovery mechanism. Therefore, no current credit losses have been recorded for Solar Loan Programs I, II and III. A substantial portion of these loan amounts are noncurrent and reported in Long-Term Investments on PSEG’s and PSE&G’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Upon the occurrence of certain defaults, indirect subsidiaries of Energy Holdings would exercise their rights and seek recovery of their investments, potentially including stepping into the lease directly to protect their investments. While these actions could ultimately protect or mitigate the loss of value, they could require the use of significant capital and trigger certain material tax obligations which could, for certain leases, wholly or partially be mitigated by tax indemnification claims against the counterparty. A bankruptcy of a lessee would likely delay and potentially limit any efforts on the part of the lessors to assert their rights upon default and could delay the monetization of claims.\n\n\nNote 10. Trus\nt Investments\nNDT Fund\nIn accordance with NRC regulations, entities owning an interest in nuclear generating facilities are required to determine the costs and funding methods necessary to decommission such facilities upon termination of operation. As a general practice, each nuclear owner places funds in independent external trust accounts it maintains to provide for decommissioning. PSEG Power is required to file periodic reports with the NRC demonstrating that its NDT Fund meets the formula-based minimum NRC funding requirements. PSEG Power maintains an external master NDT to fund its share of decommissioning costs for its \nfive\n nuclear facilities upon their respective termination of operation. The trust contains two separate funds: a qualified fund and a non-qualified fund. Section 468A of the Internal Revenue Code limits the amount of money that can be contributed into a qualified fund. PSEG Power’s share of decommissioning costs related to its five nuclear units was estimated to be between $\n3.6\n billion and $\n3.8\n billion, including contingencies. The liability for decommissioning recorded on a discounted basis as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n was approximately $\n1\n billion and is included in the ARO. The funds are managed by third-party investment managers who operate under investment guidelines developed by PSEG Power.\n \n\n\n104\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

For these securities, management considers its intent to sell or requirement to sell a security prior to expected recovery. In those cases where a sale is expected, any impairment would be recorded through earnings. For fixed income securities where there is no intent to sell or likely requirement to sell, management evaluates whether credit loss is a component of the impairment. If so, that portion is recorded through earnings while the noncredit loss component is recorded through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any subsequent recoveries of the noncredit loss component of the impairment would be recorded through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any subsequent recoveries of the credit loss component would be recognized through earnings. The assessment of fair market value compared to cost is applied on a weighted average basis taking into account various purchase dates and initial cost of the securities.\nRabbi Trust\nPSEG maintains certain unfunded nonqualified benefit plans to provide supplemental retirement and deferred compensation benefits to certain key employees.

PSEG did not recognize credit losses for corporate bonds because they are primarily investment grade. \nThe proceeds from the sales of and the net gains (losses) on securities in the Rabbi Trust Fund were:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYears Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nProceeds from Rabbi Trust Sales\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n33\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n29\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n65\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Realized Gains (Losses):\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGross Realized Gains\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGross Realized Losses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n9\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Realized Gains (Losses) on Rabbi Trust (A)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Unrealized Gains (Losses) on Equity Securities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n6\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Gains (Losses) on Rabbi Trust Investments\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n10\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(A)\nThe cost of these securities was determined on the basis of specific identification.\n\n\n109\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nThe Rabbi Trust debt securities held as of \nDecember 31, 2024 had the following maturities:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTime Frame\n\n\n \n\n\nFair Value\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLess than one year\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n1 - 5 years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n6 - 10 years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n11 - 15 years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n16 - 20 years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n15\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOver 20 years\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n73\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal Rabbi Trust Available-for-Sale Debt Securities\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n148\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nPSEG periodically assesses individual debt securities whose fair value is less than amortized cost to determine whether the investments are considered to be impaired. For these securities, management considers its intent to sell or requirement to sell a security prior to expected recovery. In those cases where a sale is expected, any impairment would be recorded through earnings. For fixed income securities where there is no intent to sell or likely requirement to sell, management evaluates whether credit loss is a component of the impairment. If so, that portion is recorded through earnings while the noncredit loss component is recorded through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any subsequent recoveries of the noncredit loss component of the impairment would be recorded through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Any subsequent recoveries of the credit loss component would be recognized through earnings. The assessment of fair market value compared to cost is applied on a weighted average basis taking into account various purchase dates and initial cost of the securities.\nThe fair value of the Rabbi Trust related to PSEG and PSE&G are detailed as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSE&G\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n32\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Power & Other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n135\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n147\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal Rabbi Trust Investments\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n165\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n179\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n110\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nNote 11. Asset Retir\nement Obligations (AROs)\n \nPSEG and PSE&G recognize liabilities for the expected cost of retiring long-lived assets for which a legal obligation exists to remove or dispose of an asset or some component of an asset at retirement. These AROs are recorded at fair value in the period in which they are incurred and are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived assets. PSEG’s subsidiaries, except for PSE&G, accrete the ARO liability to reflect the passage of time with the corresponding expense recorded in O&M. PSE&G, as a rate-regulated entity, recognizes Regulatory Assets or Liabilities as a result of timing differences between the recording of costs and costs recovered through the rate-making process.\nPSE&G has conditional AROs primarily for legal obligations related to the removal of treated wood poles and the requirement to seal natural gas pipelines at all sources of gas when the pipelines are no longer in service. PSE&G does not record an ARO for its protected steel and poly-based natural gas lines, as management believes that these categories of gas lines have an indeterminable life.\nPSEG’s other ARO liability primarily relates to decommissioning of its nuclear power plants in accordance with NRC requirements. PSEG has an independent external trust that is intended to fund decommissioning of its nuclear facilities upon termination of operation. For additional information, see Note 10. Trust Investments. PSEG also identified conditional AROs related to PSEG’s retained fossil generation sites primarily related to liabilities for removal of asbestos. To estimate the fair value of its other AROs, PSEG uses a probability weighted, discounted cash flow model which, on a unit by unit basis, considers multiple outcome scenarios that include significant estimates and assumptions, and are based on third-party decommissioning cost estimates, cost escalation rates, inflation rates and discount rates.\nUpdated nuclear cost studies are obtained triennially unless new information necessitates more frequent updates. The most recent cost study was completed in 2024. When assumptions are revised to calculate fair values of existing AROs, generally, the ARO balance and corresponding long-lived asset are adjusted which impact the amount of accretion and depreciation expense recognized in future periods. For PSE&G, Regulatory Assets and Regulatory Liabilities result when accretion and amortization are adjusted to match rates established by regulators resulting in the regulatory deferral of any gain or loss.\nThe changes to the ARO liabilities for PSEG and PSE&G during 2023 and 2024 are presented in the following table:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPSE&G\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Power & Other\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nARO Liability as of January 1, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,499\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n384\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,115\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiabilities Settled\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n13\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n13\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAccretion Expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAccretion Expense Deferred and Recovered in Rate Base (A)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRevision to Present Values of Estimated Cash Flows\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n85\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n99\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nARO Liability as of December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,468\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n401\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,067\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLiabilities Settled\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n26\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n12\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n14\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAccretion Expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n49\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAccretion Expense Deferred and Recovered in Rate Base (A)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRevision to Present Values of Estimated Cash Flows\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n7\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n52\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n59\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nARO Liability as of December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n457\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,043\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(A)\nNot reflected as expense in Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn 2024, PSE&G recorded an increase to its ARO liabilities primarily due to the impact of increases in labor rates and other costs, partially offset by decreases from changes in inflation and discount rate assumptions. Those changes had \nno\n impact on PSE&G’s Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nIn February 2022, the NRC issued an order related to its review of the subsequent license renewal (SLR) application for the Peach Bottom nuclear units. While the NRC had previously granted the SLR to the Peach Bottom units, the NRC was responding to pending motions that had not previously been adjudicated. In its decision, the NRC concluded that the previous environmental\n \n\n\n111\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nreview required by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) was incomplete because it did not adequately address environmental impacts resulting from extending the units’ licenses by 20 years. As a result, at the direction of the NRC, the NRC staff changed the expiration dates for the licenses back to 2033 and 2034, until the completion of the NEPA analysis. The NRC directed, however, that the subsequently renewed licenses themselves remain in effect. The NRC also stated that it fully expects that the staff will complete its update of the NEPA analysis before 2033. As such, at this time, PSEG has not adjusted the useful lives or the assumed shutdown probabilities assigned to the ARO of the units as PSEG believes that the licenses will be updated to reflect the approved 2053 and 2054 expiration dates within the current license period. PSEG will continue to monitor this matter for further developments and any change to the estimated useful lives and ARO probabilities could have an adverse financial statement impact, which may be material.\nIn December 2023, PSEG Power reassessed its asset retirement cost (ARC) and ARO assumptions related to its Hope Creek and Salem nuclear plants, based upon the expectation of PTCs beginning in 2024. As a result, PSEG Power decreased its ARC asset and ARO liability by $\n99\n million, reflecting a decrease in the probability of early retirement and an increase in the probability the units would obtain additional license renewals.\n \nIn December 2024, PSEG Power reassessed its ARC and ARO assumptions related to its nuclear plants, as part of the triennial cost study update. As a result, PSEG Power decreased its ARC asset and ARO liability by $\n59\n million, primarily reflected by an increase in the probability the units would obtain additional license renewals, partially offset by increases in inflation rates and other costs.\n \n\n\nNote 12. Pension, Other Postretir\nement Benefits (OPEB) and Savings Plans\n \nPSEG sponsors and Services administers qualified and nonqualified pension plans and OPEB plans covering PSEG’s and its participating affiliates’ current and former employees who meet certain eligibility criteria. PSEG’s qualified pension plans consist of two qualified defined benefit pension plans, Pension Plan of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (Pension Plan I) and Pension Plan of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated II (Pension Plan II and, together, the Plans). Each of the qualified pension plans include a Final Average Pay and two Cash Balance components. In addition, represented and non-represented employees are eligible for participation in PSEG’s \ntwo\n defined contribution plans.\nPSEG and PSE&G are required to record the under or over funded positions of their defined benefit pension and OPEB plans on their respective balance sheets. Such funding positions are required to be measured as of the date of their respective year-end Consolidated Balance Sheets. For underfunded plans, the liability is equal to the difference between the plan’s benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. For defined benefit pension plans, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation. For OPEB plans, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. In addition, GAAP requires that the total unrecognized costs for defined benefit pension and OPEB plans be recorded as an after-tax charge to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), a separate component of Stockholders’ Equity. However, for PSE&G, because the amortization of the unrecognized costs is being collected from customers, the accumulated unrecognized costs are recorded as a Regulatory Asset. The unrecognized costs represent actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs which have not been expensed. The charge to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) and the Regulatory Asset for PSE&G are amortized and recorded as net periodic pension cost in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn July 2023, PSEG and Fiduciary Counselors Inc., as independent fiduciary of the Plans, entered into a commitment agreement (for a “lift-out”) with The Prudential Insurance Company of America (the Insurer) under which the Plans agreed to purchase a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract that has transferred to the Insurer approximately $\n1\n billion of the Plans’ defined benefit pension obligations and associated Plan assets related to certain pension benefits. The contract covers approximately \n2,000\n retirees from PSEG Power & Other, excluding Services (Participants). In August 2023, assets were transferred to the Insurer and the transaction was closed. Under the contract, the Insurer made an irrevocable commitment, and is solely responsible, to pay benefits of each Participant that are due on and after December 31, 2023. The transaction resulted in no changes to the amount of benefits payable to Participants.\nAmounts for Servco are not included in any of the following pension and OPEB benefit information for PSEG and its affiliates but rather are separately disclosed later in this note.\n\n\n112\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nThe following table provides a roll-forward of the changes in the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets during each of the two years in the periods ended \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023.

projected benefit obligation for pension benefits and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for other benefits. The vested benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled but based on the employee’s expected date of separation or retirement.\n \n(B)\nFor pension benefits and OPEB, the net actuarial gains\n in 2024 were due primarily to an increase in the discount rate, partially offset by actuarial losses driven by a lower than expected return on assets. For pension benefits, the net actuarial loss in 2023 was due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate. For OPEB, the net actuarial gain in 2023 was primarily due to assumption updates.\n(C)\nIncludes $\n107\n million ($\n76\n million, after-tax) and $\n143\n million ($\n102\n million, after-tax) in AOCL related to Pension and OPEB as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, respectively. Also includes Regulatory Assets of $\n1,227\n million, Deferred Assets of $\n134\n million and Deferred Liabilities of $\n9\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and Regulatory Assets of $\n1,427\n million and Deferred Assets of $\n141\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2023\n. The Regulatory Asset amounts do not include $\n103\n million and $\n55\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as a result of modifying the method for calculating pension expense for ratemaking purposes, approved by the BPU effective January 1, 2023.\nThe pension benefits table above provides information relating to the funded status of the qualified and nonqualified pension and OPEB plans on an aggregate basis. As of December 31, 2024\n, PSEG had funded approximately \n89\n% of its projected pension benefit obligation. This percentage does not include $\n165\n million of assets in the Rabbi Trust as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, \nwhich provide funding for the nonqualified pension plans and certain deferred compensation.

Assets\nThe investments of pension and OPEB plans are held in a trust account by the Trustee and consist of an undivided interest in an investment account of the Master Trust. The investments in the pension and OPEB plans are measured at fair value within a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to fair value measurements into three levels. See Note 17. Fair Value Measurements for more information on fair value guidance. Use of the Master Trust permits the commingling of pension plan assets and OPEB plan assets for investment and administrative purposes. Although assets of the plans are commingled in the Master Trust, the Trustee maintains supporting records for the purpose of allocating the net gain or loss of the investment account to the respective participating plans. The net investment income of the investment assets is allocated by the Trustee to each participating plan based on the relationship of the interest of each plan to the total of the interests of the participating plans. As of December 31, 2024\n, the pension plan interest and OPEB plan interest in such assets of the Master Trust were approximately \n90\n% and \n10\n%, respectively.\n \n\n\n115\n\n\n\n\nTable of

Collective Investment Fund publishes a daily net asset value (NAV) which participants may use for daily redemptions without restrictions (Level 1). \n\n\n116\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\n(B)\nCommon stocks are measured using observable data in active markets and considered Level 1. \n(C)\nCommingled Funds that publish daily NAV but with certain near-term redemption restrictions which prevent redemption at the published daily NAV are classified as Level 2.\n(D)\nDebt securities include mainly U.S. Treasury obligations. These investments are valued using an evaluated pricing approach that varies by asset class and reflects observable market information such as the most recent exchange price or quoted bid for similar securities. Market-based standard inputs typically include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes and issuer spreads or the most recent quotes for similar securities which are a Level 2 measure.\n(E)\nCertain commingled equity funds are not included in the fair value hierarchy as they are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient. These funds do not meet the definition of readily determinable fair value due to the frequency of publishing NAV (monthly). The objectives of these funds are mainly tracking the S&P Index or achieving long-term growth through investment in foreign equity securities and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index.\n(F)\nThe unlisted real estate fund invests in office, apartment, industrial and retail space. The fund is valued using the NAV per unit of funds. The investment value of the real estate properties is determined on a quarterly basis by independent market appraisers engaged by the board of directors of the fund. The ability to redeem funds is subject to the availability of cash arising from net investment income, allocations and the sale of investments in the normal course of business. The fund’s NAV is published quarterly. In addition, redemptions require one quarter advance notice prior to redemption and are fulfilled quarterly. The fund, therefore, does not meet the definition of readily determinable fair value. The purpose of the fund is to acquire, own, hold for investment and ultimately dispose of investments in real estate and real estate-related assets with the intention of achieving current income, capital appreciation or both.\n(G)\nExcludes net receivables of $\n6\n million and $\n2\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, respectively, which consist of interest, dividends and receivables and payables related to pending securities sales and purchases.

PSEG’s long-term target asset allocation of \n54\n% equities, \n18\n% real assets and \n28\n% fixed income is consistent with the funds’ financial objectives. Certain investments in real assets (\n13\n% as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n) are made through investing in equity securities and tracked as equities when reporting fair value; however, they are viewed by their asset class, real assets, in our target asset allocation. Derivative financial instruments are used by the plans’ investment managers primarily to adjust the fixed income duration of the portfolio and hedge the currency risk component of foreign investments. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was \n8.1\n% for \n2024\n and will remain at \n8.1\n% for 2025. This expected return includes a premium for active management.\nPlan Contributions\nPSEG plans to contribute $\n5\n million to its OPEB plan and may choose to contribute up to $\n100\n million to its pension plans in 2025. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) minimum funding requirements for pension plans are determined based on the fund’s assets and liabilities at the end of a calendar year for the subsequent calendar year.\n\n\n117\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\n \nThe following pension benefit and postretirement benefit payments are expected to be paid to plan participants.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nYear\n\n\n \n\n\nPension\nBenefits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOther\nBenefits\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n372\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n73\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n333\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n71\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n340\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n69\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n346\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n67\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n353\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n64\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2030-2034\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,792\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n272\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,536\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n616\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n401(k) Plans\n \nPSEG sponsors \ntwo\n 401(k) plans, which are defined contribution retirement plans subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).

The vested benefit obligation is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled but based on the employee’s expected date of separation or retirement.\n(B)\nFor pension benefits, the net actuarial gain in 2024 was due primarily to an increase in the discount rate. For OPEB,\n the net actuarial gain in 2024 was due primarily to an increase in the discount rate partially offset by other assumption updates. \nFor pension benefits and OPEB, the net actuarial losses in 2023 were due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate and other assumption updates.\n(C)\nAmounts equal to the accrued pension and OPEB costs of Servco are offset in Long-Term Receivable of VIE on PSEG’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPension and OPEB costs of Servco are accounted for according to the OSA. Servco recognizes expenses for contributions to its pension plan trusts and for OPEB payments made to retirees. Operating Revenues are recognized for the reimbursement of these costs. The pension-related revenues and costs for 2024\n, 2023 and 2022 were $\n25\n million, $\n18\n million and $\n30\n million, respectively. Servco has contributed its entire planned contribution amount to its pension plan trusts during \n2024\n.

Servco’s long-term target asset allocation of \n60\n% equities, \n15\n% real assets and \n25\n% fixed income is consistent with the funds’ financial objectives. Certain investments in real assets (\n15\n% at \nDecember 31, 2024\n) are made through investing in equity securities and tracked as equities when reporting fair value; however, they are viewed by their asset class, real assets, in our target asset allocation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was \n8.0\n% for \n2024\n and will be \n8.0\n% for 2025.

Eligible non-represented employees of Servco participate in the Long Island Electric Utility Servco LLC Incentive Thrift Plan I (Thrift Plan I), and eligible represented employees of Servco participate in the Long Island Electric Utility Servco LLC Incentive Thrift Plan II (Thrift Plan II). Participants in the plans may contribute up to \n50\n% of their eligible compensation to these plans, not to exceed the IRS maximums, including any catch-up contributions for those employees age 50 and above. Servco does not provide an employer match or core contribution for employees in Thrift Plan II. For employees in Thrift Plan I, Servco matches \n50\n% of such employee contributions up to \n8\n% of eligible compensation and provides core contributions (based on years of service and age) to employees who do not participate in Servco’s Retirement Income Plan. The amount expensed by Servco for employer matching contributions was $\n13\n million, $\n10\n million and $\n9\n million for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022\n. Pursuant to the OSA, Servco recognizes Operating Revenues for the reimbursement of these costs.\n\n\nNote 13. Commitments \nand Contingent Liabilities\nGuaranteed Obligations\nPSEG Power’s activities primarily involve the purchase and/or sale of energy, nuclear fuel and other related products under transportation, physical, financial and forward contracts at fixed and variable prices. These transactions are with numerous counterparties and brokers that may require cash, letters of credit or guarantees as a form of collateral.\nPSEG Power has unconditionally guaranteed payments to counterparties on behalf of its subsidiaries in commodity-related transactions in order to\n•\nsupport current exposure, interest and other costs on sums due and payable in the ordinary course of business, and\n•\nobtain credit.\nPSEG Power is subject to\n•\ncounterparty collateral calls related to commodity contracts of its subsidiaries, and\n•\ncertain creditworthiness standards as guarantor under performance guarantees of its subsidiaries.\nUnder these agreements, guarantees cover credit extended between entities and is often reciprocal in nature. The exposure between counterparties can move in either direction.\nIn order for PSEG Power to incur a liability for the face value of the outstanding guarantees,\n•\nits subsidiaries would have to fully utilize the credit granted to them by every counterparty to whom PSEG Power has provided a guarantee, and\n\n\n122\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\n•\nthe net position of the related contracts would have to be “out-of-the-money” (if the contracts are terminated, PSEG Power would owe money to the counterparties).\nPSEG Power believes the probability of this result is unlikely. For this reason, PSEG Power believes that the current exposure at any point in time is a more meaningful representation of the potential liability under these guarantees. Current exposure consists of the net of accounts receivable and accounts payable and the forward value on open positions, less any collateral posted.\nChanges in commodity prices can have a material impact on collateral requirements under such contracts, which are posted and received primarily in the form of cash and letters of credit.\n \nPSEG Power also routinely enters into futures and options transactions for electricity and natural gas as part of its operations. These futures contracts usually require a cash margin deposit with brokers, which can change based on market movement and in accordance with exchange rules.\nIn addition to the guarantees discussed above, PSEG Power has also provided payment guarantees to third parties and regulatory authorities on behalf of its affiliated companies. These guarantees support various other non-commodity related obligations.\nThe following table shows the face value of PSEG Power’s outstanding guarantees, current exposure and margin positions as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFace Value of Outstanding Guarantees\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,272\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,381\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nExposure under Current Guarantees\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n47\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n118\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLetters of Credit - Counterparty Margining Posted\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLetters of Credit - Counterparty Margining Received\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n24\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n91\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCash Deposited and Received\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCounterparty Cash Collateral Deposited\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCounterparty Cash Collateral Received\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n2\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Broker Balance Deposited (Received)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n245\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n115\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdditional Amounts Posted\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOther Letters of Credit\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n155\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n180\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nAs part of determining credit exposure, PSEG Power nets receivables and payables with the corresponding net fair values of energy contracts. See Note 16. Financial Risk Management Activities for further discussion. In accordance with PSEG’s accounting policy, where it is applicable, cash (received)/deposited is allocated against derivative asset and liability positions with the same counterparty on the face of the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining balances of net cash (received)/deposited after allocation are generally included in Accounts Payable and Receivable, respectively.\nIn addition to amounts for outstanding guarantees, current exposure and margin positions, PSEG and PSEG Power have posted letters of credit to support PSEG Power’s various other non-energy contractual and environmental obligations. See Other Letters of Credit in the preceding table.\nEnvironmental Matters\nPassaic River\nLower Passaic River Study Area\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that a 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River (Lower Passaic River Study Area (LPRSA)) in New Jersey is a “Superfund” site under the Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). PSE&G and certain of its predecessors conducted operations at properties in this area, including at \none\n site that was transferred to PSEG Power.\n\n\n123\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nThe EPA has announced two separate cleanup plans for the Lower 8.3 miles and Upper 9 miles of the LPRSA. The EPA’s plan for the Lower 8.3 miles involves dredging and capping sediments at an estimated cost of $\n2.3\n billion, and its plan for the Upper 9 miles involves dredging and capping sediments at an estimated cost of $\n550\n million. Additional cleanup work may be required depending on the results of these initial phases of work.\nOccidental Chemical Corporation (Occidental) has voluntarily completed the design of the cleanup plan for the Lower 8.3 miles and has received an EPA Unilateral Administrative Order directing it to design the cleanup plan for the Upper 9 miles. It has filed two lawsuits against PSE&G and others to attempt to recover costs associated with this work and to obtain a declaratory judgment of parties’ shares of any future costs. PSEG cannot predict the outcome of the litigation.\nThe EPA finalized and received court approval of a settlement with 82 parties who have agreed to pay $\n150\n million to resolve their LPRSA CERCLA liability, in whole or in part. PSE&G and PSEG Power are not included in the proposed settlement, but the EPA sent PSE&G, Occidental, and several other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) a letter in March 2022 inviting them to submit to the EPA individually or jointly an offer to fund or participate in the next stages of the remediation. PSEG submitted a good faith offer to the EPA in June 2022 on behalf of PSE&G and PSEG Power. PSEG understands that the EPA is evaluating its offer.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n, PSEG has approximately $\n66\n million accrued for this matter. PSE&G has an Environmental Costs Liability of $\n53\n million and a corresponding Regulatory Asset based on its continued ability to recover such costs in its rates. PSEG Power has an Environmental Costs Liability of $\n13\n million.\n \nThe outcome of this matter is uncertain, and until (i) a final remedy for the entire LPRSA is selected and an agreement is reached by the PRPs to fund it, (ii) PSE&G’s and PSEG Power’s respective shares of the costs are determined, and (iii) PSE&G’s ability to recover the costs in its rates is determined, it is not possible to predict this matter’s ultimate impact on PSEG’s financial statements. It is possible that PSE&G and PSEG Power will record additional costs beyond what they have accrued, and that such costs could be material, but PSEG cannot at the current time estimate the amount or range of any additional costs.\nNewark Bay Study Area\nThe EPA has established the Newark Bay Study Area, which is an extension of the LPRSA and includes Newark Bay and portions of surrounding waterways. The EPA has notified PSEG and \n21\n other PRPs of their potential liability. PSE&G and PSEG Power are unable to estimate their respective portions of any loss or possible range of loss related to this matter. In December 2018, PSEG Power completed the sale of the site of the Hudson electric generating station. PSEG Power contractually transferred all land rights and structures on the Hudson site to a third-party purchaser, along with the assumption of the environmental liabilities for the site.\nNatural Resource Damage Claims\nNew Jersey and certain federal regulators have alleged that PSE&G, PSEG Power and \n56\n other PRPs may be liable for natural resource damages within the LPRSA. In particular, PSE&G, PSEG Power and other PRPs received notice from federal regulators of the regulators’ intent to move forward with a series of studies assessing potential damages to natural resources at the Diamond Alkali Superfund site, which includes the LPRSA and the Newark Bay Study Area. PSE&G and PSEG Power are unable to estimate their respective portions of any possible loss or range of loss related to this matter.\nHackensack River\nIn 2022, the EPA announced it had designated approximately 23 river miles of the Lower Hackensack River as a federal Superfund site. PSE&G and certain of its predecessors conducted operations at properties in this area, including at the Hudson, Bergen and Kearny generating stations that were transferred to PSEG Power. PSEG Power subsequently contractually transferred all land rights and structures on the Hudson generating station site to a third-party purchaser, along with the assumption of the environmental liabilities for that site. In 2024, the EPA identified PSE&G and four other parties as PRPs for the site and requested that they voluntarily perform a technical study of a portion of the river designated as “Operable Unit 2.” The EPA estimates that the technical study will cost $\n55\n million to complete and PSE&G and PSEG Power have agreed to participate in the technical study. PSE&G and PSEG Power do not believe participation in the technical study will have a material impact on their results of operations and financial condition based upon EPA’s estimate of the study costs; however, future costs related to this matter could be material.\n \n\n\n124\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nMGP Remediation Program\nPSE&G is working with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) to assess, investigate and remediate environmental conditions at its former MGP sites. To date, 38 sites requiring some level of remedial action have been identified. Based on its current studies, PSE&G has determined that the estimated cost to remediate all MGP sites to completion could range between $\n210\n million and $\n234\n million on an undiscounted basis, including its $\n53\n million share for the Passaic River as discussed above. Since no amount within the range is considered to be most likely, PSE&G has recorded a liability of $\n210\n million as of\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n. Of this amount, $\n54\n million was recorded in Other Current Liabilities and $\n156\n million was reflected as \nEnvironmental Costs\n in Noncurrent Liabilities. PSE&G has recorded a $\n210\n million\n \nRegulatory Asset with respect to these costs. PSE&G periodically updates its studies taking into account any new regulations or new information which could impact future remediation costs and adjusts its recorded liability accordingly. PSE&G completed sampling in the Passaic River in 2020 to delineate coal tar from certain MGP sites that abut the Passaic River Superfund site. PSEG cannot determine at this time the magnitude of any impact on the Passaic River Superfund remedy.\nLegacy Environmental Obligations at Former Fossil Generating Sites\nPSEG Power has retained ownership of certain liabilities excluded from the 2022 sale of its fossil generation portfolio. These liabilities primarily relate to obligations under the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act (ISRA) and the Connecticut Transfer Act (CTA) to investigate and remediate PSEG Power’s two formerly owned generating station sites in Connecticut, and six formerly owned generating station sites in New Jersey. In addition, PSEG Power still owns two former generating station sites in New Jersey that triggered ISRA in 2015.\n \nPSEG Power is in the process of fulfilling its obligations under the New Jersey ISRA and the CTA to investigate these sites. It will require multiple years and comprehensive environmental sampling to understand the extent of and to carry out the required remediation. At this stage in the remediation process, the full remediation costs are not estimable, but given the number and operating history of the facilities in the portfolio, the full remediation costs will likely be material in the aggregate. The costs could potentially include costs for, among other things, excavating soil, implementation of institutional controls, and the construction, operation and maintenance of engineering controls.\nIn May 2024, the EPA finalized revisions to the coal combustion residuals rule (CCR Rule) which established new requirements for the investigation and, if necessary, the cleanup of certain types of coal ash placed at certain fossil generation station sites, including certain sites owned or formerly owned by PSEG Power. PSEG is in the process of investigating each of the sites that PSEG Power currently owns that are subject to the CCR Rule, as well as sites that were formerly owned that are subject to the CCR Rule where PSEG Power retained certain environmental obligations to investigate and, if necessary, remediate. PSEG is currently unable to estimate the impact of the CCR Rule, but it could have a material impact on PSEG’s business, results of operations and cash flows.\n \nClean Water Act (CWA) Section 316(b) Rule\n \nThe EPA’s CWA Section 316(b) rule establishes requirements for the design and operation of cooling water intake structures at existing power plants and industrial facilities with a design flow of more than two million gallons of water per day.\n \nIn June 2016, the NJDEP issued a final New Jersey Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit for Salem. In July 2016, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network (Riverkeeper) filed an administrative hearing request challenging certain conditions of the permit, including the NJDEP’s application of the 316(b) rule. In November 2024, Riverkeeper’s administrative hearing request was denied, though the denial is subject to review by the NJDEP Commissioner and appeal by Riverkeeper. If the Riverkeeper’s challenge is ultimately successful, PSEG Power may be required to incur additional costs to comply with the CWA. Potential cooling water and/or service water system modification costs could be material and could adversely impact the economic competitiveness of this facility.\n \nBGS, BGSS and ZECs\nEach year, PSE&G obtains its electric supply requirements through annual New Jersey BGS auctions for two categories of customers that choose not to purchase electric supply from third-party suppliers. The first category is residential and smaller commercial and industrial customers (BGS-Residential Small Commercial Pricing (RSCP)). The second category is larger customers that exceed a BPU-established load (kW) threshold (BGS-Commercial and Industrial Energy Pricing (CIEP)). Pursuant\n \n\n\n125\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nto applicable BPU rules, PSE&G enters into the Supplier Master Agreements with the winners of these RSCP and CIEP BGS auctions to purchase BGS for PSE&G’s load requirements. The winners of the RSCP and CIEP auctions are responsible for fulfilling all the requirements of a PJM load-serving entity including the provision of capacity, energy, ancillary services and any other services required by PJM. As such, prices set through these auctions are impacted by prices set in the PJM capacity auctions, which significantly increased for the 2025/2026 auction year. See Note 2. Revenues for additional information. BGS suppliers assume all volume risk and customer migration risk and must satisfy New Jersey’s renewable portfolio standards.\n \nThe BGS-CIEP auction is for a one-year supply period from June 1 to May 31 with the BGS-CIEP auction price measured in dollars per MW-day for capacity. The final price for the BGS-CIEP auction year commencing June 1, 2025 is $\n696.05\n per MW-day, replacing the BGS-CIEP auction year price ending May 31, 2025 of $\n378.21\n per MW-day. Energy for BGS-CIEP is priced at hourly PJM locational marginal prices for the contract period.\nPSE&G contracts for its anticipated BGS-RSCP load on a three-year rolling basis, whereby each year one-third of the load is procured for a three-year period. \nThe contract prices in dollars per MWh for the BGS-RSCP supply, as well as the approximate load, are as follows: \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAuction Year\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n36-Month Terms Ending\n\n\n \n\n\nMay 2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMay 2028\n\n\n \n\n\n(A)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLoad (MW)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,800\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,800\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,900\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,800\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n$ per MWh\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n76.30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n93.11\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n80.88\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n107.36\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(A)\nPrices set in the 2025 BGS auction will become effective on June 1, 2025 when the 2022 BGS auction agreements expire.\nPSE&G has a full-requirements contract with PSEG Power to meet the gas supply requirements of PSE&G’s gas customers. PSEG Power has entered into hedges for a portion of these anticipated BGSS obligations, as permitted by the BPU. The BPU permits PSE&G to recover the cost of gas hedging up to \n115\n billion cubic feet or \n80\n% of its residential gas supply annual requirements through the BGSS tariff. Current plans call for PSEG Power to hedge on behalf of PSE&G approximately \n70\n billion cubic feet or \n50\n% of its residential gas supply annual requirements. For additional information, see Note 24. Related-Party Transactions.\nPursuant to a process established by the BPU, New Jersey EDCs, including PSE&G, are required to purchase ZECs from eligible nuclear plants selected by the BPU. In April 2021, PSEG Power’s Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants were awarded ZECs for the three-year eligibility period from June 2022 through May 2025. PSE&G has implemented a tariff to collect a non-bypassable distribution charge in the amount of $\n0.004\n per KWh from its retail distribution customers to be used to purchase the ZECs from these plants. PSE&G will purchase the ZECs on a monthly basis with payment to be made annually following completion of each energy year.\n \nMinimum Fuel Purchase Requirements\nPSEG Power’s nuclear fuel strategy is to maintain certain levels of uranium and to make periodic purchases to support such levels. As such, the commitments referred to in the following table may include estimated quantities to be purchased that deviate from contractual nominal quantities. PSEG Power’s minimum nuclear fuel commitments cover approximately \n100\n% of its estimated uranium, enrichment and fabrication requirements through 2027 and a significant portion through 2028 at Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom.\n \nPSEG Power has various multi-year contracts for natural gas and firm transportation and storage capacity for natural gas that are primarily used to meet its obligations to PSE&G.\n \n\n\n126\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024, the total minimum purchase requirements included in these commitments were as follows:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFuel Type\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG\nPower’s\nShare of\nCommitments\nthrough 2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNuclear Fuel\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Uranium\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n442\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Enrichment\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n357\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n  Fabrication\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n227\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNatural Gas\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,406\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nFERC Matters\n \nFERC has been conducting a non-public investigation of the Roseland-Pleasant Valley (RPV) transmission project. In December 2024, FERC approved an agreement between PSE&G and FERC Enforcement Staff resolving its investigation.  The agreement includes a $\n6.6\n million civil penalty and the implementation of certain compliance requirements, in addition to the process improvements that PSE&G has already implemented. It also includes a statement that nothing in the agreement reflects a challenge by FERC Enforcement to the end-of-life determination relative to the project and that no disgorgement has been sought. In a December 2024 proceeding related to PJM’s annual cost allocation filing, an intervenor raised an objection related to the recovery of costs for the RPV project. FERC issued an order declining to take action with respect to the intervenor’s objection. PSEG cannot predict whether there will be objections raised in other forums.\n \nBPU Audit of PSE&G\nIn 2020, the BPU ordered the commencement of a comprehensive affiliate and management audit of PSE&G. It has been more than ten years since the BPU last conducted a management and affiliate audit of this kind of PSE&G, which is initiated periodically as required by New Jersey statutes/regulations. Phase 1 of the audit reviews affiliate relations and cost allocation between PSE&G and its affiliates, including an analysis of the relationship between PSE&G and PSEG Energy Resources & Trade, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG Power over the past ten years, and between PSE&G and PSEG LI. Phase 2 is a comprehensive management audit, which addresses, among other things, executive management, corporate governance, system operations, human resources, cyber security, compliance with customer protection requirements and customer safety. The audit officially began in late May 2021. The BPU Audit Staff submitted the final audit report to the BPU in June 2023. The BPU is currently considering public comments on the audit report and has not yet determined which audit recommendations it will require PSE&G to implement. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of this matter.\n \nLitigation\nSewaren 7 Construction\nIn June 2018, a complaint was filed in federal court in Newark, New Jersey against PSEG Fossil LLC, which at the time was a wholly owned subsidiary of PSEG Power, regarding an ongoing dispute with Durr Mechanical Construction, Inc. (Durr), a contractor on the Sewaren 7 project. Among other things, Durr sought damages of $\n93\n million and alleges that PSEG Power withheld money owed to Durr and that PSEG Power’s intentional conduct led to the inability of Durr to obtain prospective contracts. PSEG Power intends to vigorously defend against these allegations. In January 2021, the court partially granted PSEG Power’s motion to dismiss certain claims, reducing the amount claimed to $\n68\n million. In December 2018, Durr filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the federal court in the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The SDNY bankruptcy court has allowed the New Jersey litigation to proceed. PSEG Power has accrued an amount related to outstanding invoices which does not reflect an assessment of claims and potential counterclaims in this matter. At this time, PSEG Power cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n \n\n\n127\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nOther Litigation and Legal Proceedings\nPSEG and its subsidiaries are party to various lawsuits in the ordinary course of business. In view of the inherent difficulty in predicting the outcome of such matters, PSEG and PSE&G generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or the eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, a liability is accrued when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. PSEG will continue to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established.\nBased on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, other than the matters described herein, could have a material adverse effect on PSEG’s or PSE&G’s consolidated financial position or liquidity. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond PSEG’s control, and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to PSEG’s or PSE&G’s results of operations or liquidity for any particular reporting period.\nNuclear Insurance Coverages and Assessments\nPSEG Power is a member of the joint underwriting association, American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), which provides nuclear liability insurance coverage at the Salem and Hope Creek site and the Peach Bottom site. The ANI policies are designed to satisfy the financial protection requirements outlined in the Price-Anderson Act, which sets the limit of liability for claims that could arise from an incident involving any licensed nuclear facility in the United States. The limit of liability per incident per site is composed of primary and excess layers. As of December 31, 2024\n, nuclear sites were required to purchase $\n500\n million of primary liability coverage for each site through ANI. The primary layer is supplemented by an excess layer, which is an industry self-insurance pool. In the event a nuclear site, which is part of the industry self-insurance pool, has a claim that exceeds the primary layer, each licensee would be assessed a prorated share of the excess layer. The excess layer limit is $\n15.8\n billion. PSEG Power’s maximum aggregate assessment per incident is $\n522\n million based on PSEG Power’s ownership interests in Salem, Hope Creek and Peach Bottom and its maximum aggregate annual assessment per incident is $\n78\n million. If the damages exceed the limit of liability, Congress could impose further revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims. Further, a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, not involving PSEG Power, held that the Price-Anderson Act did not preclude punitive damage awards based on state law claims.\nPSEG Power is also a member of an industry mutual insurance company, Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), which provides the property, decontamination and decommissioning liability insurance at the Salem and Hope Creek site and the Peach Bottom site. NEIL also provides replacement power coverage through its accidental outage policy. NEIL policies may make retrospective premium assessments in the case of adverse loss experience. The current maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligation for PSEG Power is approximately $\n52\n million. NEIL requires its members to maintain an investment grade credit rating or to ensure collectability of their annual retrospective premium obligation by providing a financial guarantee, letter of credit, deposit premium, or some other means of assurance. Certain provisions in the NEIL policies provide that the insurer may suspend coverage with respect to all nuclear units on a site without notice if the NRC suspends or revokes the operating license for any unit on that site, issues a shutdown order with respect to such unit or issues a confirmatory order keeping such unit down.\nThe ANI and NEIL policies all include coverage for claims arising out of acts of terrorism. However, NEIL policies are subject to an industry aggregate limit of $\n3.24\n billion plus such additional amounts as NEIL recovers for such losses from reinsurance, indemnity and any other source applicable to such losses.\n\n\n128\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nNote 14.

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nShort-Term Liquidity\nPSEG meets its short-term liquidity requirements, as well as those of PSEG Power, primarily through the issuance of commercial paper and, from time to time, short-term loans. PSE&G maintains its own separate commercial paper program to meet its short-term liquidity requirements. Each commercial paper program is fully back-stopped by its own separate credit facility.\nThe commitments under the $\n3.8\n billion credit facilities are provided by a diverse bank group. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the total available credit capacity was $\n2.5\n billion.\nAs of December 31, 2024\n, no single institution represented more than \n9\n% of the total commitments in the credit facilities.\nAs of December 31, 2024, PSEG’s liquidity position, including credit facilities and access to external financing, was expected to be sufficient to meet its projected stressed requirements over a 12-month planning horizon.\n \nEach of the credit facilities is restricted as to availability and use to the specific companies as listed in the following table; however, if necessary, the PSEG facilities can also be used to support its subsidiaries’ liquidity needs.\n \nThe total committed credit facilities and available liquidity as of \nDecember 31, 2024 were as follows:\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompany/Facility\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\nFacility\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nUsage (B)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAvailable\nLiquidity\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nExpiration\nDate\n\n\n \n\n\nPrimary Purpose\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMillions\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRevolving Credit Facility (A)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n764\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n736\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMar 2028\n\n\n \n\n\nCommercial Paper Support/Funding/Letters of Credit\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal PSEG\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n764\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n736\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSE&G\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRevolving Credit Facility\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n468\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n532\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMar 2028\n\n\n \n\n\nCommercial Paper Support/Funding/Letters of Credit\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal PSE&G\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n468\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n532\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPSEG Power\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRevolving Credit Facility (A)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,250\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n37\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,213\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMar 2028\n\n\n \n\n\nFunding/Letters of Credit\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nLetter of Credit Facility\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nApr 2026\n\n\n \n\n\nLetters of Credit\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal PSEG Power\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,325\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n82\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,243\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nTotal (C)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,825\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,314\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,511\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(A)\nMaster Credit Facility with sub-limits of $\n1.5\n billion for PSEG and $\n1.25\n billion for PSEG Power; sub-limits can be adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Master Credit Facility agreement.

Financial Risk M\nanagement Activities\n \nDerivative accounting guidance requires that a derivative instrument be recognized as either an asset or a liability at fair value, with changes in fair value of the derivative recognized in earnings each period. Other accounting treatments are available through special election and designation provided that the derivative instrument meets specific, restrictive criteria, both at the time of designation and on an ongoing basis. These alternative permissible treatments include NPNS cash flow hedge and fair value hedge accounting. PSEG uses interest rate swaps and other derivatives, which are designated and qualifying as cash flow or fair value hedges. PSEG Power enters into additional contracts that are derivatives, but are not designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. These transactions are economic hedges and are recorded at fair market value with changes recognized in earnings.\nCommodity Prices\nWithin PSEG and its affiliate companies, PSEG Power has the most exposure to commodity price risk. PSEG Power is exposed to commodity price risk primarily relating to changes in the market price of electricity, natural gas and other commodities. Fluctuations in market prices result from changes in supply and demand, fuel costs, market conditions, weather, state and federal regulatory policies, environmental policies, transmission availability and other factors. PSEG Power uses a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments, such as financial options, futures and swaps to manage the exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and optimize the value of PSEG Power’s expected generation. PSEG Power also uses derivatives to hedge a portion of its anticipated BGSS obligations with PSE&G. For additional information see Note 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.\n \nInterest Rates\nPSEG, PSE&G and PSEG Power are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Exposure to this risk is managed by targeting a balanced debt maturity profile which limits refinancing in any given period or interest rate environment. PSEG and PSEG Power may use a mix of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate hedges.\nCash Flow Hedges\nPSEG uses interest rate hedges which are designated and effective as cash flow hedges, to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows, primarily related to variable-rate debt instruments or anticipated future long-term debt issuances.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n, PSEG had interest rate hedges outstanding through March 2025 which were executed to convert to fixed PSEG Power’s $\n1.25\n billion variable rate term loan due June 2025. The fair value of these hedges was immaterial and $\n5\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n, PSEG also had interest rate hedges outstanding to fix the interest rate portion of anticipated 2025 debt issuances for PSEG and PSEG Power. These interest rate hedges had a fair value of $\n32\n million as of December 31, 2024.\n \nThe Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (after tax) related to outstanding and terminated interest rate hedges designated as cash flow hedges was $\n36\n million and $\n3\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023\n, respectively. The after-tax unrealized gains on these hedges expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next 12 months are $\n2\n million.\nFair Values of Derivative Instruments\nThe following are the fair values of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The following tables also include disclosures for offsetting derivative assets and liabilities which are subject to a master netting or similar agreement. In general, the terms of the agreements provide that in the event of an early termination the counterparties have the right to offset amounts owed or owing under that and any other agreement with the same counterparty. Accordingly, and in accordance with PSEG’s accounting policy, these positions are offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of PSEG. For additional information see Note 17. Fair Value Measurements.\n \n\n\n134\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nSubstantially all derivative instruments are contracts subject to master netting agreements. Contracts not subject to master netting or similar agreements are immaterial and did not have any collateral posted or received as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty (where the right of offset exists) and the application of cash collateral. All cash collateral (received) posted that has been allocated to derivative positions, where the right of offset exists, has been offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, PSEG Power had net cash collateral payments to counterparties of $\n244\n million and $\n113\n million, respectively. Of these net cash collateral (receipts) payments, $\n121\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and $\n22\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2023\n were netted against the corresponding net derivative contract positions. Of the $\n121\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, $\n73\n million was netted against current liabilities and $\n48\n million was netted against noncurrent liabilities. Of the $\n22\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2023\n, $(\n1\n) million was netted against current assets, $\n15\n million against current liabilities and $\n8\n million against noncurrent liabilities.\nCertain of PSEG Power’s derivative instruments contain provisions that require PSEG Power to post collateral. This collateral may be posted in the form of cash or credit support with thresholds contingent upon PSEG Power’s credit rating from each of the major\n \n\n\n135\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\ncredit rating agencies. The collateral and credit support requirements vary by contract and by counterparty. These credit risk-related contingent features stipulate that if PSEG Power were to be downgraded to a below investment grade rating by S&P or Moody’s, it would be required to provide additional collateral. A below investment grade credit rating for PSEG Power would represent a two level downgrade from its current Moody’s and S&P ratings. This incremental collateral requirement can offset collateral requirements related to other derivative instruments that are assets with the same counterparty, where the contractual right of offset exists under applicable master agreements. PSEG Power may also enter into commodity transactions on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). The NYMEX and ICE clearing houses act as counterparties to each trade. Transactions on the NYMEX and ICE must adhere to comprehensive collateral and margin requirements.\nThe aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features in a liability position that are not fully collateralized (excluding transactions on the NYMEX and ICE that are fully collateralized) was $\n17\n million and $\n77\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

PSEG has established credit policies that it believes significantly minimize credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of potential counterparties’ financial condition (including credit rating), collateral requirements under certain circumstances and the use of standardized agreements, which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty. In the event of non-performance or non-payment by a major counterparty, there may be a material adverse impact on PSEG’s financial condition, results of operations or net cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2024\n, more than \n95\n% of the net credit exposure for PSEG Power’s wholesale operations was with investment grade counterparties. There were two counterparties with credit exposure greater than \n10\n% of the total. This credit exposure was with PSE&G and one non-affiliated counterparty. The PSE&G credit exposure is eliminated in consolidation. See Note 24. Related-Party Transactions for additional information.\nPSE&G’s supplier master agreements are approved by the BPU and govern the terms of its electric supply procurement contracts. These agreements define a supplier’s performance assurance requirements and allow a supplier to meet its credit requirements with a certain amount of unsecured credit. The amount of unsecured credit is determined based on the supplier’s credit ratings from the major credit rating agencies and the supplier’s tangible net worth. The credit position is based on the initial market price, which is the forward price of energy on the day the procurement transaction is executed, compared to the forward price curve for energy on the valuation day. To the extent that the forward price curve for energy exceeds the initial market price, the supplier is required to post a parental guarantee or other security instrument such as a letter of credit or cash, as collateral to the extent the credit exposure is greater than the supplier’s unsecured credit limit. As of December 31, 2024, PSEG held parental guarantees, letters of credit and cash as security. PSE&G’s BGS suppliers’ credit exposure is calculated each business day. As of December 31, 2024\n, PSE&G had \nno\n unsecured mark-to-market credit exposure with its suppliers.\n \nPSE&G is permitted to recover its costs of procuring energy through the BPU-approved BGS tariffs. PSE&G’s counterparty credit risk is mitigated by its ability to recover realized energy costs through customer rates.\n\n\n137\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nNote 17. Fair V\nalue Measurements\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Accounting guidance for fair value measurement emphasizes that fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement, and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between assumptions based on market data obtained from independent sources and those based on an entity’s own assumptions. The hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to fair value measurement into three levels:\nLevel 1—measurements utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that PSEG and PSE&G have the ability to access. These consist primarily of listed equity securities and money market mutual funds, as well as natural gas futures contracts executed on an exchange.\nLevel 2—measurements include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and other observable inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. These consist primarily of exchange and non-exchange traded derivatives such as futures or forward contracts or options and most fixed income securities.\nLevel 3—measurements use unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities, based on the best information available and might include an entity’s own data and assumptions. In some valuations, the inputs used may fall into different levels of the hierarchy. In these cases, the financial instrument’s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. These consist primarily of certain electric load contracts.\n \nCertain derivative transactions may transfer from Level 2 to Level 3 if inputs become unobservable and internal modeling techniques are employed to determine fair value. Conversely, measurements may transfer from Level 3 to Level 2 if the inputs become observable.\n\n\n138\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nThe following tables present information about PSEG’s and PSE&G’s respective assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of \nDecember 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, including the fair value measurements and the levels of inputs used in determining those fair values.

money market mutual funds.\n \n(B)\nLevel 1—These contracts represent natural gas futures contracts executed on an exchange, and are being valued solely on settled pricing inputs which come directly from the exchange.\nLevel 2—Fair values for energy-related contracts are obtained primarily using a market-based approach. Most derivative contracts (forward purchase or sale contracts and swaps) are valued using settled prices from similar assets and liabilities from an exchange, such as NYMEX, ICE and Nodal Exchange, or auction prices. Prices used in the valuation process are also corroborated independently by management to determine that values are based on actual transaction data or, in the absence of transactions, bid and offers for the day. Examples may include certain exchange and non-exchange traded capacity and electricity contracts and natural gas physical or swap contracts based on market prices, basis adjustments and other premiums where adjustments and premiums are not considered significant to the overall inputs.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs are used for the valuation of certain contracts. See “Additional Information Regarding Level 3 Measurements” for more information on the utilization of unobservable inputs.\n(C)\nInterest rate derivatives are valued using quoted prices on commonly quoted intervals, which are interpolated for periods different than the quoted intervals, as inputs to a market valuation model. Market inputs can generally be verified and model selection does not involve significant management judgment.\n\n\n140\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\n(D)\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the fair value measurement table excludes cash and foreign currency of $\n24\n million and $\n1\n million, respectively, in the NDT Fund. \nAs of December 31, 2023, \nthe fair value measurement table excludes foreign currency of $\n1\n million in the NDT Fund. The NDT Fund maintains investments in various equity and fixed income securities. The Rabbi Trust maintains investments in a Russell 3000 index fund and various fixed income securities. These securities are generally valued with prices that are either exchange provided (equity securities) or market transactions for comparable securities and/or broker quotes (fixed income securities).\nLevel 1—Investments in marketable equity securities within the NDT Fund are primarily investments in common stocks across a broad range of industries and sectors. Most equity securities are priced utilizing the principal market close price or, in some cases, midpoint, bid or ask price. Certain other equity securities in the NDT and Rabbi Trust Funds consist primarily of investments in money market funds which seek a high level of current income as is consistent with the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity. To pursue its goals, the funds normally invest in diversified portfolios of high quality, short-term, dollar-denominated debt securities and government securities. The funds’ net asset value is priced and published daily. The Rabbi Trust’s Russell 3000 index fund is valued based on quoted prices in an active market and can be redeemed daily without restriction.\nLevel 2—NDT and Rabbi Trust fixed income securities include investment grade corporate bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations, asset-backed securities and certain government and U.S. Treasury obligations or Federal Agency asset-backed securities and municipal bonds with a wide range of maturities. Since many fixed income securities do not trade on a daily basis, they are priced using an evaluated pricing methodology that varies by asset class and reflects observable market information such as the most recent exchange price or quoted bid for similar securities. Market-based standard inputs typically include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes and issuer spreads. Certain short-term investments are valued using observable market prices or market parameters such as time-to-maturity, coupon rate, quality rating and current yield.\n(E)\nRepresents the netting of fair value balances with the same counterparty (where the right of offset exists) and the application of collateral. See Note 16. Financial Risk Management Activities for additional detail.\nAdditional Information Regarding Level 3 Measurements\nFor valuations that include both observable and unobservable inputs, if the unobservable input is determined to be significant to the overall inputs, the entire valuation is categorized in Level 3. This includes derivatives valued using indicative price quotations for contracts with tenors that extend into periods with no observable pricing. In instances where observable data is unavailable, consideration is given to the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability. This includes assumptions about market risks such as liquidity, volatility and contract duration. Such instruments are categorized in Level 3 because the model inputs generally are not observable. PSEG considers credit and non-performance risk in the valuation of derivative contracts categorized in Levels 2 and 3, including both historical and current market data, in its assessment of credit and non-performance risk by counterparty. The impacts of credit and non-performance risk were not material to the financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2024\n, PSEG carried $\n3.0\n billion of net assets that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis, of which $\n1\n million of liabilities were measured using unobservable inputs and classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy and are considered immaterial.\n \nAs of December 31, 2023\n, PSEG carried $\n2.8\n billion of net assets that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis, of which $\n2\n million of net liabilities were measured using unobservable inputs and classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy and are considered immaterial.\nThere were no transfers in 2024 and 2023\n to or from Level 3.\n\n\nNote 18. Stock Bas\ned Compensation\n \nPSEG’s 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2021 LTIP), approved by shareholders on April 20, 2021 and the Amended and Restated 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan ((2004 LTIP) under which no new grants have been made effective April 20, 2021), are\n \n\n\n141\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nbroad-based equity compensation programs that provide for grants of various long-term incentive compensation awards, such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance share units (PSUs), restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), cash awards or any combination thereof. The types of long-term incentive awards that have been granted under the LTIP are non-qualified options to purchase shares of PSEG’s common stock, restricted stock unit awards and performance share unit awards. The type of equity award that is granted and the details of that award may vary from time to time and is subject to the approval of the Organization and Compensation Committee of PSEG’s Board of Directors (O&CC), the LTIP’s administrative committee.\n \nThe 2021 LTIP currently provides for the issuance of equity awards with respect to \n8\n million shares of common stock. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, approximately \n6\n million shares were available for future awards under the 2021 LTIP.\nIn addition, on April 20, 2021 shareholders approved the PSEG 2021 Equity Compensation Plan for Outside Directors (2021 BOD Plan) and the PSEG 2007 Equity Compensation Plan for Outside Directors (2007 BOD Plan) was closed to new awards.\n \nUnder the 2021 BOD Plan, the only equity instrument which may be granted are RSUs and the Board member must defer the award until they have achieved their stock ownership requirement.\n \nStock Options\n \nUnder the 2021 LTIP, non-qualified options to acquire shares of PSEG common stock may be granted to officers and other key employees selected by the O&CC. No options have been granted since 2009.\n \nRSUs\nUnder both the 2021 LTIP and 2004 LTIP (LTIPs), PSEG has granted RSU awards to officers and other key employees. These awards, which are bookkeeping entries only, are subject to risk of forfeiture until vested by continued employment. Until distributed, the units are credited with dividend equivalent units (DEUs) proportionate to the dividends paid on PSEG common stock. Distributions are made in shares of common stock. The RSU grants for 2024 have a \n3-year\n graded vesting (1/3 per year) starting from the grant date and 2023 cliff vest at the end of \nthree years\n. Vesting may be accelerated (pro-rated basis or full vesting) upon certain events such as change-in-control, retirement, disability or death.\n \nPSUs\nUnder the LTIPs, PSEG has granted PSUs to officers and other key employees. These provide for distribution in shares of PSEG common stock based on achievement of certain goals over a performance period of \nthree years\n. Following the end of the performance period, the payout varies from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of the number of PSUs granted depending on PSEG’s performance with respect to those goals. The PSUs are credited with DEUs proportionate to the dividends paid on PSEG common stock. Distributions are made in shares of common stock. Vesting may be accelerated on a pro-rated basis for the period of the employee’s service during the performance period as a result of certain events, such as change-in-control, retirement, death or disability.\n \nStock-Based Compensation\nPSEG recognizes compensation expense for RSUs over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value of the shares, which is equal to the closing market price of PSEG’s common stock on the date of the grant.\n \nPSEG recognizes compensation expense for the total shareholder return (TSR) target for its PSU awards based on the grant date fair values of the award, which are determined using the Monte Carlo model. \nThe following table provides the assumptions used to calculate the grant date fair value of the TSR portion of the PSU awards for \n2024, 2023 and 2022:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGrant Date\n\n\n \n\n\nRisk-Free\nInterest Rate\n\n\n \n\n\nVolatility\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n4.35\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n20.32\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFebruary 14, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n4.24\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n25.09\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFebruary 15, 2022\n\n\n \n\n\n1.76\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n27.34\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n142\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nThe accrual of compensation cost is based on the probable achievement of the performance conditions, which result in a payout from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of the initial grant.

deferred tax effect of certain assets and liabilities is presented in the table above net of the deferred tax effect associated with the respective regulatory deferrals.\n \nPSEG and PSE&G each provide deferred taxes at the enacted statutory tax rate for all temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities irrespective of the treatment for rate-making purposes. Management believes that it is probable that the accumulated tax benefits that previously have been treated as a flow-through item to PSE&G customers will be recovered from or refunded to PSE&G’s customers in the future. See Note 6. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities.\n \nThe 2018 decrease in the federal tax rate resulted in PSE&G recording excess deferred income taxes. As of December 31, 2024\n, the remaining balance of excess deferred income taxes is all protected and was approximately $\n1.3\n billion with a Regulatory Liability of approximately $\n1.8\n billion. In 2024, PSE&G returned approximately $\n202\n million of excess deferred income taxes and previously realized and current period deferred income taxes related to tax repair deductions to its customers with a reduction to tax expense of approximately $\n145\n million. The flowback to customers of the excess deferred income taxes and previously realized tax repair deductions resulted in a decrease of approximately $\n122\n million in the Regulatory Liability. The current period tax repair deduction reduces tax expense and revenue and recognizes a Regulatory Asset as PSE&G believes it is probable that the current period tax repair deductions flowed through to the customers will be recovered from customers in the future. See Note 6. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities for additional information.\n \nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA enacted a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT), which is based on adjusted financial statement income, effective in 2023, and made certain changes to existing energy tax credit laws.\n \n\n\n149\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n\n\nPSEG has determined that it is not subject to the CAMT for 2023 and 2024 as it is not an applicable corporation in accordance with the statute. In September 2024, the U.S. Treasury issued proposed CAMT regulations on which taxpayers are not required to rely. The proposed CAMT regulations and certain relevant rules remain unclear and require further guidance. As such, the impact of the CAMT on PSEG’s and PSE&G’s financial statements is subject to continued evaluation.\nThe IRA established a new PTC for existing qualified nuclear generation facilities, effective 2024 through 2032, a new technology neutral energy tax credit, inclusive of both new nuclear units and increases to nuclear generation capacity, effective 2025, and the transferability of energy tax credits, effective 2023. The PTC for a given nuclear facility can be multiplied by five if prevailing wage requirements are met, and the value of the PTC is designed to phase down as the facility’s gross receipts increase. Both the PTC rate and reduction amount are subject to the Internal Revenue Service’s determination of annual inflation.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, PSEG recorded an income tax benefit associated with PTCs of approximately $\n350\n million. PSEG also recorded an $\n89\n million unrecognized tax benefit, which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized, since the PTCs recorded constitute an uncertain tax position and are subject to change when authoritative guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury, particularly related to the definition of \"gross receipts\".  Such guidance could result in a material increase or decrease in the net PTC recorded. Further, ZEC revenue has been reduced by the estimated PTCs generated from PSEG Power’s Salem 1, Salem 2, and Hope Creek nuclear plants for the year ended December 31, 2024. ZEC revenue will be adjusted based upon the actual value of the PTCs generated. See Note 2. Revenues for additional information.\n \nDespite the issuance of proposed regulations and various Notices that provide interim guidance on numerous provisions of the IRA, many aspects of the IRA, including the PTCs and the CAMT, remain unclear and are in need of further guidance; therefore, the impact of several provisions of the IRA will have on PSEG's and PSE&G's financial statements is subject to continued evaluation.\nThe enactment of additional federal or state tax legislation and clarification of previously enacted tax laws could impact PSEG’s and PSE&G’s financial statements.\n \nIn April 2023, the U.S. Treasury issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15 that provides a safe harbor method of accounting to determine the annual repair tax deduction for gas T&D property. The impact, if any, this may have on PSEG and PSE&G’s financial statements is subject to continued evaluation and has not yet been determined.\nAs of December 31, 2024\n, PSEG had a $\n26\n million state NOL and PSE&G had a $\n108\n million New Jersey Corporate Business Tax NOL that are both expected to be fully realized in the future.\n \nPSEG recorded the following amounts related to its unrecognized tax benefits, which were primarily comprised of amounts recorded for PSE&G and PSEG’s other

Earnings Per Share (\nEPS) and Dividends\nEPS\nBasic EPS is calculated by dividing Net Income (Loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing Net Income (Loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding, plus dilutive potential shares related to PSEG’s stock based compensation.

Financial Infor\nmation by Business Segment\nBasis of Organization\nPSEG’s and PSE&G’s operating segments were determined by management in accordance with GAAP. These segments were determined based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) (the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for PSEG and PSE&G), measures performance based on segment Net Income. The CODM uses Net Income for each segment in the annual budget and forecasting process. The CODM considers budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each segment.\n \nBased on management’s analysis, PSE&G and PSEG Power were determined to be operating segments of PSEG. The operating segments were determined based on the nature of regulated and unregulated operations and services provided by the respective segments. As discussed below, PSEG's reportable segments are PSE&G and PSEG Power & Other, which includes amounts related to the PSEG Power operating segment as well as amounts applicable to Energy Holdings, PSEG LI, PSEG (parent corporation) and Services, which do not meet the definition of operating segments individually or in the aggregate and are immaterial to PSEG’s consolidated assets and results.\n \nPSE&G\nThe PSE&G reportable segment earns revenues from its tariffs, under which it provides electric transmission and electric and gas distribution services to residential, commercial and industrial customers in New Jersey. The rates charged for electric transmission are regulated by FERC while the rates charged for electric and gas distribution are regulated by the BPU. Revenues are also earned from several other activities such as investments in EE equipment on customers’ premises, solar investments, the appliance service business and other miscellaneous services.\nPSEG Power & Other\nThis reportable segment is comprised primarily of PSEG Power which earns revenues primarily by selling energy and capacity into the markets for these products. PSEG Power also enters into bilateral contracts for energy, gas and other energy-related contracts to optimize the value of its portfolio of generating assets and its gas supply obligations. PSEG Power’s Salem 1, Salem 2 and Hope Creek nuclear plants receive ZEC revenue from the EDCs in New Jersey including PSE&G.\nThis reportable segment also includes amounts applicable to PSEG LI, which generates revenues under its contract with LIPA, primarily for the recovery of costs when Servco is a principal in the transaction (see Note 4. Variable Interest Entity for additional information) as well as fixed and variable fee components under the contract, and Energy Holdings which holds an immaterial portfolio of remaining lease investments. Other also includes amounts applicable to PSEG (parent corporation) and Services.\n \n\n\n155\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return, except for certain tax attributes and state apportionment results. If the result is a net tax liability, such amount shall be paid to PSEG. If there are NOLs and/or tax credits, the subsidiary shall receive payment for the tax savings from PSEG to the extent that PSEG is able to utilize those benefits.\n(D)\nPSE&G has advanced working capital to Services.

CONTROL\nS AND PROCEDURES\n\n\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\n\n\nPSEG and PSE&G\n \n\n\nWe have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported and is accumulated and communicated to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of each respective company, as appropriate, by others within the entities to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We have established a disclosure committee which includes several key management employees and which reports directly to the CFO and CEO of each of PSEG and PSE&G. The committee monitors and evaluates the effectiveness of these disclosure controls and procedures. The CFO and CEO of each of PSEG and PSE&G have evaluated the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures and, based on this evaluation, have concluded that disclosure controls and procedures at each respective company were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of the end of the period covered by the report.\n\n\nInternal Controls\n\n\nPSEG and PSE&G\n \n\n\nWe have conducted assessments of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, using the framework promulgated by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as “COSO.” Managements’ reports on PSEG’s and PSE&G’s internal control over financial reporting are included on pages 160 and 161, respectively. The Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm’s report with respect to the effectiveness of PSEG’s internal control over financial reporting is included on page 162. Management has concluded that internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\nWe continually review our disclosure controls and procedures and make changes, as necessary, to ensure the quality of our financial reporting. There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, each registrant’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\nITEM 9B.

As defined by the SEC in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and implemented by the company’s management and other personnel, with oversight by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (generally accepted accounting principles).\n\n\nPSEG’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of PSEG’s assets; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of PSEG are being made only in accordance with authorizations of PSEG’s management and directors; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of PSEG’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nIn connection with the preparation of PSEG’s annual financial statements, management of PSEG has undertaken an assessment, which includes the design and operational effectiveness of PSEG’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in the \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, commonly referred to as “COSO”. The COSO framework is based upon five integrated components of control: control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and communications and ongoing monitoring.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projection of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods is subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\nBased on the assessment performed, management has concluded that PSEG’s internal control over financial reporting is effective and provides reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of PSEG’s financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements as of December 31, 2024 in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Further, management has not identified any material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\nPSEG’s external auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, have audited PSEG’s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024 included in this annual report on Form 10-K and, as part of that audit, have issued a report on the effectiveness of PSEG’s internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which is included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/s/ RALPH A.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\n\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and the consolidated financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(B)(a) as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n \n\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting - PSEG. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB\n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n \n\n\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\n\n\nMorristown, New Jersey\n\n\nFebruary 25, 2025\n\n\n162\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n\n\nPART III\n\n\nITEM 10.
