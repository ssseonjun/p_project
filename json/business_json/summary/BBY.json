  "item1_summary": " The risks described below highlight potential events, trends or other circumstances that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or access to sources of financing . These risks could cause our future results to differ from historical results and from guidance we may provide regarding our expectations of future financial performance .\n These macroeconomic conditions impact consumer behavior and spending in various ways, including: whether or not they make a purchase; how frequently they upgrade or replace their devices; and whether they choose a brand, model or price-point . The impact of these factors could be compounded with respect to discretionary purchases of consumer electronics . Increases in the cost of living may also put pressure on our ability to offer competitive compensation and other employer-provided benefits .\n Our complex supply chain is heavily reliant on vendor imports from China and Mexico, which we estimate make up approximately 55% and 20% of the products we purchase . The consumer electronics we sell and our underlying technological infrastructure are dependent on rare earth elements, predominantly processed in China . Implementation of more restrictive trade policies, higher tariffs or the renegotiation of existing trade agreements could have a material adverse impact .\n The risk and actual occurrence of various catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance . The number and severity of certain catastrophic events is increasing in many of our markets . Such events can affect our properties, supply chain, partners, workforce or customers, such as power loss, telecommunications failures, or software and hardware malfunctions .\n Three of our largest states by total sales (California, Texas and Florida) are particularly vulnerable to natural disasters and extreme weather conditions . Natural disasters and climate-related events in these states, and other areas where our sales and operations are concentrated, could result in significant physical damage to, or closure of, our facilities .\n Many of the products we sell are highly susceptible to technological advancement, product life-cycle fluctuations and changes in consumer preferences . We operate in a highly and increasingly dynamic industry sector fueled by constant technological innovation and disruption, including most recently by the proliferation of artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies . We face strong competition from multi-channel retailers, e-commerce businesses, technology service providers, traditional store-based retaile .\n Price is of great importance to most customers, and price transparency and comparability continues to increase . Digital technology enables consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis, putting additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices . Retail sector continues to experience increased sales initiated online and using mobile applications, as well as online sales for both in-store or curbside pick-up .\n Our performance is highly dependent on attracting, retaining and engaging appropriately qualified employees in our stores, service centers, distribution centers, field and corporate offices . Our cost structure might be higher than some of our competitors, and this, in conjunction with price transparency, could put pressure on our margins . As competitors develop and expand their strategic use of AI, our operations and profitability could be adversely impacted if we fail to execute or maintain our own focused AI strategy .\n There is a risk that market increases in compensation and employer-provided benefits could have a material adverse effect on our profitability . Failure to recruit or retain qualified employees may impair our efficiency and effectiveness and our ability to pursue growth opportunities . The execution of our strategy relating to certain products and services (including health technology, services and logistics) brings business, financial and regulatory risks .\n As we refine existing offerings and introduce new offerings, we must navigate a complex, dynamic regulatory and technological environment . The collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information subjects us to privacy and security requirements . The risk accompanied with operating in the health sector may lead to a range of consequences, including, but not limited to customer complaints, individual consumer claims or class actions .\n Our focus on services exposes us to certain risks that could have a material adverse impact on our revenue, profitability and reputation . These risks could include an increase in consumer desire to purchase product offerings online and through mobile applications, impacting our ability to sell ancillary services . The strategy and execution of our service offerings are subject to incremental risks .\n In fiscal 2025, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 80% of the merchandise we purchased, with five suppliers – Apple, Samsung, HP, Sony and LG - representing approximately 55% of total merchandise purchased . We generally do not have long-term written contracts with our vendors that would require them to continue supplying us with merchandise . Our profitability depends on securing acceptable terms with vendors for, among other things, the price of merchandise we purchase from them .\n The competitive strategies of mobile network carriers can have a material impact on our business . Digital technology that enables consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis is limited to our flexibility to modify selling prices . We are dependent on a small number of mobile carriers to allow us to offer mobile devices with carrier connections . We believe that recognition and reputation of our company and our brands are key to our success .\n Third parties may commit fraud (including AI-driven fraud) while using our brand without our permission, possibly harming brand perception or reputation . Failure to effectively manage and execute strategic ventures or partnerships could have a negative impact on our business . Damage to the reputation of our brands could result in, among other things, decreases in revenues and customer loyalty .\n If our new or emerging Strategic Ventures are unsuccessful, our liquidity and profitability could be materially adversely affected, and we may be required to recognize material impairments to goodwill and other assets acquired . Failure to effectively manage our real estate portfolio and market segmentation strategy may negatively impact our operating results . We recorded a pre-tax, non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $475 million related to our Best Buy Health reporting unit, as described further in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements .\n Failure to identify and secure suitable locations for our stores and other facilities, failure to negotiate appropriate terms related to our real estate portfolio, or failure to react appropriately should any unforeseen changes arise, could impair our ability to compete successfully and our profitability . Any of the following factors could impact our long-term real estate strategy .\n Global supply chain impacts, similar to previous disruptions in the Red Sea and Panama Canal, could lead to increases in transportation costs or hinder third parties’ abilities to meet our demand for product volumes and timing, including unionization, labor strikes, slow-downs, competitive job markets and labor shortages impacting ports . If we fail to manage these risks effectively, we could experience a material adverse impact on our reputation, revenue and profitability .\n The company is subject to risks related to the products we sell, including those products sold on our Marketplace platforms and products under our exclusive brand labels . Failure to take appropriate actions in relation to product-related issues (for example, product recalls) could lead to violations of laws and regulations and leave us susceptible to government enforcement actions or private litigation .\n We have greater exposure to product-related risks in our exclusive brand category, including product liability claims, obsolescence and product liability . We do not generally have return-to-vendor rights . Foreign trade and other related issues could have a material adverse impact on our financial results . Most of our exclusives brand products are manufactured by contract manufacturers in China, Mexico and Southeast Asia .\n Our expanding third-party Marketplace, including our existing Canadian platform and our soon-to-launch U.S. platform, could present additional risks . Should the products sold on our Marketplace fail to meet quality, safety or regulatory standards, it could erode customer trust and damage our reputation . We rely heavily on our information technology systems for key business processes .\n The failure or interruption of these information systems, data centers, cloud platforms or their backup systems could significantly disrupt our business and cause higher costs and lost revenues . As many employees now use hybrid or full-time remote-working arrangements, the risk of any interruption of our information technology system capabilities is heightened . As we continue to expand our use of software as a service (SaaS) providers, we may face additional risks .\n The integration of AI into our operations increases cybersecurity and privacy risks . Threat actors may leverage AI to engage in automated, targeted and coordinated attacks of our systems . If a cybersecurity event is related to data that is regulated, such as under HIPAA, GDPR or California Consumer Privacy Act, we could be subject to additional regulatory investigations, penalties and fines .\n We have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats, and we may be subject to breaches of our information technology systems . We engage in significant data-protection efforts, but criminal activity, such as cyberattacks, lapses in our controls, impersonation of individuals with proper access controls, may undermine our privacy and security measures .\n Sensitive customer data may also be present on customer-owned devices entrusted to us for service and repair . Vulnerable code on products sold or serviced may also result in a compromise of customer privacy or security . Increased investment in technology and qualified staff, costs of compliance, costs resulting from fraud or criminal activity and costs of cyber and privacy insurance, could cause our business and results of operations to suffer .\n Some of the most significant compliance and litigation risks we face include the difficulty of complying with sometimes conflicting statutes and regulations in local, national and international jurisdictions . The potential for incremental costs related to compliance with new or existing environmental legislation or international agreements affecting energy transition, greenhouse gas emissions, electronics recycling and water . The impact of evolving regulations governing data privacy and security, including limitations on the collection, use or sharing of information .\n Law changes could increase costs of U.S. citizen-owned businesses . Law change could increase the risk of fines and other costs . Law changes may increase the cost of businesses and consumers of businesses in the United States . Businesses need to be able to make sure they can continue to work in compliance with the law .\n Regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on cybersecurity and CR&S matters . Regulators have increasingly expressed or pursued opposing views with respect to environmental, social and governance initiatives . As a result of these changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations, there has been, and will likely continue to be, an increase in general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations .\n Our international activities are subject to many of the same risks as described above, as well as to risks associated with the legislative, judicial, regulatory, political, economic and cultural factors specific to the countries or regions in which we operate . Any issues with our CR&S-related reporting, processes or goals, such as incomplete or inaccurate information, failure to achieve timely progress with respect to our goals, could negatively impact our reputation, business, financial performance or growth .\n These factors could significantly disrupt our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability . Failure to meet any financial performance guidance or other forward-looking statements we may provide to the public could result in a decline in our stock price . Our actual results may not be in line with guidance we have provided. We base our expense levels and investment plans on sales estimates .\n Our revenues are susceptible to volatility from various sources, which can lead to periods of flat or declining revenues . Some elements of our costs may be higher than our competitors’ because of our extended retail footprint and structure . Failure to successfully manage our costs could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and curtail our ability to fund our growth or other critical initiatives .\n Unexpected events or developments, such as pandemics, natural or man-made disasters, changes in consumer demand, economic factors, product sourcing issues could significantly disrupt our operations, especially during the fiscal fourth quarter . Customers choosing promotional financing can receive extended payment terms and low- or no-interest financing on qualifying purchases .\n We need sufficient sources of funds to fund our working capital requirements, service our outstanding indebtedness and finance business opportunities . We typically hold balances of cash, cash equivalents and/or short-term investments . We are therefore reliant on banks and other financial institutions to safeguard and allow ready access to these assets . If our sources of cash do not satisfy our requirements, we may need to seek additional financing .\n Any future downgrades to our credit ratings and outlook could negatively impact the perception of our credit risk and thus our access to capital markets, borrowing costs, vendor terms and lease terms . We rely heavily on information technology systems to operate and manage all key aspects of our business . We also process substantial volumes of confidential business information and sensitive consumer and employee personal information .\n The program deploys multiple layers of controls designed to identify, protect against, detect, respond to and recover from information security and cybersecurity incidents . We engage third parties for advice and support in the design and implementation of certain program elements . We also periodically retain outside expertise to conduct a maturity assessment of our program against industry standards and participants .\n Prior cybersecurity incidents have not materially affected, and do not appear likely to materially affect, our operations, business strategy, results of operations or financial condition . Enterprise Risk Management program has recognized that we face ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if not successfully prevented or mitigated, could materially affect us .
