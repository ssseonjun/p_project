    "item1": "Item 1: Business\n”.\nCurrent Trends Affecting MSCI\nTrends in Sustainability and Climate Investment Strategies\nWe believe sustainability and climate risks are investment risks that significantly impact many investment decisions, regulatory frameworks and corporate strategies. In Europe, disclosure requirements continue to drive demand for sustainability and climate tools to meet both regulatory and investor expectations. In the United States, political debate has led to some scrutiny of the use of sustainability and climate considerations in investment and risk management decisions.\nThe Company’s growth in this space depends on rising global demand for sustainability and climate solutions, which may be influenced by potential regulatory uncertainty or political opposition in certain markets. While some markets may face greater near-\n35\nTable of Content\ns\nterm challenges and uncertainty, we believe the long-term shift toward integrating financially material sustainability and climate factors into investment and risk management processes will support continued adoption of our sustainability and climate focused tools.\nAsset Management Industry Dynamics\nIn recent periods, the asset management industry—a key client segment for the Company—has undergone fee pressure and consolidation, driven by structural shifts, intensifying competition and evolving investor preferences. While industry fee pressure and consolidation may result in cost-cutting and vendor consolidation, firms may require more sophisticated and a broader array of investment tools across use cases and asset classes, driving demand for the Company’s offerings.\nThe impact of this fee pressure and consolidation remains uncertain, as client cost pressures could lead to contract adjustments or terminations, while asset managers may expand their use of the Company’s products and services, including for additional investment strategies. The extent to which these dynamics will impact the Company’s growth, client retention and revenue generation will depend on the pace of industry fee pressure and consolidation, evolving client priorities and the Company’s ability to adapt to shifting market demands.\nSee Item 1\n.

    "item1a": "Item 1A. \nRisk Factors—Client Risks\n of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of client trends and related risks.\nKey Financial and Operating Metrics and Drivers\nIn evaluating our financial performance, we focus on revenue and profit growth, including results accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) as well as non-GAAP measures, for the Company as a whole and by segment.\nWe present revenues disaggregated by types and by segments, which represent our major product lines. We also review expenses by activity, which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed. In addition, we utilize operating metrics including Run Rate, Subscription Sales and Retention Rate to manage and assess performance and to provide deeper insights into the recurring portion of our business.\nIn the discussion that follows, we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period. While operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes asset-based fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the underlying AUM, which is the primary component of asset-based fees, is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately three-fifths of the AUM is invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currency-adjusted variances.\nRevenues\nOur revenues are presented by type and by segment. For each segment, we present revenues disaggregated by the nature of the revenues, which are recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues.\nRecurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts and are generally recognized ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms. The fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance, prior to the license start date.\nAsset-based fees represent fees earned that are variable in nature, as they are primarily calculated based on the AUM linked to our indexes. Asset-based fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes, which are based on trading volumes and fee levels.\nNon-recurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we typically do not have renewal clauses within the contract. Examples of such products and services include one-time license fees, certain derivative financial products, certain implementation services, historical data sets and, occasionally, fees for unlicensed usage of our content in historical periods. Based on the nature of the services provided, non-recurring revenues are generally billed either in advance or after delivery and recognized point in time or over the service period.\nSee Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation” and Note 3, “Revenue Recognition” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on revenue recognition.\n36\nTable of Content\ns\nOperating Expenses\nWe group our operating expenses into the following activity categories:\n•\nCost of revenues;\n•\nSelling and marketing;\n•\nResearch and development (“R&D”);\n•\nGeneral and administrative (“G&A”);\n•\nAmortization of intangible assets; and\n•\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements.\nCosts are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or, when not directly attributable, an estimated allocation based on the type of effort involved. Cost of revenues, selling and marketing, R&D and G&A all include both compensation as well as non-compensation related expenses.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues expenses consist of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs, including data center, cloud service, platform and infrastructure costs; costs to acquire, produce and maintain market data information; costs of research to support and maintain existing products; costs of product management teams; costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs; as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources, finance and legal costs. \nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales and marketing teams, as well as costs incurred in other departments associated with acquiring new business, including product management, research, technology and sales operations.\nResearch and Development\nR&D expenses consist of costs to develop new or enhanced products and the costs to develop new or enhanced technologies and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily include the costs of development, research, product management, project management and the technology support directly associated with these activities.\nGeneral and Administrative\nG&A expenses consist of costs primarily related to finance operations, human resources, office of the CEO, legal, corporate technology, corporate development, impairment charges associated with right of use assets and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed, but are instead allocated, to a product or service.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets expense relates to definite-lived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and capitalization of internally developed software projects. Intangibles arising from past acquisitions consist of customer relationships, proprietary data, trademarks and trade names and technology and software. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. See Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation” and Note 9, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on intangible assets and amortization expense.\nDepreciation and Amortization of Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of computer and related equipment, leasehold improvements, software and furniture and fixtures over the estimated useful life of the assets.\n37\nTable of Content\ns\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness, including losses on early extinguishment of debt, income and losses associated with our previous equity method investment, foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, interest we collect on cash and short-term investments, as well as other non-operating income and expense items that may arise from time to time.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\n“Adjusted EBITDA,” a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as net income before (1) provision for income taxes, (2) other expense (income), net, (3) depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (4) amortization of intangible assets and, at times, (5) certain other transactions or adjustments, including, when applicable, impairment related to sublease of leased property and certain acquisition-related integration and transaction costs.\n“Adjusted EBITDA expenses,” a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments, including, when applicable, impairment related to sublease of leased property and certain acquisition-related integration and transaction costs.\n“Adjusted EBITDA margin” is defined as Adjusted EBITDA divided by operating revenues.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA expenses and Adjusted EBITDA margin are believed to be meaningful measures for management to assess the operating performance of the Company because they adjust for significant one-time, unusual or non-recurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the Company’s ongoing operating performance in the period. All companies do not calculate adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA expenses in the same way. These measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on, among other things, long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. Accordingly, the Company’s computation of the Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and Adjusted EBITDA expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies.\nOperating Metrics\nRun Rate\nRun Rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our Run Rate ultimately impacts our future operating revenues over time. At the end of any period, we generally have recurring subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months. We measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “Run Rate.” See “—\nOperating Metrics\n—\nRun Rate\n” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.\nSubscription Sales\nSubscription Sales is a key operating metric and is important to management because new Subscription Sales increase our Run Rate and represent future operating revenues that will be recognized over time. See “—\nOperating Metrics\n—\n Sales\n” below for additional information.\nRetention Rate\nRetention Rate is a key operating metric and is important to management because subscription cancellations decrease our Run Rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time. See “—\nOperating Metrics\n—\nRetention Rate\n” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant estimates and judgments made by management include such examples as assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and income \n38\nTable of Content\ns\ntaxes. We believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. \nGoodwill\nWe recognize goodwill in business combination transactions when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the acquired net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets. We test goodwill for impairment annually on July 1 or when interim triggers arise. When testing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test; however, on a periodic basis, we may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test. During the year ended December 31, 2024 we elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative test. The test for impairment was performed at the reporting unit level, and we used an equal weighting of the income approach and the market approach to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. \nThe income approach requires significant judgement in estimating future cash flows, including assumptions, amongst others, about revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate, which reflects the reporting unit’s cost of capital. Forecasted future cash flows are estimated based on a combination of historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit. Discount rates are selected for each reporting unit being valued based on each reporting unit’s estimated weighted-average cost of capital. The weighted-average cost of capital is estimated based on both the capital structure that we believe a market participant would utilize as well as the discount rates of guideline public companies that have similar characteristics to each reporting unit being valued, adjusted for the risk inherent in each reporting unit. Terminal growth rates are selected based on growth rates used during the reporting unit’s forecast period in combination with economic conditions. The market approach utilizes valuation multiples of revenue and cash flows derived from guideline public companies that have similar characteristics to each reporting unit being valued. Selecting appropriate guideline companies, valuation multiples and other key assumptions such as revenue growth rates and discount rates requires significant management judgment, and changes to these estimates could materially impact the fair value determination of each reporting unit. We perform sensitivity analyses around key assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the impact on the estimated fair value.\nImpairment occurs when the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below the carrying value. As of July 1, 2024, all reporting units had fair values exceeding their carrying values. As a result, no goodwill impairment was recorded as of this date. \nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2024 on our Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units, which are also our operating segments. As of July 1, 2024, the fair value of all reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. At December 31, 2024, the carrying value of goodwill within the Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units were $689.8 and $617.8 million, respectively. As of July 1, 2024, the fair value of the Private Capital Solutions and Real Assets reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 10% and 30%, respectively, introducing risk of potential future impairments. If we experience a prolonged or severe period of weakness in the business environment, financial markets, the performance of one or more of our recently acquired companies or reporting units, or our common stock price, or if economic conditions differ significantly from management’s assumptions, our goodwill could be impaired in the future, which may be material to our results of operations and financial position.   \nFor all of our reporting units, individually, a hypothetical decrease in revenue growth rates by 100 basis points or a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in the weighted average cost of capital would not result in an impairment. See Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation” and Note 9, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on goodwill.\nDefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. These events or circumstances include adverse changes in the manner in which the asset will be used, adverse changes in legal factors related to the asset or negative changes in expected financial performance of the asset, including accumulation of costs and operating losses. Determining whether an event or changes in circumstances warrant an impairment review involves management judgment.\nOnce it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, determination of recoverability is determined based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. Measurement of impairment for intangible assets is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows used in the determination and calculation of impairments represent management forecasts and require significant management judgment. While management believes that its forecasts are reasonable, \n39\nTable of Content\ns\ndifferences between forecasts and actual experience could materially affect the valuations. There were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable during the years presented. \nWith respect to our acquisition of Burgiss on October 2, 2023, the valuation of intangible assets, as part of the acquisition method of accounting, was subjective and based, in part, on inputs that were unobservable. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired intangible assets included forecasted cash flows, which were determined based on certain assumptions that included, among others, projected future revenues, and expected market royalty rates, technology obsolescence rates and discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities of Burgiss differently from the allocation that we have made.\nWe amortize our intangible assets over the estimated period of economic benefit. If the estimated period of economic benefit is changed, the prospective amortization of the intangible asset could materially change.\nSee Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation” and Note 9, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on intangible assets and amortization expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions. Our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. These laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business. The tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes. \nProvision for income taxes is provided for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our opinion, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to estimate future taxable income which requires judgment.\nWe must regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we file income tax returns and adjust unrecognized tax benefits when additional information is available or when an event occurs. This assessment requires significant judgment in assessment of tax laws, frequency of tax examinations, and the nature of intercompany transactions and tax positions.\nSee Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation” and Note 12, “Income Taxes” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on income taxes.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Results\nAcquisitions of Burgiss, Trove, Fabric and Foxberry\nOn October 2, 2023, the Company acquired the remaining 66.4% interest in Burgiss for $696.8 million in cash. The Company’s existing 33.6% interest had a fair value at acquisition date of $353.2 million which resulted in a non-taxable gain of $143.0 million for the twelve months ending December 31, 2023.\nPrior to the acquisition, the Company’s ownership interest in Burgiss was classified as an equity-method investment. Therefore, All Other – Private Assets did not include the Company’s proportionate share of operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA related to Burgiss. The Company’s proportionate share of the income or loss from its equity-method investment in Burgiss was reported as a component of other (expense) income, net.\nFollowing the acquisition, the consolidated results of Burgiss are included in the Company’s Private Capital Solutions operating segment (formerly known as Burgiss), which is combined and presented as part of All Other – Private Assets. See Note 5, “Acquisitions,” and Note 13, “Segment Information” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on the acquisition of Burgiss.\nOn November 1, 2023 MSCI completed the acquisition of Trove Research Ltd (“Trove”), a carbon markets intelligence provider for approximately $37.9 million in cash. Trove is a part of the ESG and Climate operating segment.\n40\nTable of Content\ns\nOn January 2, 2024, MSCI completed the acquisition of Fabric RQ, Inc. (“Fabric”), a wealth technology platform specializing in portfolio design, customization and analytics for wealth managers and advisors, for approximately $8.0 million in cash and contingent consideration that had an acquisition date fair value of $8.1 million that is payable based on future sales of Fabric’s products. Fabric is a part of the Analytics operating segment.\nOn April 16, 2024, MSCI completed the acquisition of Foxberry Ltd. (“Foxberry”), a front-office index technology platform for approximately $23.5 million in cash and contingent consideration that had an acquisition date fair value of $19.1 million that is payable based upon the achievement of metrics related to the operation of the platform. Foxberry is a part of the Index operating segment. We collectively refer to the acquisitions of Burgiss, Trove, Fabric and Foxberry as the “recent acquisitions”.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are grouped by the following types: recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring. We also group operating revenues by major product as follows: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate and All Other – Private Assets.\nThe following table presents operating revenues by type for the years indicated:\nYears Ended\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31,\n2024\nDecember 31,\n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nRecurring subscriptions\n$\n2,114,445 \n$\n1,871,290 \n13.0 \n%\nAsset-based fees\n657,501 \n557,502 \n17.9 \n%\nNon-recurring\n84,182 \n100,128 \n(15.9 \n%)\nTotal operating revenues\n$\n2,856,128 \n$\n2,528,920 \n12.9 \n%\nTotal operating revenues increased 12.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, total operating revenues would have increased 9.6%.\nOperating revenues from recurring subscriptions increased 13.0% for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by growth in Index products, which increased $67.8 million, or 8.3%, growth in ESG and Climate products, which increased $36.5 million, or 12.9%, growth in Analytics products, which increased $55.3 million, or 9.2%, and growth in All Other - Private Assets products, which increased $83.6 million, or 48.9%. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, operating revenues from recurring subscriptions would have increased 8.5%.\nOperating revenues from asset-based fees increased 17.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024, mainly driven by growth in revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes and non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes. Operating revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes and non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes increased by 20.0% and 19.4%, respectively, primarily driven by an increase in average AUM. \nOperating revenues from non-recurring revenues decreased 15.9% for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily driven by one-time fees for unlicensed usage of our content in historical periods recognized in 2023.\n41\nTable of Content\ns\nThe following table presents the value of AUM in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes and the sequential change of such assets as of the end of each of the periods indicated:\nPeriod Ended\n2023\n2024\n(in billions)\nMarch \n31,\nJune \n30,\nSeptember 30,\nDecember 31,\nMarch \n31,\nJune \n30,\nSeptember 30, \nDecember 31,\nAUM in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes\n(1) (2)\n$\n1,305.4 \n$\n1,372.5 \n$\n1,322.8 \n$\n1,468.9 \n$\n1,582.6 \n$\n1,631.9 \n$\n1,761.8 \n$\n1,724.7 \nSequential Change in Value\nMarket Appreciation/(Depreciation)\n$\n75.1 \n$\n48.4 \n$\n(56.1)\n$\n130.5 \n$\n92.8 \n$\n21.2 \n$\n111.3 \n$\n(85.3)\nCash Inflows/(Outflows)\n7.4 \n18.7 \n6.4 \n15.6 \n20.9 \n28.1 \n18.6 \n48.2 \nTotal Change\n$\n82.5 \n$\n67.1 \n$\n(49.7)\n$\n146.1 \n$\n113.7 \n$\n49.3 \n$\n129.9 \n$\n(37.1)\nThe following table presents the average value of AUM in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes for the periods indicated:\nYear-to-Date Average\n2023\n2024\n(in billions)\nMarch\nJune\nSeptember\nDecember\nMarch\nJune\nSeptember\nDecember\nAUM in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes\n(1) (2)\n$\n1,287.5 \n$\n1,310.7 \n$\n1,332.6 \n$\n1,340.7 \n$\n1,508.8 \n$\n1,549.7 \n$\n1,592.1 \n$\n1,632.9 \n________________\n(1)\nThe historical values of the AUM in ETFs linked to our equity indexes as of the last day of the month and the monthly average balance can be found under the link “AUM in ETFs Linked to MSCI Equity Indexes” on our Investor Relations homepage at \nhttp://ir.msci.com\n.

For any Client Contract where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume/fees, the Run Rate calculation reflects, for ETFs, the market value on the last trading day of the period, for futures and options, the most recent quarterly volumes and/or reported exchange fees, and for other non-ETF products, the most recent client-reported assets. Run Rate does not include fees associated with “one-time” and other non-recurring transactions. In addition, we add to Run Rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales, whether to existing or new clients, when we execute Client Contracts, even though the license start date, and associated revenue recognition, may not be effective until a later date. We remove from Run Rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any Client Contract when we (i) have received a notice of termination, non-renewal or an indication the client does not intend to continue their subscription during the period and (ii) have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services, even though such termination or non-renewal may not be effective until a later date.\nChanges in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in Run Rate. The actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from Run Rate for numerous reasons, including:\n•\nfluctuations in revenues associated with new recurring sales;\n•\nmodifications, cancellations and non-renewals of existing Client Contracts, subject to specified notice requirements;\n•\ndifferences between the recurring license start date and the date the Client Contract is executed due to, for example, contracts with onboarding periods or fee waiver periods;\n•\nfluctuations in asset-based fees, which may result from changes in certain investment products’ total expense ratios, market movements, including foreign currency exchange rates, or from investment inflows into and outflows from investment products linked to our indexes;\n•\nfluctuations in fees based on trading volumes of futures and options contracts linked to our indexes;\n•\nprice changes or discounts;\n•\nrevenue recognition differences under U.S. GAAP, including those related to the timing of implementation and report deliveries for certain of our products and services;\n•\nfluctuations in the number of hedge funds for which we provide investment information and risk analysis to hedge fund investors;\n•\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; and\n•\nthe impact of acquisitions and divestitures.\n50\nTable of Content\ns\nThe following table presents Run Rates as of the dates indicated and the growth percentages over the years indicated:\nAs of\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nIndex:\nRecurring subscriptions\n$\n934,251 \n$\n861,366 \n8.5 \n%\nAsset-based fees\n678,599 \n590,872 \n14.8 \n%\nIndex total\n1,612,850 \n1,452,238 \n11.1 \n%\nAnalytics\n698,377 \n661,922 \n5.5 \n%\nESG and Climate\n343,741 \n319,324 \n7.6 \n%\nAll Other - Private Assets\n266,719 \n252,677 \n5.6 \n%\nTotal Run Rate\n$\n2,921,687 \n$\n2,686,161 \n8.8 \n%\nRecurring subscriptions total\n$\n2,243,088 \n$\n2,095,289 \n7.1 \n%\nAsset-based fees\n678,599 \n590,872 \n14.8 \n%\nTotal Run Rate\n$\n2,921,687 \n$\n2,686,161 \n8.8 \n%\nTotal Run Rate increased 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, driven by a 7.1% increase from recurring subscriptions and by a 14.8% increase from asset-based fees.

Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, All Other - Private Assets Run Rate would have increased 6.8%.\nSales\nSales represents the annualized value of products and services clients commit to purchase from MSCI and will result in additional operating revenues. Non-recurring sales represent the actual value of the customer agreements entered into during the period and are not a component of Run Rate. New recurring subscription sales represent additional selling activities, such as new customer agreements, additions to existing agreements or increases in price that occurred during the period and are additions to Run Rate. Subscription cancellations reflect client activities during the period, such as discontinuing products and services and/or reductions in price, resulting in reductions to Run Rate. Net new recurring subscription sales represent the amount of new recurring subscription sales net of subscription cancellations during the period, which reflects the net impact to Run Rate during the period. \nTotal gross sales represent the sum of new recurring subscription sales and non-recurring sales. Total net sales represent the total gross sales net of the impact from subscription cancellations. \n51\nTable of Content\ns\nThe following table presents our recurring subscription sales, cancellations and non-recurring sales for the years indicated:\nYears Ended \n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nIncrease/(Decrease)\nIndex\nNew recurring subscription sales\n$\n118,191 \n$\n116,016 \n1.9 \n%\nSubscription cancellations\n(45,730)\n(32,298)\n41.6 \n%\n  Net new recurring subscription sales\n$\n72,461 \n$\n83,718 \n(13.4 \n%)\nNon-recurring sales\n$\n62,840 \n$\n87,775 \n(28.4 \n%)\nTotal gross sales\n$\n181,031 \n$\n203,791 \n(11.2 \n%)\nTotal Index net sales\n$\n135,301 \n$\n171,493 \n(21.1 \n%)\nAnalytics\nNew recurring subscription sales\n$\n82,419 \n$\n79,035 \n4.3 \n%\nSubscription cancellations\n(39,106)\n(34,675)\n12.8 \n%\nNet new recurring subscription sales\n$\n43,313 \n$\n44,360 \n(2.4 \n%)\nNon-recurring sales\n$\n16,368 \n$\n14,379 \n13.8 \n%\nTotal gross sales\n$\n98,787 \n$\n93,414 \n5.8 \n%\nTotal Analytics net sales\n$\n59,681 \n$\n58,739 \n1.6 \n%\nESG and Climate\nNew recurring subscription sales\n$\n55,397 \n$\n55,092 \n0.6 \n%\nSubscription cancellations\n(22,989)\n(10,923)\n110.5 \n%\nNet new recurring subscription sales\n$\n32,408 \n$\n44,169 \n(26.6 \n%)\nNon-recurring sales\n$\n9,015 \n$\n5,625 \n60.3 \n%\nTotal gross sales\n$\n64,412 \n$\n60,717 \n6.1 \n%\nTotal ESG and Climate net sales\n$\n41,423 \n$\n49,794 \n(16.8 \n%)\nAll Other - Private Assets\nNew recurring subscription sales\n$\n40,758 \n$\n26,175 \n55.7 \n%\nSubscription cancellations\n(23,685)\n(15,337)\n54.4 \n%\nNet new recurring subscription sales\n$\n17,073 \n$\n10,838 \n57.5 \n%\nNon-recurring sales\n$\n3,878 \n$\n2,151 \n80.3 \n%\nTotal gross sales\n$\n44,636 \n$\n28,326 \n57.6 \n%\nTotal All Other - Private Assets net sales\n$\n20,951 \n$\n12,989 \n61.3 \n%\nConsolidated\nNew recurring subscription sales\n$\n296,765 \n$\n276,318 \n7.4 \n%\nSubscription cancellations\n(131,510)\n(93,233)\n41.1 \n%\nNet new recurring subscription sales\n$\n165,255 \n$\n183,085 \n(9.7 \n%)\nNon-recurring sales\n$\n92,101 \n$\n109,930 \n(16.2 \n%)\nTotal gross sales\n$\n388,866 \n$\n386,248 \n0.7 \n%\nTotal net sales\n$\n257,356 \n$\n293,015 \n(12.2 \n%)\n52\nTable of Content\ns\nRetention Rate\nThe following table presents our Retention Rate for the periods indicated:\nIndex\n(1)\nAnalytics\n(1)\nESG and Climate\nAll Other - Private Assets\nTotal\n2024\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n93.2%\n93.5%\n90.8%\n92.2%\n92.8%\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n95.2%\n95.8%\n94.3%\n91.2%\n94.8%\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n95.4%\n93.8%\n93.0%\n92.7%\n94.2%\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n95.0%\n93.3%\n93.1%\n86.4%\n93.1%\nYear Ended December 31,\n94.7%\n94.1%\n92.8%\n90.6%\n93.7%\n2023\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n96.4%\n94.0%\n96.1%\n92.1%\n95.2%\nThree Months Ended June 30,\n95.8%\n95.2%\n96.9%\n92.8%\n95.5%\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n96.2%\n95.1%\n96.0%\n91.3%\n95.4%\nThree Months Ended December 31,\n95.0%\n93.1%\n94.7%\n88.8%\n93.6%\nYear Ended December 31,\n95.8%\n94.4%\n95.9%\n90.4%\n94.7%\n______________________________\n(1)\nRetention rate for Index excluding the impact of the acquisition of Foxberry was 95.0% and 94.7% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, respectively. Retention rate for Analytics excluding the impact of the acquisition of Fabric was 93.3% and 94.1% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2024, respectively. \nRetention Rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our Run Rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time. The annual Retention Rate represents the retained subscription Run Rate (subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year) as a percentage of the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year. \nThe Retention Rate for a non-annual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew or discontinue the subscription during the non-annual period, and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement, even though such termination or non-renewal may not be effective until a later date. This annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate. This cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100% to derive the annualized Retention Rate for the period.\nFor example, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we recorded cancellations of \n$36.0 \nmillion. To derive the Retention Rate for the fourth quarter, we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of $36.0 million to derive $144.1 million of annualized cancellations. This $144.1 million was then divided by the $2,096.8 million subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the year, which is adjusted to include Fabric’s and Foxberry’s Run Rate as of the date of acquisition, to derive a cancellation rate of 6.9%. The 6.9% was then subtracted from 100.0% to derive a Retention Rate of 93.1% for the fourth quarter.\nRetention Rate is computed by segment on a product/service-by-product/service basis. In general, if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment, or switches between products or services within a segment, we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our Retention Rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service. In those replacement cases, only the net change to the client subscription, if a decrease, is reported as a cancel. In the Analytics and the ESG and Climate operating segments, substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner, while in our Index and Real Assets operating segments, product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur only in certain limited instances. In addition, we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a down-sell of the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction. We do not calculate Retention Rate for that portion of our Run Rate attributable to assets in index-linked investment products or futures and options contracts, in each case, linked to our indexes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, 27.4% of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter. In our product lines, Retention Rate is generally higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year.\n53\nTable of Content\ns\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require capital to fund ongoing operations, internal growth initiatives and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facility. In addition, we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets. We intend to use these sources of liquidity to, among other things, service our existing and future debt obligations, fund our working capital requirements for capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and dividend payments, and make repurchases of our common stock. In connection with our business strategy, we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities. We believe our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth.\nSenior Notes and Credit Agreement\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had an aggregate of $4,200.0 million in Senior Notes outstanding. In addition, under the Credit Agreement, we had as of December 31, 2024 an aggregate of $336.9 million in outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility. See Note 6, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our outstanding indebtedness and Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn January 26, 2024, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) amending and restating in its entirety the prior credit agreement dated as of June 9, 2022 (the “Prior Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement makes available an aggregate of $1,250.0 million of revolving loan commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility (“Revolving Loan Commitments”), which may be drawn until January 26, 2029. The Revolving Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement was drawn at closing in an amount sufficient to prepay all term loans outstanding under the term loan A facility (the “TLA Facility”) under the Prior Credit Agreement. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are general unsecured obligations of the Company.\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes (the “Indentures”) among us and Computershare, National Association, as trustee and successor to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, contain covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, and that limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness. \nThe Credit Agreement also contains covenants that limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, and that limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur certain indebtedness.\nThe Credit Agreement and the Indentures also contain customary events of default, including those relating to non-payment, breach of representations, warranties or covenants, cross-default and cross-acceleration, and bankruptcy and insolvency events, and, in the case of the Credit Agreement, invalidity or impairment of loan documentation, change of control and customary Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) defaults in addition to the foregoing. None of the restrictions detailed above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business.\nThe Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the Credit Agreement: (1) the maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis not to exceed 4.25:1.00 (or 4.50:1.00 for four fiscal quarters following a material acquisition) and (2) the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis of at least 4.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2024, our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was 2.34:1.00 and our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio was 10.16:1.00. \nUpon the closing of the Credit Agreement on January 26, 2024, the subsidiary guarantors were released from their guarantees under the Indentures and the Prior Credit Agreement. Previously, the Senior Notes and the Prior Credit Agreement were fully and unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed by our direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that accounted for more than 5% of our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated assets, other than certain excluded subsidiaries. As a result, as of December 31, 2024, all of the Company’s subsidiaries were non-guarantor subsidiaries under the Indentures (‘non-guarantor subsidiaries”). The non-guarantor subsidiaries accounted for approximately $2,249.1 million, or 78.7%, of our total revenue for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2024, approximately $811.6 million, or 53.1%, of our consolidated operating income for the trailing 12 months ended December 31, 2024, and approximately $4,861.2 million, or 89.3%, of our consolidated total assets (excluding intercompany assets) and $1,532.8 million, or 24.0%, of our consolidated total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2024. \n54\nTable of Content\ns\nShare Repurchases\nIn 2024, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of shares of the Company’s common stock in the open market. See Note 11, “Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit),” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program.\nAs of trade date February 6, 2025, a total of $1.4 billion of authorization remained available under the share repurchase program. This authorization may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nCash Dividends\nOn September 17, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a plan to initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders. On October 30, 2014, we began paying regular quarterly cash dividends and have paid such dividends each quarter thereafter.\nOn January 28, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.80 per share for the three months ending March 31, 2025. This reflects an increase of 12.5% over the quarterly cash dividend declared for the three months ended December 31, 2024. The first quarter 2025 dividend is payable on February 28, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of trading on February 14, 2025.\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, including restricted cash, as of the dates indicated:\nAs of\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nCash and cash equivalents (includes restricted cash of $3,497 and \n   $3,878 at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively)\n$\n409,351 \n$\n461,693 \nThe following table presents the breakdown of the Company’s cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended \n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n1,501,627 \n$\n1,236,029 \nNet cash (used in) investing activities\n(144,255)\n(819,378)\nNet cash (used in) financing activities\n(1,402,308)\n(953,931)\nEffect of exchange rate changes\n(7,406)\n5,409 \nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n(52,342)\n$\n(531,871)\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe typically seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately $225.0 million to $275.0 million for general operating purposes. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $265.5 million and $285.2 million, respectively, of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. Repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions. We believe the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purposes or other needs, including acquisitions or expansion of our products.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The year-over-year change was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers, partially offset by higher cash expenses, mainly reflecting higher cash compensation.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation and benefits costs, income taxes, interest expense, information technology costs, professional fees, market data costs and office rent. Historically, the payment of \n55\nTable of Content\ns\ncash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nThe year-over-year change was primarily driven by the impact of lower cash paid for business acquisitions.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nThe year-over-year change was primarily driven by the impact of higher share repurchases and dividend payments.\nWe believe that global cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents and funds available under our existing revolving credit facility and our ability to access bank debt, private debt and the capital markets for additional funds, will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this Form 10-K and for the foreseeable future thereafter. In addition, we expect that foreign cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this Form 10-K and for the foreseeable future thereafter. \nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations consist primarily of our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the Senior Notes, Revolving Loan Commitments, leases for office space, leases for equipment and other operating leases and obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of December 31, 2024:\nYears Ending December 31,\n(in thousands)\nTotal\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nSenior Notes\n(1)\n$\n5,193,323 \n$\n155,875 \n$\n155,875 \n$\n155,875 \n$\n155,875 \n$\n1,155,875 \n$\n3,413,948 \nRevolving Loan Commitments\n(2)\n425,470 \n22,349 \n22,349 \n21,883 \n20,554 \n338,335 \n— \nOperating leases\n165,605 \n30,220 \n30,361 \n24,421 \n23,931 \n16,573 \n40,099 \nVendor obligations\n176,585 \n80,776 \n53,020 \n37,638 \n3,872 \n1,279 \n— \nOther obligations\n(3)\n9,959 \n9,959 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \nTotal contractual obligations\n$\n5,970,942 \n$\n299,179 \n$\n261,605 \n$\n239,817 \n$\n204,232 \n$\n1,512,062 \n$\n3,454,047 \n______________________________\n(1)\nIncludes the impact of payments for the principal amount on the Senior Notes due 2029, the Senior Notes due 2030, the 3.875% Senior Notes due 2031, the 3.625% Senior Notes due 2031 and the Senior Notes due 2033 plus interest based on the 4.000%, 3.625%, 3.875%, 3.625% and 3.250% coupon interest rates, respectively.\n(2)\nIncludes the impact of payments for the principal amount as well as coupon interest payments at the interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2024 on the revolving loans under the Revolving Credit Facility due 2029.\n(3)\nPrimarily includes amounts payable related to an estimated one-time tax on deemed repatriation of historic earnings of foreign subsidiaries (the “Toll Charge”) imposed after Tax Reform was enacted. The Toll Charge, to the extent it is payable in more than one year, is included within “Other non-current liabilities” in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nThe obligations related to our uncertain tax positions, which are not considered material, have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement.\nRecent Accounting Standards Updates\nSee Note 2, “Recent Accounting Standards Updates,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information.\n56\nTable of Content\ns\nItem 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk. Exchange rate movements can impact the U.S. dollar-reported value of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded.\nWe generally invoice our clients in U.S. dollars; however, we invoice a portion of our clients in Euros, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen and a limited number of other non-U.S. dollar currencies. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, 16.6% and 16.7%, respectively, of our revenues were subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily included clients billed in foreign currency as well as U.S. dollar exposures on non-U.S. dollar foreign operating entities. Of the 16.6% of non-U.S. dollar exposure for the year ended December 31, 2024, 41.9% was in Euros, 32.9% was in British pounds sterling and 17.8% was in Japanese yen. Of the 16.7% of non-U.S. dollar exposure for the year ended December 31, 2023, 41.9% was in Euros, 32.5% was in British pounds sterling and 17.7% was in Japanese yen.\nRevenues from asset-based fees represented 23.0% and 22.0% of operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. While a substantial portion of our asset-based fees are invoiced in U.S. dollars, the fees are based on the assets in investment products, of which approximately three-fifths are invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, declines in such other currencies against the U.S. dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses. In addition, declines in such currencies against the U.S. dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows, which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses.\nWe are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs. Approximately 40.9% and 42.4% of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were denominated in foreign currencies, the significant majority of which were denominated in British pounds sterling, Indian rupees, Euros, Hungarian forints, Mexican pesos and Swiss francs.\nWe have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts, and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency, either a gain or a loss results from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies. We manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, in part, through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies. We recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of $4.8 million and $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n57\nTable of Content\ns\nItem 8.    \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPage\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \n(PCAOB ID \n238\n)\n59\nConsolidated Statements of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023\n62\nConsolidated Statements of Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022\n63\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022\n64\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit) for the Years Ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022\n65\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2024, December 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022\n66\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n67\n1.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to \n59\nTable of Content\ns\nthe consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \nRevenue Recognition - Recurring Subscriptions, Asset-Based Fees, and Non-Recurring Revenues\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognized operating revenues of $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, related to recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees, and non-recurring revenues from the Index, Analytics, and ESG and Climate segments. Recurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts or agreements and are generally paid annually in advance and recognized in most cases ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms. Asset-based fees are principally recognized based on the estimated assets under management (AUM) linked to the Company's indexes from independent third-party sources or the most recently reported information provided by the client. Asset-based fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to the Company’s indexes, which are primarily based on trading volumes and fee levels. Asset-based fees are generally variable based upon AUM or the volume of trades or fee levels and are generally billed quarterly in arrears. Non-recurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where the Company typically does not have renewal clauses within the contract. Examples of such products and services include one-time license fees, certain derivative financial products, certain implementation services, historical data sets and, occasionally, fees for unlicensed usage of content in historical periods. Based on the nature of the services provided, non-recurring revenues are generally billed either in advance or after delivery and recognized point in time or over the service period.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees, and non-recurring revenues is a critical audit matter are a high degree of auditor effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to the Company’s revenue recognition.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n \nThese procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to revenue recognition, including controls over revenue transactions recognized as recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees, and non-recurring revenues.\n \nThese procedures also included, among others, testing a sample of revenue transactions by obtaining and inspecting source documents which included (i) sales contracts or agreements, invoices, and cash receipts, where applicable, for recurring subscriptions and non-recurring revenues, and (ii) sales contracts or agreements, invoices, and cash receipts, where applicable, and AUM data from independent third-party sources or information provided by the Company’s customers, where applicable, to recalculate revenue recognized for asset-based fees.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments – Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions Reporting Units\nAs described in Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance was $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2024. Management tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on July 1\nst\n and on an interim basis when certain events and circumstances exist. The test for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, an impairment charge will be recorded up to, but not more than, the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. As disclosed by management, as of December 31, 2024, the carrying value of goodwill within the Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units was $689.8 and $617.8 million, respectively. Management uses an equal weighting of the income approach and the market approach to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. The income approach requires significant judgment in estimating future cash flows, including assumptions, amongst others, about revenue growth rates and EBITDA margins, and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. The market approach utilizes valuation multiples of revenue and cash flows derived from guideline public companies that have similar characteristics to each reporting unit being valued. Selecting appropriate guideline companies, valuation multiples and other key assumptions such as revenue growth rates and discount rates requires significant management judgment.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessments of the Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, projected EBITDA margins, discount rates, guideline companies, and valuation multiples; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessments, including controls over the valuation of the Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the income approach and market approach used by management; (iii) \n60\nTable of Content\ns\ntesting the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the income approach and market approach; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, projected EBITDA margins, discount rates, guideline companies, and valuation multiples. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to certain revenue growth rates and projected EBITDA margins involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the income approach and market approach, (ii) the reasonableness of the discount rate assumptions and certain revenue growth rate assumptions used in the income approach, and (iii) the reasonableness of guideline companies and valuation multiples used in the market approach.\n/s/

together with its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company” or “MSCI”) is a leading provider of critical decision support tools and solutions for the global investment community. Our mission-critical offerings help investors \nnavigate the complexities of a dynamic and evolving investment landscape\n. Leveraging our deep knowledge of the global investment process and our expertise in research, data and technology, we enable our clients to understand and analyze key drivers of risk and return and build portfolios more effectively. Our products and services include indexes; portfolio construction and risk management tools; sustainability and climate solutions; and private asset data and analytics.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to financial statements, which include the accounts of MSCI Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). \nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nOn October 2, 2023, the Company acquired the remaining \n66.4\n% interest in The Burgiss Group, LLC (“Burgiss”) for $\n696.8\n million in cash. Prior to the acquisition, Burgiss was a related party and its results were included in the Company’s Burgiss operating segment as an equity method investment based on the Company’s \n33.6\n% ownership. The Company’s existing \n33.6\n% interest had a fair value of $\n353.2\n million at the date of acquisition. This resulted in a non-taxable, one-time gain on the remeasurement of our equity method investment in Burgiss of $\n143.0\n million in the fourth quarter of 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company renamed the Burgiss operating segment to Private Capital Solutions. Burgiss’ consolidated results were included in the Company’s All Other \n–\n Private Assets category following the acquisition.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of operating revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant estimates and judgments made by management include such examples as assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes. The Company believes that estimates used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue Recognition\nPerformance Obligations and Transaction Price\nThe Company recognizes revenues for products and services when performance obligations are satisfied. For revenue arrangements containing multiple products or services, the Company accounts for the individual products or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct. A product or service is distinct if a client can benefit from it either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the client, and the Company’s promise to transfer the product or service to the client is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If both criteria are not met, the promised products or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the client. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on the best estimate of a relative standalone selling price of each distinct product or service in the contract. To allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, at contract inception the Company determines the standalone selling prices of the distinct products or services underlying each performance obligation in proportion to the total transaction price. This standalone selling price may be the contract price but is more often than not the best estimate of the price the Company would receive for selling the product or service separately in similar circumstances and to other similar customers. A client can receive a discount for purchasing a bundle of products or services if the sum of the standalone selling price of those promised products or services in the contract exceeds the promised consideration in the contract.\n67\nTable of Content\ns\nFor services where the transaction price is variable such as based upon assets under management (“AUM”), volume of trades or fee levels, the transaction price is based upon pricing models and is not allocated at the inception of the contract but rather falls within the sales and usage-based royalty exception under which the price and associated revenue are based upon actual known performance or best estimates of actual performance during the performance period. \nRevenue is recognized when a client obtains control of promised products or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. Determining when control has transferred can sometimes require management’s judgment (\ne.g.\n, implementation services), which could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized exclusive of any applicable sales or other indirect taxes. \nDisaggregation of Revenue \nRevenues are characterized by type, which broadly reflects the nature of how they are recognized or earned. Our revenue types are recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues. We also group our revenues by segment. \nRevenues By Type \nRecurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts or agreements and are generally paid annually in advance and recognized in most cases ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms.\nAsset-based fees are principally recognized based on the estimated AUM linked to our indexes from independent third-party sources or the most recently reported information provided by the client. Asset-based fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes, which are primarily based on trading volumes and fee levels. Asset-based fees are generally variable based upon AUM or the volume of trades or fee levels and are generally billed quarterly in arrears.\nNon-recurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we typically do not have renewal clauses within the contract. Examples of such products and services include one-time license fees, certain derivative financial products, certain implementation services, historical data sets and, occasionally, fees for unlicensed usage of our content in historical periods. Based on the nature of the services provided, non-recurring revenues are generally billed either in advance or after delivery and recognized point in time or over the service period.\nRevenues By Segment and All – Other Private Assets\nIndex segment operating revenues consist of fees earned primarily for licenses of index data subscriptions, performance obligations to deliver the data are satisfied over time and, accordingly, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement pursuant to the contract terms. With respect to licenses to create indexed investment products, such as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), passively managed funds, or licenses which allow certain exchanges to use MSCI’s indexes as the basis for futures and options contracts, MSCI’s performance obligation allows customers to use the Company’s intellectual property (\ne.g.\n, the indexes) as the basis of the funds or other investment products the customers create over the term of the agreement. The fees earned for these rights are typically variable, in which case they are accrued under the sales and usage-based royalty exception pursuant to the level of performance achieved, which is primarily measured based on AUM, volume of trades or fee levels. The level of performance achieved is based on information obtained from independent third-party sources or best estimates taking into account the most recently reported information from the client. \nAnalytics segment operating revenues are recognized as MSCI satisfies performance obligations through providing access to its proprietary models or hosted applications and, in some cases, delivery of managed services, which are typically satisfied over time, and operating revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the service period. For implementation services, MSCI meets its performance obligation once the implementation is complete and the related service is available for the client to use. Operating revenues are recognized at the point in time when the implementation service is completed. \nESG and Climate segment operating revenues are recognized as MSCI’s performance obligations to provide data to or update data for clients are satisfied. The majority of these performance obligations are satisfied over the term of the license period, with operating revenues recognized ratably. For custom ESG research data, the performance obligation is typically satisfied, and revenue is recognized, at the point in time when the data is updated and available to the client. \nAll Other – Private Assets operating revenues are recognized as MSCI's performance obligations to provide analysis, insights and data to clients are satisfied. The majority of these performance obligations are satisfied over the term of the license period, with operating revenues recognized ratably. Certain other Real Assets products, including benchmark reports, are recognized at the point in time when the Company satisfies the performance obligation through delivery to the client.\n68\nTable of Content\ns\nShare-Based Compensation\nCertain of the Company’s employees have received share-based compensation under various compensation programs. The Company’s compensation expense reflects the fair value method of accounting for share-based payments under ASC Subtopic 718-10, “\nCompensation—Stock Compensation.\n” \nStock-based compensation awards include restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance stock units (“PSUs”) and performance stock options (“PSOs”). PSUs are subject to market conditions based on the achievement of multi-year total shareholder return targets and PSOs are subject to performance conditions based on the cumulative results of financial targets. \nThe fair value of RSUs at grant date is measured using the price of MSCI’s common stock. The fair value of PSUs at grant date is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model that creates a normal distribution of future stock prices, which is then used to value the awards based on their individual terms. The fair value of PSOs at grant date is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For PSOs, the grant-date fair value is adjusted for any changes in the probability of achievement of (i) a cumulative revenue performance goal and (ii) a cumulative adjusted EPS performance goal (each weighted at \n50\n%).\nResearch and Development\nThe Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including ASC Subtopic 730-10, “\nResearch and Development\n.” ASC Subtopic 730-10 requires that research and development costs generally be expensed as incurred. The majority of the Company’s research and development costs are incurred in developing, reviewing and enhancing the methodologies and data models offered within its product portfolio by monitoring investment trends and drivers globally, as well as analyzing product-specific needs in areas such as capitalization-weighted, factor and specialized indexes, and instrument valuation, risk modeling, portfolio construction, asset allocation and value-at-risk simulation.\nInternal Use Software\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 350-40, “\nInternal Use Software\n,” and accounts for the cost of computer software developed for internal use by capitalizing qualifying costs, which are substantially incurred during the application development stage. The amounts capitalized primarily relate to internally developed software used to provide services to customers and are included in Intangible Assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition and include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software and payroll and payroll-related costs of employees directly associated with the development activities. Additionally, costs incurred relating to upgrades and enhancements to the software are capitalized if it is determined that these upgrades or enhancements provide additional functionality to the software.\nCapitalized software development costs are typically amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related product, which is typically \nthree\n to \nfive years\n, beginning with the date the software is placed into service.\nCosts incurred in the preliminary and post-implementation stages of MSCI’s products are expensed as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for income taxes is provided for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. The Company elects to account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) in the year the tax is incurred. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within “Provision for income taxes” in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nThe Company regularly evaluates the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it is required to file income tax returns. The Company has recorded additional tax expense related to open tax years, which the Company’s management believes is adequate in relation to the potential for assessments. These amounts have been recorded in “Other non-current liabilities” on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. The Company’s management believes the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition. However, to the extent the Company is required to pay amounts in excess of its reserves, a resolution could have a material impact on its Consolidated Statement of Income for a particular future period. In addition, an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in the effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs.\n69\nTable of Content\ns\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenues represent both cash received and the amounts billed to clients for products and services in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Deferred revenue generally results in ratable recognition of operating revenues over the license or subscription period, as the performance obligations are satisfied.\n \nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company’s clients generally pay subscription fees annually in advance. MSCI’s policy is to record to a receivable when a client is billed. For products and services that are provided in advance of billing, such as for our asset-based fee products, unbilled revenue is included in Accounts Receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.\nThe Company recognizes an allowance for credit losses at the time invoices are sent to clients by applying an estimate of the uncollectable amount based on client profiles, credit considerations and historical write-offs. The Company does not require collateral from clients to mitigate credit risk.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n(in thousands) \nAmount \nBalance as of December 31, 2021\n$\n2,337\n \nAddition to credit loss expense\n910\n \nWrite-offs, net of recoveries\n(\n595\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n2,652\n \nAddition to credit loss expense\n2,196\n \nWrite-offs, net of recoveries\n(\n880\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n3,968\n \nAddition to credit loss expense\n3,990\n \nWrite-offs, net of recoveries\n(\n2,674\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n5,284\n \nGoodwill\nGoodwill is recorded as part of the Company’s acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the acquired net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets. The Company’s goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an impairment test each year, or more often if conditions indicate impairment may have occurred, pursuant to ASC Subtopic 350-10, “\nIntangibles—Goodwill and Other\n.”\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on July 1\nst\n and on an interim basis when certain events and circumstances exist. The test for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, an impairment charge will be recorded up to, but not more than, the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\n \nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2024 on its Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions reporting units, which were also the Company’s operating segments. As of July 1, 2024,the Company performed a quantitative test for impairment and determined that the fair value of all reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values. See Note 13, “Segment Information,” for further descriptions of the operating segments.\nBased on the results of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed and given there were no impairment triggers identified as part of interim assessments, \nno\n impairment of goodwill was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nIntangible Assets\nThe Company amortizes definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company also reviews the useful lives on a periodic basis to determine if the period of economic benefit has \n70\nTable of Content\ns\nchanged. If the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized in an amount equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. There were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company had \nno\n indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets and liabilities of operations having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at year-end exchange rates, and income statement accounts are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of any related tax effects, are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of shareholders’ equity (deficit). Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions incurred in currencies other than the local functional currency are included in non-operating “Other expense (income)” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nLeases\nMSCI leases office space, data centers and certain equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company does not currently have any financing lease arrangements.\nRight of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term adjusted for initial direct costs and lease incentives received or deemed probable of being received. MSCI uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available on the commencement date of the lease in determining the present value of lease payments. The lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\nRight of use assets and associated leasehold improvements are tested for impairment when there is a trigger for impairment testing at the appropriate asset group level. When a trigger exists, the asset group is tested for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the asset group’s carrying value. If the asset group fails the recoverability test, the Company will measure impairment loss as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset group. \nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in “Operating expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In situations where a right of use asset has been impaired, the subsequent amortization of the right of use asset is then recorded on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term and is combined with accretion expense on the lease liability to result in single operating lease cost.\nSome of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation which are accounted for as variable lease amounts but are not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability. Certain leases also require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises or equipment which are also not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability. The Company also subleases a small portion of its leased office space to third parties and thereby applies sublessor accounting. Sublease income is presented in “Operating expenses” as an offset.\n \nProperty, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements\nProperty, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of furniture and fixtures, and computer and communications equipment are accounted for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life, and for leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the lease term.\nTreasury Stock\nThe Company holds repurchased shares of common stock as treasury stock. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of shareholders’ equity (deficit).\n71\nTable of Content\ns\nAccrued Compensation\nA significant portion of the Company’s employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary. The Company makes estimates in determining its accrued compensation and benefits expenses. Accrued cash incentive estimates reflect an assessment of performance versus targets and other key performance indicators at the Company, operating segment and employee level. The Company also reviews compensation and benefits expenses throughout the year to determine how overall performance compares to management’s expectations. These and other factors, including historical performance, are taken into account in accruing discretionary cash compensation estimates quarterly.\nConcentrations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, BlackRock, Inc. accounted for \n10.2\n%, \n9.8\n%, and \n10.3\n% of the Company’s consolidated operating revenues, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, BlackRock, Inc. accounted for \n17.9\n%, \n16.8\n% and \n17.4\n% of the Index segment’s operating revenues, respectively. No single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of operating revenues within Analytics, ESG and Climate or All Other – Private Assets for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include ordinary bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that consist primarily of money market funds with unrestricted daily liquidity and fixed term time deposits.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash primarily relates to security deposits for certain operating leases that are legally restricted and unavailable for our general operations\n.\n2. \nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07 “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” or ASU 2023-07. The amendments in ASU 2023-07 aim to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. ASU 2023-07 was adopted by the Company and is effective for the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and subsequent interim periods. The adoption of ASU 2023-07 expanded certain disclosures but did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-09 “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” or ASU 2023-09. The amendments in ASU 2023-09 aim to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2025. The adoption of ASU 2023-09 will expand our disclosures, but we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2023-09 to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2024-03 “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)” or ASU 2024-03. The amendments in ASU 2024-03 require additional disclosure of the nature of expenses included in the income statement as well as disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented in the income statement. ASU 2024-03 is effective for the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2027 and interim period reporting beginning in fiscal 2028 on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.\n \n3. \nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nMSCI’s operating revenues are reported by product type and each product type may have different timing for recognizing revenue. The Company’s operating revenues types are recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues. The Company also disaggregates operating revenues by segment.\n72\nTable of Content\ns\nThe tables that follow present the disaggregated operating revenues for the periods indicated:\nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2024\nSegments\n(in thousands)\nIndex\nAnalytics\nESG and Climate\nAll Other - Private Assets\nTotal\nOperating Revenues Types\nRecurring subscriptions\n$\n882,367\n \n$\n658,610\n \n$\n318,835\n \n$\n254,633\n \n$\n2,114,445\n \nAsset-based fees\n657,501\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n657,501\n \nNon-recurring\n56,277\n \n16,479\n \n7,766\n \n3,660\n \n84,182\n \nTotal\n$\n1,596,145\n \n$\n675,089\n \n$\n326,601\n \n$\n258,293\n \n$\n2,856,128\n \nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2023\nSegments\n(in thousands)\nIndex\nAnalytics\nESG and Climate\nAll Other - Private Assets\nTotal\nOperating Revenues Types\nRecurring subscriptions\n$\n814,582\n \n$\n603,291\n \n$\n282,351\n \n$\n171,066\n \n$\n1,871,290\n \nAsset-based fees\n557,502\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n557,502\n \nNon-recurring\n79,731\n \n12,665\n \n5,217\n \n2,515\n \n100,128\n \nTotal\n$\n1,451,815\n \n$\n615,956\n \n$\n287,568\n \n$\n173,581\n \n$\n2,528,920\n \nFor the Year Ended December 31, 2022\nSegments\n(in thousands)\nIndex\nAnalytics\nESG and Climate\nAll Other - Private Assets\nTotal\nOperating Revenues Types\nRecurring subscriptions\n$\n729,710\n \n$\n567,004\n \n$\n223,160\n \n$\n139,649\n \n$\n1,659,523\n \nAsset-based fees\n528,127\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n528,127\n \nNon-recurring\n45,372\n \n9,103\n \n5,151\n \n1,322\n \n60,948\n \nTotal\n$\n1,303,209\n \n$\n576,107\n \n$\n228,311\n \n$\n140,971\n \n$\n2,248,598\n \nThe table that follows presents the change in accounts receivable, net of allowances and current deferred revenue between the dates indicated:\n(in thousands)\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances\nDeferred revenue\nOpening (December 31, 2023)\n$\n839,555\n \n$\n1,083,864\n \nClosing (December 31, 2024)\n820,709\n \n1,123,423\n \nIncrease/(decrease)\n$\n(\n18,846\n)\n$\n39,559\n \n(in thousands)\nAccounts receivable, net of allowances\nDeferred revenue\nOpening (December 31, 2022)\n$\n663,236\n \n$\n882,886\n \nClosing (December 31, 2023)\n839,555\n \n1,083,864\n \nIncrease/(decrease)\n$\n176,319\n \n$\n200,978\n \nThe amount of revenue recognized in the period that was included in the opening current deferred revenue, which reflects the contract liability amounts, was $\n1,022.9\n million, $\n836.7\n million and $\n819.9\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 respectively. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company’s deferred revenue was primarily driven by an increase in billings, partially offset by an increase in amortization of deferred revenue to operating revenues.

The Company’s existing \n33.6\n% interest in Burgiss had a fair value at acquisition date of $\n353.2\n million which resulted in a non-taxable gain of $\n143.0\n million which the Company recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2023. The acquisition of Burgiss provides the Company with comprehensive data and deep expertise in private assets, enabling investors to evaluate fundamental information, measure and compare performance, understand exposures, manage risk, and conduct robust analytics.\nThe step acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting and its results are reported within the Private Capital Solutions operating segment within All Other – Private Assets. \nWith the step acquisition, the Company renamed the Burgiss operating segment to Private Capital Solutions. \nPrior to the step acquisition, Burgiss was accounted for as an equity-method investment. Therefore, MSCI did not recognize the proportionate share of Burgiss’ operating revenues, rather, the Company’s proportionate share of the income or loss of Burgiss was reported as a component of other (expense) income, net. A portion of Burgiss’s client agreements do not have automatic renewal clauses at the end of the subscription period. Due to the historically high retention rate, the expectation that a substantial portion of the client agreements will be renewed and the nature of the subscription service, the associated revenue is recorded as recurring subscription revenue.\n74\nTable of Content\ns\nThe table below represents the final purchase price allocation to total assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective estimated fair values as of October 2, 2023 and the associated estimated useful lives of acquired intangibles as of that date.  \n(in thousands) \nEstimated \nUseful Life\nFair Value\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n5,397\n \nAccounts receivable\n25,839\n \nPrepaid Income Taxes\n72\n \nOther current assets\n4,201\n \nProperty, equipment and leasehold improvements, net\n670\n \nRight of use assets\n3,443\n \nOther non-current assets\n487\n \nDeferred revenue\n(\n21,479\n)\nOther current liabilities\n(\n13,705\n)\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\n(\n2,525\n)\nIntangible assets:\nProprietary data\n \n11\n years \n229,900\n \nCustomer relationships\n21\n years\n179,900\n \nAcquired technology and software\n3\n years\n19,000\n \nTrademarks\n1\n year\n900\n \nGoodwill\n617,834\n \nNet assets acquired\n$\n1,049,934\n \nThe Company, with the assistance of third-party valuation experts, calculated the fair values of intangible assets using the relief from royalty method for proprietary data, acquired technology and software and trademarks and the multi-period excess earnings method for customer relationships. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired intangible assets included forecasted cash flows, which were determined based on certain assumptions that included, among others, projected future revenues, and expected market royalty rates, technology obsolescence rates and discount rates. The weighted average amortization period of the acquired intangible assets was \n14.8\n years.\nThe recorded goodwill is primarily attributable to the utilization of the acquired data as well as expanded market opportunities. Goodwill attributable to the acquisition is deductible for federal income tax purposes to the extent of consideration paid.\nRevenue of Burgiss recognized within the consolidated financial statements was $\n105.9\n million and $\n25.4\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOn November 1, 2023 MSCI completed the acquisition of Trove Research Ltd (“Trove”), a carbon markets intelligence provider. Trove is a part of the ESG and Climate operating segment.\nOn January 2, 2024, MSCI completed the acquisition of Fabric RQ, Inc. (“Fabric”), a wealth technology platform specializing in portfolio design, customization and analytics for wealth managers and advisors. Fabric is a part of the Analytics operating segment. The contingent consideration related to Fabric is payable based upon the future product sales of the acquired business. \nOn April 16, 2024, MSCI completed the acquisition of Foxberry Ltd. (“Foxberry”), a front-office index technology platform. Foxberry is a part of the Index operating segment. The contingent consideration related to Foxberry is payable based upon the achievement of integration metrics related to the operation of the platform.\nThe Company recognizes the fair value of contingent consideration at the date of acquisition. The liability associated with any contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value at each reporting date subsequent to the acquisition and changes in the fair value are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of \nIncome. \nThe following table presents the preliminary acquired balances related to the acquisitions of Trove, Fabric and Foxberry:\n75\nTable of Content\ns\n(in thousands, except weighted average amortization period of intangible asset)\nTrove\nFabric\nFoxberry\nAcquisition Date\nNovember 1, 2023\nJanuary 2, 2024\nApril 16, 2024\nCash payments\n$\n37,465\n \n$\n7,959\n \n$\n20,945\n \nDeferred payments\n—\n \n—\n \n2,529\n \nContingent consideration liability\n—\n \n8,146\n \n19,094\n \nAggregate purchase price\n$\n37,465\n \n$\n16,105\n \n$\n42,568\n \nNet tangible assets acquired (liabilities assumed)\n$\n(\n4,787\n)\n$\n(\n1,099\n)\n$\n(\n3,877\n)\nIntangible assets\n7,705\n \n11,300\n \n22,500\n \nGoodwill\n34,547\n \n5,904\n \n23,945\n \nAggregate purchase price\n$\n37,465\n \n$\n16,105\n \n$\n42,568\n \nWeighted average amortization period of intangible assets (years)\n13.0\n9.1\n7.9\nThe fair values of the contingent consideration were determined based on management estimates and assumptions which primarily include forecasted product sales, probability of achievement of certain integration targets and discount rates. The Company classifies these liabilities as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, as the measurement is based on inputs that are not observable in the market. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the contingent consideration was $\n28.6\n million, of which $\n9.4\n million is included in “Other accrued liabilities” and $\n19.2\n million is included in “Other non-current liabilities” on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.\nChanges in the Company’s Level 3 financial liabilities for the periods indicated were as follows:\nYears Ended\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nDecember 31, \n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nAdditions of contingent consideration\n(1)\n27,240\n \n—\n \n—\n \nChange in fair value\n1,407\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPayments\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEnding Balance\n$\n28,647\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n___________________________\n(1)\nReflects balance of contingent consideration at acquisition date fair value.\nThe recorded goodwill for Trove is primarily attributable to expected synergies from the utilization of the acquired data as well as expanded market opportunities.

On January 26, 2024, the Company entered into a Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) amending and restating in its entirety the Company’s prior Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Prior Credit Agreement”). The Credit Agreement makes available to the Company an aggregate of $\n1,250.0\n million of Revolving Loan Commitments under a revolving credit facility (the “ Revolving Credit Facility”), which may be drawn until \nJanuary 26, 2029\n. At the closing of the Credit Agreement, the Company drew $\n336.9\n million on the Revolving Credit Facility and primarily used the proceeds to prepay all senior unsecured Tranche A Term Loans (the “Tranche A Term Loans”) under the term loan A facility (the “TLA Facility”) under the Prior Credit Agreement. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The prepayment of the Tranche A Term Loans and the entry into the Credit Agreement resulted in an approximately $\n1.5\n million\n \nloss on extinguishment related to unamortized debt issuance costs during the three months ended March 31, 2024. The loss on extinguishment was recorded in “Other expense (income)” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had $\n336.9\n million of revolving loans outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company may use the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes (including, working capital and acquisitions and other transactions permitted under the Credit Agreement).\nInterest on the revolving loans under the Credit Agreement accrues, at a variable rate, based on the secured overnight funding rate (“SOFR”) or the alternate base rate (“Base Rate”), plus, in each case, an applicable margin to be determined based on the credit ratings of the Company’s senior, unsecured long-term debt and will be due on each Interest Payment Date (as defined in the Credit Agreement). So long as the credit rating for the Company’s senior, unsecured long-term debt is set at BBB-/BBB- by each of S&P and Fitch, respectively, the applicable margin is \n0.50\n% for Base Rate loans, and \n1.50\n% for SOFR loans.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company carried a net liability of $\n37.3\n million and $\n31.9\n million, respectively, in “Other non-current liabilities” on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition related to its future pension obligations. The fair value of the defined benefit plan assets was $\n31.4\n million and $\n31.8\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company’s retiree benefit plans include defined benefit plans for employees in Switzerland, as well as other countries where MSCI maintains an operating presence.\nOur Switzerland plans are government-mandated retirement funds that provide employees with a minimum investment return, which is determined annually by the Swiss government and was \n1.3\n%, \n1.0\n% and \n1.0\n%, in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Under the Switzerland plans, the Company and our employees are required to make contributions into a fund managed by an independent investment fiduciary. Employer contributions must be in an amount at least equal to the employee’s contribution. Employee contributions are based on the respective employee’s age, salary and chosen contribution scale. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Switzerland defined benefit\n \nplans had a gross pension liability of $\n31.1\n million and $\n30.9\n million, respectively, and plan assets that totaled $\n25.9\n million and $\n27.2\n million, respectively. In the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized net periodic benefit expense of $\n0.4\n million, $\n0.3\n million and $\n0.4\n million, respectively, related to our Switzerland plans. The discount rate for the Switzerland defined benefit pension plan was \n1.00\n% and \n1.40\n%, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe investment strategies of the non-U.S. defined benefit plans vary according to the plan provisions and local laws. The majority of the assets in the non-U.S. plans are in the Switzerland plans. The Switzerland plans are associated with an insured collective retirement foundation, whereby assets are held in trust and the assets are comingled with those of other participating companies. Investment decisions are made by a board of the collective retirement foundation, comprised of participating company representatives and representatives from the insurer. The overall strategy is to manage risk while maximizing total returns.\n \n11. \nSHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nThis note reflects the share repurchases and related activity as well as share-based compensation activity recognized by the Company, for all periods referenced.\nReturn of capital\n \nOn\n October 28, 2024\n, \nthe Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the “2024 Repurchase Program”)\n for the purchase of up to $\n1,500.0\n million worth of shares of MSCI’s common stock \nin addition to the $\n405.4\n million\n of authorization \nthen remaining under a previously existing share repurchase program that was replaced by, and incorporated into, the 2024 Repurchase Program for a total \nof $\n1,905.4\n million of stock repurchase authorization available under the 2024 Repurchase Program.\n82\nTable of Content\ns\nShare repurchases made pursuant to the 2024 Repurchase Program may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time based on market and other conditions.

The accounting guidance for share-based compensation requires measurement of compensation cost for share-based awards at fair value and recognition of compensation cost over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. In connection with awards under its equity-based compensation and benefit plans, the Company is authorized to use newly issued shares or certain shares of common stock held in treasury. \nIn January 2025, the Company granted a portion of its employees awards in the form of RSUs, PSUs, PSOs, and premium-priced stock options (“PPOs”). The total number of units and options granted was \n419,786\n. The aggregate fair value of the awards was $\n129.7\n million. The RSUs granted in 2025 vest at the end of a \nthree-year\n service period. The PSUs granted in 2025 vest at the end of a \nthree-year\n service period, are subject to a \none-year\n sale restriction and are also subject to the achievement of an absolute total shareholder return compounded annual growth rate, measured over a \nthree-year\n period. The PSOs granted in 2025 vest and become exercisable at the end of a \nthree-year\n service period and are subject to a performance condition based on the combined level of achievement of a cumulative revenue performance goal and a cumulative adjusted EPS performance goal, measured over a \nthree-year\n period. The PPOs granted in 2025 vest and become exercisable at the end of a \nfive-year\n service period. All of these awards are subject to forfeiture under specific criteria set in the award agreements.\n84\nTable of Content\ns\nThe following table presents the amount of share-based compensation expense by category for the periods indicated: \nYears Ended\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nDecember 31, \n2022\nCost of revenues\n$\n27,518\n \n$\n19,447\n \n$\n15,404\n \nSelling and marketing\n20,863\n \n17,392\n \n14,218\n \nResearch and development\n15,049\n \n9,625\n \n6,857\n \nGeneral and administrative\n32,935\n \n26,233\n \n20,826\n \nOther expense (income)\n—\n \n346\n \n738\n \nTotal share-based compensation expense\n$\n96,365\n \n$\n73,043\n \n$\n58,043\n \nThe windfall tax benefits for share-based compensation expense related to RSUs and PSUs (together, the “Share-based Awards”) granted to Company employees and to directors who are not employees of the Company were $\n15.7\n million, $\n11.4\n million and $\n28.4\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n104.5\n million of compensation cost related to MSCI unvested share-based awards granted to the Company’s employees and to directors who are not employees of the Company had not yet been recognized. The unrecognized compensation cost relating to unvested stock-based awards expected to vest will be recognized primarily over the next \none\n to \nthree years\n. \nIn connection with awards under its equity-based compensation and benefit plans, the Company is authorized to issue shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2024, \n2.7\n million shares of common stock were available for future grants under these plans.\nShare-based Awards\nCertain Company employees have been granted Share-based Awards pursuant to a share-based compensation plan. Outstanding Share-based Awards include RSUs and PSUs. Recipients of Share-based Awards generally have rights to receive dividend equivalents that are subject to vesting.\nThe Company reports the target number of PSUs granted unless it has determined, based on the actual achievement of performance measures, that an employee will receive a different amount of shares underlying the PSUs, in which case the Company reports the amount of shares employees are likely to receive.\nThe fair value of the PSUs on the award dates were estimated under the Monte Carlo method using the following weighted average assumptions: \nYears Ended \nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nDecember 31, \n2022\nRisk free interest rate\n4.08\n \n%\n3.75\n \n%\n1.42\n \n%\nHistorical stock price volatility\n32.57\n \n%\n41.10\n \n%\n37.29\n \n%\nTerm (in years)\n3.0\n3.0\n3.0\nDiscount of Lack of Marketability\n7.2\n \n%\n9.0\n \n%\n8.0\n \n%\nThe risk-free interest rate was determined based on the yields available on U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield curve as of the valuation dates with a maturity commensurate with the terms.

The U.S. portion of the tax credit carryforwards was $\n22.3\n million and $\n2.1\n \nmillion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of the balance may be utilized over an indefinite life. The non-U.S. portion is comprised of an interest carryforward with a tax value of $\n5.8\n million and $\n10.1\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This carryforward is subject to an annual limitation on utilization over an indefinite life.\nNet operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. were $\n22.8\n million with a tax value of $\n5.7\n million and $\n32.2\n million with a tax value of $\n7.6\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These carryforwards are subject to annual limitations and will begin to expire in 2026. The non-U.S. portion of net operating loss carryforwards was $\n5.6\n million with a tax value of $\n1.4\n million and $\n0.4\n million with a tax value of $\n0.1\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively. The majority of the balance may be utilized over an indefinite life.\nThe Company believes the majority of the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2024 are more likely than not to be realized based on expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates, with the exception of certain tax carryforwards that may not be utilized. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has provided for applicable state income and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it files income tax returns. The Company has established unrecognized tax benefits that the Company believes are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, the Company adjusts unrecognized tax benefits only when more information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change. Based on the current status of income tax audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized benefits may decrease by approximately $\n20.3\n million in the next twelve months as a result of the resolution of tax examinations.\n88\nTable of Content\ns\nThe Company believes the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income for a particular future period and on the Company’s effective tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022: \nYears Ended\nGross unrecognized tax benefits\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nDecember 31, \n2022\nBeginning balance\n$\n33,801\n \n$\n32,523\n \n$\n33,039\n \nIncreases based on tax positions related to the current period\n3,068\n \n5,028\n \n640\n \nIncreases based on tax positions related to prior periods\n5,363\n \n1,961\n \n3,807\n \nDecreases based on tax positions related to prior periods\n(\n427\n)\n—\n \n(\n597\n)\nDecreases related to settlements with taxing authorities\n(\n8,940\n)\n(\n5,711\n)\n(\n4,366\n)\nDecreases related to a lapse of applicable statute of limitations\n(\n552\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nEnding balance\n$\n32,313\n \n$\n33,801\n \n$\n32,523\n \n The Company recognized $\n1.3\n million, $\n2.1\n million and ($\n0.5\n) million interest in the Consolidated Statement of Income with respect to unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Penalties of ($\n1.3\n) million, $\n1.3\n million and ($\n0.3\n) million were recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income and the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of accrued interest, which includes interest related to uncertain tax positions and accrued income tax expense, recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition was $\n3.6\n million, $\n2.5\n million and $\n0.4\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nThe Company is under examination by tax authorities in certain jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions, such as Switzerland, India and states in the U.S. in which the Company has significant operations, such as New York and California. The tax years currently under examination vary by jurisdiction but include years ranging from 2008 onwards.\n13. \nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nASC Subtopic 280-10, \n“Segment Reporting,”\n establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available. This information is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) to allocate resources and assess performance. MSCI’s Chief Executive Officer and its President and Chief Operating Officer, who together serve as the CODM, review financial information on an operating segment basis to make operational decisions and assess financial performance.\nThe CODM measures and evaluates operating segments based on segment operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is used to assess segment performance and guide resource allocation, including decisions related to capital allocations and acquisitions. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is used to monitor actual performance against budget and to establish management's compensation. The CODM also uses Adjusted EBITDA for competitive analysis, benchmarking MSCI's performance against its competitors to evaluate segment performance. Adjusted EBITDA for each segment is calculated by subtracting segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses from segment operating revenues.\nMSCI excludes the following items from segment Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA expenses: provision for income taxes; other expense (income), net; depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements; amortization of intangible assets; and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments. These may include impairments related to sublease of leased property and certain acquisition-related integration and transaction costs that the CODM does not consider when allocating resources among segments or assessing segment performance. While these amounts are excluded from segment Adjusted EBITDA, they are included in reported consolidated net income and are reflected in the reconciliation provided below.\nOperating revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining that segment’s operating results. Expenses not directly attributable to a specific segment are allocated using methodologies, such as time estimates, revenue, headcount, sales targets, data center consumption and other relevant usage measures. Given the integrated structure of MSCI’s business, certain costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Additionally, a segment may utilize content and data produced by another segment without incurring an intersegment charge. Within Adjusted EBITDA expenses by operating segment, there are no categories of expenses regularly provided to the CODM.\n89\nTable of Content\ns\nThe CODM does not receive information about total assets on an operating segment basis. Operating segments do not record intersegment revenues; therefore, none are reported. The accounting policies used for segment reporting are consistent with those applied to MSCI as a whole.\nMSCI has \nfive\n operating segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions. These are presented as \nthree\n reportable segments: Index, Analytics and ESG and Climate. The operating segments Real Assets and Private Capital Solutions do not individually meet the segment reporting thresholds and have been combined into All Other – Private Assets.\nPrior to the step acquisition of Burgiss on October 2, 2023, the Company’s ownership interest in Burgiss was classified as an equity-method investment. Therefore, All Other – Private Assets did not include the Company’s proportionate share of operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA related to Burgiss. The Company’s proportionate share of the income or loss from its equity-method investment in Burgiss was not a component of Adjusted EBITDA as it was reported as a component of other (expense) income, net. Following the acquisition, the consolidated results of Burgiss were included in the Company’s Private Capital Solutions operating segment.\nThe Index reportable segment provides equity and fixed income indexes. The indexes are used across the investment process, including the development of indexed financial products (e.g., ETFs, mutual funds, annuities, futures, options, structured products, and over-the-counter derivatives), performance benchmarking, portfolio construction and rebalancing, and asset allocation. \nThe Analytics reportable segment provides risk management, performance attribution, and portfolio management content, applications and services. These offerings give clients an integrated view of risk and return, along with tools for analyzing market, credit, liquidity, counterparty and climate risks across all major asset classes and time horizons – short, medium and long term. Clients can access Analytics tools and content through MSCI’s proprietary applications and application programming interfaces (APIs), third-party applications or directly via their own platforms. Additionally, the Analytics segment offers various managed services to enhance client efficiency. These services include consolidating portfolio data from multiple sources, reviewing and reconciling input data and results, and providing customized reporting.\nThe ESG and Climate reportable segment provides products and services designed to help institutional investors understand the impact of ESG and climate considerations on the long-term risk and return of their portfolios and individual security-level investments. This segment also offers data, ratings, research and tools to assist investors in navigating regulatory changes, meeting evolving client demands and integrating ESG and climate factors into their investment processes.\nThe Real Assets operating segment delivers data, benchmarks, return-analytics, climate assessments and market insights for tangible assets such as real estate and infrastructure\n. Its performance and risk analytics services range from enterprise-wide assessments to property-specific analysis. Additionally, the operating segment offers business intelligence products for real estate owners, managers, developers and brokers worldwide.\nThe Private Capital Solutions operating segment provides\n a suite of tools to support private asset investors in mission-critical workflows. These include sourcing terms and conditions, evaluating operating performance of underlying portfolio companies,\n \nmanaging risk and other activities related to private capital investing\n.\n90\nTable of Content\ns\nThe following table presents operating revenues, Adjusted EBITDA expenses and segment profitability and a reconciliation to net income for the periods indicated:\nYears Ended\n(in thousands)\nDecember 31, \n2024\nDecember 31, \n2023\nDecember 31, \n2022\nOperating revenues\nIndex\n$\n1,596,145\n \n$\n1,451,815\n \n$\n1,303,209\n \nAnalytics\n675,089\n \n615,956\n \n576,107\n \nESG and Climate\n326,601\n \n287,568\n \n228,311\n \nTotal reportable segment operating revenues\n2,597,835\n \n2,355,339\n \n2,107,627\n \nAll Other - Private Assets\n258,293\n \n173,581\n \n140,971\n \nTotal operating revenues\n2,856,128\n \n2,528,920\n \n2,248,598\n \nAdjusted EBITDA expense\nIndex\n374,091\n \n344,842\n \n317,802\n \nAnalytics\n346,794\n \n341,081\n \n328,212\n \nESG and Climate\n221,893\n \n195,890\n \n167,217\n \nTotal reportable segment Adjusted EBITDA expense\n942,778\n \n881,813\n \n813,231\n \nAdjusted EBITDA\nIndex Adjusted EBITDA\n1,222,054\n \n1,106,973\n \n985,407\n \nAnalytics Adjusted EBITDA\n328,295\n \n274,875\n \n247,895\n \nESG and Climate Adjusted EBITDA\n104,708\n \n91,678\n \n61,094\n \nTotal reportable segment profitability\n1,655,057\n \n1,473,526\n \n1,294,396\n \nPlus:\nAll Other - Private Assets\n(1)\n61,427\n \n49,425\n \n35,275\n \nLess:\nAmortization of intangible assets\n164,037\n \n114,429\n \n91,079\n \nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and\n   leasehold improvements\n16,978\n \n21,009\n \n26,893\n \nImpairment related to sublease of leased property\n—\n \n477\n \n—\n \nAcquisition-related integration and transaction costs\n(2)\n6,951\n \n2,427\n \n4,059\n \nOperating income\n1,528,518\n \n1,384,609\n \n1,207,640\n \nOther expense (income), net\n172,350\n \n15,548\n \n163,799\n \nIncome before provision for income taxes\n1,356,168\n \n1,369,061\n \n1,043,841\n \nProvision for income taxes\n247,040\n \n220,469\n \n173,268\n \nNet income\n$\n1,109,128\n \n$\n1,148,592\n \n$\n870,573\n \n______________________________\n(1)\nRevenue less segment expenses from segments below the segment reporting thresholds are attributable to Private Capital Solutions and Real Assets operating segments.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement of the Company, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation, as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective.\n(b). Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of our assets,\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company, and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria described in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nBased on this assessment, management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which appears on page \n59\n of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(c). Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n93\nTable of Content\ns\nItem 9B.    \nOther Information\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, none of the Company’s directors or officers, as defined in Section 16 of the Exchange Act, \nadopted\n, modified or \nterminated\n a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or a “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act, except as set forth below.\nOn \nDecember 4, 2024\n, \nC.D. Baer Pettit\n, the \nPresident and Chief Operating Officer\n of the Company and a member of its Board of Directors, \nadopted\n a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act (the “Trading Plan”). The Trading Plan provides for the potential sale of up to \n20,000\n shares of the Company’s common stock and will remain in effect until \nJune 30, 2025\n, subject to early termination in accordance with its terms.\nItem 9C.    \nDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdiction that Prevent Inspections\nNone.\n94\nTable of Content\ns\nPART III\nItem 10.    \nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance\nWe maintain insider trading policies and procedures governing the purchase, sale and/or other dispositions of our securities by directors, officers and employees that we believe are reasonably designed to promote compliance with insider trading laws, rules and regulations, as well as NYSE listing standards. In addition, it is our policy to comply with applicable securities and state laws, including insider trading laws, when engaging in transactions in our securities. A copy of our insider trading policy is filed as Exhibit 19.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nExcept for the information relating to our insider trading policies and procedures set forth in the preceding paragraph and our Executive Officers set forth in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we incorporate by reference the information responsive to this Item appearing in our Proxy Statement, which will be filed no later than 120 days after December 31, 2024.\nInformation regarding our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and Corporate Governance Policies is incorporated herein by reference from our Proxy Statement, which will be filed no later than 120 days after December 31, 2024. Any amendments to, or waivers from, a provision of our Code of Ethics that apply to our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons performing similar functions and that relates to any element of the Code of Ethics enumerated in paragraph (b) of Item 406 of Regulation S-K shall be disclosed by posting such information on our website at www.msci.com. Information contained on our website is not deemed part of or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report filed with the SEC.\nItem 11.    \nExecutive Compensation\nWe incorporate by reference the information responsive to this Item appearing in our Proxy Statement, which will be filed no later than 120 days after December 31, 2024.\nItem 12.    \nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\nWe incorporate by reference the additional information responsive to this Item appearing in our Proxy Statement, which will be filed no later than 120 days after December 31, 2024.\nEquity Compensation Plans\nOn February 18, 2016, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation & Talent Management Committee of the Board of Directors (the “Compensation Committee”), approved the MSCI Inc. 2016 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan (the “Directors Plan”), a cash and equity incentive compensation plan that was approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. The Directors Plan replaced the Company’s then existing non-employee director compensation plan, the MSCI Inc. Independent Directors’ Equity Compensation Plan (the “2011 Plan”). The total number of shares authorized to be awarded under the Directors Plan is 352,460, which is equal to the number of shares that remained available for issuance under the 2011 Plan. Under the MSCI Inc. Non-Employee Directors Deferral Plan, directors may elect to defer receipt of all or any portion of any shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of any stock unit or any retainer elected to be paid in shares of our common stock until (i) 60 days following separation of service or (ii) the earlier of a specified date or 60 days following separation of service. \nOn February 18, 2016, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the MSCI Inc. 2016 Omnibus Plan (“Omnibus Plan”), an equity incentive compensation plan that was approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. The Omnibus Plan replaced the Company’s then existing equity compensation plan, the MSCI Inc. Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (as amended, the “2007 Plan”). Compensation paid to the Company’s executive officers historically complied with the performance-based compensation exception under 162(m) of the IRC (“162(m)”) by being granted pursuant to the MSCI Inc. Performance Formula and Incentive Plan (the “Performance Plan”). Shareholder approval of the Omnibus Plan constituted approval of the material terms of the performance goals under the Omnibus Plan for purposes of 162(m). In light of the final Section 162(m) regulations published in December 2020, which, among other things, eliminated the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m), the Compensation Committee determined to cease awarding compensation to the Company’s executive officers under the Performance Plan starting with calendar year 2021.\nPursuant to the Omnibus Plan, the Company reserved 7,565,483 shares of common stock for issuance; plus any additional shares which become available due to forfeiture, expiration or cancellation of outstanding awards, which were registered under the Securities Act following approval by the Company’s shareholders. This is in addition to currently outstanding awards under the 2007 Plan. The Omnibus Plan permits the Compensation Committee to make grants of a variety of equity-based awards (such as stock \n95\nTable of Content\ns\noptions, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance awards and other stock-based awards) totaling up to 7,565,483 and other cash-based awards to eligible recipients, including employees and consultants. No awards will be granted under the Omnibus Plan after the earliest to occur of (i) April 28, 2026, (ii) the maximum number of shares available for issuance having been issued and (iii) the Board of Directors terminating the Omnibus Plan in accordance with its terms. \nThe following table presents certain information with respect to our equity compensation plans at December 31, 2024:\nNumber of securities\nto be issued upon\nexercise of\noutstanding options,\nwarrants and rights\n(a)\nWeighted-average\nexercise price of\noutstanding options,\nwarrants and rights\n(b) (3)\nNumber of securities\nremaining available\nfor future issuance\nunder equity\ncompensation plans\n(excluding securities\nreflected in column(a))\n(c)\nEquity Compensation Plans Approved by Security Holders\nMSCI Inc. 2016 Omnibus Plan\nRestricted Stock Units (“RSUs”)\n215,283\nN/A\nPerformance Stock Units (“PSUs”)\n(1)\n595,648\nN/A\nPerformance Stock Options (“PSOs”)\n(2)\n739,026\n$570.19\nTotal MSCI Inc. 2016 Omnibus Plan\n1,549,957\nN/A\n2,485,193\nMSCI Inc. 2016 Non-Employee Directors Compensation Plan (RSUs)\n4,569\nN/A\n262,853\nEquity Compensation Plans Not Approved by Security Holders\n—\nN/A\n—\nTotal\n1,554,526\nN/A\n2,748,046\n______________________________\n(1)\nThe numbers included for PSUs in column (a) reflect the maximum payout.
