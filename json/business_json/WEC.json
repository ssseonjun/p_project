    "item1": "Item 1. Business – E. Regulation.\nThe issuance of securities by our utility companies is subject to the approval of the applicable state commissions or FERC. Additionally, with respect to the public offering of securities, we, WE, and WPS file registration statements with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (1933 Act). The amounts of securities authorized by the appropriate regulatory authorities, as well as the securities registered under the 1933 Act, are closely monitored and appropriate filings are made to ensure flexibility in the capital markets.\nAt December 31, 2024, our current liabilities exceeded our current assets by $1,930.2 million. We do not expect this to have an impact on our liquidity as we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents, our available capacity under existing revolving credit facilities, cash generated from ongoing operations, and access to the capital markets are adequate to meet our short-term and long-term cash requirements.\nSee Note 11, Common Equity, Note 13, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, and Note 14, Long-Term Debt, for more information about our common stock activity, commercial paper, credit facilities, and debt securities. \nInvestments in Outside Trusts\nWe maintain investments in outside trusts to fund the obligation to provide pension and certain OPEB benefits to current and future retirees. As of December 31, 2024, these trusts had investments of approximately $3.5 billion, consisting of fixed income and equity securities, that are subject to the volatility of the stock market and interest rates. The performance of existing plan assets, long-term discount rates, changes in assumptions, and other factors could affect our future contributions to the plans, our financial position if our accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of the plan assets, and future results of operations related to changes in pension and OPEB expense and the assumed rate of return. For additional information, see Note 20, Employee Benefits.\nCapitalization Structure\nThe following table shows our capitalization structure as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as well as an adjusted capitalization structure that we believe is consistent with how a majority of the rating agencies currently view our Junior Notes:\n2024\n2023\n(in millions)\nActual\nAdjusted \n(1)\nActual\nAdjusted\n (2)\nCommon shareholders' equity\n$\n12,395.0\n \n$\n12,770.0\n \n$\n11,724.2 \n$\n11,974.2 \nPreferred stock of subsidiary\n30.4\n \n30.4\n \n30.4 \n30.4 \nLong-term debt (including current portion)\n18,907.1\n \n18,532.1\n \n16,631.1 \n16,381.1 \nShort-term debt\n1,116.6\n \n1,116.6\n \n2,020.9 \n2,020.9 \nTotal capitalization\n$\n32,449.1\n \n$\n32,449.1\n \n$\n30,406.6 \n$\n30,406.6 \nTotal debt\n$\n20,023.7\n \n$\n19,648.7\n \n$\n18,652.0 \n$\n18,402.0 \nRatio of debt to total capitalization\n61.7\n \n%\n60.6\n \n%\n61.3 \n%\n60.5 \n%\n(1)    \nIncluded in long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2024, was $750.0 million principal amount of WEC Energy Group's 2024 Junior Notes (2024A Junior Notes and 2024B Junior Notes, collectively) due 2055. The adjusted presentation at December 31, \n2024 Form 10-K\n82\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of Contents\n2024 attributes $375.0 million of the Junior Notes to common equity and $375.0 million to long-term debt, similar to how the majority of rating agencies treat them. \n(2)    \nIncluded in long-term debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023, was $500.0 million principal amount of the 2007 Junior Notes. The adjusted presentation at December 31, 2023 attributes $250.0 million of the 2007 Junior Notes to common equity and $250.0 million to long-term debt, similar to how the majority of rating agencies treat them. \nThe adjusted presentation of our consolidated capitalization structure is included as a complement to our capitalization structure presented in accordance with GAAP. Management evaluates and manages our capitalization structure, including our total debt to total capitalization ratio, using the GAAP calculation as adjusted to reflect the treatment of the 2024 Junior Notes and 2007 Junior Notes by the majority of rating agencies. Therefore, we believe the non-GAAP adjusted presentation reflecting this treatment is useful and relevant to investors in understanding how management and the rating agencies evaluate our capitalization structure.\nDebt Covenants\nCertain of our short-term and long-term debt agreements contain financial covenants that we must satisfy, including debt to capitalization ratios and debt service coverage ratios. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all such covenants related to outstanding short-term and long-term debt. We expect to be in compliance with all such debt covenants for the foreseeable future. See Note 11, Common Equity, Note 13, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, and Note 14, Long-Term Debt, for more information.\nCredit Rating Risk\nCash collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties, including postings related to exchange-traded contracts, and cash collateral posted by external parties were immaterial as of December 31, 2024. From time to time, we may enter into commodity contracts that could require collateral or a termination payment in the event of a credit rating change to below BBB- at S&P Global Ratings, a division of S&P Global Inc., and/or Baa3 at Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. If WE had a sub-investment grade credit rating at December 31, 2024, it could have been required to post $103 million of additional collateral or other assurances pursuant to the terms of a PPA. We also have other commodity contracts that, in the event of a credit rating downgrade, could result in a reduction of our unsecured credit granted by counterparties.\nIn addition, access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality. Any credit ratings downgrade could impact our ability to access capital markets.\nIn June 2024, Moody's changed the rating outlook for PGL to negative from stable as a result of the November 2023 rate order and the May 2024 limited re-hearing. The change in rating outlook has not had, and we do not believe that it will have, a material impact on our ability to access capital markets. Moody's affirmed PGL's ratings including its Aa3 senior secured rating and its P-1 short term rating for commercial paper. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on the outcome of the rate order.\nSubject to other factors affecting the credit markets as a whole, we believe our current ratings should provide a significant degree of flexibility in obtaining funds on competitive terms. However, these security ratings reflect the views of the rating agency only. An explanation of the significance of these ratings may be obtained from the rating agency. Such ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities. Any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency.\nFACTORS AFFECTING RESULTS, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCompetitive Markets\nElectric Utility Industry\nThe FERC supports large RTOs, which directly impacts the structure of the wholesale electric market. Due to the FERC's support of RTOs, MISO uses the MISO Energy Markets to carry out its operations, including the use of LMPs to value electric transmission congestion and losses. Increased competition in the retail and wholesale markets, which may result from restructuring efforts, could have a significant and adverse financial impact on us.\n2024 Form 10-K\n83\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nWisconsin\nElectric utility revenues in Wisconsin are regulated by the PSCW. The PSCW continues to maintain the position that the question of whether to implement electric retail competition in Wisconsin should ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin legislature. No such legislation has been introduced in Wisconsin to date, and it is uncertain when, if at all, retail choice might be implemented in Wisconsin. \nMichigan\nMichigan has adopted a limited retail choice program. Under Michigan law, our retail customers may choose an alternative electric supplier to provide power supply service. As a result, some of our small retail customers have switched to an alternative electric supplier. At December 31, 2024, Michigan law limited customer choice to 10% of an electric utility's Michigan retail load. Our iron ore mine customer, Tilden, is exempt from this 10% cap based on current law, but Tilden is required under a long-term agreement to purchase electric power from UMERC through March 2039. In addition, certain load increases by facilities already using an alternative electric supplier can still be serviced by their alternative electric supplier, when various conditions exist, even if the cap has already been met. When a customer switches to an alternative electric supplier, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions for the customer.\nNatural Gas Utility Industry\nWe offer natural gas transportation services to our customers that elect to purchase natural gas directly from a third-party supplier. Since these transportation customers continue to use our distribution systems to transport natural gas to their facilities, we earn distribution revenues from them. As such, the loss of revenue associated with the cost of natural gas that our transportation customers purchase from third-party suppliers has little impact on our net income, as it is substantially offset by an equal reduction to natural gas costs. \nWisconsin\nOur Wisconsin utilities offer both natural gas transportation service and interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change. \nDue to the PSCW's previous proceedings on natural gas industry regulation in a competitive environment, the PSCW currently provides all Wisconsin customer classes with competitive markets the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier. All of our Wisconsin non-residential customer classes have competitive market choices and, therefore, can purchase natural gas directly from either a third-party supplier or their local natural gas utility. Since third-party suppliers can be used in Wisconsin, the PSCW has also adopted standards for transactions between a utility and its natural gas marketing affiliates. \nWe are currently unable to predict the impact, if any, of potential future industry restructuring on our results of operations or financial position.\nIllinois\nAbsent extraordinary circumstances, potential competitors are not allowed to construct competing natural gas distribution systems in the service territories for PGL and NSG. A charter from the State of Illinois gives PGL the right to provide natural gas distribution service in the City of Chicago as a public utility. Further, the \"first in the field\" and public interest standards limit the ability of potential competitors to operate in an existing utility service territory. In addition, we believe it would be impractical to construct competing duplicate distribution facilities due to the high cost of installation.\nSince 2002, PGL and NSG have, under ICC-approved tariffs, provided their customers with the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier. There are no state laws requiring PGL and NSG to make this choice option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our Illinois customers under tariff, ICC approval would be needed to withdraw those tariffs.\nAn interstate pipeline may seek to provide transportation service directly to our Illinois end users, which would bypass our natural gas transportation service. However, PGL and NSG have anti-bypass tariffs approved by the ICC, which allow them to negotiate rates \n2024 Form 10-K\n84\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nwith customers that are potential bypass candidates to help ensure that such customers continue to use utility transportation service.\nMinnesota\nNatural gas utilities in the state of Minnesota do not have exclusive franchise service territories and, as a matter of law and policy, natural gas utilities may compete for new customers. However, natural gas utilities have customarily avoided competing for existing customers of other utilities, as there would be duplicative utility facilities and/or increased costs to customers. If this approach were to change, it could lead to a greater level of competition amongst utilities to obtain customers and potentially adversely impact our results of operations.\nMERC offers both natural gas transportation service and interruptible natural gas sales to enable customers to better manage their energy costs. Customers continue to switch between firm system supply, interruptible system supply, and transportation service each year as the economics and service options change. MERC has provided its commercial and industrial customers with the option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier since 2006. We are not required by the MPUC or state law to make this choice option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our Minnesota commercial and industrial customers, we would need MPUC approval to eliminate it.\nMichigan\nThe option to choose a third-party natural gas supplier has been provided to UMERC’s natural gas customers (formerly WPS’s Michigan natural gas customers) since the late 1990s and MGU's customers since 2005. We are not required by the MPSC or state law to make this choice option available to customers, but since this option is currently provided to our Michigan customers, we would need MPSC approval to eliminate it.\nRegulatory, Legislative, and Legal Matters\nRegulatory Recovery\nOur utilities account for their regulated operations in accordance with accounting guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC. Our rates are determined by various regulatory commissions. See Item 1. Business – E. Regulation for more information on these commissions.\nRegulated entities are allowed to defer certain costs that would otherwise be charged to expense if the regulated entity believes the recovery of those costs is probable. We record regulatory assets pursuant to generic and/or specific orders issued by our regulators. Recovery of the deferred costs in future rates is subject to the review and approval by those regulators. We assume the risks and benefits of ultimate recovery of these items in future rates. If the recovery of the deferred costs, including those referenced below, is not approved by our regulators, the costs would be charged to income in the current period. Regulators can impose liabilities on a prospective basis for amounts previously collected from customers and for amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers. We record these items as regulatory liabilities. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information on our regulatory assets and liabilities. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information regarding recent and pending rate proceedings, orders, and investigations involving our utilities.\nUncollectible Expense Adjustment Rider\nThe rates of PGL and NSG include a UEA rider for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates. The UEA rider is subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs are reviewed for accuracy and prudency by the ICC. In May 2023, the ICC issued a written order on PGL's and NSG's 2018 UEA rider reconciliation. The order required a $15.4 million and $0.7 million refund to ratepayers at PGL and NSG, respectively. These amounts were refunded over a period of nine months, which began on September 1, 2023. In July 2023, PGL and NSG petitioned the Illinois Appellate Court for review of the ICC order. On November 7, 2024, the Illinois Appellate Court issued an opinion affirming the ICC order and the related disallowance. PGL and NSG petitioned the Illinois Supreme Court on December 12, 2024 seeking review and reversal of the May 2023 order. \nAs of December 31, 2024, there can be no assurance that all costs incurred under the UEA rider during the open reconciliation years, which include 2019 through 2024, will be deemed recoverable by the ICC. The combined annual costs of PGL and NSG included in \n2024 Form 10-K\n85\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nthe rider, which reflect uncollectible write-offs in excess of what is recovered in base rates, have ranged from $10 million to $40 million during these open reconciliation years. Disallowances by the ICC, if any, could be material and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nQualifying Infrastructure Plant Rider\nIn January 2014, the ICC approved PGL's use of the QIP rider as a recovery mechanism for costs incurred related to investments in QIP. This rider, which was in effect until December 1, 2023, continues to be subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs are reviewed for accuracy and prudency. In August 2024, the ICC issued a final order on PGL's 2016 annual reconciliation, which included a disallowance of $14.8 million of certain capital costs. PGL recorded a pre-tax charge to income of $25.3 million during the third quarter of 2024 related to the disallowance and the previously recognized return on and of these investments. The charge was recorded on the income statement as a $12.9 million reduction in revenues for the amounts previously collected from customers, a $12.1 million increase to operating expenses for the impairment of PGL's property, plant, and equipment, and a $0.3 million increase to interest expense related to the amounts due to customers. On October 25, 2024, PGL filed a petition with the Illinois Appellate Court for review of the ICC's August order. \nIn March 2024, PGL filed its 2023 reconciliation with the ICC, which, along with the reconciliations from 2017 through 2022, is still pending. The aggregate capital costs included in the rider during the open reconciliation years, which include 2017 through 2023, along with any previously recognized return on these investments, totaled approximately $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2024. There can be no assurance that all of these costs and the previously recognized returns will be deemed recoverable by the ICC. Further disallowances by the ICC, if any, could be material and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIllinois Proceedings\nIn the PGL rate order issued by the ICC in November 2023, the ICC ordered PGL to pause spending on its SMP until the ICC completed a proceeding to determine the optimal method for replacing aging natural gas infrastructure and a prudent investment level. In accordance with the written order, the ICC initiated the proceeding in January 2024. On February 20, 2025, the ICC issued an order setting expectations for PGL's prospective operations under its SMP. The ICC directed us to focus on replacing all cast and ductile iron pipe that has a diameter under 36 inches by January 1, 2035. The ICC also indicated that failure to comply with this directive could subject us to civil penalties under Illinois statute. We are evaluating the impact of this order on our operations and capital plan.\nIn March 2024, the ICC initiated a statewide \"Future of Gas\" proceeding. The goal of this proceeding is to explore the issues involved with decarbonization of the gas distribution system in Illinois and recommend any future ICC action or legislative changes needed. It includes the formal exploration and consideration of the role of natural gas in the future, including in the context of the state’s environmental and energy policy goals. The proceeding includes a broad range of stakeholders, including Illinois utilities and other interested parties. The “Future of Gas” proceeding is expected to be completed in 2026. At this time, we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this proceeding or the resulting impact to our natural gas operations in Illinois. Future natural gas investment opportunities in Illinois could be negatively impacted depending upon the outcome.\n See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information regarding the November 2023 ICC rate order.\nChicago Decarbonization Efforts\nThe CABO was introduced at a meeting of the Chicago city council held in January 2024. If approved, this ordinance would set an indoor emissions standard that would require zero-to-low-emission energy systems in newly built commercial and residential buildings and major building additions in the city of Chicago. The proposed emission standards would effectively prohibit the use of natural gas in new buildings and homes and require electric heat and appliances. The CABO would not impact existing homes and businesses. In addition, certain buildings and equipment, such as hospitals, commercial kitchens, and back-up generators, would be exempt from the new emission limits.\nIn response to the CABO, a resolution was also introduced that would require the formation of a working group comprised of various subject matter experts to analyze the costs of converting buildings from natural gas to electricity, the costs for additional electric generation capacity needed for future building conversions, and the impact of shifting natural gas system costs from new construction to existing buildings if electrification measures are adopted. If the resolution is passed, this analysis would need to be completed prior to the adoption of any decarbonization initiatives, such as the CABO.\n2024 Form 10-K\n86\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nIf approved by the city council, the CABO is expected to become effective one year after the approval date. PGL's future natural gas operations could be materially adversely impacted if the CABO is passed.\nPetitions Before PSCW Regarding Third-Party Financed Distributed Energy Resources\nIn May 2022, a petition was filed with the PSCW requesting a declaratory ruling that the owner of a third-party financed DER is not a \"public utility\" as defined under Wisconsin law and, therefore, is not subject to the PSCW’s jurisdiction under any statute or rule regulating public utilities. The party that filed the petition provides financing to its customers for installation of DERs (including solar panels and energy storage) on the customer’s property. A DER is connected to the host customer’s utility meter and is used for the customer’s energy needs. It may also be connected to the grid for distribution.\nIn December 2022, the PSCW granted the petitioner’s request for a declaratory ruling in part, finding that the owner of the third-party financed DER at issue in the petitioner’s brief is not a public utility under Wisconsin law, but declining to issue the petitioner’s request for a broader declaratory ruling that the petitioner would not be regulated as a \"public utility\". \nUpon appeal, in April 2024, the Dane County Circuit Court reversed the PSCW’s decision, finding that the PSCW erroneously interpreted the definition of \"public utility,\" and the evidence did not support its determination that the lease at issue in the petition did not involve the sale of electricity to the \"public\" under Wisconsin law. The case was remanded to the PSCW for further review. Although the PSCW issued an order in June 2024 to reopen the docket to consider modifications, the project lease originally at issue was no longer going forward, and so in October 2024 the PSCW issued an order declining to issue any declaratory ruling. \nMeanwhile, in June 2024, the party that filed the May 2022 PSCW petition appealed the Dane County Circuit Court’s April 2024 decision to the Wisconsin Court of Appeals. That appeal was in briefing when the PSCW issued its October 2024 order, which left the Court of Appeals with no agency decision to review. Based on this and the fact that the underlying project was no longer going forward, a motion to dismiss the appeal was granted by the Court of Appeals in February 2025. At this time we do not expect any material impact on our business operations.\nUyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\nThe CBP issued a WRO in June 2021, applicable to certain silica-based products originating from the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China (Xinjiang), such as polysilicon, included in the manufacturing of solar panels. In June 2022, the WRO was superseded by the implementation of the UFLPA. The UFLPA establishes a rebuttable presumption that any imports wholly or partially manufactured in Xinjiang are prohibited from entering the United States. While our suppliers have been able to provide the CBP sufficient documentation to meet WRO and UFLPA compliance requirements, and we expect the same will be true for subsequent projects, we cannot currently predict what, if any, long-term impact the UFLPA will have on the overall supply of solar panels into the United States and whether we will experience any further impacts to the timing and cost of solar projects included in our long-term capital plan. \nIn January 2025, the Department of Homeland Security announced the addition of several more Chinese businesses to the UFLPA, including five solar supply chain providers. We are working to avoid doing business with these companies and remain in compliance with the UFLPA.\nUnited States Department of Commerce Complaints\nThe solar panel industry continues to experience uncertainty resulting from AD and CVD investigations involving four southeast Asian countries including Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, and Cambodia. \nIn August 2023, the DOC issued a final decision regarding an AD/CVD petition filed by a California-based company alleging that Chinese manufacturers were shifting products to the four southeast Asian countries to avoid tariffs required on products imported from China and requesting that the DOC conduct a country-wide inquiry into each country. In its final decision, the DOC determined that circumvention was occurring in each of the four Southeast Asian countries noted above. Duties began to be applied to certain imports of solar cells from Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia after expiration of the 24-month tariff moratorium on June 6, 2024. In addition, in response to its findings, the DOC promulgated new regulations that imposed enhanced duties in certain circumstances, including when the USITC determines there is a reasonable indication the domestic solar industry is materially or potentially injured because of imported products that violate certain fair trade laws.\n2024 Form 10-K\n87\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nIn April 2024, a coalition of several U.S. producers of solar panels filed a petition with the DOC requesting new tariffs on imports from the same four Southeast Asian countries. The group alleged that some Chinese companies had moved their solar operations to avoid penalties implemented after the expiration of the moratorium. In May 2024, in response to the petition, the DOC initiated a new AD/CVD investigation of solar panels from the four southeast Asian countries. \nIn April 2024, the USITC began a preliminary investigation and, in June 2024, issued a preliminary determination that there is a reasonable indication imports of solar panels from the four Southeast Asian countries have caused injury to the U.S. solar industry. Based on the USITC’s preliminary decision, the DOC began an investigation and, in October and November 2024, announced preliminary affirmative determinations in its CVD and AD investigations, respectively, and set preliminary duties on imports from the four southeast Asian countries. The DOC and USITC are expected to make final determinations in the second quarter of 2025, which could result in enhanced duties, including retroactive duties in certain circumstances.\n \nThe Biden Administration invoked the Defense Production Act to accelerate the production of solar panels in the U.S.; however, final determinations by the DOC and/or USITC may have an adverse impact on the solar industry overall. Additionally, there is uncertainty with respect to how WROs applied to panels under previous complaints would be affected.\nAs a result of these investigations, the solar industry overall has experienced higher costs of materials as well as delays. Some of these impacts have already been reflected in the estimated cost and in-service dates for certain of our solar projects. We are continuing to assess the potential impact from the preliminary determinations on our business and results of operations.\nInfrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act\nIn November 2021, former President Biden signed into law the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provides for approximately $1.2 trillion of federal spending over a five year period, including approximately $85 billion for investments in power, utilities, and renewables infrastructure across the United States. We believe that funding from this Act would support the work we are doing to reduce GHG emissions, increase EV charging, and strengthen and protect the energy grid. Funding in the Act could also help to expand emerging technologies, like hydrogen and carbon management, as we continue the transition to a clean energy future to the benefit of our customers, the communities we serve, and our company.\nIn August 2022, former President Biden signed into law the IRA, which provides for $258 billion in energy-related provisions over a 10-year period. The provisions of the IRA are intended to, among other things, lower gasoline and electricity prices, incentivize domestic clean energy investment, manufacturing, and production, and promote reductions in carbon emissions. We believe that we and our customers can benefit from the IRA’s provisions that extend tax benefits for renewable technologies, increase or restore higher rates for PTCs, add an option to claim PTCs for solar projects, expand qualified ITC facilities to include standalone energy storage, and its provision to allow companies to transfer tax credits generated from renewable projects. \nUnder the IRA transferability option, we entered into an agreement in 2024 to sell substantially all of our 2024 PTCs to a third party. Additionally, in October 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell the majority of our 2025 PTCs to a third party. See Note 1(q), Income Taxes, for more information about the impact of these sales during 2024. The IRA also implements a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases. Although significant regulatory guidance is expected on the tax provisions in the IRA, we currently believe the provisions on alternative minimum tax and stock repurchases will not have a material impact on us. Overall, we believe the IRA will help reduce our cost of investing in projects that will support our commitment to reduce emissions and provide customers affordable, reliable, and clean energy over the longer term.\nIn January 2025, pursuant to an executive order issued by the new presidential administration, disbursement of funds under these two Acts was paused until agency heads can determine whether grants, loans contracts, and other disbursements are consistent with the new administration's energy policy. Agency heads must consult with the Office of Management and Budget and the National Economic Council prior to any funding being disbursed. The new policy encourages use of domestic energy sources including oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical minerals, and nuclear, promotes consumer choice of goods and appliances, aims to boost American workers and businesses, eliminates the EV mandate, and limits regulations that apply to the energy industry. The executive order did not impact the IRA's provisions for tax credits and the transferability option.\n2024 Form 10-K\n88\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nReturn on Equity Incentive for Membership in a Transmission Organization\nThe FERC currently allows transmission utilities, including ATC, to increase their ROE by 50 basis points as an incentive for membership in a transmission organization, such as MISO. This incentive was established to stimulate infrastructure development and to support the evolving electric grid. However, a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking was issued by the FERC on April 15, 2021, proposing to limit the 50 basis point increase in ROE to only be available to transmission utilities initially joining a transmission organization for the first three years of membership. If this proposal becomes a final rule, ATC would be required to submit, within 30 days of the final rule's effective date, a compliance filing eliminating the 50 basis point incentive from its tariff. As a result, we estimate that this proposal, if adopted, would reduce our future after-tax equity earnings from ATC by approximately $7 million annually on a prospective basis. The transmission costs WE, WPS, and UMERC are required to pay ATC after the effective date would also be reduced by this proposal.\nAmerican Transmission Company Allowed Return on Equity Complaints\nThe ROE allowed by the FERC helps determine how much transmission owners, such as ATC, earn on their transmission assets as well as how much consumers pay for those assets. When two complaints were filed arguing the base ROE for MISO transmission owners, including ATC, was too high, the FERC started analyzing the base ROE for these transmission owners. The first of these complaints is discussed below. For information on the second complaint, see Factors Affecting Results, Liquidity, and Capital Resources – Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Matters – American Transmission Company Allowed Return on Equity Complaints in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K \nThe base ROEs listed in the ROE complaint section below do not include the 50 basis point ROE incentive currently provided for membership in a transmission organization. See the Return on Equity Incentive for Membership in a Transmission Organization section above for more information on this incentive.\nReturn on Equity Complaint\nIn November 2013, a group of MISO industrial customers filed a complaint with the FERC asking that the FERC order a reduction to the base ROE used by MISO transmission owners, including ATC, from 12.2% to 9.15%. Due to this complaint, the FERC and the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued the following orders and opinion. The refunds resulting from these orders and opinion are also described below.\n•\nSeptember 2016 FERC Order – On September 28, 2016, the FERC issued an order reducing the base ROE for MISO transmission owners to 10.32% for the period covered by this complaint, November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015 and September 28, 2016 going forward.\n•\nNovember 2019 FERC Order – On November 21, 2019, the FERC issued another order after directing MISO transmission owners and other stakeholders to provide briefs and comments on a proposed change to the methodology for calculating base ROE. In this order, the FERC expanded its base ROE methodology to include the capital-asset pricing model in addition to the discounted cash flow model to better reflect how investors make their investment decisions. The FERC also rejected the use of the risk premium model as part of its base ROE methodology in this order. The FERC's modified methodology further reduced the base ROE for all MISO transmission owners, including ATC, to 9.88% for the period covered by the complaint. In response to this FERC decision, requests for the FERC to rehear the November 2019 Order in its entirety were filed by various parties.\n•\nMay 2020 FERC Order – On May 21, 2020, the FERC issued an order that granted in part and denied in part the requests to rehear the November 2019 Order. In this May 2020 Order, the FERC made additional revisions to its base ROE methodology, including reinstating the use of the risk premium model. The additional revisions made by the FERC increased the base ROE for all MISO transmission owners, including ATC, from the 9.88% authorized in the November 2019 Order to 10.02% for the period covered by the complaint. Various parties then filed requests to rehear certain parts of the May 2020 Order with the FERC.\n•\nNovember 2020 FERC Order – In response to the rehearing requests filed concerning certain parts of the May 2020 Order, the FERC issued an order in November 2020 that confirmed the ROE previously authorized in its May 2020 Order.\n•\nRefunds for FERC Orders Issued Prior to October 2024 – Due to the base ROE changes resulting from the FERC orders issued prior to October 2024, ATC was required to provide refunds, with interest, for the 15-month refund period from November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015 and for the period from September 28, 2016 through November 19, 2020. In January 2022, ATC \n2024 Form 10-K\n89\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\ncompleted providing WE, WPS, and UMERC with the net refunds related to the transmission costs they paid during these periods. The refunds were applied to WE's and WPS's PSCW-approved escrow accounting for transmission expense.\n•\nAugust 2022 D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Opinion – Since several petitions for review were filed with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals concerning this ROE complaint, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion on August 9, 2022, addressing these petitions. In its August 2022 Opinion, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the FERC failed to adequately explain why it reinstated the use of the risk premium model as part of its ROE methodology in its May 2020 Order after previously rejecting the model in its November 2019 Order. Due to this ruling, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the FERC’s previous orders and remanded the issue of determining an appropriate base ROE for MISO transmission owners back to the FERC for additional proceedings. As a result, ATC recorded a reserve for potential refunds based on a 9.88% base ROE. \n•\nOctober 2024 FERC Order – In response to the August 2022 D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals Opinion, the FERC issued an order on October 17, 2024. The FERC’s October 2024 Order removed the risk premium model from the base ROE methodology and required MISO transmission owners, including ATC, to adopt a 9.98% base ROE for the period covered by the complaint.\n•\nRefunds for FERC Order Issued in October 2024 – Prior to the October 2024 FERC order, the base ROE for MISO transmission owners was 10.02% based on the November 2020 FERC order. Since the October 2024 FERC order changed the base ROE to 9.98%, ATC will be providing additional refunds, with interest, for the 15-month refund period from November 12, 2013 through February 11, 2015 and for the period from September 28, 2016 through October 17, 2024. Therefore, ATC is expected to provide WE, WPS, and UMERC with refunds related to the transmission costs they paid during these two refund periods. The refunds will be applied to WE’s and WPS’s PSCW-approved escrow accounting for transmission expense. \nDue to the change between the 9.88% base ROE originally reflected in ATC's reserve and the 9.98% base ROE authorized in the October 2024 FERC Order, ATC reduced its refund liability, which increased our pre-tax equity earnings by $20.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2024. \nEnvironmental Matters\nSee Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, for a discussion of certain environmental matters affecting us, including rules and regulations relating to air quality, water quality, and land quality. \nMarket Risks and Other Significant Risks\nWe are exposed to market and other significant risks as a result of the nature of our businesses and the environments in which those businesses operate. These include, but are not limited to, the risks described below. In addition, there is continuing uncertainty over the impact that the ongoing regional and international conflicts, including those in Ukraine, Israel and in other parts of the Middle East, will have on the global economy, supply chains, and fuel prices.\nCommodity Costs\nIn the normal course of providing energy, we are subject to market fluctuations in the costs of coal, natural gas, purchased power, and fuel oil used in the delivery of coal. We manage our fuel and natural gas supply costs through a portfolio of short and long-term procurement contracts with various suppliers for the purchase of coal, natural gas, and fuel oil. In addition, we manage the risk of price volatility through natural gas and electric hedging programs.\nEmbedded within our utilities' rates are amounts to recover fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs. Our utilities have recovery mechanisms in place that generally allow them to recover or refund all or a portion of the changes in prudently incurred fuel, natural gas, and purchased power costs from rate case-approved amounts. See Item 1. Business – E. Regulation for more information on these mechanisms.\nHigher commodity costs can increase our working capital requirements, result in higher gross receipts taxes, and lead to increased energy efficiency investments by our customers to reduce utility usage and/or fuel substitution. Higher commodity costs combined with slower economic conditions also expose us to greater risks of accounts receivable write-offs as more customers are unable to pay their bills. See Note 5, Credit Losses, for more information on riders and other mechanisms that allow for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense.\n2024 Form 10-K\n90\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nWeather\nOur utilities' rates are based upon estimated normal temperatures. Our electric utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to below normal temperatures during the summer cooling season and, to some extent, to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. Our natural gas utility margins are unfavorably sensitive to above normal temperatures during the winter heating season. PGL, NSG, and MERC have decoupling mechanisms in place that help reduce the impacts of weather. Decoupling mechanisms differ by state and allow utilities to recover or refund certain differences between actual and authorized margins. A summary of actual weather information in our utilities' service territories during 2024, 2023, and 2022, as measured by degree days, can be found in Results of Operations. \nOur utility operations (primarily our electric utility operations) and the operations of WECI, can be negatively impacted from storms. High wind conditions, lightning, hail, and flooding from these storms can result in downed wires and poles, as well as damage to wind and solar generation facilities and other operating equipment. This can result in us incurring significant restoration costs at our utilities and at WECI, including lost revenue to customers. Our utilities' rates include a fixed amount for expected storm restoration costs. To the extent actual storm restoration costs are above what is included in these rates, earnings at our utility operations are negatively impacted and it becomes more difficult to achieve our authorized ROEs. Similarly, restoration costs and lost revenue from storms negatively impacts operations and earnings at our non-utility WECI renewable generation facilities.\nInterest Rates\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk resulting from our short-term and long-term borrowings and projected near-term debt financing needs. We manage exposure to interest rate risk by limiting the amount of our variable rate obligations and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates. When it is advantageous to do so, we enter into long-term fixed rate debt. We may also enter into derivative financial instruments, such as swaps, to mitigate interest rate exposure.\nBased on the variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 and 2023, a hypothetical increase in market interest rates of one percentage point would have increased annual interest expense by $11.2 million and $25.2 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. This sensitivity analysis was performed assuming a constant level of variable rate debt during the period and an immediate increase in interest rates, with no other changes for the remainder of the period.\nMarketable Securities Return\nWe use various trusts to fund our pension and OPEB obligations. These trusts invest in debt and equity securities. Changes in the market prices of these assets can affect future pension and OPEB expenses. Additionally, future contributions can also be affected by the investment returns on trust fund assets. The financial risks associated with investment returns are mitigated at our Wisconsin utilities through the requirement that WE, WPS, and WG implement escrow accounting treatment for pension and OPEB costs in 2023 through 2026, as required by the December 2022 and December 2024 rate orders issued by the PSCW. As a result, our Wisconsin utilities defer as a regulatory asset or liability, the difference between actual pension and OPEB costs and those included in rates until recovery or refund is authorized in a future rate proceeding. We also believe that the financial risks associated with investment returns would be partially mitigated at our other utilities through future rate actions by regulators. \nThe fair value of our trust fund assets and expected long-term returns were approximately: \n(in millions)\nAs of December 31, 2024\nExpected Return on Assets in 2025\nPension trust funds\n$\n2,624.3\n \n6.61 \n%\nOPEB trust funds\n$\n850.0\n \n6.50 \n%\nFiduciary oversight of the pension and OPEB trust fund investments is the responsibility of an Investment Trust Policy Committee. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an ongoing basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target asset allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. The targeted asset allocations are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans, and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments. Investment strategies utilize a wide diversification of asset types and qualified external investment managers.\n2024 Form 10-K\n91\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nWe consult with our investment advisors on an annual basis to help us forecast expected long-term returns on plan assets by reviewing actual historical returns and calculating expected total trust returns using the weighted-average of long-term market returns for each of the major target asset categories utilized in the funds.\nEconomic Conditions\nWe have electric and natural gas utility operations that serve customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, and Michigan. As such, we are exposed to market risks in the regional Midwest economy. In addition, any economic downturn or disruption of national or international markets could adversely affect the financial condition of our customers and demand for their products, which could affect their demand for our products.\nInflation and Supply Chain Disruptions\nWe continue to monitor the impact of inflation and supply chain disruptions. We monitor the costs of medical plans, fuel, transmission access, construction costs, regulatory and environmental compliance costs, and other costs in order to minimize inflationary effects in future years, to the extent possible, through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. We monitor the global supply chain, and related disruptions, in order to ensure we are able to procure the materials and other resources necessary to both maintain our energy services in a safe and reliable manner and to grow our infrastructure in accordance with our capital plan. For additional information concerning risks related to inflation and supply chain disruptions, see the four risk factors below.\n•",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in compliance with GAAP requires the application of accounting policies, as well as the use of estimates, assumptions, and judgments that could have a material impact on our financial statements and related disclosures. Judgments regarding future events may include the likelihood of success of particular projects, legal and regulatory challenges, and anticipated recovery of costs. Actual results may differ significantly from estimated amounts based on varying assumptions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. The following is a list of accounting policies and estimates that require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments and may change in subsequent periods. \nRegulatory Accounting\nOur utility operations follow the guidance under the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC (Topic 980). Our financial statements reflect the effects of the ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions regulating us. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by our regulators.\n2024 Form 10-K\n92\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nFuture recovery of regulatory assets, including the timeliness of recovery and our ability to earn a reasonable return, is not assured and is generally subject to review by regulators in rate proceedings for matters such as prudence and reasonableness. Once approved, the regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized into earnings over the rate recovery or refund period. If recovery or refund of costs is not approved or is no longer considered probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in current period earnings. Management regularly assesses whether these regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as changes in the regulatory environment, earnings from our electric and natural gas utility operations, rate orders issued by our regulators, historical decisions by our regulators regarding regulatory assets and liabilities, and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.\nThe application of the Regulated Operations Topic of the FASB ASC would be discontinued if all or a separable portion of our utility operations no longer met the criteria for application. Our regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off to income as an unusual or infrequently occurring item in the period in which discontinuation occurred. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information on our regulatory assets and liabilities.\nGoodwill\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment tests for all of our reporting units that carried a goodwill balance as of July 1, 2024. No impairments were recorded as a result of these tests. For all of our reporting units, the fair values calculated in step one of the test were greater than their carrying values. The fair values for the reporting units were calculated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach.\nFor the income approach, we used internal forecasts to project cash flows. Any forecast contains a degree of uncertainty, and changes in these cash flows could significantly increase or decrease the calculated fair value of a reporting unit. For our reporting units that are regulated, a fair recovery of and return on costs prudently incurred to serve customers is assumed. An unfavorable outcome in a rate case could cause the fair values of our reporting units to decrease.\nKey assumptions used in the income approach include ROEs, the long-term growth rates used to determine terminal values at the end of the discrete forecast period, and the discount rates. The discount rate is applied to estimated future cash flows and is one of the most significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the income approach. As interest rates rise, the calculated fair values will decrease. The discount rate is based on the weighted-average cost of capital for each reporting unit, taking into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. The terminal year ROE for each utility is driven by its current allowed ROE. The terminal growth rate is based primarily on a combination of historical and forecasted statistics for real gross domestic product and personal income for each utility service area. \nFor the market approach, we used a higher weighting for the guideline public company method than the guideline merged and acquired company method due to a low number of mergers and acquisitions in recent years. The guideline public company method uses financial metrics from similar publicly traded companies to determine fair value. The guideline merged and acquired company method calculates fair value by analyzing the actual prices paid for recent mergers and acquisitions in the industry. We applied multiples derived from these two methods to the appropriate operating metrics for our reporting units to determine fair value.\nThe underlying assumptions and estimates used in the impairment tests were made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could change the results of the tests.\nFor all of our reporting units that carried a goodwill balance at July 1, 2024, the fair value exceeded its carrying value by over 50%. Based on these results, our reporting units are not at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test.\nSee Note 10, Goodwill and Intangibles, for more information.\nLong-Lived Assets\nIn accordance with ASC 980-360, Regulated Operations – Property, Plant, and Equipment, we periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long-lived assets may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, a significant decrease in the market price, a significant change in use, a regulatory decision related to recovery of assets from customers, adverse legal factors or a change in business climate, operating or cash flow losses, or an expectation that the asset might be sold or abandoned. See Note 1(k), Asset Impairment, for our policy on accounting for abandonments and recently completed plant subject to disallowance.\n2024 Form 10-K\n93\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nPerforming an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment by management in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets, and developing the undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset in comparison to the fair value of the asset. The fair value of the asset is assessed using various methods, including recent comparable third-party sales for our nonregulated operations, internally developed discounted cash flow analysis, expected recovery of regulated assets, and analysis from outside advisors. \nSee Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information on our generating units probable of being retired. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, and Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on our retired generating units, including various approvals we received from the FERC and the PSCW.\nPension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefits \nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined pension benefits and OPEB, described in Note 20, Employee Benefits, are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience.\nPension and OPEB costs are impacted by actual employee demographics (including age, compensation levels, and employment periods), the level of contributions made to the plans, and earnings on plan assets. Pension and OPEB costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions, including anticipated rates of return on plan assets, mortality and discount rates, and expected health care cost trends. Changes made to the plan provisions may also impact current and future pension and OPEB costs.\nPension and OPEB plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments. Fluctuations in actual equity and fixed income market returns, as well as changes in general interest rates, may result in increased or decreased benefit costs in future periods. Changes in benefit costs are mitigated at our Wisconsin utilities through the requirement that WE, WPS, and WG implement escrow accounting treatment for pension and OPEB costs in 2023 and 2024, as required by the December 2022 rate orders issued by the PSCW. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information on 2023 and 2024 rates at our Wisconsin utilities. We believe that changes to benefit costs at our other utilities would be recovered or refunded through the ratemaking process. \nThe following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the projected benefit obligation and the reported net periodic pension cost (including amounts capitalized to our balance sheets). Each factor below reflects an evaluation of the change based on a change in that assumption only.\nActuarial Assumption\n(in millions, except percentages)\nPercentage-Point Change in Assumption\nImpact on Projected Benefit Obligation\nImpact on 2024\nPension Cost\nDiscount rate\n(0.5)\n$\n100.7 \n$\n5.1 \nDiscount rate\n0.5\n(93.5)\n(5.2)\nRate of return on plan assets\n(0.5)\nN/A\n13.7 \nRate of return on plan assets\n0.5\nN/A\n(13.7)\nThe following table shows how a given change in certain actuarial assumptions would impact the accumulated OPEB obligation and the reported net periodic OPEB cost (including amounts capitalized to our balance sheets).

From the hypothetical bond portfolios, a single rate is determined that equates the market value of the bonds purchased to the discounted value of the plans' expected future benefit payments.\nWe establish our expected return on assets based on consideration of historical and projected asset class returns, as well as the target allocations of the benefit trust portfolios. The assumed long-term rate of return on pension plan assets was 6.61%, 6.62%, and 6.88%, in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The actual rate of return on pension plan assets, net of fees, was 4.75%, 9.23%, and (14.03)%, in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nIn selecting assumed health care cost trend rates, past performance and forecasts of health care costs are considered. For more information on health care cost trend rates and a table showing future payments that we expect to make for our pension and OPEB, see Note 20, Employee Benefits.\nUnbilled Revenues\nWe record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. \nUnbilled revenues are estimated each month based upon actual generation and throughput volumes, recorded sales, estimated customer usage by class, weather factors, estimated line losses, and applicable customer rates. Energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in rate mix due to fluctuations in usage patterns of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Total unbilled utility revenues were $567.2 million and $473.9 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The changes in unbilled revenues are primarily due to changes in the cost of natural gas, weather, and customer rates.\nIncome Tax Expense\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred income tax assets. The assumptions involved are supported by historical data, reasonable projections, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. Significant changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. See Note 1(q), Income Taxes, and Note 16, Income Taxes, for a discussion of accounting for income taxes.\nWe are required to estimate income taxes for each of our applicable tax jurisdictions as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements. This process involves estimating current income tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such as depreciation, for income tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our balance sheets. We also assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. To the extent we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance, which is offset by an adjustment to income tax expense in our income statements.\nUncertainty associated with the application of tax statutes and regulations, the outcomes of tax audits and appeals, changes in income tax law, enacted tax rates or amounts subject to income tax, and changes in the regulatory treatment of any tax reform benefits requires that judgments and estimates be made in the accrual process and in the calculation of effective tax rates. Only income tax benefits that meet the \"more likely than not\" recognition threshold may be recognized or continue to be recognized. Unrecognized tax benefits are re-evaluated quarterly and changes are recorded based on new information, including the issuance of relevant guidance by the courts or tax authorities and developments occurring in the examinations of our tax returns.\nWe expect our 2025 annual effective tax rate to be between 6.5% and 7.5%. Our effective tax rate calculations are revised every quarter based on the best available year-end tax assumptions, adjusted in the following year after returns are filed. Tax accrual estimates are trued-up to the actual amounts claimed on the tax returns and further adjusted after examinations by taxing authorities, as needed.\n2024 Form 10-K\n95\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nITEM 7A.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nA. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of WEC Energy Group, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of WEC Energy Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities - Impact of rate regulation on financial statements — Refer to Notes 6 and 26 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by various state and federal regulatory bodies (collectively the “Commissions”) which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and gas distribution companies in each respective state. Management has determined the Company meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the Regulated Operations Topic of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standard Codification. \n2024 Form 10-K\n97\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nRates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the Company’s costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the Company’s investment in the utility business. Current and future regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered through rates. The Commissions’ regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Certain items that would otherwise be immediately recognized as revenues and expenses are deferred as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities for future recovery or refund to customers, as authorized by the Company’s regulators. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment or (3) timely recovery of costs incurred.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about the impacted account balances and disclosures and the subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs and/or (2) a refund to customers. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the impact of rate regulation on certain assets and liabilities included the following, among others: \n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over regulatory assets and liabilities, including management’s controls over the identification of costs recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates. \n•\nWe inquired of Company management and independently obtained and read: (1) relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company, (2) Company filings with the Commissions, (3) filings made by intervenors and (4) other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\nFebruary 21, 2025\n2024 Form 10-K\n99\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nB.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1—\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n(a) Nature of Operations\n—\nWEC Energy Group serves approximately \n1.7\n million electric customers and \n3.0\n million natural gas customers, owns approximately \n60\n% of ATC, and owns majority interests in multiple renewable generating facilities as part of its non-utility energy infrastructure segment.\nAs used in these notes, the term \"financial statements\" refers to the consolidated financial statements. This includes the income statements, statements of comprehensive income, balance sheets, statements of cash flows, and statements of equity, unless otherwise noted. On our financial statements, we consolidate our majority-owned subsidiaries, which we control, and VIEs, of which we are the primary beneficiary. We reflect noncontrolling interests for the portion of entities that we do not own as a component of consolidated equity separate from the equity attributable to our shareholders. The noncontrolling interests that we reported as equity on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 related to the minority interests held by third parties in the renewable generating facilities that are included in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment.\nOur financial statements include the accounts of WEC Energy Group, a diversified energy holding company, and the accounts of our subsidiaries in the following reportable segments:\n•\nWisconsin segment – Consists of WE, WPS, and WG, which are engaged primarily in the generation of electricity and the distribution of electricity and natural gas in Wisconsin; and UMERC, which generates electricity and distributes electricity and natural gas to customers located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\n•\nIllinois segment – Consists of PGL and NSG, which are engaged primarily in the distribution of natural gas in Illinois.\n•\nOther states segment – Consists of MERC and MGU, which are engaged primarily in the distribution of natural gas in Minnesota and Michigan, respectively.\n•\nElectric transmission segment – Consists of our approximate \n60\n% ownership interest in ATC, a for-profit, electric transmission company regulated by the FERC and certain state regulatory commissions, and our approximate \n75\n% ownership interest in ATC Holdco, which invests in transmission-related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint.\n•\nNon-utility energy infrastructure segment – Consists of We Power, which is principally engaged in the ownership of electric power generating facilities for long-term lease to WE, and Bluewater, which owns underground natural gas storage facilities in Michigan. WECI, which holds our majority interests in multiple renewable generating facilities, is also included in this segment. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on recently acquired WECI renewable generating facilities.\n•\nCorporate and other segment – Consists of the WEC Energy Group holding company, the Integrys holding company, the PELLC holding company, Wispark, Wisvest, WECC, and WBS.\nInvestments in companies not controlled by us, but over which we have significant influence regarding the operating and financial policies of the investee, are accounted for using the equity method. We use the cumulative earnings approach for classifying distributions received in the statements of cash flows. Under the cumulative earnings approach, we compare the distributions received to cumulative equity method earnings since inception. Any distributions received up to the amount of cumulative equity earnings are considered a return on investment and classified in operating activities. Any excess distributions are considered a return of investment and classified in investing activities.\n \nOur financial statements also reflect our proportionate interests in certain jointly owned utility facilities. See Note 8, Jointly Owned Utility Facilities, for more information.\n(b) Basis of Presentation\n—\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP.\n \nWe make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n2024 Form 10-K\n105\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\n(c) Cash and Cash Equivalents\n—\nCash and cash equivalents include marketable debt securities with an original maturity of \nthree months\n or less.\n(d) Operating Revenues\n—\nThe following discussion includes our significant accounting policies related to operating revenues. For additional required disclosures on disaggregation of operating revenues, see Note 4, Operating Revenues.\nRevenues from Contracts with Customers\nElectric Utility Operating Revenues\nElectricity sales to residential and commercial and industrial customers are generally accomplished through requirements contracts, which provide for the delivery of as much electricity as the customer needs. These contracts represent discrete deliveries of electricity and consist of \none\n distinct performance obligation satisfied over time, as the electricity is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. For our Wisconsin residential and commercial and industrial customers and the majority of our Michigan residential and commercial and industrial customers, our performance obligation is bundled to consist of both the sale and the delivery of the electric commodity. In our Michigan service territory, a limited number of residential and commercial and industrial customers can purchase the commodity from a third party. In this case, the delivery of the electricity represents our sole performance obligation.\nThe transaction price of the performance obligations for residential and commercial and industrial customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service included in the tariffs of our regulated electric utilities, which have been approved by state regulators. These rates often have a fixed component customer charge and a usage-based variable component charge. We recognize revenue for the fixed component customer charge monthly using a time-based output method. We recognize revenue for the usage-based variable component charge using an output method based on the quantity of electricity delivered each month. Our retail electric rates in Wisconsin include base amounts for fuel and purchased power costs, which also impact our revenues. The electric fuel rules set by the PSCW allow us to defer, for subsequent rate recovery or refund, under- or over-collections of actual fuel and purchased power costs beyond a \n2\n% price variance from the costs included in the rates charged to customers. Our electric utilities monitor the deferral of under-collected costs to ensure that it does not cause them to earn a greater ROE than authorized by the PSCW. In contrast, the rates of our Michigan retail electric customers include recovery of fuel and purchased power costs on a one-for-one basis. In addition, the Wisconsin residential tariffs of WE and WPS include a mechanism for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates. \nWholesale customers who resell power can choose to either bundle capacity and electricity services together under \none\n contract with a supplier or purchase capacity and electricity separately from multiple suppliers. Furthermore, wholesale customers can choose to have our utilities provide generation to match the customer's load, similar to requirements contracts, or they can purchase specified quantities of electricity and capacity. Contracts with wholesale customers that include capacity bundled with the delivery of electricity contain \ntwo\n performance obligations, as capacity and electricity are often transacted separately in the marketplace at the wholesale level. When recognizing revenue associated with these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recognized as control of each individual component is transferred to the customer. Electricity is the primary product sold by our electric utilities and represents a single performance obligation satisfied over time through discrete deliveries to a customer. Revenue from electricity sales is generally recognized as units are produced and delivered to the customer within the production month. Capacity represents the reservation of an electric generating facility and conveys the ability to call on a plant to produce electricity when needed by the customer. The nature of our performance obligation as it relates to capacity is to stand ready to deliver power. This represents a single performance obligation transferred over time, which generally represents a monthly obligation. Accordingly, capacity revenue is recognized on a monthly basis.\nThe transaction price of the performance obligations for wholesale customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service, which have been approved by the FERC. These wholesale rates include recovery of fuel and purchased power costs from customers on a one-for-one basis. For the majority of our wholesale customers, the price billed for energy and capacity is a formula-based rate. Formula-based rates initially set a customer's current year rates based on the previous year’s expenses. This is a predetermined formula derived from the utility's costs and a reasonable rate of return. Because these rates are eventually trued up to reflect actual current-year costs, they represent a form of variable consideration in certain circumstances. The variable consideration is estimated and recognized over time as wholesale customers receive and consume the capacity and electricity services.\n2024 Form 10-K\n106\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nWe are an active participant in the MISO Energy Markets, where we bid our generation into the Day Ahead and Real Time markets and procure electricity for our retail and wholesale customers at prices determined by the MISO Energy Markets. Purchase and sale transactions are recorded using settlement information provided by MISO. These purchase and sale transactions are accounted for on a net hourly position. Net purchases in a single hour are recorded as purchased power in cost of sales, and net sales in a single hour are recorded as resale revenues on our income statements. For resale revenues, our performance obligation is created only when electricity is sold into the MISO Energy Markets.\nFor all of our customers, consistent with the timing of when we recognize revenue, customer billings generally occur on a monthly basis, with payments typically due in full within \n30\n days.\nNatural Gas Utility Operating Revenues\nWe recognize natural gas utility operating revenues under requirements contracts with residential, commercial and industrial, and transportation customers served under the tariffs of our regulated utilities. Tariffs provide our customers with the standard terms and conditions, including rates, related to the services offered. Requirements contracts provide for the delivery of as much natural gas as the customer needs. These requirements contracts represent discrete deliveries of natural gas and constitute a single performance obligation satisfied over time. Our performance obligation is both created and satisfied with the transfer of control of natural gas upon delivery to the customer. For most of our customers, natural gas is delivered and consumed by the customer simultaneously. A performance obligation can be bundled to consist of both the sale and the delivery of the natural gas commodity. In certain of our service territories, customers can purchase the commodity from a third party. In this case, the performance obligation only includes the delivery of the natural gas to the customer.\nThe transaction price of the performance obligations for our natural gas customers is valued using the rates, charges, terms, and conditions of service included in the tariffs of our regulated utilities, which have been approved by state regulators. These rates often have a fixed component customer charge and a usage-based variable component charge. We recognize revenue for the fixed component customer charge monthly using a time-based output method. We recognize revenue for the usage-based variable component charge using an output method based on natural gas delivered each month.\nThe tariffs of our natural gas utilities include various rate mechanisms that allow them to recover or refund changes in prudently incurred costs from rate case-approved amounts. The rates for all of our natural gas utilities include one-for-one recovery mechanisms for natural gas commodity costs. Under normal circumstances, we defer any difference between actual natural gas costs incurred and costs recovered through rates as a current asset or liability. The deferred balance is returned to or recovered from customers at intervals throughout the year. \nIn addition, the rates of PGL and NSG, and the residential tariffs of WE, WPS, and WG, include riders or other mechanisms for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates. The rates of PGL and NSG include riders for cost recovery of both environmental cleanup costs and energy conservation and management program costs. Finally, the rates of MGU include a rider to recover costs incurred to replace or modify natural gas facilities. \nConsistent with the timing of when we recognize revenue, customer billings generally occur on a monthly basis, with payments typically due in full within \n30\n days.\nOther Natural Gas Operating Revenues\nWe have other natural gas operating revenues from Bluewater, which is in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment. Bluewater has entered into long-term service agreements for natural gas storage services with WE, WPS, and WG, and also provides limited service to unaffiliated customers. We recognize revenues using a time-based output method through a monthly fixed service fee. Typical storage contract rates consist of firm storage reservation charges and firm injection and withdrawal charges. All amounts associated with the service agreements with WE, WPS, and WG have been eliminated at the consolidated level.\nOther Non-Utility Operating Revenues\nWind and solar generation revenues from WECI's ownership interests in renewable generation facilities continued to grow in 2024. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on recent acquisitions. Most of these renewable generation facilities have offtake agreements with unaffiliated third parties for all of the energy to be produced by the facility, some of which are bundled with \n2024 Form 10-K\n107\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\ncapacity and RECs. We consider bundled energy, capacity, and RECs within these offtake agreements to be distinct performance obligations as each are often transacted separately in the marketplace. \nWhen recognizing revenue associated with these contracts, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. Revenue is recognized as control of each individual component is transferred to the customer. Revenue from the sale of this renewable energy is generally recognized as units are produced and delivered to the customer within the production month. Capacity represents the reservation of the renewable generation facility and conveys the ability to call on the renewable generation facility to produce electricity when needed by the customer. The nature of our performance obligation as it relates to capacity is to stand ready to deliver power. This represents a single performance obligation transferred over time, which generally represents a monthly obligation. Accordingly, capacity revenue is recognized on a monthly basis. The performance obligation for RECs is recognized at a point-in-time; however, the timing of revenue recognition is the same, as the generation of renewable energy and the recognition of REC revenues generally occur concurrently.\nNon-utility operating revenues are also derived from servicing appliances for customers at MERC. These contracts customarily have a duration of \none year\n or less and consist of a single performance obligation satisfied over time. We use a time-based output method to recognize revenues monthly for the service fee.\nConsistent with the timing of when we recognize revenue, customer billings for the renewable generation and servicing revenues generally occur on a monthly basis, with payments typically due in full within \n30\n days.\nAs part of the construction of the We Power electric generating units, we capitalized interest during construction, which is included in property, plant, and equipment. As allowed by the PSCW, we collected these carrying costs from WE's utility customers during construction. The equity portion of these carrying costs was recorded as a contract liability, which is presented as deferred revenue, net on our balance sheets. We continually amortize the deferred carrying costs to revenues over the related lease term that We Power has with WE. During 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recorded $\n24.3\n million, $\n23.5\n million, and $\n23.4\n million, respectively, of revenues related to these deferred carrying costs. \nOther Operating Revenues\nAlternative Revenues\nAlternative revenues are created from programs authorized by regulators that allow our utilities to record additional revenues by adjusting rates in the future, usually as a surcharge applied to future billings, in response to past activities or completed events. Alternative revenue programs allow compensation for the effects of weather abnormalities, other external factors, or demand side management initiatives. Alternative revenue programs can also provide incentive awards if the utility achieves certain objectives and in other limited circumstances. We record alternative revenues when the regulator-specified conditions for recognition have been met. We reverse these alternative revenues as the customer is billed, at which time this revenue is presented as revenues from contracts with customers.\nBelow is a summary of the alternative revenue programs at our utilities:\n•\nThe rates of PGL, NSG, and MERC include decoupling mechanisms. These mechanisms differ by state and allow the utilities to recover or refund the differences between actual and authorized margins for certain customer classes. \n•\nMERC’s rates include a conservation improvement program rider, which includes a financial incentive for meeting energy savings goals.\n•\nWE and WPS provide wholesale electric service to customers under market-based rates and FERC formula rates. The customer is charged a base rate each year based upon a formula using prior year actual costs and customer demand. A true-up is calculated based on the difference between the amount billed to customers for the demand component of their rates and what the actual cost of service was for the year. The true-up can result in an amount that we will recover from or refund to the customer. We consider the true-up portion of the wholesale electric revenues to be alternative revenues.\n(e) Credit Losses\n—\nThe following discussion includes our significant accounting policies related to credit losses. For additional required disclosures on credit losses, see Note 5, Credit Losses.\nOur exposure to credit losses is related to our accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances, which are primarily generated from the sale of electricity and natural gas by our regulated utility operations. Credit losses associated with our utility operations are \n2024 Form 10-K\n108\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nanalyzed at the reportable segment level as we believe contract terms, political and economic risks, and the regulatory environment are similar at this level as our reportable segments are generally based on the geographic location of the underlying utility operations.\nWe have an accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balance associated with our non-utility energy infrastructure segment, related to the sale of electricity from our majority-owned renewable generating facilities through agreements with several large high credit quality counterparties. \nWe evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable and unbilled revenue balances considering a combination of factors. For some of our larger customers and also in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we record a specific allowance for credit losses against amounts due in order to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. For all other customers, we use the accounts receivable aging method to calculate an allowance for credit losses. Using this method, we classify accounts receivable into different aging buckets and calculate a reserve percentage for each aging bucket based upon historical loss rates. The calculated reserve percentages are updated on at least an annual basis, in order to ensure recent macroeconomic, political, and regulatory trends are captured in the calculation, to the extent possible. Risks identified that we do not believe are reflected in the calculated reserve percentages, are assessed on a quarterly basis to determine whether further adjustments are required.\nWe monitor our ongoing credit exposure through active review of counterparty accounts receivable balances against contract terms and due dates. Our activities include timely account reconciliation, dispute resolution and payment confirmation. To the extent possible, we work with customers with past due balances to negotiate payment plans, but will disconnect customers for non-payment as allowed by our regulators, if necessary, and employ collection agencies and legal counsel to pursue recovery of defaulted receivables. For our larger customers, detailed credit review procedures may be performed in advance of any sales being made. We sometimes require letters of credit, parental guarantees, prepayments or other forms of credit assurance from our larger customers to mitigate credit risk.\n \n(f) Materials, Supplies, and Inventories\n—\nOur inventories as of December 31 consisted of:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nMaterials and supplies\n$\n412.5\n \n$\n320.0\n \nNatural gas in storage\n300.2\n \n327.8\n \nFossil fuel\n100.5\n \n127.4\n \nTotal\n$\n813.2\n \n$\n775.2\n \nPGL and NSG price natural gas storage injections at the calendar year average of the costs of natural gas supply purchased. Withdrawals from storage are priced on the LIFO cost method. Inventories stated on a LIFO basis represented approximately \n18\n% and \n17\n% of total inventories at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The estimated replacement cost of natural gas in inventory at December 31, 2024 and 2023, exceeded the LIFO cost by $\n77.9\n million and $\n12.2\n million, respectively. In calculating these replacement amounts, PGL and NSG used a Chicago city-gate natural gas price per Dth of $\n3.10\n at December 31, 2024, and $\n2.13\n at December 31, 2023. \nSubstantially all other materials and supplies, natural gas in storage, and fossil fuel inventories are recorded using the weighted-average cost method of accounting.\n(g) Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\n—\nThe economic effects of regulation can result in regulated companies recording costs and revenues that are allowed in the ratemaking process in a period different from the period they would have been recognized by a nonregulated company. When this occurs, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recorded on the balance sheet. Regulatory assets represent deferred costs probable of recovery from customers that would have otherwise been charged to expense. Regulatory liabilities represent amounts that are expected to be refunded to customers in future rates or future costs already collected from customers in rates.\nThe recovery or refund of regulatory assets and liabilities is based on specific periods determined by our regulators or occurs over the normal operating period of the related assets and liabilities. If a previously recorded regulatory asset is no longer probable of recovery, the regulatory asset is reduced to the amount considered probable of recovery, and the reduction is charged to expense in the current period. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information.\n2024 Form 10-K\n109\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\n(h) Property, Plant, and Equipment\n—\nWe record property, plant, and equipment at cost. Cost includes material, labor, overhead, and both debt and equity components of AFUDC. Additions to and significant replacements of property are charged to property, plant, and equipment at cost; minor items are charged to other operation and maintenance expense. The cost of depreciable utility property less salvage value is charged to accumulated depreciation when property is retired.\nWe record straight-line depreciation expense over the estimated useful life of utility property using depreciation rates approved by the applicable regulators. \nAnnual utility composite depreciation rates are shown below:\nAnnual Utility Composite Depreciation Rates \n2024\n2023\n2022\nWE\n3.03\n%\n3.03\n%\n3.06\n%\nWPS\n2.92\n%\n2.93\n%\n2.67\n%\nWG\n2.61\n%\n2.61\n%\n2.47\n%\nPGL\n3.36\n%\n3.13\n%\n3.13\n%\nNSG\n2.49\n%\n2.46\n%\n2.43\n%\nMERC\n2.60\n%\n2.60\n%\n2.56\n%\nMGU\n2.87\n%\n2.73\n%\n2.75\n%\nUMERC\n3.01\n%\n2.97\n%\n3.01\n%\nWe depreciate our We Power assets over the estimated useful life of the various property components. The components have useful lives of between \n10\n to \n45\n years for PWGS 1 and PWGS 2 and \n10\n to \n55\n years for ER 1 and ER 2.\nWe depreciate our WECI assets over the estimated useful life of the property, with wind and solar generating facilities being depreciated over \n30\n and \n35\n years, respectively.\nWe capitalize certain costs related to software developed or obtained for internal use and record these costs to amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the related software, which ranges from \n3\n to \n15\n years. If software is retired prior to being fully amortized, the difference is recorded as a loss on the income statement.\nThird parties reimburse the utilities for all or a portion of expenditures for certain capital projects. Such contributions in aid of construction costs are recorded as a reduction to property, plant, and equipment.\nSee Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information.\n(i) Allowance for Funds Used During Construction\n—\nAFUDC is included in utility plant accounts and represents the cost of borrowed funds (AFUDC-Debt) used during plant construction, and a return on shareholders' capital (AFUDC-Equity) used for construction purposes. AFUDC-Debt is recorded as a reduction of interest expense, and AFUDC-Equity is recorded in other income, net.\nThe majority of AFUDC is recorded at WE, WPS, WG, UMERC, and WBS. Approximately \n50\n% of WE's, WPS's, WG's, UMERC's, and WBS's retail jurisdictional CWIP expenditures are subject to the AFUDC calculation. The AFUDC calculation for WBS uses the WPS AFUDC retail rate, while our utilities' AFUDC rates are determined by their respective state commissions, each with specific requirements. \nAverage AFUDC rates are shown below:\n2024\nAverage AFUDC Retail Rate\nAverage AFUDC Wholesale Rate\nWE\n8.45\n%\n7.11\n%\nWPS\n7.46\n%\n5.53\n%\nWG\n7.94\n%\nN/A\nUMERC\n6.28\n%\nN/A\nWBS\n7.46\n%\nN/A\n2024 Form 10-K\n110\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nOur regulated utilities and WBS recorded the following AFUDC for the years ended December 31:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAFUDC-Debt\nWE\n$\n14.6\n \n$\n13.0\n \n$\n6.9\n \nWPS\n3.6\n \n2.9\n \n2.3\n \nWG\n1.0\n \n3.4\n \n1.4\n \nUMERC\n0.4\n \n—\n \n0.1\n \nWBS\n0.1\n \n0.1\n \n0.1\n \nOther\n0.2\n \n0.1\n \n0.2\n \nTotal AFUDC-Debt\n$\n19.9\n \n$\n19.5\n \n$\n11.0\n \nAFUDC-Equity\nWE\n$\n46.0\n \n$\n41.0\n \n$\n18.8\n \nWPS\n9.2\n \n7.6\n \n5.8\n \nWG\n2.9\n \n9.8\n \n3.9\n \nUMERC\n1.0\n \n—\n \n0.1\n \nWBS\n0.3\n \n0.4\n \n0.3\n \nOther\n0.4\n \n0.3\n \n0.5\n \nTotal AFUDC-Equity\n$\n59.8\n \n$\n59.1\n \n$\n29.4\n \n(j) Cloud Computing Hosting Arrangements that are Service Contracts\n—\nWe have entered into several cloud computing arrangements that are hosted service contracts as part of projects related to the continuous transformation of technology. These projects include, among other things, a centralized repository for data to improve analytics, reporting and asset management, targeted enterprise resource planning systems, human resources management, employee scheduling, geospatial information, and customer contact systems. We present prepaid hosting fees that are service contracts in either prepayments or other long-term assets on our balance sheets and amortize them as the hosting services are received. Amortization expense, as well as the fees associated with the hosting arrangements, is recorded in other operation and maintenance expense on our income statements.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $\n17.0\n million and $\n11.3\n million, respectively, of capitalized implementation costs related to cloud computing arrangements that are hosted service contracts. We amortize the implementation costs on a straight-line basis over the cloud computing service arrangement term once the component of the hosted service is ready for its intended use. Accumulated amortization at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $\n4.1\n million and $\n2.8\n million, respectively. Amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was not significant. The presentation of the implementation costs, along with the related accumulated amortization, follows the prepaid hosting fees.\n(k) Asset Impairment\n—\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment test. Interim impairment tests are performed when impairment indicators are present. During the third quarter of each year, we perform an annual impairment test for all of our reporting units that carried a goodwill balance. The carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is considered not recoverable if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's net assets exceeds the reporting unit's fair value. An impairment loss is recorded as the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over its fair value. For our indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over its fair value. \nNo\n impairment losses were recorded for our indefinite-lived intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. See Note 10, Goodwill and Intangibles, for more information.\nWe periodically assess the recoverability of certain long-lived assets when factors indicate the carrying value of such assets may be impaired or such assets are planned to be sold. Long-lived assets that would be subject to an impairment assessment generally include any assets within regulated operations that may not be fully recovered from our customers as a result of regulatory decisions that will be made in the future, as well as assets within nonregulated operations that are proposed to be sold or are currently generating operating losses. An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value. \nWe assess the likelihood of a disallowance of part of the cost of recently completed plant by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes, our own recent rate orders, as well as recent rate orders of other regulated entities in similar \n2024 Form 10-K\n111\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\njurisdictions. When it becomes probable that part of the cost of recently completed plant will be disallowed for rate-making purposes, we assess whether a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. The estimated amount of the probable disallowance will then be deducted from the reported cost of the plant and recognized as an impairment loss. In 2024, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $\n12.1\n million driven by an ICC order received in August 2024 related to the 2016 annual prudency review of PGL's 2016 Rider QIP, which included a disallowance of certain capital costs. In 2023, we recorded a non-cash impairment loss of $\n178.9\n million related to the disallowance of certain previously incurred capital costs resulting from PGL's and NSG's November 2023 rate orders from the ICC. See Note 26, Regulatory Environment, for more information.\nWhen it becomes probable that a generating unit will be retired before the end of its useful life, we assess whether the generating unit meets the criteria for abandonment accounting. Generating units that are considered probable of abandonment are expected to cease operations in the near term, significantly before the end of their original estimated useful lives. If a generating unit meets the applicable criteria to be considered probable of abandonment, and the unit has been abandoned, we assess the likelihood of recovery of the remaining net book value of that generating unit at the end of each reporting period. If it becomes probable that regulators will disallow full recovery as well as a return on the remaining net book value of a generating unit that is either abandoned or probable of being abandoned, an impairment loss may be required. An impairment loss would be recorded if the remaining net book value of the generating unit is greater than the present value of the amount expected to be recovered from ratepayers, using an incremental borrowing rate. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, and Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information.\nWe periodically assess the recoverability of equity method investments when factors indicate the carrying amount of such assets may be impaired. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment by comparing the fair values of these investments to their carrying amounts if a fair value assessment was completed or by reviewing for the presence of impairment indicators. If an impairment exists, and it is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the investment's fair value.\n(l) Asset Retirement Obligations\n—\nWe recognize, at fair value, legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, and normal operation of the assets. An ARO liability is recorded, when incurred, for these obligations as long as the fair value can be reasonably estimated, even if the timing or method of settling the obligation is unknown. The associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and are depreciated over the useful life of the asset. The ARO liabilities are accreted each period using the credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates associated with the expected settlement dates of the AROs. These rates are determined when the obligations are incurred. Subsequent changes resulting from revisions to the timing or the amount of the original estimate of undiscounted cash flows are recognized as an increase or a decrease to the carrying amount of the liability and the associated capitalized retirement costs. For our regulated entities, we recognize regulatory assets or liabilities for the timing differences between when we recover an ARO in rates and when we recognize the associated retirement costs. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information.\n(m) Finite-Lived Intangible Asset and Liabilities\n—\nOur finite-lived intangible asset and liabilities include revenue contracts, consisting of PPAs and a proxy revenue swap, in addition to interconnection agreements, which resulted from the acquisitions of renewable generation facilities by WECI in our non-utility energy infrastructure segment. Our intangible asset and liabilities are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which is the term of the related agreement. Amortization of the revenue contract intangible asset and liabilities are recorded within operating revenues in the income statements. Amortization of the interconnection agreement intangible liabilities is recorded within other operation and maintenance in the income statements. The straight-line method of amortization is used because it best reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangibles are consumed or otherwise used. The amounts and useful lives assigned to the intangible asset and liabilities assumed impact the amount and timing of future amortization.\n \n(n) Stock-Based Compensation\n—\nIn accordance with the Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, we provide long-term incentives through our equity interests to our non-employee directors, officers, and other key employees. The plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock, performance shares, and other stock-based awards. Awards may be paid in common stock, cash, or a combination thereof. In addition to those shares of common stock that were subject to awards outstanding as of May 6, 2021, when the plan was last approved by shareholders, \n9.0\n million shares were reserved for issuance under the plan.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Awards classified as equity awards are measured based on their grant-date fair value. Awards classified as liability awards are recorded at fair value each reporting period. \nWe account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than estimating potential future forfeitures and recording them over the vesting period.\n2024 Form 10-K\n112\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nStock Options\nWe grant non-qualified stock options that generally vest on a cliff-basis after \nthree years\n. The exercise price of a stock option under the plan cannot be less than \n100\n% of our common stock's fair market value on the grant date. Historically, all stock options have been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant. Options vest immediately upon retirement, death, or disability; however, they may not be exercised within \nsix months\n of the grant date except in connection with certain termination of employment events following a change in control. Options expire no later than \n10\n years from the date of the grant.\nOur stock options are classified as equity awards. The fair value of our stock options was calculated using a binomial option-pricing model. \nThe following table shows the estimated weighted-average fair value per stock option granted along with the weighted-average assumptions used in the valuation models:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStock options granted\n294,990\n \n257,780\n \n437,269\n \nEstimated weighted-average fair value per stock option\n$\n16.19\n \n$\n19.58\n \n$\n14.71\n \nAssumptions used to value the options:\nRisk-free interest rate\n3.9\n% – \n5.4\n%\n3.8\n% – \n4.8\n%\n0.2\n% – \n1.6\n%\nDividend yield\n3.8\n \n%\n3.2\n \n%\n3.2\n \n%\nExpected volatility\n22.0\n \n%\n22.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nExpected life (years)\n8.4\n8.3\n8.7\nThe risk-free interest rate was based on the United States Treasury interest rate with a term consistent with the expected life of the stock options. The dividend yield was based on our dividend rate at the time of the grant and historical stock prices. Expected volatility and expected life assumptions were based on our historical experience.\nRestricted Shares\nRestricted shares granted to employees generally have a vesting period of \nthree years\n with one-third of the award vesting on each anniversary of the grant date. Restricted shares granted to non-employee directors fully vest after \none year\n.\nOur restricted shares are classified as equity awards.\nPerformance Units\nOfficers and other key employees are granted performance units under the WEC Energy Group Performance Unit Plan. All grants of performance units are settled in cash and are accounted for as liability awards accordingly. Performance units accrue forfeitable dividend equivalents in the form of additional performance units. The fair value of the performance units reflects our estimate of the final expected value of the awards, which is based on our stock price and performance achievement under the terms of the award. Stock-based compensation costs are generally recorded over the performance period, which is \nthree years\n. \nThe ultimate number of performance units that will be paid out is dependent on our total shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus dividends) as compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group of companies over \nthree years\n, as well as other performance metrics, as may be determined by the Compensation Committee. Under the terms of awards granted prior to 2023, participants may earn between \n0\n% and \n175\n% of the performance unit award based on our total shareholder return. Pursuant to the plan terms governing these awards, these percentages can be adjusted upwards or downwards by up to \n10\n% based on our performance against additional performance measures, if any, adopted by the Compensation Committee. \nThe WEC Energy Group Performance Unit Plan was amended and restated, effective January 1, 2023. In accordance with the amended plan, the Compensation Committee selected multiple performance measures that will be weighted to determine the ultimate payout for the awards granted in 2023, 2024, and 2025. The ultimate number of units that will be paid out will be based on our total shareholder return compared to the total shareholder return of a peer group of companies over \nthree years\n (\n55\n%), and our performance against the weighted average authorized ROE of all of our utility subsidiaries (\n45\n%). In addition, the Compensation \n2024 Form 10-K\n113\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nCommittee selected the level of our stock price to earnings ratio compared to our peer companies as a performance measure that can increase the payout by up to \n25\n%. In no event can the performance unit payout be greater than \n200\n% of the target award.\nSee Note 11, Common Equity, for more information on our stock-based compensation plans.\n(o) Earnings Per Share\n—\nWe compute basic earnings per share by dividing our net income attributed to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in a similar manner, but includes the exercise and/or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities. Our potentially dilutive securities include stock options and shares issuable upon the conversion of the 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes.\nThe dilutive impact from our in-the-money stock options is calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 excluded \n66,870\n; \n1,716,286\n; and \n653,323\n stock options, respectively, that had an anti-dilutive effect. \nPotentially dilutive common shares issuable upon conversion of the 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes are calculated using the if-converted method. For the year ended December 31, 2024, there were \nno\n shares of our common stock related to the potential conversion of the 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes included in our diluted earnings per share calculation as the impact was anti-dilutive.\n(p) Leases\n—\nWe recognize a right of use asset and lease liability for operating and finance leases with a term of greater than \none year\n. As a policy election, we account for each lease component separately from the nonlease components of a contract.\nWe are currently party to several easement agreements that allow us access to land we do not own for the purpose of constructing and maintaining certain electric power and natural gas equipment. The majority of payments we make related to easements relate to our renewable generating facilities. We have not classified our easements as leases because we view the entire parcel of land specified in our easement agreements to be the identified asset, not just that portion of the parcel that contains our easement. As such, we have concluded that we do not control the use of an identified asset related to our easement agreements, nor do we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits associated with these shared-use assets.\nSee Note 15, Leases, for more information.\n(q) Income Taxes\n—\nWe follow the liability method in accounting for income taxes. Accounting guidance for income taxes requires the recording of deferred assets and liabilities to recognize the expected future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns and the adjustment of deferred tax balances to reflect tax rate changes. We are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets would expire before being realized. If we conclude that certain deferred tax assets are likely to expire before being realized, a valuation allowance would be established against those assets. GAAP requires that, if we conclude in a future period that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets would be realized before expiration, we reverse the related valuation allowance in that period. Any change to the allowance, as a result of a change in judgment about the realization of deferred tax assets, is reported in income tax expense.\nITCs are deferred and amortized over the life of the assets. PTCs are recognized in the period in which such credits are generated. The amount of the credit is based upon power production from our qualifying generation facilities. We file a consolidated federal income tax return. Accordingly, we allocate federal current tax expense, benefits, and credits to our subsidiaries based on their separate tax computations and our ability to monetize all credits on our consolidated federal return. \nWe recognize interest and penalties accrued, related to unrecognized tax benefits, in income tax expense in our income statements.\nThe IRA contains a tax credit transferability provision that allows us to sell PTCs produced after December 31, 2022, to third parties. In 2023 and 2024, under this transferability provision, we entered into agreements to sell substantially all of the PTCs we generated in 2023 and 2024 to third parties. In October 2024, we entered into an agreement to sell the majority of the PTCs expected to be generated in 2025 to a third party. We elect to account for tax credits transferred under the scope of ASC 740. We include the discount from the sale of tax credits as a component of income tax expense. We also include any expected proceeds from the sale of tax credits in the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets related to PTCs. The sale of tax credits is presented in the operating activities section of the statements of cash flows consistent with the presentation of cash taxes paid.\nIn April 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether expenses to repair, maintain, replace, or improve natural gas transmission and distribution property must \n2024 Form 10-K\n114\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nbe capitalized for tax purposes. We adopted the safe harbor method of accounting for certain of our utilities on our 2023 tax return, which increased our deferred tax liabilities. We are still evaluating whether this new guidance can be adopted by our remaining utilities.\nSee Note 16, Income Taxes, for more information.\n(r) Fair Value Measurements\n—\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).\nFair value accounting rules provide a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.\nLevel 2 – Pricing inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly, but are not quoted prices included within Level 1. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using external inputs within models or other valuation methods.\nLevel 3 – Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methods that result in management's best estimate of fair value. Level 3 instruments include those that may be more structured or otherwise tailored to customers' needs.\nAssets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We use a mid-market pricing convention (the mid-point price between bid and ask prices) as a practical measure for valuing certain derivative assets and liabilities. We primarily use a market approach for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.\nWhen possible, we base the valuations of our assets and liabilities on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. These valuations are classified in Level 1. The valuations of certain contracts not classified as Level 1 may be based on quoted market prices received from counterparties and/or observable inputs for similar instruments. Transactions valued using these inputs are classified in Level 2. Certain derivatives, such as FTRs and TCRs, are categorized in Level 3 due to the significance of unobservable or internally-developed inputs. FTRs and TCRs are valued using auction prices from the applicable RTO. \nSee Note 17, Fair Value Measurements, for more information.\n(s) Derivative Instruments\n—\nWe use derivatives as part of our risk management program to manage the risks associated with the price volatility of interest rates, purchased power, generation, and natural gas costs for the benefit of our customers and shareholders. Our approach is non-speculative and designed to mitigate risk. Regulated hedging programs are approved by our state regulators.\nWe record derivative instruments on our balance sheets as assets or liabilities measured at fair value unless they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception, and are so designated. We continually assess our contracts designated as normal and will discontinue the treatment of these contracts as normal if the required criteria are no longer met. Changes in the derivative's fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met or we receive regulatory treatment for the derivative. For most energy-related physical and financial contracts in our regulated operations that qualify as derivatives, our regulators allow the effects of fair value accounting to be offset to regulatory assets and liabilities. \nWe classify derivative assets and liabilities as current or long-term on our balance sheets based on the maturities of the underlying contracts. Cash flows from derivative activities are presented in the same category as the item being hedged within operating activities on our statements of cash flows.\nDerivative accounting rules provide the option to present certain asset and liability derivative positions net on the balance sheets and to net the related cash collateral against these net derivative positions. We elected not to net these items. On our balance \n2024 Form 10-K\n115\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nsheets, cash collateral provided to others is reflected in other current assets, and cash collateral received is reflected in other current liabilities. See Note 18, Derivative Instruments, for more information.\n(t) Guarantees\n—\nWe follow the guidance of the Guarantees Topic of the FASB ASC, which requires, under certain circumstances, that the guarantor recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee at its inception. See Note 19, Guarantees, for more information.\n(u) Employee Benefits\n—\nThe costs of pension and OPEB plans are expensed over the periods during which employees render service. These costs are distributed among our subsidiaries based on current employment status and actuarial calculations, as applicable. Our regulators allow recovery in rates for the utilities' net periodic benefit cost calculated under GAAP. See Note 20, Employee Benefits, for more information.\n(v) Customer Deposits and Credit Balances\n—\nWhen utility customers apply for new service, they may be required to provide a deposit for the service. Customer deposits are recorded within other current liabilities on our balance sheets.\nUtility customers can elect to be on a budget plan. Under this type of plan, a monthly installment amount is calculated based on estimated annual usage. During the year, the monthly installment amount is reviewed by comparing it to actual usage. If necessary, an adjustment is made to the monthly amount. Annually, the budget plan is reconciled to actual annual usage. Payments in excess of actual customer usage are recorded within other current liabilities on our balance sheets.\n(w) Environmental Remediation Costs\n—\nWe are subject to federal and state environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to pay for environmental remediation at sites where we have been, or may be, identified as a potentially responsible party. Loss contingencies may exist for the remediation of hazardous substances at various potential sites, including CCR landfills and manufactured gas plant sites. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information regarding CCR landfills and Note 24, Commitments and Contingencies, for more information regarding manufactured gas plant sites.\nWe record environmental remediation liabilities when site assessments indicate remediation is probable, and we can reasonably estimate the loss or a range of losses. The estimate includes both our share of the liability and any additional amounts that will not be paid by other potentially responsible parties or the government. When possible, we estimate costs using site-specific information but also consider historical experience for costs incurred at similar sites. Remediation efforts for a particular site generally extend over a period of several years. During this period, the laws governing the remediation process may change, as well as site conditions, potentially affecting the cost of remediation.\nOur utilities have received approval to defer certain environmental remediation costs, as well as estimated future costs, through a regulatory asset. The recovery of deferred costs is subject to the applicable state regulatory commission's approval.\nWe review our estimated costs of remediation annually for our manufactured gas plant sites and CCR landfills. We adjust the liabilities and related regulatory assets, as appropriate, to reflect the new cost estimates. Any material changes in cost estimates are adjusted throughout the year.\n(x) Customer Concentrations of Credit Risk\n—\nThe geographic concentration of our customers did not contribute significantly to our overall exposure to credit risk. We periodically review customers' credit ratings, financial statements, and historical payment performance and require them to provide collateral or other security as needed. Credit risk exposure at WE, WPS, WG, PGL, and NSG is mitigated by their recovery mechanisms for uncollectible expense discussed in Note 1(d), Operating Revenues. As a result, we did not have any significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2024. In addition, there were \nno\n customers that accounted for more than \n10\n% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024\n.\nNOTE 2—\nACQUISITIONS\nIn accordance with Topic 805: Clarifying the Definition of a Business (ASU 2017-01), transactions are evaluated and are accounted for as acquisitions of assets or businesses, and transaction costs are capitalized in asset acquisitions.

The remaining $\n445.8\n million represents our estimated future cash expenditures.\n(6)    \nThis regulatory asset relates to WE's 2014 announcement to retire the PIPP. Despite WE's intent to retire the PIPP, MISO designated the PIPP as a SSR, which meant the PIPP's operation was necessary for reliability, and the plant could not be shut down until new generation or transmission facilities were built. In December 2014, the PSCW authorized escrow accounting for WE's SSR revenues because of the fluctuations in the actual revenues WE received under the PIPP SSR agreements. The rate order WE received from the PSCW in December 2019 authorized recovery of this SSR regulatory asset over a \n15\n-year period that began on January 1, 2020.\n(7)    \nPrimarily relates to costs associated with the long-term service agreements our Wisconsin utilities have with Bluewater for natural gas storage services. The PSCW has approved escrow accounting for these costs. As a result, our Wisconsin utilities defer as a regulatory asset or liability the difference between actual storage costs and those included in rates until recovery or refund is authorized in a future rate proceeding.\n(8)    \nRepresents amounts recoverable from customers related to programs at the utilities designed to meet energy efficiency standards.\nThe following regulatory liabilities were reflected on our balance sheets as of December 31:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nSee Note\nRegulatory liabilities\nIncome tax related items\n$\n1,825.4\n \n$\n1,901.8\n \n16\nRemoval costs \n(1)\n1,458.2\n \n1,329.9\n \nPension and OPEB benefits \n(2)\n308.5\n \n299.2\n \n20, 26\nEnergy costs refundable through rate adjustments\n160.8\n \n72.4\n \n1(d)\nUncollectible expense\n47.2\n \n21.2\n \n5\nRevenue requirements of renewable generation facilities \n(3)\n44.2\n \n—\n \n26\nDerivatives\n36.9\n \n19.2\n \n1(s)\nElectric transmission costs \n(4)\n19.7\n \n30.3\n \nOther, net\n102.4\n \n71.2\n \nTotal regulatory liabilities\n$\n4,003.3\n \n$\n3,745.2\n \nBalance sheet presentation\nOther current liabilities\n$\n45.3\n \n$\n47.5\n \nRegulatory liabilities\n3,958.0\n \n3,697.7\n \nTotal regulatory liabilities\n$\n4,003.3\n \n$\n3,745.2\n \n(1)    \nRepresents amounts collected from customers to cover the future cost of property, plant, and equipment removals that are not legally required.

Due to the retirement of these units and the determination that recovery was probable, their net book value of $\n75.3\n million at December 31, 2024 was classified as a regulatory asset. In addition, a $\n43.8\n million cost of removal reserve related to the units continued to be classified as a regulatory liability at December 31, 2024. Not included in these amounts was $\n8.6\n million of deferred tax liabilities previously recorded for the retired units. Effective with its rate order issued by the PSCW in December 2022, WE received approval to collect a return of and on the entire net book value of OCPP Units 5 and 6 and, as a result, will continue to amortize the regulatory asset on a straight-line basis, using the composite depreciation rates \n2024 Form 10-K\n125\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\napproved by the PSCW before the units were retired.

The net book value of this plant was $\n506.8\n million at December 31, 2024, representing book value less cost of removal and accumulated depreciation. In addition, previously deferred unprotected tax benefits from the Tax Legislation related to the unrecovered balance of this plant were $\n15.4\n million as of December 31, 2024. The net amount of $\n491.4\n million was classified as a regulatory asset on our balance sheet at December 31, 2024 due to the retirement of the plant. This regulatory asset does not include certain other previously recorded deferred tax liabilities of $\n138.0\n million related to the retired Pleasant Prairie power plant. Pursuant to its rate order issued by the PSCW in December 2019, WE will continue to amortize this regulatory asset on a straight-line basis through 2039, using the composite depreciation rates approved by the PSCW before this plant was retired. The amortization is included in depreciation and amortization in the income statement. WE also has FERC approval to continue to collect the net book value of the Pleasant Prairie power plant using the approved composite depreciation rates, in addition to a return on the remaining net book value. \nWE received approval from the PSCW in December 2019 to collect a full return of the net book value of the Pleasant Prairie power plant and a return on all but $\n100\n million of the net book value. During May 2021, WE securitized the remaining $\n100\n million of the Pleasant Prairie power plant's book value, the carrying costs accrued on the $\n100\n million during the securitization process, and the related financing fees, in accordance with a written order issued by the PSCW in November 2020. See Note 23, Variable Interest Entities, for more information on this securitization.\nPresque Isle Power Plant\nPursuant to MISO's April 2018 approval of the retirement of the PIPP, these units were retired on March 31, 2019. The net book value of the PIPP was $\n142.6\n million at December 31, 2024, representing book value less cost of removal and accumulated depreciation. In addition, previously deferred unprotected tax benefits from the Tax Legislation related to the unrecovered balance of these units were $\n4.4\n million as of December 31, 2024. The net amount of $\n138.2\n million was classified as a regulatory asset on our balance sheet at December 31, 2024 as a result of the retirement of the plant. This regulatory asset does not include certain other previously recorded deferred tax liabilities of $\n38.7\n million related to the retired PIPP. After the retirement of the PIPP, a portion of the regulatory asset and related cost of removal reserve was transferred to UMERC for recovery from its retail customers. In WE's rate order issued by the PSCW in December 2019 and UMERC's rate order issued by the MPSC in October 2024, WE and UMERC received approval to collect a return of and on the net book value of the PIPP and, as a result, will continue to amortize the regulatory assets on a straight-line basis through 2037, using the composite depreciation rates approved by the PSCW before the units were retired. This amortization is included in depreciation and amortization in the income statement. WE also has FERC approval to continue to collect the net book value of the PIPP using the approved composite depreciation rates, in addition to a return on the remaining net book value. \nPulliam Power Plant\nIn connection with a MISO ruling, WPS retired Pulliam Units 7 and 8 on October 21, 2018. The net book value of the Pulliam units was $\n29.3\n million at December 31, 2024, representing book value less cost of removal and accumulated depreciation.

Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements impose certain restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances. All of our utility subsidiaries, with the exception of UMERC and MGU, are prohibited from loaning funds to us, either directly or indirectly.\nIn accordance with their most recent rate orders, WE, WPS, and WG may not pay common dividends above the test year forecasted amounts reflected in their respective rate cases, if it would cause their average common equity ratio, on a financial basis, to fall \n2024 Form 10-K\n132\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nbelow their authorized level of \n53.0\n%. A return of capital in excess of the test year amount can be paid by each company at the end of the year provided that their respective average common equity ratios do not fall below the authorized level.\nWE may not pay common dividends to us under WE's Restated Articles of Incorporation if any dividends on its outstanding preferred stock have not been paid. In addition, pursuant to the terms of WE's \n3.60\n% Serial Preferred Stock, WE's ability to declare common dividends would be limited to \n75\n% or \n50\n% of net income during a \n12\n-month period if its common stock equity to total capitalization, as defined in the preferred stock designation, is less than \n25\n% and \n20\n%, respectively.\nNSG's long-term debt obligations contain provisions and covenants restricting the payment of cash dividends and the purchase or redemption of its capital stock.\nThe long-term debt obligations of UMERC, Bluewater Gas Storage, and ATC Holding contain a provision requiring them to maintain a total funded debt to capitalization ratio of \n65\n% or less.\nThe long-term debt obligations of WECI Wind Holding I, WECI Wind Holding II, and WECI Energy Holding III contain various conditions that must be met prior to them making any cash distributions. Included in these provisions is a requirement to maintain a debt service coverage ratio of \n1.2\n or greater for the \n12\n-month period prior to the distribution. \nWEC Energy Group has the option to defer interest payments on its 2024A Junior Notes and 2024B Junior Notes, from time to time, for \none\n or more periods of up to \n10\n consecutive years per period. During any period in which it defers interest payments, it may not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, repurchase or acquire, its common stock. \nSee Note 13, Short-Term Debt and Lines of Credit, for discussion of certain financial covenants related to short-term debt obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, restricted net assets of our consolidated subsidiaries totaled approximately $\n13\n billion.

During 2023 and 2022, we instructed our independent agents to purchase shares on the open market to fulfill obligations under these plans. As such, \nno\n new shares of common stock were issued during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\nOn August 6, 2024, we entered into an EDA, under which we may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of our common stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $\n1.5\n billion through an at-the-market offering program, which includes an equity forward sales component. We may offer and sell our common shares through the sales agents party to the EDA during the term of the agreement. The EDA will terminate upon the earliest of (i) the sale of all common stock subject to the EDA, (ii) termination of the EDA pursuant to its terms, or (iii) August 31, 2027. Actual sales of common stock under the EDA will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock, capital needs, and our determination of the appropriate sources of funding. Any shares offered and sold will be done pursuant to our registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on August 5, 2024 and the related prospectus supplement. During the year ended December 31, 2024, we issued \n1,030,674\n shares of common stock under the EDA and received proceeds of $\n98.3\n million, which is net of $\n1.7\n million of commissions and other fees.

See Note 23, Variable Interest Entities, for more information.\nWe amortize debt premiums, discounts, and debt issuance costs over the life of the debt and we include the costs in interest expense.\nIn December 2024, the DOE issued to WE a conditional commitment for a federal loan guarantee for up to $\n2.5\n billion of borrowings that would be used by WE to fund a portion of the costs to construct certain utility-scale renewable generation projects. The conditional commitment was issued pursuant to provisions of the IRA. Under the conditional commitment, the guaranteed borrowings would be senior, unsecured borrowings of WE made through the Federal Financing Bank and reduce WE's issuance of senior, unsecured obligations in the capital markets. Final approval and issuance of a loan guarantee by the DOE is subject to numerous conditions, including negotiation of definitive agreements, completion of due diligence by the DOE, receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of other conditions. In addition, in January 2025, President Trump issued an executive order that requires all federal agencies to immediately halt the disbursement of funds under the IRA and to review their processes for issuing, among other things, loan guarantees. There can be no assurance that the DOE will issue the loan guarantee for WE.\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nIn January and February 2024, pursuant to a tender offer, we purchased $\n122.1\n million aggregate principal amount of the $\n500.0\n million outstanding of our 2007 Junior Notes for $\n115.2\n million with proceeds from issuing commercial paper. We recorded a $\n6.4\n million gain related to the early settlement. Additionally, in May 2024, we repurchased $\n19.0\n million aggregate principal amount of the $\n377.9\n million outstanding of our 2007 Junior Notes for $\n18.7\n million, plus accrued interest, with proceeds received from issuing commercial paper. We recorded a $\n0.2\n million gain related to the early settlement. In December 2024, we redeemed the remaining $\n358.9\n million outstanding principal at par, plus accrued interest, of our 2007 Junior Notes with the proceeds we received from the issuance of our 2024A Junior Notes and 2024B Junior Notes. \nIn March 2024, our $\n600.0\n million of \n0.80\n% Senior Notes, due March 15, 2024, matured, and outstanding principal and accrued interest were paid with proceeds received from issuing commercial paper.\nIn December 2024, we issued $\n254.0\n million of \n6.69\n% Junior Notes, due June 15, 2055 and $\n496.0\n million of \n6.74\n% Junior Notes due June 15, 2055 and used the net proceeds to repay the remaining aggregate principal amount of our 2007 Junior Notes and for other general corporate purposes.\nIn December 2024, pursuant to a tender offer, we repurchased $\n250.0\n million aggregate principal amount of the $\n600.0\n million outstanding of our \n5.60\n% Senior Notes due September 12, 2026 and repurchased $\n150.0\n million aggregate principal amount of the $\n450.0\n million outstanding of our \n1.80\n% Senior Notes due October 15, 2030, for $\n380.9\n million, plus accrued interest, with proceeds received from issuing commercial paper. As a result of the repurchase, we recorded a $\n16.5\n million gain on debt extinguishment. \nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we issued $\n862.5\n million of 2027 Notes and $\n862.5\n million of 2029 Notes. The 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and bear interest at an annual rate of \n4.375\n%, payable semiannually beginning on December 1, 2024. Proceeds from the offerings were used to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. \nThe 2027 Notes will mature on June 1, 2027, and the 2029 Notes will mature on June 1, 2029, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms, or in the case of the 2029 Notes, redeemed by us.

We may redeem for cash all or part of the 2029 Notes, at our option, on or after June 1, 2027 and on or before the \n41\nst scheduled trading day immediately preceding their maturity date, if the last reported sale price per share of our common stock has been at least \n130\n% of the conversion price of the 2029 Notes then in effect for at least \n20\n trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any \n30\n consecutive trading day period. Any redemptions or fundamental change repurchases of the 2027 Notes or 2029 Notes will be at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nHolders may convert all or any portion of their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2027, in the case of the 2027 Notes, and March 1, 2029, in the case of the 2029 Notes, only under the following circumstances:\n•\nDuring any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2024 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least \n20\n trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of \n30\n consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to \n130\n% of the conversion price of such series of notes on each applicable trading day;\n•\nDuring the \nfive\n consecutive business day period immediately after any \nten\n consecutive trading day period (measurement period) in which the trading price per $\n1,000\n principal amount of notes of such series for each trading day of the measurement period was less than \n98\n% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate of such series of notes on each such trading day; \n•\nUpon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as defined in the related indenture; \n•\nIn the case of the 2029 Notes only, if we call any of the 2029 Notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day prior to the redemption date, but only with respect to the 2029 Notes called (or deemed called) for redemption.\nHolders may convert all or any portion of their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances, on or after March 1, 2027, in the case of the 2027 Notes, or March 1, 2029, in the case of the 2029 Notes, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of such series of notes.\nUpon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted.\nThe initial conversion rate for both the 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes is \n10.1243\n shares of common stock per $\n1,000\n principal amount, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $\n98.77\n per share of our common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, as defined in the related indenture, but will not be adjusted for accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change, as defined in the related indenture, we will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate by a number of additional shares of common stock for conversions in connection with the make-whole fundamental change.\nAs of December 31, 2024, none of the conditions allowing holders to convert their notes were met. In accordance with the guidance in ASC Subtopic 470-20, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options, the 2027 Notes and 2029 Notes were accounted for in their entirety as a liability on our balance sheet. \nThe following is a summary of our convertible debt instruments as of December 31, 2024:\n(in millions)\nPrincipal Amount\nUnamortized Debt Issuance Costs\nNet Carrying Amount\nFair Value Amount\n (1)\n2027 Notes\n$\n862.5\n \n$\n(\n8.0\n)\n$\n854.5\n \n$\n920.6\n \n2029 Notes\n862.5\n \n(\n8.8\n)\n853.7\n \n929.1\n \n(1)    \nThe fair values are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Certain of our leases contain options for early termination or to renew past the initial term, as set forth in the lease agreements. These options are included in our calculation of the lease obligations if it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. \nObligations Under Finance Leases\nIn accordance with ASC Subtopic 980-842, Regulated Operations – Leases (Subtopic 980-842), the timing of expense recognition associated with our finance leases is modified to conform to the rate treatment. Amortization of the right-of-use asset is modified so that the total of the imputed interest and amortization costs equals the lease expense that is allowed for rate-making purposes. The difference between this lease expense and the sum of imputed interest and unadjusted amortization costs calculated under Topic 842 is deferred as a regulatory asset on our balance sheets in accordance with Subtopic 980-842. \nLand Leases – Utility Solar Generation\nWe have various land leases related to our investments in utility solar generation. Each lease has an initial term and \none\n or more optional extensions. We expect the optional extensions to be exercised, and, as a result, all of the land leases are being amortized over an extended term of approximately \n50\n years. Once a solar project achieves commercial operation, the lease liability is remeasured to reflect the final total acres being leased. Our payments related to these leases are being recovered through rates. \nPower Purchase Commitment\nIn 1997, WE entered into a \n25\n-year PPA with LSP-Whitewater Limited Partnership. The contract, for \n236.5\n MWs of firm capacity from a natural gas-fired cogeneration facility, included \nzero\n minimum energy requirements. The PPA expired on May 31, 2022; however, in November 2021, WE entered into a tolling agreement with LSP-Whitewater Limited Partnership that commenced on June 1, 2022. Concurrent with the execution of the tolling agreement, WE and WPS entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire the natural gas-fired cogeneration facility and the acquisition closed effective January 1, 2023. See Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information. Both the PPA and the tolling agreement were accounted for as a finance lease prior to the acquisition.\nLand Leases – Non-Utility Energy Infrastructure Solar Generation\nWe have various land leases related to our investments in non-utility solar generation. Each lease has an initial term and \none\n or more optional extensions. We expect the optional extensions to be exercised, and, as a result, all of the land leases are being amortized over an extended term of approximately \n50\n years. \n2024 Form 10-K\n141\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nAmounts Recognized in the Financial Statements and Other Information\nThe components of lease expense and supplemental cash flow information related to our leases for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFinance lease expense\nAmortization of right of use assets \n(1)\n$\n0.2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n6.0\n \nInterest on lease liabilities \n(2)\n1.8\n \n0.8\n \n0.9\n \nOperating lease expense \n(3)\n5.2\n \n4.7\n \n6.1\n \nShort-term lease expense \n(3)\n0.6\n \n1.2\n \n0.9\n \nTotal lease expense\n$\n7.8\n \n$\n6.7\n \n$\n13.9\n \nOther information\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows from finance leases\n$\n1.8\n \n$\n0.8\n \n$\n0.9\n \nOperating cash flows from operating leases\n7.1\n \n6.8\n \n5.7\n \nFinancing cash flows from finance leases\n—\n \n—\n \n6.0\n \nNon-cash activities:\nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for finance lease liabilities \n(4)\n$\n153.2\n \n$\n32.8\n \n$\n57.6\n \nRight of use assets obtained in exchange for operating lease liabilities\n2.6\n \n18.3\n \n—\n \nWeighted-average remaining lease term – finance leases\n50.2\n years\n49.4\n years\n30.0\n years\nWeighted-average remaining lease term – operating leases\n25.1\n years\n22.4\n years\n12.0\n years\nWeighted-average discount rate – finance lease \n(5)\n5.9\n \n%\n5.3\n \n%\n3.9\n \n%\nWeighted average discount rate – operating leases \n(5)\n5.9\n \n%\n5.8\n \n%\n3.4\n \n%\n(1)    \nAmortization of right of use assets was included as a component of depreciation and amortization expense.\n(2)    \nInterest on lease liabilities was included as a component of interest expense.\n(3)    \nOperating and short-term lease expense were included as a component of other operation and maintenance expense.\n(4)    \nAmounts are net of any reductions to right of use assets and finance lease liabilities resulting from remeasurements.\n(5)    \nBecause our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we used an estimate of the fully collateralized incremental borrowing rates based upon information available for similarly rated companies in determining the present value of lease payments.\n \n2024 Form 10-K\n142\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nThe following table summarizes our finance and operating lease right of use assets and obligations at December 31:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nBalance Sheet Location\nRight of use assets\nOperating lease right of use assets, net\n$\n32.1\n \n$\n32.0\n \nOther long-term assets\nFinance lease right of use assets, net\nLand leases – utility solar generation\n$\n235.8\n \n$\n132.7\n \nLand leases –non-utility energy infrastructure solar generation\n43.5\n \n—\n \nOther\n2.0\n \n1.1\n \nTotal finance lease right of use assets, net \n(1)\n$\n281.3\n \n$\n133.8\n \nProperty, plant, and equipment, net\nLease obligations\nCurrent operating lease liabilities\n$\n4.3\n \n$\n4.7\n \nOther current liabilities\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\n$\n37.5\n \n$\n38.8\n \nOther long-term liabilities\nCurrent finance lease liabilities\nOther\n$\n0.2\n \n$\n—\n \nOther current liabilities\nLong-term finance lease liabilities\nLand leases – utility solar generation\n$\n257.9\n \n$\n144.8\n \nLand leases –non-utility energy infrastructure solar generation\n43.8\n \n—\n \nOther\n1.6\n \n1.1\n \nTotal long-term finance lease liabilities\n$\n303.3\n \n$\n145.9\n \nFinance lease obligations\n(1)    \nAmounts are net of accumulated amortization of $\n10.0\n million and $\n6.1\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFuture minimum lease payments under our operating and finance leases and the present value of our net minimum lease payments as of December 31, 2024, were as follows:\n(in millions)\nTotal Operating Leases\nLand Leases -

In addition, we and our subsidiaries offer multiple OPEB plans to employees. The benefits for a portion of these plans are funded through irrevocable trusts, as allowed for income tax purposes. We also offer medical, dental, and life insurance benefits to active employees and their dependents. We expense the costs of these benefits as incurred.\nOther than those employees who receive a contribution to their 401(k) savings plan as described below, former Wisconsin Energy Corporation employees who started with the company after 1995 receive a benefit based on a percentage of their annual salary plus an interest credit. Employees who started before 1996 receive a benefit based upon years of service and final average salary. Wisconsin Energy Corporation management employees hired after December 31, 2014, and certain new represented employees hired after May 1, 2017, receive an annual company contribution to their 401(k) savings plan instead of being enrolled in the defined benefit plans. \nFor former Integrys employees, the defined benefit pension plans are closed to all new hires. In addition, the service accruals for the defined benefit pension plans were frozen for non-union employees as of January 1, 2013. These employees receive an annual company contribution to their 401(k) savings plan, which is calculated based on age, wages, and full years of vesting service as of December 31 each year.\nWe use a year-end measurement date to measure the funded status of all of our pension and OPEB plans. Due to the regulated nature of our business, we have concluded that substantially all of the unrecognized costs resulting from the recognition of the funded status of our pension and OPEB plans qualify as a regulatory asset.\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in our plans' benefit obligations and fair value of assets:\nPension Benefits\nOPEB Benefits\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nChange in benefit obligation\nObligation at January 1\n$\n2,352.4\n \n$\n2,315.9\n \n$\n448.1\n \n$\n402.3\n \nService cost\n24.2\n \n24.0\n \n10.9\n \n9.8\n \nInterest cost\n116.6\n \n122.3\n \n22.7\n \n21.6\n \nParticipant contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n11.2\n \n11.8\n \nActuarial (gain) loss\n(\n99.6\n)\n81.9\n \n6.9\n \n45.9\n \nBenefit payments\n(\n184.4\n)\n(\n191.7\n)\n(\n41.7\n)\n(\n46.0\n)\nFederal subsidy on benefits paid\nN/A\nN/A\n1.4\n \n1.5\n \nTransfer\n—\n \n—\n \n1.4\n \n1.2\n \nObligation at December 31\n$\n2,209.2\n \n$\n2,352.4\n \n$\n460.9\n \n$\n448.1\n \nChange in fair value of plan assets\nFair value at January 1\n$\n2,665.8\n \n$\n2,628.0\n \n$\n829.6\n \n$\n835.3\n \nActual return on plan assets\n129.8\n \n214.9\n \n49.5\n \n76.4\n \nEmployer contributions net of plan transfer \n(1)\n13.1\n \n14.6\n \n1.4\n \n(\n47.9\n)\nParticipant contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n11.2\n \n11.8\n \nBenefit payments\n(\n184.4\n)\n(\n191.7\n)\n(\n41.7\n)\n(\n46.0\n)\nFair value at December 31\n$\n2,624.3\n \n$\n2,665.8\n \n$\n850.0\n \n$\n829.6\n \nFunded status at December 31\n$\n415.1\n \n$\n313.4\n \n$\n389.1\n \n$\n381.5\n \n(1)    \nEmployer contribution includes a $\n50.0\n million transfer out of the WEC Energy Group Retiree Welfare Plan, in 2023, associated with the overfunded position of this plan.\nIn 2024, we had actuarial gains related to our pension benefit obligations of $\n99.6\n million and actuarial losses in 2023 of $\n81.9\n million.

For 2025, the expected return on assets assumption is \n6.61\n% for the pension plans and \n6.50\n% for the OPEB plans.\nPlan Assets\nCurrent pension trust assets and amounts which are expected to be contributed to the trusts in the future are expected to be adequate to meet pension payment obligations to current and future retirees.\nThe Investment Trust Policy Committee oversees investment matters related to all of our funded benefit plans. The Committee works with external actuaries and investment consultants on an on-going basis to establish and monitor investment strategies and target asset allocations. Forecasted cash flows for plan liabilities are regularly updated based on annual valuation results. Target allocations are determined utilizing projected benefit payment cash flows and risk analyses of appropriate investments. They are intended to reduce risk, provide long-term financial stability for the plans and maintain funded levels which meet long-term plan obligations while preserving sufficient liquidity for near-term benefit payments.\nThe target asset allocations are \n25\n% equity investments, \n55\n% fixed income investments, and \n20\n% private equity and real estate investments for both the legacy Wisconsin Energy Corporation and legacy Integrys pension trusts. The legacy Wisconsin Energy Corporation OPEB trust target asset allocations are \n45\n% equity investments, \n45\n% fixed income investments, and \n10\n% real estate investments. The two largest legacy OPEB trusts for Integrys have the same target asset allocations of \n45\n% equity investments, \n45\n% fixed income investments, and \n10\n% real estate investments. Equity securities include investments in large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap companies. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage and other asset backed securities, commercial paper, and United States Treasuries.\nPension and OPEB plan investments are recorded at fair value.

The 401(k) savings plans include an Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Certain employees receive an employer retirement contribution, in which amounts are contributed to the employee's savings plan account based on the employee's wages, age, and years of service.

In regards to the first ROE complaint, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion in August 2022 that resulted in ATC recording a reserve for potential refunds based on a \n9.88\n% base ROE. In response to this opinion, the FERC issued an order in October 2024 that required ATC to adopt a \n9.98\n% base ROE. Due to the change between the \n9.88\n% base ROE originally reflected in ATC's reserve and the \n9.98\n% base ROE authorized in the October 2024 FERC order, ATC reduced its refund liability, which increased our pre-tax equity earnings by $\n20.1\n million during the fourth quarter of 2024. \nIn November 2019 and May 2020, the FERC issued orders that addressed the second complaint related to ATC's ROE. In August 2022, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the FERC’s orders. Therefore, during the third quarter of 2022, we reversed a $\n39.1\n million liability for potential future refunds that ATC may have been required to provide, which increased our equity earnings from ATC.\nWe pay ATC for network transmission and other related services it provides. In addition, we provide a variety of operational, maintenance, and project management work for ATC, which is reimbursed by ATC. We are also required to initially fund the construction of transmission infrastructure upgrades needed for new generation projects.

The CODM regularly reviews net income attributed to common shareholders to measure segment profitability and to allocate resources, including assets, to our businesses. Net income attributed to common shareholders best measures our segment profitability as it reflects all revenues and costs, including the impact on our tax provision from tax credits generated through investments in renewable generation facilities. \nOur CODM allocates resources such as employees as well as financial and capital resources to our segments during the annual review of budgets and the capital plan. Our CODM also reviews and revises the resources throughout the year during the monthly forecasting process in order to make timely decisions that align with our overall corporate strategy. The CODM uses each segment’s net income to evaluate performance by comparing actual results to budgeted and forecasted amounts, as well as the ROE earned for each utility within the various utility segments. \nSegments were determined based on a combination of factors, including the regulatory environment of each geographical jurisdiction in which the segment operates, equity investment interests, as well as the revenue streams for the products or services provided to customers through electric, natural gas, and renewable operations. See Note 4, Operating Revenues, for more \n2024 Form 10-K\n155\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\ninformation on disaggregation of operating revenues, including intercompany eliminations. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nAt December 31, 2024, we reported \nsix\n segments, which are described below. All of our operations are located within the United States.\n•\nThe Wisconsin segment includes the electric and natural gas utility operations of WE, WPS, WG, and UMERC.\n•\nThe Illinois segment includes the natural gas utility operations of PGL and NSG.\n•\nThe other states segment includes the natural gas utility operations of MERC and MGU and the non-utility operations of MERC.\n•\nThe electric transmission segment includes our approximate \n60\n% ownership interest in ATC, a for-profit, transmission-only company regulated by the FERC for cost of service and certain state regulatory commissions for routing and siting of transmission projects, and our approximate \n75\n% ownership interest in ATC Holdco, which was formed to invest in transmission-related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint. See Note 21, Investment in Transmission Affiliates, for more information on equity method investments.\n•\nThe non-utility energy infrastructure segment includes:\n◦\nWe Power, which owns and leases generating facilities to WE,\n◦\nBluewater, which owns underground natural gas storage facilities in Michigan that provide approximately one-third of the current storage needs for our Wisconsin natural gas utilities, and\n◦\nWECI, which owns majority interests in multiple renewable generating facilities.\nSee Note 2, Acquisitions, for more information on recent WECI acquisitions.\n•\nThe

and WE.\nNOTE 23—\nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES \nThe primary beneficiary of a VIE must consolidate the entity's assets and liabilities. In addition, certain disclosures are required for significant interest holders in VIEs.\nWe assess our relationships with potential VIEs, such as our coal suppliers, natural gas suppliers, coal transporters, natural gas transporters, and other counterparties related to PPAs, investments, and joint ventures. In making this assessment, we consider, along with other factors, the potential that our contracts or other arrangements provide subordinated financial support, the obligation to absorb the entity's losses, the right to receive residual returns of the entity, and the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance.\n2024 Form 10-K\n159\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nWEPCo Environmental Trust Finance I, LLC\nIn November 2020, the PSCW issued a financing order approving the securitization of $\n100\n million of undepreciated environmental control costs related to WE's retired Pleasant Prairie power plant, the carrying costs accrued on the $\n100\n million during the securitization process, and the related financing fees. The financing order also authorized WE to form WEPCo Environmental Trust, a bankruptcy-remote special purpose entity, for the sole purpose of issuing ETBs to recover the costs approved in the financing order. WEPCo Environmental Trust is a wholly owned subsidiary of WE. \nIn May 2021, WEPCo Environmental Trust issued ETBs and used the proceeds to acquire environmental control property from WE. The environmental control property is recorded as a regulatory asset on our balance sheets and includes the right to impose, collect, and receive a non-bypassable environmental control charge from WE's retail electric distribution customers until the ETBs are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The ETBs are secured by the environmental control property. Cash collections from the environmental control charge and funds on deposit in trust accounts are the sole sources of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders do not have any recourse to WE or any of WE's affiliates. \nWE acts as the servicer of the environmental control property on behalf of WEPCo Environmental Trust and is responsible for metering, calculating, billing, and collecting the environmental control charge. As necessary, WE is authorized to implement periodic adjustments of the environmental control charge. The adjustments are designed to ensure the timely payment of principal, interest, and other ongoing financing costs. WE remits all collections of the environmental control charge to WEPCo Environmental Trust's indenture trustee. \nWEPCo Environmental Trust is a VIE primarily because its equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. As described above, WE has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact WEPCo Environmental Trust's economic performance. Therefore, WE is considered the primary beneficiary of WEPCo Environmental Trust, and consolidation is required. \nThe following table summarizes the impact of WEPCo Environmental Trust on our balance sheets:\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets\nOther current assets (restricted cash)\n$\n1.5\n \n$\n0.8\n \nRegulatory assets\n76.5\n \n85.9\n \nOther long-term assets (restricted cash)\n0.6\n \n0.6\n \nLiabilities\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n9.2\n \n9.0\n \nOther current liabilities (accrued interest)\n0.1\n \n0.1\n \nLong-term debt\n76.4\n \n85.3\n \nInvestment in Transmission Affiliates\nWe own approximately \n60\n% of ATC, a for-profit, electric transmission company regulated by the FERC and certain state regulatory commissions. We have determined that ATC is a VIE but consolidation is not required since we are not ATC's primary beneficiary. As a result of our limited voting rights, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact ATC's economic performance. Therefore, we account for ATC as an equity method investment. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our equity investment in ATC was $\n2,085.1\n million and $\n1,980.8\n million, respectively, which approximates our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with ATC.\nWe also own approximately \n75\n% of ATC Holdco, a separate entity formed in December 2016 to invest in transmission-related projects outside of ATC's traditional footprint. We have determined that ATC Holdco is a VIE but consolidation is not required since we are not ATC Holdco's primary beneficiary. As a result of our limited voting rights, we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact ATC Holdco's economic performance. Therefore, we account for ATC Holdco as an equity method investment. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our equity investment in ATC Holdco was $\n23.8\n million and $\n25.1\n million, respectively, which approximates our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with ATC Holdco.\nSee Note 21, Investment in Transmission Affiliates, for more information, including any significant assets and liabilities related to ATC and ATC Holdco recorded on our balance sheets.\n2024 Form 10-K\n160\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nNOTE 24—\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nWe and our subsidiaries have significant commitments and contingencies arising from our operations, including those related to unconditional purchase obligations, environmental matters, and enforcement and litigation matters.\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nOur electric utilities have obligations to distribute and sell electricity to their customers, and our natural gas utilities have obligations to distribute and sell natural gas to their customers. The utilities expect to recover costs related to these obligations in future customer rates. In order to meet these obligations, we routinely enter into long-term purchase and sale commitments for various quantities and lengths of time.\nThe renewable generation facilities that are part of our non-utility energy infrastructure segment have obligations to distribute and sell electricity through long-term offtake agreements with their customers for all of the energy produced. In order to support these sales obligations, these companies enter into easements and other service agreements associated with the generating facilities.\nThe following table shows our minimum future commitments related to these purchase obligations as of December 31, 2024, including those of our subsidiaries:\nPayments Due By Period\n(in millions)\nDate Contracts Extend Through\nTotal Amounts Committed\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nLater Years\nElectric utility:\nNuclear\n2033\n$\n5,680.3\n \n$\n634.5\n \n$\n681.6\n \n$\n730.4\n \n$\n782.6\n \n$\n838.5\n \n$\n2,012.7\n \nCoal supply and transportation\n2029\n343.4\n \n303.0\n \n33.5\n \n3.3\n \n1.7\n \n1.9\n \n—\n \nPurchased power\n2063\n394.3\n \n59.7\n \n61.4\n \n56.1\n \n52.2\n \n25.5\n \n139.4\n \nOther\n2043\n80.2\n \n10.0\n \n10.1\n \n8.7\n \n7.1\n \n6.3\n \n38.0\n \nNatural gas utility:\nSupply and transportation\n2048\n2,448.0\n \n388.5\n \n357.9\n \n345.2\n \n302.6\n \n217.5\n \n836.3\n \nNon-utility energy infrastructure:\nPurchased power\n2051\n623.0\n \n38.2\n \n38.6\n \n39.3\n \n40.6\n \n39.4\n \n426.9\n \nNatural gas storage and transportation\n2048\n4.8\n \n4.0\n \n—\n \n0.1\n \n—\n \n0.1\n \n0.6\n \nTotal\n$\n9,574.0\n \n$\n1,437.9\n \n$\n1,183.1\n \n$\n1,183.1\n \n$\n1,186.8\n \n$\n1,129.2\n \n$\n3,453.9\n \nEnvironmental Matters\nConsistent with other companies in the energy industry, we face significant ongoing environmental compliance and remediation obligations related to current and past operations. Specific environmental issues affecting us include, but are not limited to, current and future regulation of air emissions such as SO\n2\n, NOx, fine particulates, ozone, mercury, and GHGs; water intake and discharges; management of coal combustion products such as fly ash; and remediation of impacted properties, including former manufactured gas plant sites.\nWe have continued to pursue a proactive strategy to manage our environmental compliance obligations, including:\n•\nthe development of additional sources of renewable electric energy supply, battery storage, and natural gas and LNG storage facilities;\n•\nthe addition of improvements for water quality matters such as treatment technologies to meet regulatory discharge limits and improvements to our cooling water intake systems;\n•\nthe addition of emission control equipment to existing facilities to comply with ambient air quality standards and federal clean air rules;\n•\nthe protection of wetlands and waterways, biodiversity including threatened and endangered species, and cultural resources associated with construction projects;\n•\nthe retirement of older coal-fired power plants and conversion to modern, efficient, natural gas generation, super-critical pulverized coal generation, and/or replacement with renewable generation;\n•\nthe beneficial use of ash and other products from coal-fired and biomass generating units;\n2024 Form 10-K\n161\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\n•\nthe remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites;\n•\nthe reduction of methane emissions across our natural gas distribution system by upgrading infrastructure; and\n•\nthe tracking and reporting of GHG emissions to comply with federal clean air rules.\nAir Quality\nCross State Air Pollution Rule – Good Neighbor Rule \nIn March 2023, the EPA issued its final Good Neighbor Rule, which became effective in August 2023 and requires significant reductions in ozone-forming emissions of NOx from power plants and industrial facilities. After review of the final rule, we believe we are well positioned to meet the requirements.\nOur RICE units in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Wisconsin are not currently subject to the final rule as each unit is less than \n25\n MWs. To the extent we use RICE engines for natural gas distribution operations, those engines not part of an LDC are subject to the emission limits and operational requirements of the rule beginning in 2026. The EPA has exempted LDCs from the final rule.\nIn February 2024, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding stay applications related to the EPA's Good Neighbor Rule. In June 2024, the Supreme Court granted a stay of the Good Neighbor Rule pending disposition of the applicants' petitions for review at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals litigation has been held in abeyance since September 2024, when the court granted the EPA's motion for partial voluntary remand so that it could address issues of severability raised in the Supreme Court's June 2024 opinion granting the petitions for stay of the rule. Pursuant to an order of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, the parties filed motions to govern future proceedings in December 2024. In January 2025, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an order returning the consolidated cases to the court's active docket and establishing a schedule for supplemental briefing on the issue of severability that extends through early March 2025. We will continue to monitor this case as arguments at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals move forward.\nIn November 2024, the EPA issued a Good Neighbor Interim Final Rule that administratively stayed the effectiveness of the Good Neighbor Rule in all states to which it originally applies and ensured implementation of good neighbor obligations previously established to address the 2008 ozone NAAQS while the process works through the courts. We are well positioned to comply with the rule's requirements.\nMercury and Air Toxics Standards\nIn 2012, the EPA issued the MATS to limit emissions of mercury, acid gases, and other hazardous air pollutants. In April 2023, the EPA issued the pre-publication version of a proposed rule to strengthen and update MATS to reflect recent developments in control technologies and performance of coal and oil-fired units. In May 2024, the EPA published a final rule in the Federal Register lowering the PM limit from \n0.03\n lb/MMBtu to \n0.01\n lb/MMBtu. We are well positioned to comply with the rule's requirements.\nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards\nOzone\nAfter completing its review of the 2008 ozone standard, the EPA released a final rule in October 2015, creating a more stringent standard than the 2008 NAAQS. The 2015 ozone standard lowered the 8-hour limit for ground-level ozone. In November 2022, the EPA's 2022 CASAC Ozone Review Panel issued a draft report supporting reconsideration of the 2015 standard. The EPA staff initially issued a draft Policy Assessment in March 2023 that also supported the reconsideration; however, in August 2023, the EPA announced that it was instead restarting its ozone standard evaluation. The EPA released the first two volumes of its Integrated Review Plan in December 2024. This new review is anticipated to take \n3\n to \n5\n years to complete.\nIn February 2022, revisions to the Wisconsin Administrative Code to adopt the 2015 standard were finalized. The amended regulations incorporated by reference the federal air pollution monitoring requirements related to the standard. The WDNR submitted the rule updates as a SIP revision to the EPA, which the EPA approved in February 2023.\nThe EPA's initial nonattainment area designation was effective August 2018, and the attainment status is evaluated every \n3\n years thereafter until attainment is achieved. The Milwaukee, Sheboygan, and Chicago, IL-IN-WI nonattainment areas did not meet the marginal attainment deadline of August 2021, so in April 2022 the EPA proposed \"moderate\" nonattainment status based on the \n2024 Form 10-K\n162\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\n2015 standard. In October 2022, the EPA published its final reclassifications from \"marginal\" to \"moderate\" for these areas, effective November 7, 2022. \nThe most recent attainment evaluation date was in August 2024. The moderate attainment deadline was not met, so in December 2024 the EPA published a final determination reclassifying the nonattainment areas in Wisconsin to a \"serious\" classification effective January 16, 2025. This nonattainment status could have a material adverse effect on future permitting activities for our facilities in applicable locations, including additional costs associated with more strenuous emission control requirements or the need to purchase additional emission reduction credits.\nParticulate Matter\nAll counties within our service territories are in attainment with current 2012 standards for fine PM2.5. Under the Biden Administration's policy review, the EPA concluded that the scientific evidence and information from a December 2020 review of the 2012 standards supported revising the level of the annual standard for the PM2.5 NAAQS to below the current level of \n12\n µg/m\n3\n, while retaining the 24-hour standard of \n35\n µg/m\n3\n. In February 2024, the EPA finalized a rule which lowered the primary (health-based) annual PM2.5 NAAQS to \n9\n µg/m\n3\n. The secondary (welfare-based) PM2.5 standard and 24-hour standards (both primary and secondary) remain unchanged. The EPA has until February 2026 to designate areas as attainment and nonattainment with the new standard. The WDNR will need to draft and submit a SIP for the EPA's approval. A designation of nonattainment status could impact future permitting activities for facilities in applicable locations, including the potential need for improved or new air pollution control equipment. With our planned transition from coal-fired plants to natural gas-fired plants and renewable generating facilities, we do not expect this new standard to have a material impact on our units. \nClimate Change\nIn May 2023, the EPA proposed GHG performance standards for fossil-fired steam generating and natural gas combustion units and also proposed to repeal the Affordable Clean Energy rule, which had replaced the Clean Power Plan. The final rule, known as the Greenhouse Gas Power Plant Rule, was published in May 2024. Pursuant to the final rule, there are \nno\n applicable standards for coal plants until the end of 2031 and after 2031, the applicable standard is dependent upon the unit's retirement date. Coal-fired units that are planned to refuel to natural gas-fired units must convert to natural gas and no longer retain the capability to burn coal by the end of 2029. For new combined cycle natural gas plants above a \n40\n% capacity factor, the rule is dependent upon the implementation of carbon capture by the end of 2031. For new simple cycle natural gas-fired combustion turbines, there are \nno\n applicable limits as long as the capacity factor is less than \n20\n%. Our RICE units in Michigan and the new Weston RICE units are not affected under the rule because the rule excludes RICE units that are less than \n25\n MWs. Numerous parties have challenged the Greenhouse Gas Power Plant Rule through litigation pending in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\nIn March 2024, the EPA announced it had removed regulations on existing natural gas combustion turbines from the rule. At that time, the EPA indicated it would work on new rulemaking phases, focusing on CO\n2 \nemissions, as well as NOx and hazardous air pollutants (formaldehyde) emissions. In November 2024, the EPA released the first proposed rule of the three rule \"packages\" to address NOx emissions from existing combustion turbines. The proposed rule for turbines that operate at a greater than \n20\n% capacity factor, will require more stringent NOx limits and control requirements for new, modified, or reconstructed turbines. For turbines that operate at a capacity of \n20\n% or lower, less restrictive standards and the use of combustion controls would apply. Our combined cycle facilities and the new Oak Creek combustion turbines are well positioned to comply with the proposed rule. As the EPA will not finalize this proposal until late 2025, it could be revised or repealed under the new presidential administration. \nIn April 2024, the EPA issued its final Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule, 40 CFR Part 98, which includes updates to the global warming potentials to determine CO\n2\n equivalency for threshold reporting and the addition of a new section regarding energy consumption. The revisions will impact the reporting required for our electric generation facilities, LDCs, and underground natural gas storage facilities. In May 2024, the EPA also issued its final rule to amend reporting requirements for petroleum and natural gas systems. Under the final rule, new leak emission factors and reporting requirements for large release events will impact the reporting required for our LDCs and underground natural gas storage facilities. \nOur capital plan includes the retirement of older, fossil-fueled generation, to be replaced with zero-carbon-emitting renewables and reliable, efficient natural gas-fueled generation. We have already retired nearly \n2,500\n MWs of fossil-fueled generation since the beginning of 2018, which includes the retirement of OCPP Units 5 and 6 in May 2024, the 2019 retirement of PIPP, and the 2018 retirements of the Pleasant Prairie power plant, the Pulliam power plant, and the jointly-owned Edgewater Unit 4 generating unit. We expect to retire approximately \n1,200\n MWs of additional coal-fired generation by the end of 2031, which includes the planned retirements of OCPP Units 7 and 8, the jointly-owned Columbia Units 1 and 2 while investigating conversion of at least one unit to \n2024 Form 10-K\n163\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nnatural gas, and Weston Unit 3. See Note 7, Property, Plant, and Equipment, for more information related to planned power plant retirements. In May 2021, we announced goals to achieve reductions in carbon emissions from our electric generation fleet by \n60\n% by the end of 2025 and by \n80\n% by the end of 2030, both from a 2005 baseline. We expect to achieve these goals by continuing to make operating refinements, retiring less efficient generating units, and executing our capital plan. Over the longer term, the target for our generation fleet is to be net carbon neutral by 2050. We also believe we will be in a position to eliminate coal as an energy source by the end of 2032.\nWe will also continue to focus on methane emissions reductions by improving our natural gas distribution systems, and have set a target across our natural gas distribution operations to achieve net-zero methane emissions by the end of 2030. We plan to achieve our net-zero goal through an effort that includes continuous operational improvements and equipment upgrades, as well as the use of RNG throughout our natural gas utility distribution systems. In addition, subject to regulatory approval and market conditions, we expect to procure RTCs.\nWater Quality\nClean Water Act Cooling Water Intake Structure Rule\nSection 316(b) of the CWA became effective in October 2014 and requires the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures at existing power plants reflect the BTA for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. The rule applies to all of our existing generating facilities with cooling water intake structures, except for the ERGS units, which were permitted and received a final BTA determination under the rules governing new facilities.\nEffective in June 2020, the requirements of federal Section 316(b) of the CWA were incorporated into the Wisconsin Administrative Code. The WDNR applies this rule when establishing BTA requirements for cooling water intake structures at existing facilities. These BTA requirements are incorporated into WPDES permits for WE and WPS facilities.\nWe have received final or interim BTA determinations for all generation facilities where Section 316(b) is applicable. The most recent BTA determination was for Weston Units 3 and 4. In accordance with the requirements in the CWA, the WDNR reissued the Weston WPDES permit in June 2024 (effective July 1, 2024) that includes a determination that existing technology (wet cooling towers) installed at the units represents BTA for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. With respect to OCPP Units 7 and 8, we believe the WDNR will reach the same BTA determination decision when the WPDES permit for those units is reissued, which is expected in 2025.\nSteam Electric Effluent Limitation Guidelines\nThe EPA's 2015 final ELG rule, which took effect in January 2016 (2015 ELG rule), was modified in 2020 (2020 ELG rule), and again in 2024 with the May 2024 publication of the Supplemental ELG Rule. These rules establish federal technology-based requirements for several types of power plant wastewaters. The \nthree\n requirements that affect WE and WPS facilities relate to discharge limits for BATW, FGD wastewater, and CRL (landfill leachate). Although our coal-fueled facilities were constructed with advanced wastewater treatment technologies that meet many of the discharge limits established by the 2015 rule, facility modifications were still necessary at OCPP, ERGS, and Weston to meet all of the 2015 ELG requirements and the additional ones established by the 2020 ELG rule. Through 2023, compliance costs associated with the 2015 and 2020 ELG rules required $\n105\n million in capital investment.\nThe 2024 Supplemental ELG rule established zero discharge requirements for BATW, FGD, and CRL wastewaters at coal-fueled units with no planned retirement date. The Supplemental ELG Rule also kept \none\n existing and created \none\n new “permanent cessation of coal” subcategory. Those electing to cease coal combustion by either retiring or repowering a unit by December 31, 2028 or December 31, 2034 can limit ELG-related capital investments to what was required by either the 2015 or the 2020 ELG Rule, respectively. For units where cessation of coal is planned to occur no later than December 31, 2034, facility owners must complete all 2020 ELG rule required capital investments by December 31, 2025. All WE and WPS coal-fueled units fully meet the 2020 ELG rule requirements. Based on current electrical generation resource planning, we plan to file a Notice of Planned Participation by December 31, 2025 to opt into the \"cessation of coal by December 31, 2034\" subcategory for both the ERGS and Weston coal-fired facilities. A Notice of Privacy Practice also may be filed for the OCPP, PWGS, and VAPP facilities because this ELG rule option will allow the company to qualify for more reasonable requirements to address the CRL provisions at our landfills that served these former coal-fired facilities.\n2024 Form 10-K\n164\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nThe final Supplemental ELG Rule allows owners of coal-fired units who opted into a cessation of coal subcategory to operate beyond the end of 2028 or 2034, required by either the 2015 or the 2020 ELG Rule, respectively, if needed for reliability concerns (i.e., energy emergencies, reliability must run agreements, etc.) as determined by the DOE, a public utility commission, or independent system operator.\nWe are still evaluating the Supplemental ELG Rule CRL provisions to determine the applicability and potential compliance costs for inactive/closed landfills. Numerous parties have challenged the rule through litigation pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit. This rule remains in effect during the pendency of the legal challenge.\nLand Quality\nManufactured Gas Plant Remediation\nWe have identified sites at which our utilities or a predecessor company owned or operated a manufactured gas plant or stored manufactured gas. We have also identified other sites that may have been impacted by historical manufactured gas plant activities. Our natural gas utilities are responsible for the environmental remediation of these sites, some of which are in the EPA Superfund Alternative Approach Program. We are also working with various state jurisdictions in our investigation and remediation planning. These sites are at various stages of investigation, monitoring, remediation, and closure.\nIn addition, we are coordinating the investigation and cleanup of some of these sites subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA under what is called a \"multisite\" program. This program involves prioritizing the work to be done at the sites, preparation and approval of documents common to all of the sites, and use of a consistent approach in selecting remedies. At this time, we cannot estimate future remediation costs associated with these sites beyond those described below.\nThe future costs for detailed site investigation, future remediation, and monitoring are dependent upon several variables including, among other things, the extent of remediation, changes in technology, and changes in regulation. Historically, our regulators have allowed us to recover incurred costs, net of insurance recoveries and recoveries from potentially responsible parties, associated with the remediation of manufactured gas plant sites. Accordingly, we have established regulatory assets for costs associated with these sites.\nWe have established the following regulatory assets and reserves for manufactured gas plant sites as of December 31:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nRegulatory assets\n$\n570.1\n \n$\n596.8\n \nReserves for future environmental remediation\n445.8\n \n463.7\n \nCoal Combustion Residuals Rule\nThe EPA finalized a rule for CCR in April 2024 that would apply to landfills, historic fill sites, and projects where CCR was placed at a power plant site. The rule will regulate previously exempt closed landfills. \nThe final rule, which became effective in November 2024 will have an impact on some of our coal ash landfills, requiring additional remediation that is not currently required under the state programs. The rule is being challenged through litigation pending in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. We expect the cost of the additional remediation would be recovered through future rates. See Note 9, Asset Retirement Obligations, for more information on the estimated cost of the additional remediation. \nRenewables, Efficiency, and Conservation\nWisconsin Legislation \nIn 2005, Wisconsin enacted Act 141, which established a goal that \n10\n% of all electricity consumed in Wisconsin be generated by renewable resources annually. WE and WPS have achieved their required renewable energy percentages of \n8.27\n% and \n9.74\n%, respectively, by constructing various wind parks, solar parks, a biomass facility, and by also relying on renewable energy purchases. WE and WPS continue to review their renewable energy portfolios and acquire cost-effective renewables as needed to meet their requirements on an ongoing basis. The PSCW administers the renewable program related to Act 141, and each utility funds the program based on \n1.2\n% of its annual retail operating revenues.\n2024 Form 10-K\n165\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nMichigan Legislation\nIn December 2016, Michigan enacted Act 342, which required \n12.5\n% of the state's electric energy to come from renewables for 2019 and 2020, and energy optimization (efficiency) targets up to \n1\n% annually. The renewable requirement increased to \n15.0\n% for 2021 and beyond. UMERC was in compliance with its requirements under this statute as of December 31, 2024. The legislation continues to allow recovery of costs incurred to meet the standards and provides for ongoing review and revision to assure the measures taken are cost-effective.\nIn November 2023, Michigan enacted Acts 229, 231 and 235. The acts require electric providers to file a renewable energy plan every \ntwo\n years and to set renewable energy portfolio targets from now until 2040. The proposed renewable energy targets include \n15\n% through 2029, \n50\n% from 2030 through 2034, and \n60\n% renewable energy by 2035 and thereafter. The bill also sets clean energy standards of \n80\n% from 2035 through 2039 and \n100\n% after 2040. The acts only allow natural gas to count as clean energy if it is accompanied with carbon capture and storage. The new acts also revise the requirement a utility must meet in filing its energy waste reduction plans. They require a utility to file a plan every \ntwo\n years until 2025, then every \nthree\n years thereafter.\nEnforcement and Litigation Matters\nWe and our subsidiaries are involved in legal and administrative proceedings before various courts and agencies with respect to matters arising in the ordinary course of business. Although we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters, management believes that appropriate reserves have been established and that final settlement of these actions will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nConsent Decrees\nWisconsin Public Service Corporation – Weston and Pulliam Power Plants\nIn November 2009, the EPA issued an NOV to WPS, which alleged violations of the CAA's New Source Review requirements relating to certain projects completed at the Weston and Pulliam power plants from 1994 to 2009. WPS entered into a Consent Decree with the EPA resolving this NOV. This Consent Decree was entered by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in March 2013. With the retirement of Pulliam Units 7 and 8 in October 2018, WPS completed the mitigation projects required by the Consent Decree and received a completeness letter from the EPA in October 2018. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information about the retirement. Following our significant engagement with the EPA, the agency conditionally terminated the Consent Decree in December 2024.\nJoint Ownership Power Plants – Columbia and Edgewater\nIn December 2009, the EPA issued an NOV to WPL, the operator of the Columbia and Edgewater plants, and the other joint owners of these plants, including MG&E, WE (former co-owner of an Edgewater unit), and WPS. The NOV alleged violations of the CAA's New Source Review requirements related to certain projects completed at those plants. WPS, along with WPL, MG&E, and WE, entered into a Consent Decree with the EPA resolving this NOV. This Consent Decree was entered by the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin in June 2013. As a result of the continued implementation of the Consent Decree related to the jointly owned Columbia and Edgewater plants, the Edgewater Unit 4 generating unit was retired in September 2018. See Note 6, Regulatory Assets and Liabilities, for more information about the retirement. WPL started the process to close out this Consent Decree.\n2024 Form 10-K\n166\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nNOTE 25—\nSUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\nNon-Cash Transactions\nYear Ended December 31\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash paid for interest, net of amount capitalized\n$\n785.7\n \n$\n653.4\n \n$\n485.2\n \nCash paid (received) for income taxes, net \n(1)\n(\n264.2\n)\n(\n58.9\n)\n52.4\n \nSignificant non-cash investing and financing transactions:\nAccounts payable related to construction costs\n285.7\n \n171.3\n \n197.4\n \nCommon stock issued for stock-based compensation plans\n6.4\n \n—\n \n—\n \nIncrease in receivables related to property damage insurance proceeds\n2.3\n \n3.5\n \n—\n \nIncrease in receivables for corporate-owned life insurance proceeds\n5.8\n \n1.4\n \n—\n \nLiabilities accrued for software licensing agreements\n0.2\n \n—\n \n7.4\n \n(1)    \nCash received for income taxes in 2024 and 2023 includes $\n269.1\n million and $\n75.0\n million, respectively, related to 2023 and 2024 PTCs that were sold to third parties.\nRestricted Cash\nThe statements of cash flows include our activity related to cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash. \nThe following table reconciles the cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash amounts reported within the balance sheets at December 31 to the total of these amounts shown on the statements of cash flows:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n9.8\n \n$\n42.9\n \n$\n28.9\n \nRestricted cash included in other current assets\n5.3\n \n70.1\n \n25.6\n \nRestricted cash included in other long-term assets\n27.1\n \n52.2\n \n127.7\n \nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n$\n42.2\n \n$\n165.2\n \n$\n182.2\n \nOur restricted cash primarily consisted of the following:\n•\nCash held in the Integrys rabbi trust, which is used to fund participants' benefits under the Integrys deferred compensation plan and certain Integrys non-qualified pension plans. \n•\nCash on deposit in financial institutions that is restricted to satisfy the requirements of certain debt agreements at WECI Wind Holding I, WECI Wind Holding II, and WEPCo Environmental Trust.\n•\nCash related to WECI's ownership interests in certain renewable generation projects.

The primary drivers of the requested increases in electric rates were continued capital investments to transition our generation fleets from coal to renewables and natural gas-fueled generation, increased costs driven by higher inflation and interest rates, and the recovery of regulatory assets previously approved by the PSCW. The requested increases in natural gas rates were driven by the companies' ongoing capital investments in reliability and safety projects, including LNG storage facilities, as well as the impacts from higher inflation and increased interest rates.\nOn December 19, 2024, the PSCW issued final written orders approving electric, natural gas, and steam base rate increases, effective January 1, 2025 and 2026, as applicable. \nThe final written orders reflected the following: \nWE\nWPS\nWG\n2025 rate increase\nElectric \n(1)\n$\n144.0\n \n million\n/\n4.2\n%\n$\n55.1\n \n million\n/\n4.5\n%\nN/A\nGas\n$\n41.3\n \n million\n/\n7.1\n%\n$\n14.9\n \n million\n/\n3.8\n%\n$\n34.5\n \n million\n/\n4.2\n%\nSteam\n$\n1.5\n \n million\n/\n5.0\n%\nN/A\nN/A\n2026 rate increase \n(2)\nElectric \n(1)\n$\n169.5\n \n million\n/\n4.5\n%\n$\n30.0\n \n million\n/\n2.3\n%\nN/A\nGas\n$\n29.8\n \n million\n/\n4.5\n%\n$\n13.5\n \n million\n/\n3.1\n%\n$\n23.5\n \n million\n/\n2.6\n%\nROE\n9.8\n%\n9.8\n%\n9.8\n%\nCommon equity component average on a financial basis\n53.0\n%\n53.0\n%\n53.0\n%\n(1)    \nAmounts reflect the impact to our Wisconsin retail electric operations and include the incremental decrease resulting from updated fuel costs.\n(2)    \nThe 2026 rate increases are incremental to the previously authorized revenue plus the approved rate increases for 2025.\nEffective January 1, 2025, WE was required to implement a new earnings sharing mechanism, under which, if WE earns above its authorized ROE: (i) it retains \n100.0\n% of earnings for the first 15 basis points above the authorized ROE; (ii) \n50.0\n% of the next 25 basis points is required to be refunded to ratepayers; and (iii) \n100.0\n% of any remaining excess earnings is required to be refunded to ratepayers. \nWPS and WG are required to maintain their current earnings sharing mechanism. Under the current mechanism, if the utility earns above its authorized ROE: (i) the utility retains \n100.0\n% of earnings for the first 15 basis points above the authorized ROE; (ii) \n50.0\n% of the next 60 basis points is required to be refunded to ratepayers; and (iii) \n100.0\n% of any remaining excess earnings is required to be refunded to ratepayers. \n2024 Limited Rate Case Re-Opener\nIn accordance with their rate orders approved by the PSCW in December 2022, WE, WPS, and WG filed requests for limited electric and natural gas rate case re-openers, as applicable, with the PSCW in May 2023. The WE and WPS limited electric rate case re-openers included updated fuel costs and revenue requirements for the generation projects that were previously approved by the PSCW and were placed into service in 2023 or were expected to be placed into service in 2024. WE's limited electric re-opener also included the projected savings from the retirement of the OCPP Units 5 and 6, which were retired in May 2024. WE and WG also filed a request for a limited natural gas rate case re-opener to reflect the additional revenue requirements associated with their previously approved LNG projects. WE's and WG's LNG projects were placed into service in November 2023 and February 2024, respectively. \n2024 Form 10-K\n168\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nIn December 2023, the PSCW issued final written orders approving electric and natural gas rate increases and decreases, effective January 1, 2024. \nThe final orders reflected the following:\nWE\nWPS\nWG\n2024 incremental rate increases (decreases)\nElectric \n(1)\n$\n82.2\n \n million\n/\n2.5\n%\n$\n(\n32.7\n)\n million\n/\n(\n2.6\n)%\nN/A\nGas\n$\n23.9\n \n million\n/\n4.5\n%\nN/A\n$\n21.6\n \n million\n/\n2.8\n%\n(1)    \nAmounts reflect the impact to our Wisconsin retail electric operations and include any incremental increases (WE) or decreases (WPS) resulting from updated fuel costs.\nThe utilities' ROE and common equity component averages were not addressed in the limited rate case re-openers. \n2023 and 2024 Rates\nIn April 2022, WE, WPS, and WG filed requests with the PSCW to increase their retail electric, natural gas, and steam rates, as applicable. These requests were updated in July 2022 to reflect new developments that impacted the original proposals. The requested increases in electric rates were driven by capital investments in new wind, solar, and battery storage; capital investments in natural gas generation; reliability investments, including grid hardening projects to bury power lines and strengthen WE's distribution system against severe weather; and changes in wholesale business with other utilities. Many of these investments had already been approved by the PSCW. The requested increases in natural gas rates primarily related to capital investments previously approved by the PSCW, including LNG storage for our natural gas distribution system. \nIn December 2022, the PSCW issued final written orders approving electric, natural gas, and steam base rate increases, effective January 1, 2023. \nThe final orders reflected the following:\nWE\nWPS\nWG\n2023 base rate increase\nElectric\n$\n283.5\n \n million\n/\n9.1\n%\n$\n120.5\n \n million\n/\n9.8\n%\nN/A\nGas\n$\n46.1\n \n million\n/\n9.6\n%\n$\n26.4\n \n million\n/\n7.1\n%\n$\n46.5\n \n million\n/\n6.4\n%\nSteam\n$\n7.6\n \n million\n/\n35.3\n%\nN/A\nN/A\nROE\n9.8\n%\n9.8\n%\n9.8\n%\nCommon equity component average on a financial basis\n53.0\n%\n53.0\n%\n53.0\n%\nIn addition to the above, the final orders included the following terms:\n•\nThe utilities kept their then current earnings sharing mechanisms, under which, if a utility earned above its authorized ROE: (i) the utility retained \n100.0\n% of earnings for the first 15 basis points above the authorized ROE; (ii) \n50.0\n% of the next 60 basis points was refunded to ratepayers; and (iii) \n100.0\n% of any remaining excess earnings was required to be refunded to ratepayers.\n•\nWE and WPS were required to complete an analysis of alternative recovery scenarios for generating units that will be retired prior to the end of their useful life. \n•\nWE and WPS were not allowed to propose any changes to their real time pricing rates for large commercial and industrial electric customers through the end of 2024.\n•\nWE and WPS were required to lower monthly residential and small commercial electric customer fixed charges by $\n1.00\n and $\n3.33\n, respectively, from previously authorized rates.\n•\nWE and WPS were required to offer an additional voluntary renewable energy pilot for commercial and industrial customers.\n•\nWE and WPS were required to continue to work with PSCW staff and other interested parties to develop alternative low income assistance programs. WE and WPS also collectively contributed $\n4.0\n million to the Keep Wisconsin Warm Fund.\n•\nWE, WPS, and WG were required to implement escrow accounting treatment for pension and OPEB costs in 2023 and 2024. As a result, they defer as a regulatory asset or liability, the difference between actual pension and OPEB costs and those included in rates until recovery or refund is authorized in a future rate proceeding.\n•\nAs discussed above, WE and WPS were authorized to file a limited electric rate case re-opener for 2024, and WE and WG were authorized to file a limited natural gas rate case re-opener for 2024.\n2024 Form 10-K\n169\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\n2022 Rates\nIn March 2021, WE, WPS, and WG filed an application with the PSCW for the approval of certain accounting treatments that allowed them to maintain their electric, natural gas, and steam base rates through 2022 and forego filing a rate case for \none year\n. In connection with the request, the \nthree\n utilities also entered into an agreement, dated March 23, 2021, with various stakeholders. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the stakeholders fully supported the application. In September 2021, the PSCW issued written orders approving the application. \nThe final orders reflected the following:\n•\nWE, WPS, and WG amortized, in 2022, certain previously deferred balances to offset approximately half of their forecasted revenue deficiencies.\n•\nWG deferred interest and depreciation expense associated with capital investments since its last rate case that otherwise would have been added to rate base in a 2022 test-year rate case.\n•\nWE, WPS, and WG were able to defer any increases in tax expense due to changes in tax law that occurred in 2021 and/or 2022.\n•\nWE, WPS, and WG maintained their earnings sharing mechanisms, with modification. \nThe Peoples Gas Light and Coke Company and North Shore Gas Company\n2023 Rate Order\nIn January 2023, PGL and NSG filed requests with the ICC to increase their natural gas base rates. The requested rate increases were primarily driven by capital investments made to strengthen the safety and reliability of each utility’s natural gas distribution system. PGL was also seeking to recover costs incurred to upgrade its natural gas storage field and operations facilities and to continue improving customer service. PGL did not request an extension of the QIP rider as PGL returned to the traditional rate making process to recover the costs of necessary infrastructure improvements.\nOn November 16, 2023, the ICC issued final written orders approving base rate increases for PGL and NSG. The written orders were subsequently amended for various technical corrections. The amended written orders approved the following base rate increases: \n•\nA $\n304.6\n million (\n43.5\n%) base rate increase for PGL’s natural gas customers. This amount includes the recovery of costs related to PGL’s SMP that were previously being recovered under its QIP rider. PGL's new rates were effective December 1, 2023. \n•\nAn $\n11.0\n million (\n11.6\n%) base rate increase for NSG’s natural gas customers. The new rates at NSG were not effective until February 1, 2024 as changes were required to NSG's billing system as a result of the final rate order. \nThe ICC approved an authorized ROE of \n9.38\n% for both PGL and NSG, and set the common equity component average at \n50.79\n% and \n52.58\n% for PGL and NSG, respectively.\nAs part of its decisions, the ICC, among other things, disallowed $\n236.2\n million of capital costs related to the construction and improvement of PGL’s shops and facilities and $\n1.7\n million of capital costs related to NSG's construction of a gas infrastructure project.\nIn addition, the ICC ordered PGL to pause spending on its SMP until the ICC had a proceeding to determine the optimal method for replacing aging natural gas infrastructure and a prudent investment level. In accordance with the written order, the ICC initiated the proceeding in January 2024. On February 20, 2025, the ICC issued an order setting expectations for PGL's prospective operations under its SMP. The ICC directed us to focus on replacing all cast and ductile iron pipe that has a diameter under \n36\n inches by January 1, 2035. The ICC also indicated that failure to comply with this directive could subject us to civil penalties under Illinois statute. We are evaluating the impact of this order on our operations and capital plan.\nIn December 2023, PGL and NSG filed an application for rehearing with the ICC requesting reconsideration of various issues in the ICC's November 16, 2023 written orders. The ICC granted PGL and NSG a limited-scope rehearing focused exclusively on the authorized spending for the completion of SMP projects that started in 2023 and emergency repairs needed to ensure the safety and reliability of PGL's delivery system. On May 30, 2024, the ICC issued a written order on the rehearing. The order approved $\n28.5\n million of additional spending for emergency work, representing a $\n1.6\n million increase to PGL's annual revenue requirement.\n2024 Form 10-K\n170\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nAs the ICC did not grant a rehearing on the disallowance of PGL's and NSG's capital costs, we recorded a $\n178.9\n million non-cash impairment of our property, plant, and equipment during the fourth quarter of 2023. This amount included $\n177.2\n million of previously incurred disallowed costs at PGL related to its shops and facilities, and the $\n1.7\n million of capital costs disallowed at NSG. The remaining disallowance of capital costs at PGL related to expected future spend.\nOn June 7, 2024, PGL and NSG filed a petition with the Illinois Appellate Court for review of the November 16, 2023 and May 30, 2024 orders. The appeal includes the ICC's $\n237.9\n million combined disallowance of capital costs at PGL and NSG discussed above, along with the $\n116.0\n million disallowance of SMP capital investments needed to meet safety and reliability requirements. Although the ICC ordered PGL to complete safety and reliability work in 2024, it denied the recovery of these costs.\nUncollectible Expense Adjustment Rider\nThe rates of PGL and NSG include a UEA rider for cost recovery or refund of uncollectible expense based on the difference between actual uncollectible write-offs and the amounts recovered in rates. The UEA rider is subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs are reviewed for accuracy and prudency by the ICC. In May 2023, the ICC issued a written order on PGL's and NSG's 2018 UEA rider reconciliation. The order required a $\n15.4\n million and $\n0.7\n million refund to ratepayers at PGL and NSG, respectively. These amounts were refunded over a period of \nnine months\n, which began on September 1, 2023. In July 2023, PGL and NSG petitioned the Illinois Appellate Court for review of the ICC order. On November 7, 2024, the Illinois Appellate Court issued an opinion affirming the ICC order and the related disallowance. PGL and NSG petitioned the Illinois Supreme Court on December 12, 2024 seeking review and reversal of the May 2023 order. \nAs of December 31, 2024, there can be \nno\n assurance that all costs incurred under the UEA rider during the open reconciliation years, which include 2019 through 2024, will be deemed recoverable by the ICC. The combined annual costs of PGL and NSG included in the rider, which reflect uncollectible write-offs in excess of what is recovered in base rates, have ranged from $\n10\n million to $\n40\n million during these open reconciliation years. Disallowances by the ICC, if any, could be material and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nQualifying Infrastructure Plant Rider\nIn July 2013, Illinois Public Act 98-0057, The Natural Gas Consumer, Safety & Reliability Act, became law. This law provides natural gas utilities with a cost recovery mechanism that allows collection, through a surcharge on customer bills, of prudently incurred costs to upgrade Illinois natural gas infrastructure. In January 2014, the ICC approved a QIP rider for PGL, which was in effect until December 1, 2023. As discussed above, PGL has returned to the traditional rate-making process for recovery of these costs, and they are now included in PGL's base rates.\nCosts previously incurred under PGL's QIP rider are still subject to an annual reconciliation whereby costs are reviewed for accuracy and prudency. In August 2024, the ICC issued a final order on PGL's 2016 annual reconciliation, which included a disallowance of $\n14.8\n million of certain capital costs. PGL recorded a pre-tax charge to income of $\n25.3\n million during the third quarter of 2024 related to the disallowance and the previously recognized return on and of these investments. The charge was recorded on the income statement as a $\n12.9\n million reduction in revenues for the amounts previously collected from customers, a $\n12.1\n million increase to operating expenses for the impairment of PGL's property, plant, and equipment, and a $\n0.3\n million increase to interest expense related to the amounts due to customers. On October 25, 2024, PGL filed a petition with the Illinois Appellate Court for review of the ICC's August order. \nIn March 2024, PGL filed its 2023 reconciliation with the ICC, which, along with the reconciliations from 2017 through 2022, is still pending. The aggregate capital costs included in the rider during the open reconciliation years, which include 2017 through 2023, along with any previously recognized return on these investments, totaled approximately $\n2.8\n billion as of December 31, 2024. There can be \nno\n assurance that all of these costs and the previously recognized returns will be deemed recoverable by the ICC. Further disallowances by the ICC, if any, could be material and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\n2024 Form 10-K\n171\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nMinnesota Energy Resources Corporation\n2023 Rate Order\nIn November 2022, MERC initiated a rate proceeding with the MPUC to increase its retail natural gas base rates. In December 2022, the MPUC approved MERC's request for interim rates totaling $\n37.0\n million, subject to refund. The interim rates went into effect on January 1, 2023.\nIn November 2023, the MPUC issued a written order approving a settlement agreement MERC reached with certain intervenors. The settlement agreement reflects a natural gas base rate increase of $\n28.8\n million (\n7.1\n%), along with a \n9.65\n% ROE and a common equity component average of \n53.0\n%. The natural gas rate increase was primarily driven by increased capital investments as well as inflationary pressure on operating costs. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, MERC will continue the use of its decoupling mechanism for residential customers, and it will be expanded to include certain small commercial and industrial customers.\nFinal rates went into effect on March 1, 2024. MERC’s customers were entitled to an $\n8.9\n million refund due to the interim rate increase exceeding the final approved rate increase, which was retroactive to January 1, 2023. These amounts were refunded to customers during the second quarter of 2024.\nRecovery of Natural Gas Costs\nIn February 2021, MERC incurred approximately $\n75\n million of natural gas costs in excess of the benchmark set in its GCRM. In August 2021, the MPUC issued a written order approving a joint proposal filed by MERC and \nfour\n other Minnesota utilities to recover their respective excess natural gas costs. In accordance with the order, MERC recovered $\n10\n million of these costs through its annual natural gas true-up process over a period of \n12\n months, and the remaining $\n65\n million was to be recovered over a period of \n27\n months, both beginning in September 2021. Recovery of these costs and the issue of prudence was referred to a contested-case proceeding. In October 2022, the MPUC issued a written order approving a settlement agreement entered into by MERC and various parties related to the recovery of the extraordinary natural gas costs incurred in February 2021. Under the settlement agreement, MERC agreed to not seek recovery of $\n3\n million of these costs. MERC recovered the remaining $\n62\n million of extraordinary natural gas costs over the previously approved \n27\n-month recovery period. \nMichigan Gas Utilities Corporation\n2024 Rate Order\nIn March 2024, MGU filed a request with the MPSC to increase its retail natural gas base rates. In September 2024, the MPSC issued a final order approving a settlement agreement, which authorizes MGU to increase its natural gas base rates by $\n7.0\n million (\n3.88\n%). The rate increase reflects a \n9.86\n% ROE and a common equity component average of \n50.0\n%. The rate increase is primarily driven by inflationary pressure on capital projects and operating and maintenance costs and the significant increase in interest rates over the past few years. The order also authorizes MGU to defer any expenses incurred to implement the PHMSA's proposed rulemaking titled \"Gas Pipeline Leak Detection and Repair.\"\nThe new rates became effective January 1, 2025.\n2023 Rate Order\nIn March 2023, MGU filed a request with the MPSC to increase its retail natural gas base rates. In August 2023, the MPSC issued a written order approving a comprehensive settlement that resolved all issues in MGU's rate case. The key terms of the settlement agreement included:\n•\na natural gas base rate increase of $\n9.9\n million (\n4.7\n%);\n•\nan ROE of \n9.8\n%;\n•\na common equity component average of \n51.0\n%; and,\n•\na continuation of the existing MRP rider, effective January 1, 2025 through 2027, including forecasted increased costs for those projects. MRP costs were recovered in base rates in 2024. \n2024 Form 10-K\n172\nWEC Energy Group, Inc.\nTable of \nContents\nThe rate increase was primarily driven by capital investments made to strengthen the safety and reliability of MGU's natural gas distribution system and to provide service to additional customers. Inflationary pressure on operating costs also contributed to the rate increase. The new rates were effective January 1, 2024.\nUpper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation\n2024 Rate Order\nIn May 2024, UMERC filed a request with the MPSC to increase its electric base rates for non-mine customers. On October 10, 2024, the MPSC issued a final order approving a settlement agreement, which authorizes UMERC to increase electric base rates for non-mine customers by $\n6.6\n million (\n8.2\n%). The rate increase reflects a \n9.86\n% ROE and a common equity component average of \n50.0\n%. The rate increase is primarily driven by the construction of the now in-service RICE generation facilities located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and a reduction in sales volumes resulting from the implementation of limited retail choice since UMERC’s predecessor utilities last reset rates. A reduction of operation and maintenance costs partially offset these impacts.\nThe new rates became effective January 1, 2025.\nNOTE 27—\nOTHER INCOME, NET\nTotal other income, net was as follows for the years ended December 31:\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNon-service components of net periodic benefit costs\n$\n83.7\n \n$\n97.7\n \n$\n104.4\n \nAFUDC-Equity\n59.8\n \n59.1\n \n29.4\n \nInterest income\n17.2\n \n3.9\n \n1.2\n \nGains (losses) from investments held in rabbi trust\n11.7\n \n13.7\n \n(\n12.6\n)\nEarnings (losses) from equity method investments \n(1)\n4.7\n \n(\n1.1\n)\n9.3\n \nOther, net\n1.1\n \n4.4\n \n(\n2.9\n)\nOther income, net\n$\n178.2\n \n$\n177.7\n \n$\n128.8\n \n(1)    \nAmounts do not include equity earnings of transmission affiliates as those earnings are shown as a separate line item on the income statements.\nNOTE 28—\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40) Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective: (i) in recording, processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act; and (ii) to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our and our subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \nInternal Control \n–\n Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, our management concluded that our and our subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
