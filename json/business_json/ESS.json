(“Essex”), a Maryland corporation, is an S&P 500 company that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (“REIT”). Essex owns all of its interest in its real estate and other investments directly or indirectly through Essex Portfolio, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or “EPLP”). Essex is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership and as of December 31, 2024, had an approximately 96.5% general partner interest in the Operating Partnership. In this report, the terms “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” also refer to Essex Property Trust, Inc., the Operating Partnership and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by Essex and/or the Operating Partnership.\nEssex has elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with the year ended December 31, 1994. Essex completed its initial public offering on June 13, 1994. In order to maintain compliance with REIT tax rules, the Company utilizes taxable REIT subsidiaries for various revenue generating or investment activities. A domestic taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax as a regular C Corporation. All taxable REIT subsidiaries are consolidated by the Company for financial reporting purposes.\nThe Company is engaged primarily in the ownership, operation, management, acquisition, development and redevelopment of predominantly apartment communities, located along the West Coast of the United States. As of December 31, 2024, the Company owned or had ownership interests in 255 operating apartment communities, aggregating 62,157 apartment homes, excluding the Company’s ownership in preferred equity co-investments, loan investments, two operating commercial buildings, and a development pipeline comprised of various predevelopment projects (collectively, the “Portfolio”).\nThe Company’s website address is https://www.essex.com. The Company’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports, and the Proxy Statement for its Annual Meeting of Stockholders are available, free of charge, on its website as soon as practicable after the Company files the reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The information contained on the Company’s website shall not be deemed to be incorporated into this report.\nBUSINESS STRATEGIES\nThe following is a discussion of the Company’s business strategies in regards to real estate investment and management.\nBusiness Strategies\nResearch Driven Approach to Investments\n \n–\n The Company believes that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge. The Company continually assesses markets where the Company operates, as well as markets where the Company considers future investment opportunities by evaluating markets and focusing on the following strategic criteria:\n•\nMajor metropolitan areas that have regional population in excess of one million;\n•\nConstraints on new supply driven by: (i) low availability of developable land sites where competing housing could be economically built; (ii) political growth barriers, such as protected land, urban growth boundaries, and potential lengthy and expensive development permit processes; and (iii) natural limitations to development, such as mountains or waterways;\n•\nRental demand enhanced by affordability of rents relative to costs of for-sale housing; and\n•\nHousing demand based on job growth, proximity to jobs, high median incomes and the quality of life including related commuting factors.\nRecognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical, the Company regularly evaluates the results of its regional economic, and local market research, and adjusts the geographic focus of its portfolio accordingly. The Company seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions. Likewise, the Company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields.\nProperty Operations\n – The Company manages its communities by focusing on activities that may generate above-average rental growth, tenant retention/satisfaction and long-term asset appreciation. The Company intends to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth below:\n2\nTable of Contents\n•\nProperty Management\n \n–\n Oversee delivery and quality of the housing provided to our tenants and manage the properties financial performance.\n•\nCapital Preservation – \nThe Company’s asset management services are responsible for the planning, budgeting and completion of major capital improvement projects at the Company’s communities.\n•\nBusiness Planning and Control –\n Comprehensive business plans are implemented in conjunction with significant investment decisions. These plans include benchmarks for future financial performance based on collaborative discussions between property operations teams and the senior leadership team.\n•\nDevelopment and Redevelopment –\n The Company focuses on acquiring and developing apartment communities in supply constrained markets, and redeveloping its existing communities to improve the financial and physical aspects of the Company’s communities.\nCURRENT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES\nAcquisitions of Real Estate Interests\n \nThe table below summarizes acquisition activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 ($ in millions):\nProperty Name\nLocation\nApartment Homes\nEssex Ownership Percentage\nContract Price at Pro Rata Share\nBEXAEW Portfolio\nCA and WA\n1,480 \n100%\n$\n252.0 \n(1)\nMaxwell Sunnyvale\nCA\n75 \n100%\n46.6\n(2)\nARLO Mountain View\nCA\n164 \n100%\n101.1\nPatina at Midtown\nCA\n269 \n100%\n58.4\n(3)\nCentury Towers\nCA\n376 \n100%\n86.8\n(4)\nBEX II Portfolio\nCA\n871 \n100%\n168.4\n(5)\nBeaumont\nWA\n344 \n100%\n136.1\nTotal acquisitions\n3,579 \n \n$\n849.4 \n(1)\nIn March 2024, the Company acquired its joint venture partner's 49.9% interest in the BEXAEW LLC’s (“BEXAEW”) portfolio comprised of four communities for a total purchase price of $505.0 million on a gross basis.  \n(2)\nIn April 2024, the Company accepted the third-party sponsor’s common equity interest affiliated with its $14.7 million preferred equity investment. The community was consolidated on the Company’s financial statements at a $46.6 million valuation.\n(3)\nIn July 2024, the Company acquired its joint venture partner's 49.9% common equity interest in Patina at Midtown for a total purchase price of $117.0 million on a gross basis.  \n(4)\nIn September 2024, the Company acquired its joint venture partner's 50% common equity interest in Century Towers for a total purchase price of $173.5 million on a gross basis. \n(5)\nIn October 2024, the Company acquired its joint venture partner’s 49.9% interest in the BEX II, LLC (“BEX II”) portfolio, comprised of four communities for a total contract price of $337.5 million on a gross basis. \nDispositions of Real Estate Interests\nAs part of its strategic plan to own quality real estate in supply-constrained markets, the Company continually evaluates all of its communities and sells those communities that no longer meet the Company’s strategic criteria. The Company may use the capital generated from the dispositions to invest in higher-return communities, other real estate investments or to fund other commitments. The Company believes that the sale of these communities will not have a material impact on its future results of operations or cash flows nor will the sale of these communities materially affect the Company’s ongoing operations. In general, the Company seeks to offset the dilutive impact on long-term earnings and funds from operations from these dispositions through the positive impact of reinvestment of proceeds.\n3\nTable of Contents\nThe table below summarizes disposition activity for the year ended December 31, 2024 ($ in millions): \nProperty Name\nLocation\nApartment Homes\nSale Price at Pro Rata Share\nHillsdale Garden\nCA\n697 \n$\n205.7 \n(1)\nTotal dispositions\n697 \n$\n205.7 \n(1)\n    In October 2024, the Company sold its 81.5% interest in a consolidated co-investment, Hillsdale Garden, a 697-unit apartment home community, for a contract price of $252.4 million on a gross basis ($205.7 million at pro rata). \nDevelopment Pipeline\nThe Company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed, or are newly constructed and are in a phase of lease-up and have not yet reached stabilized operations. \nThe Company defines predevelopment projects as proposed communities in negotiation or in the entitlement process with an expected high likelihood of becoming entitled development projects. The Company may also acquire land for future development purposes. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s development pipeline was comprised of various consolidated predevelopment projects with total incurred costs of $52.7 million. \nLong Term Debt\nDuring 2024, the Company made regularly scheduled principal payments of $3.1 million to its secured mortgage notes payable at an average interest rate of 3.5%.\nIn March 2024, the Operating Partnership issued $350.0 million of senior unsecured notes due on April 1, 2034 with a coupon rate of 5.500% per annum (the \"2034 Notes\"), which are payable on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2024. The 2034 Notes were offered to investors at a price of 99.752% of the principal amount. The 2034 Notes are general unsecured senior obligations of the Operating Partnership, rank equally in right of payment with all other senior unsecured indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and are unconditionally guaranteed by Essex. The Company used the net proceeds of this offering to repay debt maturities, including to fund a portion of the repayment of its outstanding 3.875% senior unsecured notes due May 2024 and for other general corporate and working capital purposes. In August 2024, the Operating Partnership issued an additional $200.0 million of the 2034 Notes at a price of 102.871% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest from and including March 2024, up to, but excluding, the settlement date of August 21, 2024, with an effective yield of 5.110% per annum. These additional notes have substantially identical terms of the 2034 Notes issued in March 2024.\nBank Debt\nAs of December 31, 2024, Moody’s Investor Service and Standard and Poor’s (“S&P”) credit agencies rated Essex Property Trust, Inc. and Essex Portfolio, L.P. Baa1/Stable and BBB+/Stable, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had two unsecured lines of credit aggregating $1.28 billion. The Company’s $1.2 billion credit facility had an interest rate of Adjusted Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Adjusted SOFR”) plus 0.765% which is based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company’s credit ratings, adjusted for the facility’s sustainability metric adjustment feature, and a scheduled maturity date of January 2029 with two six-month extensions, exercisable at the Company’s option. In September 2024, the scheduled maturity date was extended from January 2027 to January 2029. The Company’s $75.0 million working capital unsecured line of credit had an interest rate of Adjusted SOFR plus 0.765%, which is based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company’s credit ratings, adjusted for the facility’s sustainability metric adjustment feature. Prior to its maturity in July 2024 the line of credit facility was amended such that the line’s capacity was increased from $35.0 million to $75.0 million and the scheduled maturity date was extended to July 2026.\n4\nTable of Contents\nEquity Transactions\nIn August 2024, the Company entered into a new equity distribution agreement pursuant to which the Company may offer and sell shares of its common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of up to $900.0 million (the “2024 ATM Program”). In connection with the 2024 ATM Program, the Company may also enter into related forward sale agreements whereby, at the Company’s discretion, it may sell shares of its common stock under the 2024 ATM Program under forward sale agreements. The use of a forward sale agreement would allow the Company to lock in a share price on the sale of shares of its common stock at the time the agreement is executed, but defer receipt of the proceeds from the sale of shares until a later date.\nThe 2024 ATM Program replaced the prior equity distribution agreement entered into in September 2021 (the “2021 ATM Program”), which was terminated upon the establishment of the 2024 ATM Program. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did not issue any shares of common stock under the 2024 ATM Program or the 2021 ATM Program. As of December 31, 2024, there were no outstanding forward sale agreements, and $900.0 million of shares remained available to be sold under the 2024 ATM Program. \nIn September 2022, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase plan to allow the Company to acquire shares of common stock up to an aggregate value of $500.0 million. The plan supersedes the Company’s previous common stock repurchase plan announced in December 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company did not repurchase any shares. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $302.7 million of purchase authority remaining under the stock repurchase plan.\nCo-investments\nThe Company has entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures or partnerships (including limited liability companies) through which it owns an indirect economic interest in less than 100% of the community or land or other investments owned directly by the joint venture or partnership. For each joint venture the Company holds a non-controlling interest in the venture and, in most cases, may earn customary management fees, development fees, asset property management fees, and a promote interest.\nThe Company has also made, and may continue in the future to make, preferred equity investments in various multifamily stabilized communities or development projects. The Company earns a preferred rate of return on these investments.\nHUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT\nCompany Overview and Values\nThe Company’s mission is to create quality communities in premier locations and it is critical to the Company’s mission that it attracts, trains and retains a talented and diverse team by providing a compelling place to work and opportunities for professional growth. The Company’s culture supports its mission and is guided by its core values: to act with integrity, to care about what matters, to do right with urgency, to lead at every level and to seek fairness. The Company is headquartered in San Mateo, CA, and has regional corporate offices in Woodland Hills, CA; Irvine, CA and Bellevue, WA. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had 1,715 employees, 99.8% of whom were full-time employees. A total of 1,293 employees worked on-site at our operating communities and 422 worked in our corporate offices.

The Company also supports employee-led resource groups which are open to all employees and intended to foster a sense of community and inclusion for associates at the Company that are intended to engage, educate, enable, and empower the Company’s employees.\n5\nTable of Contents\nTraining and Development\nThe Company values leadership at every level and enables the same by providing opportunities for all associates to develop personal and professional skills through programs that encourage associate retention and advancement. The Company currently offers training courses to its associates via Workday Learning, and its associates spent 13,122 hours learning in 2024. The Company also provides its associates with an annual $3,000 tuition reimbursement to further support outside professional growth opportunities. To identify, retain and reward top performers, the Company engages in meaningful internal succession planning and offers a tenure program, excellence awards, and a bonus recognition program to reward associates for good teamwork, good ideas, and good service. The Company encourages internal promotions and hiring for open positions, and the executive team actively mentors the Company’s top talent to ensure strong leadership at the Company for the future. 38% of the Company’s associates have approached or surpassed the Company’s average tenure of 6.57 years, with 22% reaching beyond 10 years of service.\nEmployee Safety, Health, and Wellness\nSafety is a top priority. The Company deeply cares about the wellbeing of its associates and residents. The Essex Safety Committee, comprised of key stakeholders across departments, meets quarterly and reviews the overall safety of the company in both our corporate offices and our communities. To maximize real-time responses, the Company has also established a working safety subcommittee that meets bi-weekly. The Company has implemented enhanced safety programs, which include a new Workplace Violence Prevention Program enacted companywide in 2024, regular safety inspections, emergency preparedness processes, hazard identification and control protocols, and related associate training.\nThe Company’s safety policies align with its health and wellness goals and seeks to proactively prevent workplace accidents and protect the health, wellness and safety of the Company’s associates through training and analysis of incident reports. Additionally, the Company offers retirement support, associate discount programs, a mental health program (which includes counseling and coaching sessions for mental well-being support at no cost), refresh days for our operations teams, and health benefit credits for participation in wellness programs.\nCompensation and Benefits\nThe Company offers competitive compensation to secure and retain top talent. Alongside competitive pay, the Company is committed to pay parity, and conducts a pay analysis on an annual basis which includes the development and use of a robust, multiple regression analysis model to confirm the Company’s continued achievement of gender pay parity.\nBeyond competitive compensation, the Company offers a suite of benefits, including health insurance, a retirement plan with a $6,000 annual matching potential benefit, life and disability coverage, supplemental paid parental leave, and the robust health and wellness support programs noted above. Additionally, the Company offers an associate housing discount.\nEmployee Engagement\nIn order to engage and promote communication with our associates and solicit meaningful feedback on our efforts to create a positive work environment, the Company issues engagement surveys to all associates to measure 10 key drivers of employee engagement including goal setting, organizational fit, well-being, freedom of opinion, meaningful work, management support and recognition, among others. Engagement surveys are split into three phases: new hire surveys, Company-wide annual surveys, and exit surveys. 90% of Company employees participated in the surveys in 2024. The Company’s overall engagement score on the surveys was 8 out of 10. Goal setting, Performance, and Alignment were recognized as the top three areas of strength for the organization.\nCommunity and Social Impact\nThe Company believes volunteering can create positive change in the communities where our associates live and work and that the Company’s commitment to giving back helps it attract and retain associates. The Company’s volunteer program is aimed at supporting and encouraging eligible associates to become actively involved in their communities through the Company’s support of charity initiatives and offering paid hours for volunteer time. Additionally, the Company’s “Essex Cares” program provides direct aid to the Company’s residents, associates, and local communities.\n6\nTable of Contents\nINSURANCE \nThe Company purchases general liability and property insurance coverage, including loss of rent, for each of its communities. The Company also purchases limited earthquake, terrorism, environmental and flood insurance. There are certain types of losses which may not be covered or could exceed coverage limits. The insurance programs are subject to deductibles and self-insured retentions in varying amounts. The Company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Pacific Western Insurance LLC (“PWI”), to self-insure certain earthquake and property losses. As of December 31, 2024, PWI had cash and marketable securities of $98.9 million, and is consolidated in the Company’s financial statements.\nAll of the Company’s communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. The Company evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models developed by the insurance industry and in most cases property vulnerability analysis based on structural evaluations by seismic consultants. The Company manages this exposure, where considered appropriate, desirable, and cost-effective, by upgrading properties to increase their resistance to forces caused by seismic events, by considering available funds and coverages provided by PWI and/or by purchasing seismic insurance. In most cases the Company also purchases limited earthquake insurance for certain properties owned by the Company’s co-investments.\nIn addition, the Company carries other types of insurance coverage related to a variety of risks and exposures.  \nBased on market conditions, the Company may change or potentially eliminate insurance coverages, or increase levels of self-insurance. Further, the Company may incur losses, which could be material, due to uninsured risks, deductibles and self-insured retentions, and/or losses in excess of coverage limits.\nCOMPETITION\nThere are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the Company’s communities in attracting tenants. These include other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family homes. If the demand for the Company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire competing housing, rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company faces competition from other REITs, businesses and other entities in the acquisition, development and operation of apartment communities. Some competitors are larger and have greater resources than the Company. This competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities the Company acquires and/or develops.\nWORKING CAPITAL\nThe Company believes that cash flows generated by its operations, existing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities balances, availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of its reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2025.\nThe timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates, stock price, and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can affect the Company’s plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment activities.\nENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS\nAs a real estate owner and operator, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and may be subject to liability and the costs of removal or remediation of certain potentially hazardous materials that may be present in our communities. See the discussion under the caption, “Risks Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Operations - \nThe Company’s portfolio may have environmental liabilities.\n” in",

Cybersecurity\nThe Company has developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program intended to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its critical systems and information\n. The Company’s cybersecurity risk management program is integrated into our overall risk management program, and shares common methodologies, reporting channels and governance processes that apply across the risk management program to other legal, compliance, strategic, operational and financial risk areas.\nThe Company’s cybersecurity risk management program employs several different measures, including perimeter monitoring, endpoint monitoring and user management, designed to assess and identify cybersecurity risks. The Company’s technology management team is principally responsible for managing the Company’s cybersecurity risk assessment and management processes. The Company’s technology management team performs enterprise-level risk assessments designed to help identify \n23\nTable of Contents\nmaterial cybersecurity risks to our critical systems, information, products, services, and our broader enterprise IT environment.\n \nThe Company’s technology management team and third-party professionals perform penetration tests, vulnerability scans, and patch management to assess and protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of its critical systems and information. The Company provides training to its employees on cybersecurity matters, performs periodic awareness testing to facilitate compliance with the Company’s cybersecurity policies, and maintains a method for its employees and consultants to communicate any suspected cybersecurity incident. \nIn addition, the Company evaluates key third-party service providers before the Company grants the service provider access to its information systems and has a process in place to ensure that future access is appropriate.\n \nThe Company has an established incident response plan for responding to cybersecurity incidents. The goal of the incident response plan is to detect and react to cybersecurity incidents, evaluate the scope and risk, respond appropriately, communicate effectively to all stakeholders, and ultimately reduce the likelihood of an incident recurrence. The Company’s incident response team consists of seasoned information technology, legal and financial reporting Company personnel. The incident response plan, members of the incident response team and the steps to respond to a security incident are evaluated for appropriateness and effectiveness, and key personnel from cross-functional departments are involved.\n \nThe Board of Directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and has delegated to the Audit Committee oversight of enterprise level risks, including any cybersecurity-related risks faced by the Company.\n At least quarterly, the Audit Committee reviews cyber risks and mitigation strategies with senior management. The Audit Committee periodically reports to the full Board regarding its activities, including those relating to cybersecurity. Additionally, on an annual basis, the Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”) presents to the Audit Committee on any material updates to the cybersecurity program, such as process improvements, new initiatives and key vendor performance. Material cybersecurity events, if any, are escalated to the Board on an ongoing basis. The Board is also briefed annually on all major enterprise risks, including cybersecurity risks.\nThe Company’s management team, including the CTO, is responsible for assessing and managing the Company’s material risks from cybersecurity threats. \nThe \nCTO\n leads the technology management team and has extensive cybersecurity knowledge and expertise developed through a career of serving in various roles in information technology for over 20 years.\n \nThe CTO oversees the Company’s initiatives to address existing or evolving cyber risks and is a member of the Enterprise Risk Committee. \nThe CTO reports to the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and provides updates to the Company’s senior leadership team on a regular basis, at least quarterly, about risks from cybersecurity threats, the results of penetration tests, vulnerability scans and userbase issues. The CTO and other members of the Company’s management team takes steps to stay informed about and monitor efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, such as briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in our IT environment.\nOver the past fiscal year, the Company has not identified risks from known cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any prior cybersecurity incidents, that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including its operations, business strategy, results of operations or financial condition.\n See the discussion under the caption, “Risks Related to Our Real Estate Investments and Operations - \nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to the handling of personal information and we rely on information technology to sustain our operations. Any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or breach of the Company’s privacy or information systems, or those of our vendors or other third parties, could materially adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.\n”\n in"
