  "item1_text": "Item 1, \nBusiness\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe conduct business in approximately 50 countries and regions throughout the world. Our industrial gases business is organized and operated regionally in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Middle East and India segments and generates the majority of our sales via our on-site and merchant supply modes. Approximately half our total revenue is generated through the on-site supply mode, which is governed by contracts that are generally long-term in nature with provisions that allow us to pass through changes in energy costs to our customers.\nOur Corporate and other segment includes the results of our sale of equipment businesses, costs for corporate support functions and global management activities, and other income and expenses not directly associated with the regional segments, such as foreign exchange gains and losses. In fiscal year 2024, this segment also included the results of our former liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") process technology and equipment business, which we sold to Honeywell International Inc. on 30 September 2024.\nFor additional information regarding our supply modes and business segments, refer to Note 7, \nRevenue Recognition\n, and Note 26, \nBusiness Segment and Geographic Information\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\n29\nTable of Contents\n2025 IN SUMMARY\nFiscal year 2025 was a transitional year for Air Products, marked by a renewed focus on our core industrial gas business under the leadership of our new Chief Executive Officer, who joined the Company in February 2025. We took decisive actions to reshape our portfolio, including the cancellation and descoping of several large energy transition projects, and enhance operations through targeted productivity initiatives. We also sharpened our approach to capital deployment, emphasizing strict return thresholds, appropriate risk-sharing, and alignment with long-term customer relationships. These efforts are helping to improve execution and support reductions in capital expenditures and debt over time.\nKey results versus the prior year include:\n•\nSales of $12.0 billion decreased 1%, or $63.3, as 4% lower volumes were partially offset by 2% higher energy cost pass-through to customers and 1% higher pricing driven by non-helium merchant products across all regions. Lower volumes primarily reflect the September 2024 LNG sale, lower global helium demand, and previously announced project exits, partially offset by higher on-sites and favorable non-helium merchant.\n•\nOperating loss was $877.0 compared to operating income of $4.5 billion in fiscal year 2024. The operating loss in fiscal year 2025 included approximately $3.7 billion in pre-tax charges related to business and asset actions ($3.0 billion after tax, or $13.68 per share).\n \nOperating income in fiscal year 2024 included a $1.6 billion pre-tax gain on the September 2024 sale of the LNG business ($1.2 billion after tax, or $5.38 per share). \n•\nAdjusted operating income of $2.9 billion decreased 3%, or $89.8, due to lower volumes and higher costs, partially offset by higher non-helium pricing. The higher costs were driven by fixed-cost inflation and depreciation, partially offset by productivity improvements across all segments. \n \n•\nEquity affiliates' income of $647.7 was flat. Increased contributions from affiliates in the Europe and Asia segments were offset by lower income from affiliates in the Corporate and other, Middle East and India, and Americas segments.\n•\nNet loss was $354.4 compared to net income of $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2024. The decrease was primarily due to higher charges for business and asset actions in fiscal year 2025 and the prior year gain from the sale of the LNG business.\n•\nAdjusted EBITDA of $5.1 billion increased 1%, or $30.1.\n•\nLoss per share of $1.74 was driven by an after-tax charge attributable to Air Products of $3.0 billion for business and asset actions recorded during fiscal year 2025. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\") was $12.03. In the prior year, EPS was $17.24 and adjusted EPS was $12.43. A summary table of changes in EPS is presented on page \n31\n.\n•\nWe believe providing a consistent dividend plays a critical part in the creation of shareholder value. During fiscal year 2025, we marked our 43\nrd\n consecutive year of increasing our dividends and returned approximately $1.6 billion to our shareholders through dividend payments.\n30\nTable of Contents\nChanges in Diluted EPS Attributable to Air Products\nThe per share impacts for the items presented in the table below were calculated independently and may not sum to the total change in diluted EPS due to rounding.\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\nChange vs.\nPrior Year\nEarnings (Loss) per share\n($1.77)\n$17.18 \n($18.95)\nLess: Loss per share from discontinued operations\n(0.04)\n(0.06)\n0.02 \nEarnings (Loss) per share from continuing operations\n($1.74)\n$17.24 \n($18.98)\n% Change from prior year\n**\nOperating Items\nUnderlying business:\nVolume\n($0.45)\nPrice, net of variable costs\n0.20 \nOther costs\n(0.11)\nCurrency\n0.03 \nBusiness and asset actions\n(A)\n(13.46)\nShareholder activism-related costs\n(0.32)\nGain on sale of business\n(5.15)\nGain on sale of other assets\n(B)\n0.11 \nTotal Operating Items\n($19.15)\nOther Impacts\nEquity affiliates' income\n$0.03 \nEquity method investment impairment associated with business and asset actions\n(A)\n(0.02)\nInterest expense\n0.02 \nOther non-operating income/expense, net:\nGain on de-designation of cash flow hedges\n(C)\n0.05 \nNon-service pension cost, net\n0.19 \nOther\n(0.09)\nChange in effective tax rate, excluding discrete items below\n(0.07)\nTax reform adjustment related to deemed foreign dividends\n0.16 \nTax on repatriation of foreign earnings\n(0.14)\nNoncontrolling interests \n(A)(C)\n0.05 \nWeighted average diluted shares\n(0.01)\nTotal Other Items\n$0.17 \nTotal Change\n($18.98)\n% Change from prior year\n**\n**Change versus prior period is not meaningful due to materially higher charges for business and asset actions in fiscal year 2025.

Decisive actions taken in fiscal year 2025, including the cancellation and descoping of several large energy transition projects and other targeted productivity initiatives, reflect our commitment to disciplined capital allocation and operational excellence. These actions allow us to concentrate resources on opportunities that will deliver the greatest value to our shareholders.\nWhile clean energy markets have not developed as previously anticipated, we remain confident in the long-term demand fundamentals for industrial gases and clean energy solutions. We continue to pursue opportunities in both traditional industrial gas and energy transition projects that meet our projected return requirements. Additionally, we have made significant progress on the construction of several energy transition projects, including the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project, which we expect to come onstream and deliver green ammonia in 2027.\nIn fiscal year 2026, we expect to achieve earnings growth from new plant onstreams, continued pricing discipline, and productivity improvements. We remain committed to cost control, a reduction in capital expenditures, and other measures aimed at unlocking value and generating cash. Cost discipline remains a top priority as we seek to mitigate the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures and continued helium headwinds, while continuing to reward shareholders through increased dividends, as we have done for the past 43 consecutive years.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDISCUSSION OF CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\nChange vs. Prior Year\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\n$\n%/bp\nGAAP Measures\nSales\n$12,037.3 \n$12,100.6 \n($63.3)\n(1\n%)\nOperating income (loss)\n(877.0)\n4,466.1 \n(5,343.1)\n**\nOperating margin\n(7.3\n%)\n36.9\n%\n**\nEquity affiliates’ income\n$647.7 \n$647.7 \n$— \n—\n%\nNet income (loss)\n(354.4)\n3,862.4 \n(4,216.8)\n**\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted operating income\n$2,857.7 \n$2,947.5 \n($89.8)\n(3\n%)\nAdjusted operating margin\n23.7\n%\n24.4\n%\n(70 \n bp)\nAdjusted EBITDA\n$5,076.4 \n$5,046.3 \n$30.1 \n1\n%\n** Change versus prior period is not meaningful due to charges for business and asset actions recorded in fiscal year 2025.\nSales\nThe table below summarizes the major factors that impacted consolidated sales for the periods presented:\nVolume\n(4\n%)\nPrice\n1\n%\nEnergy cost pass-through to customers\n2\n%\nCurrency\n—\n%\nTotal Consolidated Sales Change\n(1\n%)\nSales of $12.0 billion decreased 1%, or $63.3, as lower volumes of 4% were partially offset by higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 2% and favorable pricing of 1%. Lower volumes primarily reflect the September 2024 LNG sale, lower global helium demand, and the previously announced project exits, partially offset by higher on-sites and favorable non-helium merchant. The overall pricing improvement reflects a 2% increase in our merchant business, which was driven by non-helium product lines in our Europe and Americas segments. Currency was flat versus the prior year.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nCost of sales of $8.3 billion increased 1%, or $87.3, due to higher energy cost pass-through to customers of $278, higher costs of $73, higher power and fuel costs in our merchant business of $49, and an unfavorable currency impact of $12. The higher costs of $73 were driven by fixed-cost inflation and depreciation, partially offset by productivity improvements. These impacts were partially offset by lower costs of $325 attributable to lower sales volumes. Gross margin of 31.4% decreased 110 bp from 32.5% in the prior year primarily due to higher costs and increased energy cost pass-through to customers.\nSelling and Administrative Expense\nSelling and administrative expense of $906.1 decreased 4%, or $36.3, as our productivity actions were partially offset by labor inflation. Selling and administrative expense as a percentage of sales decreased to 7.5% from 7.8% in the prior year.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense of $96.3 decreased 4%, or $3.9. Research and development expense as a percentage of sales of 0.8% was flat versus the prior year.\n33\nTable of Contents\nBusiness and Asset Actions\nThe charges we record for business and asset actions are not recorded in segment results. Additional information regarding these actions can be found in Note 5, \nBusiness and Asset Actions\n, to the consolidated financial statements. \nIn fiscal year 2025, total pre-tax charges related to business and asset actions were approximately $3.7 billion ($3.0 billion attributable to Air Products after tax, or $13.68 per share) compared to $57.0 ($43.8 after tax, or $0.20 per share) in fiscal year 2024.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer initiated a project review to focus resources on projects we believe will deliver the greatest value to our shareholders. As a result of this review, we made the decision to exit various projects, primarily related to clean energy generation and distribution. The review remains ongoing and may result in additional costs in future periods. In connection with this review, we recognized project exit costs totaling approximately $3.6 billion, primarily consisting of noncash asset write-downs and estimated costs to terminate contractual commitments. Costs attributable to our noncontrolling partners totaled $10.7.\nThe remaining charge of $123.7 in fiscal year 2025 related to severance and other employee benefits under a global cost reduction program initiated in June 2023. Fiscal year 2024 costs under the plan totaled $57.0. Once all actions under the plan are fully executed, we expect to realize annual pre-tax savings of approximately $240 to $260, primarily through selling and administrative expense.\nOur estimates related to the actions discussed above reflect our best judgment based on information available as of 30 September 2025. Final settlement of these items may differ materially from our current estimates, which could impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nShareholder Activism-Related Costs\nShareholder activism-related costs totaling $86.3 ($71.7 after tax, or $0.32 per share) were reflected in our consolidated income statements during the first three quarters of fiscal year 2025. These costs were recorded in connection with a proxy contest that concluded in January 2025 following certification of the election of directors at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. These costs were not allocated to our reportable segments. No shareholder activism-related charges were recorded during the fourth quarter. \nOf the total $86.3 reflected on our fiscal year 2025 income statement, $31.9 related to legal and professional service fees and proxy solicitation expenses incurred directly by Air Products, primarily during the first quarter. In the second quarter, $29.7 was recorded for executive separation costs following the Board of Directors’ appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer in February 2025, which included a noncash expense of $22.4 to accelerate vesting of share-based awards and $7.3 in severance and other cash benefits. The remaining $24.7 was authorized and paid during the third quarter as a reimbursement to Mantle Ridge LP and its affiliated entities (collectively, “Mantle Ridge”) for expenses incurred in connection with the proxy contest. The reimbursement was unanimously approved by our Board of Directors, with one director abstaining from the vote due to his role as founder and Chief Executive Officer of Mantle Ridge.\nRefer to Note 25, \nSupplemental Information\n, for additional information.\nGain on Sale of Business\nIn April 2025, we completed the sale of our 100% ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary in Singapore for cash proceeds of $104.3. We recognized a gain of $67.3 ($51.9 after tax, or $0.23 per share) in connection with the transaction during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. Prior to the divestiture, the subsidiary contributed annual sales of approximately $50 to our Asia segment.\nOn 30 September 2024, we completed the sale of our LNG business to Honeywell International Inc. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a gain of $1.6 billion ($1.2 billion after tax, or $5.38 per share) during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. Prior to the divestiture, the results of the LNG business were reflected within the Corporate and other segment.\nThe gains from the sale of the businesses discussed above were not recorded in segment results. Refer to Note 4,\n Gain on Sale of Business\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income of $110.1 increased 89%, or $51.9. The increase was primarily driven by a $31.3 gain ($23.8 after tax, or $0.11 per share) on the sale of a regional office in Hersham, England, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. This gain is not reflected in the results of the Europe segment. \nOperating Income (Loss) and Operating Margin\nOperating loss was $877.0 in fiscal year 2025 compared to income of $4.5 billion in the prior year.\n \nThe loss in fiscal year 2025 was primarily attributable to higher pre-tax charges for business and asset actions, which totaled $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2025 compared to $57 in fiscal year 2024. Additionally, the prior year included a $1.6 billion pre-tax gain on the sale of the LNG business. Unfavorable volumes lowered operating income by $122, primarily due to the divestiture of the LNG business in September 2024. Operating income contributed by the LNG business in the prior year was approximately $135. Fiscal year 2025 also included shareholder activism-related costs of $86. In addition, other costs were unfavorable by $31, primarily reflecting fixed-cost inflation and higher depreciation, partially offset by productivity improvements. We also recorded pre-tax gains totaling approximately $99 in connection with the sale of a consolidated subsidiary and the sale of a regional office during the third quarter of fiscal year 2025. Furthermore, higher pricing primarily from non-helium merchant products favorably impacted operating results by $55, net of power and fuel costs.\nDue to these factors, operating margin was negative 7.3% compared to 36.9% in the prior year.\nAdjusted Operating Income and Adjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating income of $2.9 billion decreased 3%, or $89.8, due to lower volumes and higher costs, partially offset by higher non-helium pricing. The higher costs were driven by fixed-cost inflation and depreciation, partially offset by productivity improvements. Adjusted operating margin of 23.7% decreased 70bp from 24.4% in the prior year. Approximately 50bp of the decline was attributable to increased energy cost pass-through to customers.\nEquity Affiliates’ Income\nEquity affiliates' income of $647.7 was flat compared to the prior year. Increased contributions from affiliates in the Europe and Asia segments were offset by lower income from affiliates in the Corporate and other, Middle East and India, and Americas segments.\nInterest Expense\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\nInterest incurred\n$615.8\n \n$507.9 \nLess: Capitalized interest\n401.8\n \n289.1 \nInterest expense\n$214.0\n \n$218.8 \nInterest expense decreased 2%, or $4.8, driven by a higher carrying value of ongoing projects under construction despite our decision to exit various projects in fiscal year 2025. This decrease was partially offset by higher interest incurred on principal borrowings from Euro- and U.S. Dollar-denominated senior fixed-rate notes issued in February and June 2025.\nOther Non-Operating Income (Expense), Net\nOther non-operating income of $2.6 increased $76.4 from an expense of $73.8 in the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by lower non-service pension costs, which totaled $45.0 ($33.7 after tax, or $0.15 per share) in fiscal year 2025, compared to $102.0 ($76.8 after tax, or $0.34 per share) in the prior year. Additionally, de-designated interest rate swaps related to financing for the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project resulted in an unrealized gain of $27.0 ($7.2 attributable to Air Products after tax, or $0.03 per share), compared to an unrealized loss of $16.3 ($4.3 after tax, or $0.02 per share) in the prior year. Refer to Note 3, \nVariable Interest Entities\n, and Note 15, \nFinancial Instruments\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. These benefits were partially offset by lower interest income on short-term investments.\n35\nTable of Contents\nDiscontinued Operations\nWe recorded net losses from discontinued operations of $8.0 and $13.9 in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nIn fiscal year 2025, a pre-tax loss from discontinued operations of $10.6 ($8.0 after tax, or $0.04 per share) was recorded in the third quarter primarily to increase our existing liability for retained environmental remediation obligations related to production facilities in the atmospheric emulsions and global pressure-sensitive adhesives businesses, which were sold in 2008. Refer to the \"Piedmont\" discussion under Note 19, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information.\nIn fiscal year 2024, a pre-tax loss from discontinued operations of $19.4 ($13.9 after tax, or $0.06 per share) was recorded in the fourth quarter to increase our existing liability for retained environmental remediation obligations related to the 2006 sale of the Amines business. Refer to the \"Pace\" discussion under Note 19, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information.\nNet Income (Loss)\nNet loss was $354.4 for fiscal year 2025 compared to net income of $3.9 billion in the prior year. The loss in fiscal year 2025 was primarily attributable to after-tax charges for business and asset actions, which totaled $3.0 billion in fiscal year 2025 compared to $44 in the prior year. Additionally, fiscal year 2024 included a $1.2 billion after-tax gain recognized from the sale of the LNG business in September 2024.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA of $5.1 billion increased 1%, or $30.1, as higher pricing and productivity improvements were partially offset by lower volumes and fixed-cost inflation.\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate equals the income tax expense (benefit) divided by income or loss before taxes. Equity affiliates' income is primarily included net of income taxes within income before taxes on our consolidated income statements.\nFor the fiscal year ended 30 September 2025, our consolidated income statements include an income tax benefit of $94.3 compared to an income tax expense of $944.9 for the comparative prior-year period. The tax benefit in fiscal year 2025 represents an effective tax rate of 21.4% on the pre-tax loss reported for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2025 compared to an effective rate of 19.6% for tax expense on the pre-tax income reported for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2024.\nThe current year rate was primarily impacted by charges for business and asset actions and other items as further discussed below. Our estimates related to these items reflect our best judgment based on information available as of 30 September 2025. The amount and timing of final settlement of these items may differ from our current estimates, which could impact our tax provision in future periods.\nOur prior year effective tax rate included impacts from the $1.6 billion gain on the sale of the LNG business during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. This gain increased our income from continuing operations before taxes, which diluted the impact of recurring effective tax rate reconciling items for fiscal year 2024. \nFor additional information, refer to Note 24, \nIncome Taxes\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness and Asset Actions\nIn fiscal year 2025, we recorded charges for project exits and other cost reduction measures as described in Note 5, \nBusiness and Asset Actions\n, to the consolidated financial statements. These actions resulted in a pre-tax charge of approximately $3.7 billion. The related net tax benefit of these actions totaled $695.2, which includes an $11.3 cost for reserves established for uncertain tax positions related to the deductibility of the amount of the charges incurred in foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded a net tax cost of $197.4 resulting from a $364.9 increase in our valuation allowance net of $167.5 of deferred tax assets related to the future disposal of certain foreign subsidiaries.\n36\nTable of Contents\nTax Reform Adjustment Related to Deemed Foreign Dividends\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $34.9 related to our intent to file a refund claim after a review of several U.S. Tax Court cases regarding the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition year of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (our fiscal year 2018).\nTax on Repatriation of Foreign Earnings\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we recorded an income tax expense of $31.4 related to estimated withholding taxes on foreign earnings that we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest. There were no other significant changes to our assumptions regarding the reinvestment of foreign earnings during fiscal year 2025.\nShareholder Activism-Related Costs\nDuring fiscal year 2025, we recorded costs of $86.3 related to a proxy contest as further discussed in Note 25, \nSupplemental Information\n, to the consolidated financial statements. We recognized an income tax benefit of $14.6 primarily related to costs for legal and other professional service fees as well as incremental proxy solicitation costs related to the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nOther\nIn addition to the items discussed above, our effective tax rate was higher in fiscal year 2025 due to lower tax benefits on U.S. export income in fiscal year 2025, higher net costs on foreign-related income taxed in the U.S, and an income tax benefit for a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary that occurred in our prior fiscal year but did not recur in fiscal year 2025. These increases were partially offset by larger benefits in fiscal year 2025 for the release of unrecognized tax benefits upon expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.\nAdjusted Effective Tax Rate\nOur adjusted effective tax rate, which excludes the impact of the business and asset actions described above as well as other adjustments in the \"Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section beginning on page \n42\n, was 18.2% and 17.8% for the fiscal years ended 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nH.R.1\nOn 4 July 2025, H.R.1, commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\"), was enacted in the United States. OBBBA includes a broad range of tax reform provisions, including extending and modifying certain key U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions (both domestic and international), expanding certain Inflation Reduction Act incentives, and accelerating the phase-out of others. OBBBA did not have a material impact on our fiscal year 2025 results and is expected to primarily affect future fiscal years.\nWhile OBBBA revised certain Inflation Reduction Act incentives, we continue to anticipate future benefits from tax credits related to certain clean hydrogen production projects, where construction has begun or is expected to begin prior to the applicable phase-out dates.\n37\nTable of Contents\nDISCUSSION OF RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\nAmericas\nChange vs. Prior Year\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\n$\n%/bp\nGAAP Measures\nSales\n$5,125.9\n$5,040.1\n$85.8 \n2%\nOperating income\n1,519.6\n1,565.1\n(45.5)\n(3%)\nOperating margin\n29.6\n%\n31.1\n%\n(150  bp)\nEquity affiliates’ income\n$157.0\n$158.8\n($1.8)\n(1%)\nNon-GAAP Measure\nAdjusted EBITDA\n2,408.7\n2,423.2\n(14.5)\n(1%)\nThe table below summarizes the major factors that impacted sales in the Americas segment for the periods presented:\nVolume\n(3\n%)\nPrice\n2\n%\nEnergy cost pass-through to customers\n4\n%\nCurrency\n(1\n%)\nTotal Americas Sales Change\n2\n%\nSales of $5.1 billion increased 2%, or $85.8, as higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 4% and higher pricing of 2% were partially offset by lower volumes of 3% and an unfavorable currency impact of 1%. Higher energy cost pass-through to customers was primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices. The overall pricing improvement reflects a 3% increase in our merchant business, which was driven by non-helium product lines. Volumes were unfavorable primarily due to lower on-sites, driven by previously announced project exits and the impact of a one-time asset sale in the prior year related to a customer-initiated early contract termination. Lower helium demand also contributed to the volume decline, despite a significant, non-recurring helium sale to an existing merchant customer in the first quarter. These headwinds were partially offset by a favorable one-time customer contract amendment in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.\nOperating income of $1.5 billion decreased 3%, or $45.5, due to higher costs of $92 and unfavorable currency of $10, partially offset by positive pricing, net of power and fuel costs, of $41 and favorable business mix of $15. The increase in costs was mainly driven by higher depreciation, maintenance, and fixed-cost inflation, partially offset by productivity improvements. Additionally, income recognized from the sale of an equity method investment in the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 was largely offset by a favorable legal settlement recorded in the prior year. Operating margin of 29.6% decreased 150 bp from 31.1% in the prior year as the margin impacts of higher costs and higher energy cost pass-through to customers were partially offset by favorable business mix. Approximately 100 bp of the decline was attributable to higher energy cost pass-through.\nEquity affiliates’ income of $157.0 decreased 1%, or $1.8, driven by our share of income from an asset sale in the prior year, partially offset by higher income from an affiliate in Mexico. \n38\nTable of Contents\nAsia\nChange vs. Prior Year\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\n$\n%/bp\nGAAP Measures\nSales\n$3,271.0\n$3,224.3\n$46.7 \n1%\nOperating income\n851.1\n859.2\n(8.1)\n(1%)\nOperating margin\n26.0\n%\n26.6\n%\n(60  bp)\nEquity affiliates’ income\n$42.3\n$32.9\n$9.4\n29%\nNon-GAAP Measure\nAdjusted EBITDA\n1,412.3\n1,363.1\n49.2 \n4%\nThe table below summarizes the major factors that impacted sales in the Asia segment for the periods presented:\nVolume\n—\n%\nPrice\n(1\n%)\nEnergy cost pass-through to customers\n2\n%\nCurrency\n—\n%\nTotal Asia Sales Change\n1\n%\nSales of $3.3 billion increased 1%, or $46.7, as higher energy cost pass-through to customers of 2% was partially offset by lower pricing of 1%.

On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted earnings per share (\"EPS\"), adjusted EBITDA, the adjusted effective tax rate, and capital expenditures. On a segment basis, we present adjusted EBITDA. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or \"non-GAAP adjustments,\" have on the calculation of our adjusted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. \nWe provide these non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others to evaluate the performance of our business in the same manner as our management. We believe these measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. However, we caution readers not to consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.\nIn many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we exclude the impact of the non-service components of net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans. Non-service related components are recurring, non-operating items that include interest cost, expected returns on plan assets, prior service cost amortization, actuarial loss amortization, as well as special termination benefits, curtailments, and settlements. The net impact of non-service related components is reflected within “Other non-operating income (expense), net” on our consolidated income statements. Adjusting for the impact of non-service pension components provides management and users of our financial statements with a more accurate representation of our underlying business performance because these components are driven by factors that are unrelated to our operations, such as volatility in equity and debt markets. Further, non-service related components are not indicative of our defined benefit plans’ future contribution needs due to the funded status of the plans. We may also exclude certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions and impairment charges as well as gains on disclosed transactions, such as the sale of the LNG business. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future. \nWhen applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.\n42\nTable of Contents\nADJUSTED OPERATING INCOME AND ADJUSTED EPS\nIn addition to adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income is an important measure to evaluate our business performance following the appointment of our new Chief Executive Officer in February 2025. The table below presents a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, along with reconciliations for each major component used in the calculation of adjusted EPS.\nIn periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for readers to understand the impact of each adjustment as management excludes these items when assessing the Company's underlying performance.\nPer share amounts are calculated and presented on a diluted basis from continuing operations attributable to Air Products. These amounts are computed independently and may not sum to totals due to rounding. Because we reported a loss from operations for fiscal year 2025, GAAP loss per share is calculated using the basic weighted average share count of 222.7 million, which does not consider outstanding share-based awards due to their anti-dilutive effect. Both adjusted earnings per share and the individual adjustments used in its calculation are based on a diluted weighted average share count of 222.9 million.\nFY2025 vs. FY2024\nOperating\nIncome/\nLoss\nEquity\n Affiliates'\n Income\nOther Non-\nOperating\nInc/Exp, Net\nIncome Tax\nBenefit/\nExpense\nNet Income/Loss Attributable to Air Products\nEarnings/\nLoss per Share\nFY2025 GAAP\n($877.0)\n$647.7 \n$2.6 \n($94.3)\n($386.5)\n($1.74)\nFY2024 GAAP \n4,466.1 \n647.7 \n(73.8)\n944.9 \n3,842.1 \n17.24\n$ GAAP Change\n($5,343.1)\n($18.98)\n% GAAP Change\n**\n**\nFY2025 GAAP Measures\n($877.0)\n$647.7\n \n$2.6\n \n($94.3)\n($386.5)\n($1.74)\nBusiness and asset actions\n(A)\n3,747.0 \n6.8 \n— \n695.2 \n3,047.9 \n13.68\nShareholder activism-related costs\n86.3 \n— \n— \n14.6 \n71.7 \n0.32\nGain on sale of business\n(67.3)\n— \n— \n(15.4)\n(51.9)\n(0.23)\nGain on sale of other assets\n(B)\n(31.3)\n— \n— \n(7.5)\n(23.8)\n(0.11)\nGain on de-designation of cash flow hedges\n(c)\n— \n— \n(27.0)\n(2.2)\n(7.2)\n(0.03)\nNon-service pension cost, net\n— \n— \n45.0 \n11.3 \n33.7 \n0.15\nTax reform adjustment related to deemed foreign dividends\n— \n— \n— \n34.9 \n(34.9)\n(0.16)\nTax on repatriation of foreign earnings\n— \n— \n— \n(31.4)\n31.4 \n0.14\nFY2025 Adjusted Measures\n$2,857.7\n \n$654.5\n \n$20.6\n \n$605.2\n \n$2,680.4\n \n$12.03\nFY2024 GAAP Measures\n$4,466.1\n \n$647.7\n \n($73.8)\n$944.9\n \n$3,842.1\n \n$17.24\nGain on sale of business\n(1,575.6)\n— \n— \n(377.2)\n(1,198.4)\n(5.38)\nBusiness and asset actions\n57.0 \n— \n— \n13.2 \n43.8 \n0.20\nLoss on de-designation of cash flow hedges\n(C)\n— \n— \n16.3 \n1.4 \n4.3 \n0.02\nNon-service pension cost, net\n— \n— \n102.0 \n25.2 \n76.8 \n0.34\nFY2024 Adjusted Measures\n$2,947.5\n \n$647.7\n \n$44.5\n \n$607.5\n \n$2,768.6\n \n$12.43\n$ Adjusted Change\n($89.8)\n($0.40)\n% Adjusted Change\n(3%)\n(3%)\n(A)\nCharge attributable to noncontrolling interests was\n \n$10.7.\n(B)\nReflected on the fiscal year 2025 consolidated income statement in \"Other income (expense), net.\"\n(C)\nGain attributable to noncontrolling interests was $17.6 in fiscal year 2025.

As further discussed in the \"Cash Flows From Financing Activities\" section on page \n52\n, we are able to raise capital through a variety of financing activities, including accessing capital or commercial paper markets or drawing upon our credit facilities.\nAs of 30 September 2025, we had $1.4 billion of foreign cash and cash items, compared to total cash and cash items of\n \n$1.9 billion. We do not expect a significant portion of the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and affiliates to be subject to U.S. income tax upon repatriation.

The adjustment for deferred income taxes of $554.8 was largely attributable to tax impacts associated with these costs.\nWorking capital accounts in fiscal year \n2025\n resulted in a net use of cash of $851.6, including $562.6 of other working capital driven by accrued income taxes. In fiscal year 2025, we made approximately $395 in tax payments related to the prior year sale of the LNG business. Payables and accrued liabilities were a use of cash of $224.0, primarily due to payments for contract terminations associated with our business and asset actions and previously accrued severance actions under our global cost reduction plan. \nIn fiscal year 2024, cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.6 billion. This included a $1.6 billion gain related to the sale of the LNG business as discussed in Note 4, \nGain on Sale of Business\n, to the consolidated financial statements. Business and asset actions of $57.0 reflected expenses recognized for severance and other benefits associated with our global cost reduction plan. Refer to Note 5, \nBusiness and Asset Actions\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Other operating adjustments of $183.8 primarily included pension expense, net of contributions, totaling $89.1.\n49\nTable of Contents\nWorking capital changes in fiscal year 2024 resulted in a net use of cash of $183.0. A use of cash of $338.7 within payables and accrued liabilities primarily resulted from a reduction in customer advances for sale of equipment projects as revenue was recognized, along with payments related to previously accrued severance actions and incentive compensation under the fiscal year 2023 plan. An inventory-related cash use of $137.8 was largely attributable to helium purchases. A use of cash of $111.0 from trade receivables was primarily due to the timing of collections. Offsetting these uses, other working capital provided a source of cash of $370.1, largely driven by the timing of income tax payments related to the LNG business sale. As noted above, tax payments associated with the LNG sale were remitted in fiscal year 2025.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\nAdditions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits\n($7,022.6)\n($6,796.7)\nAcquisitions, less cash acquired\n(59.9)\n— \nInvestment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates\n(390.4)\n— \nInvestment in financing receivables\n(61.9)\n(403.0)\nProceeds from sale of assets and investments\n245.8\n \n1,878.8 \nPurchases of short-term investments\n(117.6)\n(141.4)\nProceeds from short-term investments\n122.5\n \n470.7 \nProceeds from other investing activities\n115.4\n \n72.4 \nCash Used for Investing Activities\n($7,168.7)\n($4,919.2)\nIn fiscal year 2025, cash used for investing activities was $7.2 billion. The primary use of cash was $7.0 billion for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, of which approximately $3 billion related to the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project. Additional uses included investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates of $390.4, investments in financing receivables of $61.9, and cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $59.9. These activities are further detailed in the \"Capital Expenditures\" section on page \n51\n.\nCash proceeds of $245.8 from sales of assets and investments primarily included $104.3 from the sale of a subsidiary in Singapore and $37.7 for the sale of a regional office in Hersham, England, as further described in Note 6, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n, to the consolidated financial statements. Maturities of short-term investments provided cash of $122.5, which exceeded purchases of $117.6.\nIn fiscal year 2024, cash used for investing activities was $4.9 billion. The primary use of cash was $6.8 billion for additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits, and investments in financing receivables of $403.0. Additional information regarding the investments in financing receivables is provided in the \"Capital Expenditures\" section on page \n51\n. Proceeds from the sale of assets and investments totaled $1.9 billion and primarily related to the sale of the LNG business in September 2024. Refer to Note 4, \nGain on Sale of Business\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Maturities of short-term investments provided cash of $470.7, which exceeded purchases of $141.4.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCapital Expenditures\n (Non-GAAP Financial Measure)\nThe components of our capital expenditures are detailed in the table below. Refer to page \n48\n for a definition of this non-GAAP financial measure as well as a reconciliation to cash used for investing activities.\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\nAdditions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits\n$7,022.6\n \n$6,796.7 \nAcquisitions, less cash acquired\n59.9\n \n— \nInvestment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates\n390.4\n \n— \nInvestment in financing receivables\n61.9\n \n403.0 \nNGHC expenditures not funded by Air Products' equity\n(A)\n(2,470.7)\n(2,047.7)\nCapital Expenditures\n$5,064.1\n \n$5,152.0 \n(A)\nReflects the portion of \"Additions to plant and equipment, including long-term deposits\" that is associated with NGHC, less our approximate cash investment in the joint venture.\nCapital expenditures totaled $5.1 billion in fiscal year 2025, a 2% decrease from capital expenditures of $5.2 billion in fiscal year 2024. Spending in fiscal year 2025 was driven by $7.0 billion in additions to plant and equipment, primarily supporting our clean energy initiatives, including the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in NEOM City, Saudi Arabia, and clean energy complexes in Louisiana, United States, and Alberta, Canada. We also continued to invest in our core industrial gases business, funding the development of new plants and the maintenance and replacement of existing facilities.\nThe $390.4 investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal year 2025 included approximately $238 related to BHIG and approximately $115 for our final investment in the JIGPC joint venture. Additional information regarding these affiliates is provided in Note 6, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n, and Note 10, \nEquity Affiliates\n, to the consolidated financial statements. The $61.9 investment in financing receivables related to the financing arrangement for the natural gas-to-syngas processing facility in Uzbekistan. Additional details regarding this arrangement are provided in Note 6, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n, to the consolidated financial statements. In the prior year, the $403.0 investment in financing receivables included approximately $120 associated with the Uzbekistan arrangement, with the remaining amount related to the purchase of renewable fuel assets from World Energy. As discussed in Note 3, \nVariable Interest Entities\n, to the consolidated financial statements, we exited the World Energy sustainable aviation fuel project in fiscal year 2025. Cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, totaled $59.9 in fiscal year 2025 and was paid at the closing of our acquisition of an independent industrial gases company in Belgium.\nOutlook for Investing Activities\nIt is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because management is unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. These decisions, either individually or in the aggregate, could have a significant effect on our cash used for investing activities. Accordingly, management is unable to fully reconcile, without unreasonable efforts, our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities.\nWe expect capital expenditures for fiscal year 2026 to be approximately $4 billion, reflecting continued investment in our energy transition projects, traditional industrial gas projects, and maintenance within our core business. Approximately $1 billion is expected to be dedicated to traditional industrial gas projects. We anticipate funding these expenditures through our existing cash balance and cash generated from continuing operations. We also have access to capital and money market financing as well as other sources of funding as discussed in the \"Financing and Capital Structure\" section on page \n52\n.\n51\nTable of Contents\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\nLong-term debt proceeds\n$4,386.7\n \n$4,678.3 \nPayments on long-term debt\n(429.9)\n(486.2)\nNet decrease in commercial paper and short-term borrowings\n(74.7)\n(289.9)\nDividends paid to shareholders\n(1,584.1)\n(1,564.9)\nProceeds from stock option exercises \n1.1\n \n7.9 \nInvestments by noncontrolling interests\n594.6\n \n428.5 \nDistributions to noncontrolling interests\n(7.2)\n(25.8)\nOther financing activities\n(91.3)\n(132.5)\nCash Provided by Financing Activities\n$2,795.2\n \n$2,615.4 \nIn fiscal year 2025, cash provided by financing activities was $2.8 billion\n. The primary source of cash was long-term debt proceeds of \n$4.4 billion\n, which included $\n2.7 billion\n from Euro- and U.S. Dollar-denominated senior fixed-rate notes issued in February and June 2025. Net proceeds from the notes were used to repay commercial paper obligations, including those incurred prior to the closing of the February 2025 O\nffering\n that were used to repay €300 million (approximately $311) aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 1.000% Euro-denominated senior fixed-rate notes at maturity, plus accrued interest, and for general corporate purposes. An additional \n$1.6 billion\n in long-term debt proceeds was provided through project financing available to the NGHC joint venture, as further discussed on \npage \n53\n. Separately, we received \n$594.6\n in contributions from noncontrolling interests, primarily related to NGHC. These sources of cash were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of \n$1.6 billion.\nIn fiscal year 2024, cash provided by financing activities was $2.6 billion. The primary source of cash was long-term debt proceeds of $4.7 billion, which included $2.5 billion from green senior notes issued during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024 through U.S. Dollar-denominated fixed-rate offerings. In line with our Green Finance Framework, we allocated the net proceeds to finance or refinance, in whole or in part, projects expected to deliver environmental benefits, such as pollution prevention and control, renewable energy generation and procurement, and sustainable aviation fuel. Additionally, the NGHC joint venture borrowed approximately $2.0 billion from project financing in fiscal year 2024. These proceeds were partially offset by financing fees of approximately $112.0, which were reflected within \"Other financing activities.\" W\ne also received $\n428.5 in contributions from noncontrolling interests.\nCash proceeds from financing activities in fiscal year 2024 were partially offset by dividend payments to shareholders of $1.6 billion, payments on long-term debt of $486.2, and net decreases in commercial paper and short-term borrowings of $289.9.\nFinancing and Capital Structure\nDebt\nTotal debt increased to $17.7 billion as of 30 September 2025 from $14.2 billion as of 30 September 2024. We issued Euro- and U.S. Dollar-denominated senior fixed-rate notes in February and June 2025, which together had a combined carrying value of $2.9 billion as of 30 September 2025. Total debt also increased due to approximately $1.6 billion in incremental borrowings under the project financing arrangement related to the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project, which is nonrecourse to Air Products, as further discussed on page \n53\n. Total debt included related party debt of $236.5 and $304.4 as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nSubsequent to the balance sheet date, we repaid at maturity $550.0 aggregate principal amount of our 1.50% senior notes due October 2025, plus accumulated and unpaid interest through the maturity date.\nVarious debt agreements to which we are a party include financial covenants and other restrictions, including restrictions pertaining to the ability to create property liens and enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions. As of 30 September 2025, we were in compliance with all the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.\n52\nTable of Contents\nCommitted Credit Facilities\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we refinanced our existing 364-day $500 revolving credit agreement to extend its maturity date from 27 March 2025 to 26 March 2026 (the “364-Day Credit Agreement”). All other terms remain consistent with the original 364-Day Credit Agreement, including our ability to convert the facility into a term loan maturing 26 March 2027. Fees incurred in connection with the refinancing were not material. \nWe also maintain a five-year $3.0 billion revolving credit agreement that matures on 31 March 2029 (the “Five-Year Credit Agreement”). Both the 364-Day Credit Agreement and the Five-Year Credit Agreement are syndicated committed facilities that provide a source of liquidity and support our commercial paper program through the availability of senior unsecured debt to us and certain of our subsidiaries. No borrowings were outstanding under either of the 364-Day Credit Agreement or the Five-Year Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2025 or 30 September 2024.\nSeparately, certain of our foreign subsidiaries maintain access to committed credit facilities with a combined maximum borrowing capacity of $394.0, all of which was borrowed and outstanding as of 30 September 2025. The amount borrowed from available facilities as of 30 September 2024 was $1.1 billion, which included long-term borrowings of approximately $675 that were derecognized upon deconsolidation of BHIG during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Refer to Note 6, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nNEOM Green Hydrogen Project Financing\nTo support the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project, NGHC has access to project financing of approximately $6.1 billion, which is expected to fund about 73% of the project and is being drawn over the construction period, as well as additional credit facilities totaling approximately $500 primarily for NGHC's working capital needs. Creditors of NGHC do not have recourse to the general credit of Air Products. As of 30 September 2025, the joint venture had borrowed short- and long-term principal amounts totaling $4.9 billion compared to $3.3 billion as of 30 September 2024. Refer to Note 3, \nVariable Interest Entities\n, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nDividends\nWe believe that providing a consistent dividend plays a critical role in creating shareholder value. The Board of Directors determines whether to declare cash dividends on our common stock, as well as the timing and amount, based on our financial condition and other factors it deems relevant. We returned approximately $1.6 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2025, an increase of 1% compared to the prior year, and we remain committed to continuing our history of dividend growth as part of our long-term capital allocation strategy.\nDividends are paid quarterly, usually during the sixth week after the close of the fiscal quarter. On 18 July 2025, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.79 per share that was payable on 10 November 2025 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 1 October 2025. Additionally, on 19 November 2025, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.79 per share that is payable on 9 February 2026 to shareholders of record at the close of business on 2 January 2026.\n53\nTable of Contents\nPENSION BENEFITS\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. The shift to defined contribution plans is expected to continue to reduce volatility of both plan expense and contributions. For additional information, refer to Note 18, \nRetirement Benefits\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nNet Periodic Cost\nThe table below summarizes the components of net periodic cost for our U.S. and international defined benefit pension plans for the fiscal years ended 30 September:\n2025\n2024\nService cost\n$20.7\n \n$20.9 \nNon-service related costs\n45.0\n \n102.0 \nOther\n0.3\n \n0.9 \nNet Periodic Cost\n$66.0\n \n$123.8 \nNet periodic cost was $66.0 and $123.8 in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively. The decrease in costs versus the prior year was primarily attributable to non-service costs, which were driven by a higher expected return on plan assets due to a higher beginning balance of plan assets, lower interest cost, and a decrease in actuarial loss amortization. The net impact of non-service related items are reflected within \"Other non-operating income (expense), net\" on our consolidated income statements.\nService costs result from benefits earned by active employees and are reflected as operating expenses primarily within \"Cost of sales\" and \"Selling and administrative expense\" on our consolidated income statements. The amount of service costs capitalized in fiscal years 2025 and 2024 was not material.\nThe table below summarizes the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic cost for the fiscal years ended 30 September:\n2025\n2024\nWeighted average discount rate – Service cost\n4.9\n%\n5.6\n%\nWeighted average discount rate – Interest cost \n4.6\n%\n5.7\n%\nWeighted average expected rate of return on plan assets\n5.4\n%\n5.3\n%\nWeighted average expected rate of compensation increase\n3.5\n%\n3.5\n%\n2026 Outlook\nIn fiscal year 2026, we expect to recognize pension expense of approximately $30 to $40, which includes approximately $10 to $20 of non-service related costs. The lower non-service related costs are the result of higher expected return on plan assets from increases in the return assumption and a decrease in actuarial loss amortization.\nIn fiscal year 2025, we recognized net actuarial losses of $39.4 in other comprehensive income. Actuarial gains and losses are amortized into pension expense over prospective periods to the extent they are not offset by future gains or losses. Future changes in the discount rate and actual returns on plan assets could impact the actuarial gain or loss and resulting amortization in years beyond fiscal year 2026.\n54\nTable of Contents\nPension Funding\nFunded Status\nThe projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits attributable to employee service rendered to date, including the effects of estimated future salary increases. The plan funded status is calculated as the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets at the end of the period.\nThe table below summarizes the projected benefit obligation, the fair value of plan assets, and the funded status for our U.S. and international plans as of 30 September:\n2025\n2024\nProjected benefit obligation\n$3,795.3\n \n$3,951.8 \nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n3,727.6\n \n3,907.5 \nPlan Funded Status\n($67.7)\n($44.3)\nThe net unfunded liability of $67.7 as of 30 September 2025 increased $23.4 from $44.3 as of 30 September 2024, as the interest cost component of the net periodic pension cost was greater than decreases to the projected benefit obligation from actuarial gains due to higher discount rates. \nCompany Contributions\nPension funding includes both contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are primarily non-qualified plans. With respect to funded plans, our funding policy is that contributions, combined with appreciation and earnings, will be sufficient to pay benefits without creating unnecessary surpluses.\nIn addition, we make contributions to satisfy all legal funding requirements while managing our capacity to benefit from tax deductions attributable to plan contributions. With the assistance of third-party actuaries, we analyze the liabilities and demographics of each plan, which help guide the level of contributions. During fiscal years 2025 and 2024, our cash contributions to funded pension plans and benefit payments for unfunded pension plans were $29.9 and $34.7, respectively.\nFor fiscal year 2026, cash contributions to defined benefit plans are estimated to be $25 to $35. The estimate is based on expected contributions to certain international plans and anticipated benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon the timing of retirements. Actual future contributions will depend on future funding legislation, discount rates, investment performance, plan design, and various other factors.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRefer to Note 1, \nBasis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies\n, and Note 2, \nNew Accounting Guidance\n, to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our major accounting policies and information concerning implementation and impact of new accounting guidance.\nThe accounting policies discussed below are those policies that we consider to be the most critical to understanding our financial statements because they require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as the result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current and/or future economic and market conditions and their effect based on information available as of the date of our consolidated financial statements. If conditions change, actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the Audit and Finance Committee of our Board of Directors.\nDepreciable Lives of Plant and Equipment\nPlant and equipment, net as of 30 September 2025 totaled approximately $25.3 billion, and depreciation expense totaled approximately $1.5 billion during fiscal year 2025. Disclosures related to plant and equipment are included in Note 11, \nPlant and Equipment, net\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nPlant and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. Economic useful life is the duration of time an asset is expected to be productively employed by us, which may be less than its physical life. Assumptions on the following factors, among others, affect the determination of estimated economic useful life: wear and tear, obsolescence, technical standards, contract life, market demand, competitive position, raw material availability, and geographic location.\nThe estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness, especially when business circumstances change. For example, changes in technology, changes in the estimated future demand for products, excessive wear and tear, or unanticipated government actions may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated. In these cases, we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life, thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis. Likewise, if the estimated useful life is increased, the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis.\nOur regional industrial gas segments have numerous long-term customer supply contracts for which we construct an on-site plant on or near the customer’s facility. These contracts typically have initial contract terms of 10 to 20 years. Depreciable lives of the production assets related to long-term supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives. Extensions to the contract term of supply frequently occur prior to the expiration of the initial term. As contract terms are extended, the depreciable life of the associated production assets is adjusted to match the new contract term, as long as it does not exceed the remaining physical life of the asset.\nOur regional industrial gas segments also have contracts for liquid or gaseous bulk supply and, for smaller customers, packaged gases. The depreciable lives of production facilities associated with these contracts are generally 15 years. These depreciable lives have been determined based on historical experience combined with judgment on future assumptions such as technological advances, potential obsolescence, and competitors’ actions. \nIn addition, we may purchase assets through transactions accounted for as either an asset acquisition or a business combination. Depreciable lives are assigned to acquired assets based on the age and condition of the assets, the remaining duration of long-term supply contracts served by the assets, and our historical experience with similar assets. Management monitors its assumptions and may potentially need to adjust depreciable life as circumstances change. \nWe continue to depreciate assets that are temporarily idle. Depreciation is discontinued when assets meet the criteria for classification as held for sale.\n56\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of Assets\nAs part of a project review initiated by our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer in fiscal year 2025, we made the decision to exit various projects, primarily related to clean energy generation and distribution. As a result, we assessed the carrying values of the affected project assets against their estimated fair values. Where carrying values exceeded fair values, we recorded impairment charges as described under “\nImpairment of Assets: Plant and Equipment\n”. The review also led to the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment in one of our joint ventures, as discussed under \"\nImpairment of Assets: Equity Method Investments\n\".\nNo triggering events were identified in fiscal year 2025 that would require impairment testing for any of our reporting units containing goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets. We completed our annual impairment tests for these assets and concluded there were no indications of impairment. Refer to “\nImpairment of Assets: Goodwill\n”\n \nand “\nImpairment of Assets: Intangible Assets\n”\n \nfor additional detail. \nImpairment of Assets: Plant and Equipment\nPlant and equipment meeting the held for sale criteria are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Plant and equipment to be disposed of other than by sale may be reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, such as decisions to discontinue or exit projects, unexpected contract terminations, or unforeseen foreign government-imposed restrictions or expropriations. Plant and equipment held for use is grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. Such circumstances may include:\n•\na significant decrease in the market value of a long-lived asset grouping;\n•\na significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset grouping is being used or in its physical condition;\n•\nan accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of the long-lived asset;\n•\na reduction in revenues that is other than temporary;\n•\na history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset grouping; or\n•\nchanges in the expected useful life of the long-lived assets.\nIf such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the asset group is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset group’s fair value and its carrying value. An estimate of the asset group’s fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.\nThe assumptions underlying the undiscounted future cash flow projections require significant management judgment. Factors that management must estimate include but are not limited to industry and market conditions, sales volume and prices, costs to produce, and inflation. The assumptions underlying the cash flow projections represent management’s best estimates at the time of the impairment review and could include probability weighting of cash flow projections associated with multiple potential future scenarios. Changes in key assumptions or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge. We use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews and cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges.\n57\nTable of Contents\nAs part of a project review initiated by our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer in fiscal year 2025, we made the decision to exit various projects, primarily related to clean energy generation and distribution. Accordingly, we assessed the recoverability of project assets and recorded a total impairment charge of approximately $2.5 billion in fiscal year 2025 to write down long-lived assets to their estimated value, depending on the intended manner of disposal. For assets that met the held-for-sale criteria and are actively being marketed, observable market prices were not available. As a result, fair value less cost to sell was estimated using various data points, including an offer to purchase the facility, amounts due from the customer if the customer was contractually required to repurchase the asset, and an internally-developed discounted cash flow analysis. An impairment loss of $350.6 was recognized to reduce the long-lived assets held for sale to their estimated fair value, net of estimated selling costs, of $418.3 as of 30 September 2025. We expect the sale of these assets to be completed during fiscal year 2026. For plant and equipment that did not meet the held-for-sale criteria but is capable of being sold through secondary equipment markets, recoverability was evaluated using an orderly liquidation valuation approach. An impairment loss of approximately $2.1 billion was recognized as the difference between the estimated liquidation value of $22.5 and the net book value of the assets as of 31 March 2025. There have been no significant changes in the estimated net realizable value for the remaining assets as of 30 September 2025.\nThese estimates are considered critical because they involve significant assumptions regarding future cash flows, asset disposition strategies, and market conditions, all of which are subject to change and could materially affect the amount and timing of impairment charges. Additionally, because the project review is ongoing, we may make further project-related decisions that could impact the intended use or recoverability of certain assets, potentially resulting in the recognition of additional impairment charges in future periods.\nOther than the impairment charges recorded as discussed above, no additional asset groupings required impairment testing, as no other events or changes in circumstances indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\nImpairment of Assets: Goodwill\nThe acquisition method of accounting for business combinations requires us to make use of estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price paid for acquisitions to the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree, over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired entity. Goodwill, net was $963.9 as of 30 September 2025. Disclosures related to goodwill are included in Note 12, \nGoodwill\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The tests are done at the reporting unit level, which is defined as being equal to or one level below the operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are reviewed by segment managers regularly.\n \nAt the time of our fiscal year 2025 testing, we had five reportable business segments, six operating segments and 10 reporting units, eight of which included a goodwill balance. Reporting units are primarily based on products and subregions within each reportable segment. The majority of our goodwill is assigned to reporting units within our regional industrial gases segments. Refer to Note 26, \nBusiness Segment and Geographic Information\n, for additional information. \nAs part of annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Our evaluation of qualitative factors includes an assessment of relevant facts, events, and circumstances of a reporting unit including but not limited to: business performance, strategy, and outlook; macroeconomic conditions; local market dynamics; cost management; and significant changes in key personnel, customers, operating assets, or product mix. We perform a quantitative test when qualitative factors alone are not sufficient to conclude whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If we perform a quantitative test, an impairment loss will only be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. \nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we conducted our annual assessment and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value.\n58\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of Assets: Intangible Assets\nDisclosures related to intangible assets other than goodwill are included in Note 13, \nIntangible Assets\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nIntangible assets, net with determinable lives as of 30 September 2025 totaled $258.4 and consisted primarily of customer relationships. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment as part of the long-lived asset grouping impairment tests. Impairment testing of the asset group occurs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. See the impairment discussion above under \"\nImpairment of Assets – Plant and Equipment\n\" for a description of how impairment losses are determined.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets as of 30 September 2025 totaled $35.1 and consisted of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that potential impairment exists. As part of annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we have the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. Our evaluation of qualitative factors includes an assessment of relevant facts, events, and circumstances including but not limited to: business performance, strategy and outlook; macroeconomic conditions; local market dynamics; cost management; and significant changes in key personnel, customers, operating assets, or product mix. We perform a quantitative test when qualitative factors alone are not sufficient to conclude whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we perform a quantitative test, an impairment loss will only be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the total carrying value of the asset. \nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we conducted our annual assessment and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each asset was greater than its carrying value.\nImpairment of Assets: Equity Method Investments\nInvestments in and advances to equity affiliates totaled approximately $5.4 billion as of 30 September 2025. The majority of our equity method investments are ventures with other industrial gas companies. Summarized financial information of our equity affiliates is included in Note 10, \nEquity Affiliates\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe review our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized in the event that an other-than-temporary decline in fair value below the carrying value of an investment occurs. We estimate the fair value of our investments under the income approach, which considers the estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the investee, and/or the market approach, which considers market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded industrial gas companies. Changes in key assumptions about the financial condition of an investee or actual conditions that differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge.\nIn fiscal year 2025, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment of a joint venture in China that had been established to develop clean hydrogen infrastructure in the region. As a result, we recorded a charge of $6.8 to write down the full carrying value of the investment. There were no other events or changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying amount of our equity method investments may not be recoverable, and therefore, no further impairment testing was required.\n59\nTable of Contents\nRevenue Recognition: Cost Incurred Input Method\nRevenue from sale of equipment contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. We use a cost incurred input method to recognize revenue by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include material, labor, and overhead costs and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. \nAccounting for contracts using the cost incurred input method requires management judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimates of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for incentives or penalties on performance, schedule delays, technical issues, cost inflation, labor productivity, the complexity of work performed, the availability of materials, and performance of subcontractors. When adjustments in estimated total contract revenues or estimated total costs are required, any changes in the estimated profit from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of such change. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues to be earned, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nIn addition to the typical risks associated with underlying performance of engineering, project procurement, and construction activities, our sale of equipment projects within our Corporate and other segment require monitoring of risks associated with schedule, geography, and other aspects of the contract and their effects on our estimates of total revenues and total costs to complete the contract. \nWe assess the performance of our sale of equipment projects as they progress. Our earnings could be positively or negatively impacted by changes to our contractual revenues and cost forecasts on these projects. Changes to project revenue and cost estimates unfavorably impacted operating results by approximately $85 in fiscal year 2025.\nRevenue Recognition: On-site Customer Contracts\nFor customers who require large volumes of gases on a long-term basis, we produce and supply gases under long-term contracts from large facilities that we build, own, and operate on or near the customer’s facilities. Certain of these on-site contracts contain complex terms and provisions regarding tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, variable components, pricing provisions, and amendments, which require significant judgment to determine the amount and timing of revenue recognition.\n60\nTable of Contents\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\n \nAs of 30 September 2025, accrued income taxes were $179.4, and our net deferred income tax liability was $451.7. Tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions as of 30 September 2025 were $194.8, excluding interest and penalties. Income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2025 was $94.3.\nManagement judgment is required concerning the ultimate outcome of tax contingencies and the realization of deferred tax assets.\nActual income taxes paid may vary from estimates, depending upon changes in income tax laws, actual results of operations, and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities. Tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed. We believe that our recorded tax liabilities adequately provide for these assessments.\nDeferred tax assets are recorded for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. However, when we do not expect sufficient sources of future taxable income to realize the benefit of the operating losses or tax credit carryforwards, these deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance. A valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is considered more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include forecasted future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize or renew net deferred tax assets in order to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits. The effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in income tax expense.\nA 1% increase or decrease in our effective tax rate may result in a decrease or increase to net income, respectively, of approximately $4.\nDisclosures related to income taxes are included in Note 24, \nIncome Taxes\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing numerous assumptions. The discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions, expense, and obligations associated with the defined benefit plans.\nActuarial models are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the various defined benefit plans. These models have an underlying assumption that the employees render service over their service lives on a relatively consistent basis; therefore, the expense of benefits earned should follow a similar pattern.\nSeveral assumptions and statistical variables are used in the models to calculate the expense and liability related to the plans. We determine assumptions about the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, and the rate of compensation increase. Note 18, \nRetirement Benefits\n, to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates on a weighted-average basis for both the U.S. and international plans. The actuarial models also use assumptions about demographic factors such as retirement age, mortality, and turnover rates. Mortality rates are based on the most recent U.S. and international mortality tables. We believe the actuarial assumptions are reasonable. However, actual results could vary materially from these actuarial assumptions due to economic events and differences in rates of retirement, mortality, and turnover. \nOne of the assumptions used in the actuarial models is the discount rate used to measure benefit obligations. This rate reflects the prevailing market rate for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments with maturities corresponding to the expected timing of benefit payments as of the annual measurement date for each of the various plans. We measure the service cost and interest cost components of pension expense by applying spot rates along the yield curve to the relevant projected cash flows. The rates along the yield curve are used to discount the future cash flows of benefit obligations back to the measurement date. These rates change from year to year based on market conditions that affect corporate bond yields. A higher discount rate decreases the present value of the benefit obligations and results in lower pension expense. With respect to impacts on pension benefit obligations, a 50 bp increase or decrease in the discount rate may result in a decrease or increase, respectively, to pension expense of approximately $14 per year.\n61\nTable of Contents\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of the long-term average rate of return to be earned by plan assets reflecting current asset allocations. In determining estimated asset class returns, we take into account historical and future expected long-term returns and the value of active management, as well as the interest rate environment. Asset allocation is determined based on long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. Lower returns on the plan assets result in higher pension expense. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the estimated rate of return on plan assets may result in a decrease or increase, respectively, to pension expense of approximately $18 per year.\nWe use a market-related valuation method for recognizing certain investment gains or losses for our significant pension plans. Investment gains or losses are the difference between the expected return and actual return on plan assets. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on a market-related value of plan assets. This is a calculated value that recognizes investment gains and losses on equities over a five-year period from the year in which they occur and reduces year-to-year volatility. The market-related value for non-equity investments equals the actual fair value. Expense in future periods will be impacted as gains or losses are recognized in the market-related value of assets.\nThe expected rate of compensation increase is another key assumption. We determine this rate based on review of the underlying long-term salary increase trend characteristic of labor markets and historical experience, as well as comparison to peer companies. A 50 bp increase or decrease in the expected rate of compensation may result in an increase or decrease to pension expense, respectively, of approximately $4 per year.\nLoss Contingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we encounter contingencies, or situations involving varying degrees of uncertainty as to the outcome and effect on our company. We accrue a liability for loss contingencies when it is considered probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued.\nContingencies include those associated with litigation and environmental matters, for which our accounting policy is discussed in Note 1, \nBasis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies\n, to the consolidated financial statements, and details are provided in Note 19, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to the consolidated financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability and whether the amount of loss associated with a contingency can be reasonably estimated. These determinations are made based on the best available information at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess probability and estimates of loss contingencies. Revisions to the estimates associated with loss contingencies could have a significant impact on our results of operations in the period in which an accrual for loss contingencies is recorded or adjusted. For example, due to the inherent uncertainties related to environmental exposures, a significant increase to environmental liabilities could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or our proportionate share of the liability increases. Similarly, a future charge for regulatory fines or damage awards associated with litigation could have a significant impact on our net income in the period in which it is recorded.\n62\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. It is our policy to minimize our cash flow exposure to adverse changes in currency exchange rates and to manage the financial risks inherent in funding with debt capital.\nWe address these financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. For details on the types and use of these derivative instruments and related major accounting policies, refer to Note 1, \nBasis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies\n, and Note 15, \nFinancial Instruments\n, to the consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we mitigate adverse energy price impacts through our cost pass-through contracts with customers and price increases.\nOur derivative and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt, including the current portion and amounts owed to related parties; interest rate swaps; cross currency interest rate swaps; and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the \"net financial instrument position\" and is disclosed in Note 16, \nFair Value Measurements\n, to the consolidated financial statements. Our net financial instrument position increased from a liability of approximately $13.9 billion at 30 September 2024 to a liability of approximately $17.2 billion at 30 September 2025. The increase was primarily due to the issuance of Euro- and U.S. Dollar-denominated senior fixed-rate notes during the second and third quarters of fiscal year 2025, as well as additional borrowings under the project financing associated with the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project as discussed in Note 3, \nVariable Interest Entities\n, to the consolidated financial statements. Aggregate principal amounts of Euro- and U.S. Dollar-denominated senior fixed-rate notes issued were €1.5 billion (approximately $1.6 billion) and $1.1 billion, respectively. These increases were partially offset by the derecognition of long-term debt associated with the deconsolidation of BHIG and the repayment of €300 million (approximately $311) aggregate principal amount outstanding of our 1.000% Euro-denominated senior fixed-rate notes at maturity in February 2025. For additional information regarding deconsolidation of BHIG, refer to Note 6, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n, to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices. Market values are the present values of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices chosen. The market values for interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are calculated by us using a third-party software model that utilizes standard pricing models to determine the present value of the instruments based on market conditions as of the valuation date, such as interest rates, spot and forward exchange rates, and implied volatility.\nInterest Rate Risk\nOur debt portfolio as of 30 September 2025, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 91% fixed-rate debt and 9% variable-rate debt. Our debt portfolio as of 30 September 2024, including the effect of currency and interest rate swap agreements, was composed of 87% fixed-rate debt and 13% variable-rate debt.\nThe sensitivity analysis related to the interest rate risk on the fixed portion of our debt portfolio assumes an instantaneous 100 bp parallel move in interest rates from the level at 30 September 2025, with all other variables held constant. A 100 bp increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of $1,128 and $1,035 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively. A 100 bp decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of $1,290 and $1,197 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nBased on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, a 100 bp increase in interest rates would result in an additional $16 and $19 of interest incurred per year at 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively. A 100 bp decline in interest rates would lower interest incurred by $16 and $19 per year at 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n63\nTable of Contents\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nThe sensitivity analysis related to foreign currency exchange rates assumes an instantaneous 10% change in the foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 30 September 2025 and 2024, with all other variables held constant. A 10% strengthening or weakening of the functional currency of an entity versus all other currencies would result in a decrease or increase, respectively, of $565 and $408 in the net liability position of financial instruments at 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively. The increase in sensitivity is primarily due to the issuance of the Euro-denominated senior fixed-rate notes noted above. \nThe primary currency pairs for which we have exchange rate exposure are the Chinese Renminbi and U.S. Dollar and Euro and U.S. Dollar. Foreign currency debt, cross currency interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts are used in countries where we do business, thereby reducing our net asset exposure. Foreign exchange-forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps are also used to hedge our firm and highly anticipated foreign currency cash flows. Thus, there is either an asset or liability or cash flow exposure related to all of the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and materially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis.\nThe majority of our sales are denominated in foreign currencies as they are derived outside the United States. Therefore, financial results will be affected by changes in foreign currency rates. The Chinese Renminbi and the Euro represent the largest exposures in terms of our foreign earnings. We estimate that a 10% reduction in either the Chinese Renminbi or the Euro versus the U.S. Dollar would lower our annual operating income by approximately $50 and $34, respectively.\n64\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n67\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect \nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition – On-site Customer Contracts – Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nOn-site industrial gas customer contracts involve large capital investments to serve customers who require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand. The Company builds, owns and operates facilities on or near the customer’s facilities to produce and supply the customer with gases under a long-term arrangement. Typically, these contracts have 15- to 20-year terms and contain fixed monthly charges and/or minimum purchase requirements. Revenue associated with these contracts is generally recognized over time during the period in which the Company delivers or makes available the agreed upon quantity of gases. In addition, certain on-site industrial gas contracts contain complex terms and provisions such as tolling arrangements, minimum payment requirements, and pricing provisions that are specific to a customer arrangement. These arrangements may require greater judgment in determining when contractual requirements have been met, impacting the amount of revenue to be recorded. \nWe identified revenue recognition for certain on-site industrial gas customer contracts with complex terms and provisions as a critical audit matter because of the judgments necessary for management to evaluate these contract terms, including amendments, in order to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized. This required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing procedures to audit management’s determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition and evaluating the results of those procedures.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to revenue recognition for certain on-site industrial gas customer contracts with complex terms and provisions included the following procedures, among others: \n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of the Company’s controls related to the amount of revenue recognition, including controls over the evaluation of complex terms and provisions in certain on-site industrial gas customer contracts.\n•\nWe evaluated the terms included within original customer contracts and related amendments to assess the accounting for provisions such as minimum payment requirements, pricing provisions, and settlement terms that require management to apply judgment in determining revenue recognition associated with the contract.\n•\nWe evaluated customer transactions and agreed the amount of revenue recognized to underlying contracts, customer invoices, and cash receipts.\n•\nWe inquired of personnel who oversee operations and revenue recognition as to the presence of contract amendments, and interpretation of contract terms.\n/s/ \nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nNovember 20,

indicates otherwise, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” the “Company,” \"Air Products,\" or “registrant” include our controlled subsidiaries and affiliates.\nAbout Air Products\nAir Products and Chemicals, Inc., a Delaware corporation founded in 1940, is a world-leading industrial gases company that has built a reputation for its innovation, operational excellence, and commitment to safety and environmental stewardship. Focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets and generating a cleaner future, we offer products and services that improve our customers’ operations and sustainability.\nWe serve a broad range of industries, including refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, medical, and food, providing essential industrial gases, related equipment, and applications expertise. We also develop, engineer, build, own, and operate some of the world’s largest clean hydrogen projects supporting the transition to low- and zero-carbon energy, particularly in industrial applications and the heavy-duty transportation sector. Additionally, our sale of equipment businesses provide specialized products such as turbomachinery, membrane systems, and cryogenic containers to customers worldwide.\nWe manage our operations, assess performance, and report earnings under \nfive\n reportable segments: Americas, Asia, Europe, Middle East and India, and Corporate and other. Refer to Note 26, \nBusiness Segment and Geographic Information\n, for additional information.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. and those of its controlled subsidiaries. The notes that follow are an integral part of our consolidated financial statements. These notes, unless otherwise indicated, are presented on a continuing operations basis. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nAs further described in Note 2, \nNew Accounting Guidance\n, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\" in fiscal year 2025. Accordingly, additional segment disclosure information has been included for fiscal years 2023 and 2024.\n \nDiscontinued Operations\nThe results of operations and cash flows for our discontinued operations have been segregated from the results of continuing operations and segment results. The comprehensive income related to discontinued operations has not been segregated and is included in the consolidated comprehensive income statements. There were \nno\n assets and liabilities presented as discontinued operations on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 8, \nDiscontinued Operations\n, for additional information.\nEstimates and Assumptions\nPreparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n75\nTable of Contents\nConsolidation Principles\nWe consolidate all entities we control under either the voting interest model, which generally applies when we hold a majority of the voting interest of an entity, or the variable interest model, which applies to arrangements for which we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (\"VIE\"). For consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, the outside shareholders’ interests are reflected as non-controlling interests on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe are considered the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We are the primary beneficiary of the NEOM Green Hydrogen Company and consolidate the joint venture within our Middle East and India segment. For additional information, refer to Note 3, \nVariable Interest Entities\n. We are not the primary beneficiary of any other material VIEs.\nWe account for a VIE for which we have an equity interest and exercise significant influence but are not the primary beneficiary, such as the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company joint venture, as an equity method investment. For additional information on this joint venture, refer to Note 10, \nEquity Affiliates\n.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when or as performance obligations are satisfied, which occurs when control is transferred to the customer. We determine the transaction price of our contracts based on the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for the goods or services provided. Our contracts within the scope of revenue guidance do not contain payment terms that include a significant financing component. Consistent with industry business practice, we generally do not accept sales returns or provide return allowances.\nOur sale of gas contracts are either accounted for over time during the period in which we deliver or make available the agreed upon quantity of goods or at a point in time when the customer receives and obtains control of the product, which generally occurs upon delivery. We generally recognize revenue from our sale of gas contracts based on the right to invoice practical expedient. \nOur sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation as the individual promised goods or services contained within the contracts are integrated with or dependent upon other goods or services in the contract for a single output to the customer. Revenue from our sale of equipment contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. We recognize these contracts using a cost incurred input method by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. \nAmounts billed for shipping and handling fees are classified as sales in the consolidated income statements. Shipping and handling activities for our sale of equipment contracts may be performed after the customer obtains control of the promised goods. In these cases, we have elected to apply the practical expedient to account for shipping and handling as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods.\nAmounts billed for sales and use taxes, value-added taxes, and certain excise and other specific transactional taxes imposed on revenue-producing transactions are presented on a net basis and excluded from sales in the consolidated income statements.\nFor additional information, refer to Note 7, \nRevenue Recognition\n.\nCost of Sales\nCost of sales predominantly represents the cost of tangible products sold. These costs include labor, raw materials, plant engineering, power, depreciation, production supplies and materials packaging costs, and maintenance costs. Costs incurred for shipping and handling are also included in cost of sales.\n76\nTable of Contents\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is recorded using the straight-line method, which deducts equal amounts of the cost of each asset from earnings every year over its estimated economic useful life. The principal lives for major classes of plant and equipment are summarized in Note 11, \nPlant and Equipment, net\n.\nWe continue to depreciate assets that are temporarily idle. Depreciation is discontinued when assets meet the criteria for classification as held for sale.\nSelling and Administrative Expense\nThe principal components of selling and administrative expense are costs related to compensation, administrative functions, and professional fees.\nPostemployment Benefits\nWe provide ongoing benefit arrangements that provide nonretirement postemployment benefits such as severance and outplacement services to involuntarily terminated employees. We record a liability for these benefits when we determine it is probable that the benefits will be paid in an amount that can be reasonably estimated. These criteria are met when management, with the appropriate level of authority, approves and commits to a termination plan that identifies impacted employees and their related benefits and is expected to be substantially completed within one year. We do not provide material one-time benefit arrangements.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe are required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, either upon initial measurement or for subsequent accounting or reporting. For example, fair value is used in the initial measurement of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination; on a recurring basis in the measurement of derivative financial instruments; and on a nonrecurring basis when long-lived assets are written down to fair value when held for sale or determined to be impaired. Refer to Note 16, \nFair Value Measurements\n, and Note 18, \nRetirement Benefits\n, for information on the methods and assumptions used in our fair value measurements.\nFinancial Instruments\nWe address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The types of derivative financial instruments permitted for such risk management programs are specified in policies set by management. Refer to Note 15, \nFinancial Instruments\n, for further detail on the types and use of derivative instruments into which we enter.\nMajor financial institutions are counterparties to all of these derivative contracts. We have established counterparty credit guidelines and generally enter into transactions with financial institutions of investment grade or better. Management believes the risk of incurring losses related to credit risk is remote, and any losses would be immaterial to the consolidated financial results, financial condition, or liquidity.\nWe recognize derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. On the date the derivative instrument is entered into, we generally designate the derivative as either (1) a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (cash flow hedge), (2) a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge), or (3) a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability (fair value hedge).\n77\nTable of Contents\nThe following details the accounting treatment of our cash flow, fair value, net investment, and non-designated hedges:\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets the cash flow hedge criteria are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCL\") to the extent effective and then recognized in earnings when the hedged items affect earnings.\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is designated as and meets all the required criteria for a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in current period earnings.\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative and foreign currency debt that are designated as and meet all the required criteria for a hedge of a net investment are recorded as translation adjustments in AOCL.\n•\nChanges in the fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedge are recorded immediately in earnings.\nWe formally document the relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. This process includes relating derivatives that are designated as fair value or cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. We also formally assess, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, whether derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item. If it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we will discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.\nForeign Currency\nSince we do business in many foreign countries, fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIn most of our foreign operations, the local currency is considered the functional currency. Foreign subsidiaries translate their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date. The gains or losses that result from this process are shown as translation adjustments in AOCL in the equity section of the balance sheet.\nThe revenue and expense accounts of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates that prevail during the period. Therefore, the U.S. dollar value of these items on the consolidated income statements fluctuates from period to period, depending on the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies. Some transactions are made in currencies different from an entity’s functional currency. Gains and losses from these foreign currency transactions, and the impact of related hedges, are generally reflected in \"Other income (expense), net\" on our consolidated income statements as they occur and were not material for the periods presented in this report.\nForeign exchange gains and losses from the foreign currency remeasurement of balances associated with income tax assets and liabilities, intercompany and third-party financing transactions, and the impact of related hedges are reflected within “Other non-operating income (expense), net\" and were not material for the periods presented in this report.  \nIn addition, foreign currency forward points and currency swap basis differences that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness of our cash flow hedges of intercompany loans (“excluded components”) are recorded within “Other non-operating income (expense), net\" on a straight-line basis. Excluded components were expenses of\n \n$\n20.4\n, $\n31.4\n, and $\n25.1\n in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\n \n78\nTable of Contents\nGovernment Assistance\nWe receive various types of government assistance, primarily in the form of grants or refundable tax credits. Government assistance is recognized when there is reasonable assurance that we have complied with relevant conditions and the assistance will be received. Government assistance is recognized in the consolidated income statements on a systematic basis over the periods in which we recognize the related costs for which the government assistance is intended to compensate. Government assistance related to assets is included in the balance sheet as a reduction of the cost of the asset and results in reduced depreciation expense over the useful life of the asset. Government assistance that relates to expenses is recognized in the income statement as a reduction of the related expense or as a component of other income (expense), net. Government assistance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for the periods presented in this report.\nEnvironmental Expenditures\nAccruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Remediation costs are capitalized if the costs improve our property as compared with the condition of the property when originally constructed or acquired, or if the costs prevent environmental contamination from future operations. We expense environmental costs related to existing conditions resulting from past or current operations and from which no current or future benefit is discernible. The amounts charged to \nincome from continuing operations\n related to environmental matters totaled $\n37.7\n, $\n27.0\n, and $\n24.9\n in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nAdditionally, in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, we recorded pre-tax losses from discontinued operations of $\n10.6\n and $\n19.4\n, respectively, primarily to increase our existing liabilities for retained environmental remediation obligations associated with previously divested businesses. Refer to the \"Piedmont\" and \"Pace\" discussions under Note 19, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information.\nThe measurement of environmental liabilities is based on an evaluation of currently available information with respect to each individual site and considers factors such as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. An environmental liability related to cleanup of a contaminated site might include, for example, a provision for one or more of the following types of costs: site investigation and testing costs, remediation costs, post-remediation monitoring costs, natural resource damages, and outside legal fees. These liabilities include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that we have reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. They do not consider any claims for recoveries from insurance or other parties and are not discounted.\nAs assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amount of projected cost is reviewed, and the liability is adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Management has an established process in place to identify and monitor our environmental exposures. An environmental accrual analysis is prepared and maintained that lists all environmental loss contingencies, even where an accrual has not been established. This analysis assists in monitoring our overall environmental exposure and serves as a tool to facilitate ongoing communication among our technical experts, environmental managers, environmental lawyers, and financial management to ensure that required accruals are recorded and potential exposures disclosed.\nDue to inherent uncertainties involved in evaluating environmental exposures, actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates. Refer to Note 19, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information on our environmental loss contingencies.\nThe accruals for environmental liabilities are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets, primarily as part of other noncurrent liabilities.\n79\nTable of Contents\nLitigation\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings. We accrue a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. When only a range of possible loss can be established, the most probable amount in the range is accrued. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount within the range, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. The accrual for a litigation loss contingency includes estimates of potential damages and other directly related costs expected to be incurred. Refer to Note 19, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information on our current legal proceedings.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe expense the grant-date fair value of our share-based awards over the vesting period during which employees perform related services. Expense recognition is accelerated for retirement-eligible individuals who would meet the requirements for vesting of awards upon their retirement. Refer to Note 21, \nShare-Based Compensation\n, for additional information regarding our awards, including the models and assumptions used to determine their grant-date fair value.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A principal temporary difference results from the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation because accelerated methods of depreciation and shorter useful lives are used for income tax purposes. The cumulative impact of a change in tax rates or regulations is included in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We recognize deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances to the extent we believe that these assets are more likely than not to be realized considering all available evidence. \nA tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. This position is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\nWe have elected as an accounting policy to account for Global Intangible Low Tax Income (“GILTI”) as a period cost when incurred.\nFor additional information regarding our income taxes, refer to Note 24, \nIncome Taxes\n.\nOther Non-Operating Income (Expense), net\n\"Other non-operating income (expense), net\" includes interest income associated with our cash and cash items and short-term investments, certain foreign currency remeasurements and impacts from the related hedging activities discussed in the \nForeign Currency\n section above, and non-service cost components of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost. Our non-service costs primarily include interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of actuarial gains and losses, and settlements.\nAdditionally, during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting for certain interest rate swaps associated with financing for the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project. As a result of the de-designation, unrealized gains and losses are recorded to \"Other non-operating income (expense), net\" until the instruments re-qualify for cash flow hedge accounting. Refer to Note 3, \nVariable Interest Entities\n, and Note 15, \nFinancial Instruments\n, for additional information.\nCash and Cash Items\n\"Cash and cash items\" include cash, time deposits, and treasury securities acquired with an original maturity of three months or less.\nShort-term Investments\n\"Short-term investments\" include time deposits and treasury securities with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year.\n80\nTable of Contents\nCredit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. When extending credit, we evaluate customer creditworthiness based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors that include, but are not limited to, the customer’s credit score from external providers, financial condition, and past payment experience. \nWe assess allowances for credit losses on our trade receivable, lease receivable, and financing receivable portfolios. Allowances are evaluated by portfolio on a collective basis where similar characteristics exist. A provision for customer defaults is made on a general formula basis as the risk of some default is expected but cannot yet be associated with specific customers. The assessment of the likelihood of default is based on various factors, including the length of time the receivables are past due, historical experience, existing economic conditions, and forward-looking information. When we identify specific customers with known collectability issues, the assessment for credit losses is performed on an individual basis, considering current and forward-looking information about the customer. We also consider variables that may mitigate the inherent credit risk of a particular transaction, such as the estimated fair value of the collateral, whether by use or sale. \nThe use of forward-looking information considers economic conditions that may affect the customers’ ability to pay. Although we historically have not experienced significant credit losses, our exposure to credit losses may increase if our customers are adversely affected by economic pressures or uncertainty associated with local or global economic recessions, or other customer-specific factors. We review our reserves for credit losses on a quarterly basis. \nTrade receivables comprise amounts owed to us through our operating activities and are presented net of allowances for credit losses. \nChanges to the carrying amount of the allowance for credit losses on trade receivables are summarized below:\nBalance at 30 September 2022\n$\n24.1\n \nProvision for credit losses\n8.2\n \nWrite-offs charged against the allowance\n(\n7.9\n)\nCurrency translation and other\n(\n1.5\n)\nBalance at 30 September 2023\n$\n22.9\n \nProvision for credit losses\n10.7\n \nWrite-offs charged against the allowance\n(\n8.5\n)\nCurrency translation and other\n1.2\n \nBalance at 30 September 2024\n$\n26.3\n \nProvision for credit losses\n10.3\n \nWrite-offs charged against the allowance\n(\n7.5\n)\nCurrency translation and other\n1.1\n \nBalance at 30 September 2025\n$\n30.2\n \nAdditionally, lease and financing receivables are presented net of allowances for credit losses. As of 30 September 2025 and 2024, the allowance on lease receivables was not material. In fiscal year 2025, we recorded a $\n300\n allowance for credit loss related to a financing receivable in connection with our exit from the sustainable aviation fuel expansion project with World Energy. Refer to Note 3, \nVariable Interest Entities\n, and Note 5, \nBusiness and Asset Actions\n, for additional information. The allowance on financing receivables was not material as of 30 September 2024.\n81\nTable of Contents\nInventories\nWe carry inventories consisting of finished goods, work-in-process, raw materials, and supplies. \nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value and are presented net of applicable reserves on our consolidated balance sheets. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out (\"FIFO\") method. We write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or when inventories become unmarketable based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Refer to Note 9, \nInventories\n, for further detail.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe apply the equity method of accounting when we have the ability to exercise significant influence but do not control the operating and financial decisions of an investee, which generally applies when our ownership interest in common stock or in-substance common stock of the investee is between 20% and 50%. Under the equity method, we initially record our investment at cost and subsequently adjust the investment to recognize our share of net earnings or losses, distributions received, and other-than-temporary impairments. The carrying value of our equity method investments is reflected as \"Investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates\" on our consolidated balance sheets. We use the cumulative earnings approach for determining cash flow presentation of cash distributions received from equity method investees. Equity investments are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable.\nOur share of the investee's net earnings is primarily presented net of income taxes within “Equity affiliates’ income\" on our consolidated income statements. Profits or losses related to intra-entity sales with our equity method investees are eliminated consistent with our ownership percentage in the entity until realized by the investee through a transaction with a third party. In addition, “Equity affiliates’ income” includes interest income from shareholder loans viewed as in-substance common stock.\nPlant and Equipment, net\nPlant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Construction costs, labor, and applicable overhead related to installations are capitalized. Expenditures for additions and improvements that extend the lives or increase the capacity of plant assets are capitalized. The costs of maintenance and repairs of plant and equipment are expensed as incurred.\nFully depreciated assets are retained in the gross plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until they are removed from service. In the case of disposals, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from disposal, are included in income. Refer to Note 11, \nPlant and Equipment, net\n, for further detail.\nComputer Software\nWe capitalize costs incurred to purchase or develop software for internal use. Capitalized costs include purchased computer software packages, payments to vendors/consultants for development and implementation or modification to a purchased package to meet our requirements, payroll and related costs for employees directly involved in development, and interest incurred while software is being developed. Capitalized costs are reflected in \"Plant and equipment, net\" on the consolidated balance sheets and are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the software, generally a period of \nthree\n to \nfive years\n. \nWe capitalize costs incurred with the implementation of a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract, consistent with our policy for software developed or obtained for internal use. However, the capitalized costs are reflected in \"Other noncurrent assets\" on our consolidated balance sheets and expensed over the term of the related hosting arrangement.\n82\nTable of Contents\nLeases as Lessee\nAs lessee, we recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms in excess of 12 months. We evaluate whether an arrangement contains a lease at inception by determining whether there is an identifiable asset, we obtain substantially all the economic benefits from that asset, and we direct how and for what purpose the asset is used during the term of the arrangement. We apply a practical expedient to exclude arrangements with initial terms of 12 months or less from our balance sheet.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since our leases generally do not provide an implicit discount rate, we use our incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. To determine the incremental borrowing rate, we consider our unsecured borrowings and published market rates, and then adjust those rates to assume full collateralization and to factor in the individual lease term, geography, and payment structure. \nOur lease term includes periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise an option to extend or not exercise an option to terminate. Lease payments consider our practical expedient to combine amounts for lease and related non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets in which we are lessee. Fixed payments and payments associated with escalation clauses based on an index are included in the ROU asset and lease liability at commencement. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. Our variable lease payments primarily include the impact from escalation clauses that are not fixed or based on an index. Prepaid lease payments are included in the recognition of ROU assets. Our lease agreements do not contain any material lease incentives, residual value guarantees or restrictions or covenants.\nLeases as Lessor\nCertain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer are accounted for as containing embedded leases. Our lease receivables are primarily long-term in nature and relate to sales-type leases on certain on-site assets for which payments are collected over the contract term. Revenue representing interest income from the financing component of the lease receivable is reflected as sales over the life of the contract.\nIn cases for which operating lease treatment is appropriate, there is no difference in revenue recognition over the life of the contract as compared to accounting for the contract under a sale of gas agreement. These contracts qualify for a practical expedient available to lessors to combine the lease and non-lease components and account for the combined component in accordance with the accounting treatment for the predominant component. We elected to apply this practical expedient and have accounted for the combined component as product sales under the revenue standard as we control the operations and maintenance of the assets that provide the supply of gas to our customers.\nThere have been no new arrangements that qualified as a lease for which we are the lessor in fiscal year 2025.\nFinancing Receivables\nSome of our acquisitions include terms that provide the seller with both the right to receive all output from the acquired asset for an agreed upon term as well as the right to reacquire the asset at a future date. In these instances, we evaluate the contract terms to determine whether we have obtained control of the underlying asset, or the transaction qualifies as a financing arrangement. For transactions that qualify as financing arrangements, we record our investment as a financing receivable, net of any allowances for credit losses, on our consolidated balance sheets. We then recognize a portion of the payments received as a reduction to the financing receivable. Related interest income is presented within “Sales” on our consolidated income statements with revenue received to operate the plant. Accrued interest is presented within trade receivables, net and was not material as of 30 September 2025 and 2024.\n83\nTable of Contents\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are grouped for impairment testing at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. We assess recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If an asset group is determined to be impaired, the impairment loss to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the asset group’s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value. An estimate of the asset group's fair value is based on the discounted value of its estimated cash flows.\nLong-lived assets that meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. The fair value of the disposal group is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis. Long-lived assets intended for disposal through means other than sale are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or disposal group may not be recoverable. \nIn fiscal year 2025, we recorded impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of long-lived assets associated with exited projects. A portion of the related plant and equipment is capable of being marketed through secondary equipment channels but did not meet the criteria for classification as held for sale. The estimated net realizable value of these assets was $\n22.5\n, which remains classified within “Plant and equipment, net” on our consolidated balance sheet as of 30 September 2025. Separately, \ntwo\n coal gasification plants in China met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. Accordingly, the estimated fair value less cost to sell for long-lived assets of $\n418.3\n is included in “Assets held for sale” on our consolidated balance sheet as of 30 September 2025. Refer to Note 5, \nBusiness and Asset Actions\n, and Note 16, \nFair Value Measurements\n, for additional information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation is recognized in the period in which it is incurred. The fair value of the liability is measured using discounted estimated cash flows and is adjusted to its present value in subsequent periods as accretion expense is recorded. The corresponding asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset’s useful life. Our asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with on-site long-term supply contracts under which we have built a facility on land owned by the customer and are obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. Refer to Note 19, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for further detail.\nGoodwill\nBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Any excess purchase price (plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest and previously held equity interest in the acquiree) over the fair market value of the net assets acquired, including identified intangibles, is recorded as goodwill. Preliminary purchase price allocations are made at the date of acquisition and finalized when information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date needed to finalize underlying estimates is obtained or when we determine that such information is not obtainable, within a maximum measurement period of one year.\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. During fiscal year 2025, no triggering events were identified that would require impairment testing for any of our reporting units containing goodwill. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded there were no indications of impairment.\nRefer to Note 12, \nGoodwill\n, for further detail.\n84\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets with determinable lives primarily consist of customer relationships. The cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of economic benefit. \nNo\n residual value is estimated for these intangible assets. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names and trademarks. Indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually, and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. During fiscal year 2025, no triggering events were identified that would require impairment testing for any of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. We completed our annual impairment test for these assets and concluded there were no indications of impairment.\nCustomer relationships are generally amortized over periods of \nfive\n to \n25\n years. Purchased patents and technology and other finite-lived intangibles are generally amortized over periods of \nfive\n to \n15\n years. Other intangibles includes certain land use rights, which are generally amortized over a period of \n50\n years. Amortizable lives are adjusted whenever there is a change in the estimated period of economic benefit. Refer to Note 13, \nIntangible Assets\n, for further detail.\nRetirement Benefits\nOur retirement benefit plans are discussed in Note 18, \nRetirement Benefits\n. The cost of benefits we contribute to defined contribution plans is recognized in the year earned. The cost of benefits under our defined benefit and other post-retirement plans is generally recognized over the employees’ service period. We use actuarial methods and assumptions in the valuation of defined benefit obligations and the determination of expense. Differences between actual and expected results or changes in the value of obligations and plan assets are recognized systematically over subsequent periods\n.\n85\nTable of Contents\n2.  \nNEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nAccounting Guidance Implemented in Fiscal Year 2025\nReportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\". We adopted the update upon its effective date in fiscal year 2025 and implemented the expanded disclosure requirements in Note 26, \nBusiness Segment and Geographic Information\n, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nPursuant to the update, we expanded our disclosures to include significant expense categories that are regularly provided to our Chief Operating Decision Maker, as well as other segment items included in the reported measure of segment profit or loss. Prior period segment disclosures presented in this report have been updated to reflect the additional information now required under the new guidance.\nThese updates will also be reflected in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2026.\nNew Accounting Guidance to be Implemented\nClimate-Related Disclosures\nIn March 2024, the SEC issued Release No. 33-11275, \"The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors\", which includes final rules for providing annual qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding certain climate-related topics. As a result of legal challenges, the SEC issued an order in April 2024 to stay the effectiveness of the rules pending the completion of judicial review of the consolidated challenges before the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.\nThe SEC subsequently announced its withdrawal of its legal defense to such challenges in March 2025; however, the rules have not been formally rescinded by the SEC. In April 2025, the appellate court suspended its proceedings indefinitely and directed the SEC to file a status report outlining its next steps. In response, the SEC stated in July 2025 that it does not intend to revisit the rules and requested the court to rule on the pending petitions.\nIn September 2025, the appellate court declined the SEC's request and placed the litigation in abeyance, which will remain in effect until the SEC reconsiders the rules by notice-and-comment rulemaking or renews its defense. We continue to monitor these developments.\nIncome Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740)—Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, to expand income tax disclosures, primarily through disaggregation requirements for the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The update will be effective in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending 30 September 2026, although early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis with a retrospective option. We are evaluating the impact this update will have on our disclosures.  \nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses”, which requires additional disclosures of certain costs and expenses, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, as well as selling expenses in the notes to the financial statements. In January 2025, the FASB clarified that the update will be effective in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ending 30 September 2028 as well as interim periods thereafter, although early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied either prospectively after the effective date or retrospectively to any or all periods presented. We are evaluating the impact this update will have on our disclosures.\n86\nTable of Contents\nMeasurement of Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets\nIn July 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-09, “Measurement of Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets”, which allows an entity to elect a practical expedient to assume that current conditions as of the balance sheet date do not change when estimating expected credit losses. This update will be effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2027, although early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. We are evaluating the implications of this update. At this time, we do not expect it will have a material impact on our financial statements.\nAccounting for Internal-Use Software \nIn September 2025, the FASB issued ASU 2025-06, “Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Internal-Use Software”, which establishes criteria for commencing cost capitalization for software projects. This update will be effective at the beginning of fiscal year 2029, although early adoption is permitted. The amendments can be applied prospectively, retrospectively, or via a modified prospective transition method. We are evaluating the impact this update will have on our financial statements.\n3.  \nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nWe are the primary beneficiary of the NEOM Green Hydrogen Company joint venture (\"NGHC\"), a variable interest entity (\"VIE\") that is consolidated in our Middle East and India segment. We are not the primary beneficiary of any other material VIEs. \nOur other material VIEs are those in which we hold variable interests but are not the primary beneficiary. We have an equity interest and exercise significant influence in the Jazan Integrated Gasification and Power Company joint venture (\"JIGPC\"), which we account for as an equity method investment in our Middle East and India segment. We have no equity interest in World Energy, LLC (\"World Energy\"), but hold a variable interest through a financing receivable that was fully reserved in fiscal year 2025 in connection with our exit from the SAF expansion project.\nOur variable interests in NGHC, JIGPC, and World Energy are further discussed below.\nNGHC Joint Venture\nThe NEOM Green Hydrogen Project is a multi-billion dollar green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility that is being constructed in NEOM City, Saudi Arabia. Owned and operated by NGHC, the facility will be powered by renewable energy to produce green ammonia for Air Products as the exclusive offtaker under a long-term take-if-tendered agreement.\nAir Products is an equal owner in NGHC with our joint venture partners, ACWA Power and NEOM Company. While we only hold one-third of the voting interests in the joint venture, substantially all the activities of the joint venture involve or are conducted on behalf of Air Products. Since we have disproportionately few voting rights relative to our economic interests in the joint venture, we determined that NGHC is a VIE. In addition, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of NGHC since we have the power to unilaterally direct certain significant activities, including key design and construction decisions, and we share power with our joint venture partners related to other activities that are significant to the economic performance of NGHC. Therefore, we consolidate NGHC within the Middle East and India segment.\nUnder the project financing discussed below, the assets of NGHC can only be used to settle obligations of the joint venture, and creditors of NGHC do not have recourse to the general credit of Air Products. A table summarizing balances associated with NGHC as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets is provided on page \n89\n.\n87\nTable of Contents\nProject Financing\nIn May 2023, NGHC finalized the $\n6.7\n billion engineering, procurement, and construction agreement, naming Air Products as the main contractor and system integrator for the facility. To support the project, NGHC secured project financing that is non-recourse to Air Products of approximately $\n6.1\n billion, which is expected to fund about \n73\n% of the project and will be drawn over the construction period. At the same time, NGHC secured additional credit facilities totaling approximately $\n500\n, primarily for NGHC's working capital needs. These facilities are also non-recourse to Air Products.\nTotal principal borrowings were $\n4.9\n billion and $\n3.3\n billion as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively. These balances include short-term borrowings of $\n24.0\n and $\n51.6\n, respectively, under a variable-rate Saudi Riyal facility, which carried an interest rate of \n6.30\n% as of 30 September 2025. The remaining borrowings are from long-term facilities, which are reflected net of unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs within \"Long-term debt\" on our consolidated balance sheets. \nA summary of NGHC's long-term borrowings is provided in the table below:\n30 September\nFiscal Year Maturities\n2025\n2024\nPayable in U.S. Dollars\nU.S. Dollar variable-rate facilities \n5.49\n%\n(A)\n2027 to 2053\n$\n2,911.0\n \n$\n1,945.2\n \nU.S. Dollar variable-rate facility \n5.14\n%\n(A)\n2027 to 2041\n630.6\n \n345.5\n \nU.S. Dollar stated-rate facility \n5.00\n%\n2027 to 2053\n368.0\n \n245.9\n \nTotal Payable in U.S. Dollars\n$\n3,909.6\n \n$\n2,536.6\n \nPayable in Other Currencies\nSaudi Riyal stated-rate facility \n2.00\n%\n2028 to 2041\n1,000.1\n \n735.2\n \nTotal Principal Amount\n$\n4,909.7\n \n$\n3,271.8\n \nLess: Unamortized discount and debt issuance costs\n(B)\n232.1\n \n218.5\n \nTotal NGHC Long-term Debt\n$\n4,677.6\n \n$\n3,053.3\n \n(A)\nReflects a daily compounded SOFR as of 30 September 2025 plus an annual margin of \n1.31\n% and \n0.96\n%, respectively. These rates do not include the impact of our floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps, which result in an overall lower interest rate for the borrowings. Additional information regarding these instruments is provided below.\n(B)\nOur consolidated balance sheets as of 30 September 2025 and 2024 also included $\n3.8\n and $\n4.6\n, respectively, for remaining project financing fees that were eligible for deferral as a noncurrent asset. As additional borrowings are drawn, the unamortized balance is reclassified as an offset to the outstanding debt.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nIn May 2023, NGHC entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps designed to hedge the long-term variable rate debt facilities available under the project financing during the construction period of the project. We discontinued cash flow hedge accounting for certain swaps during the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 due to changes in the anticipated drawdown timeline for the hedged borrowings. As a result of the de-designation, unrealized gains and losses are recorded to \"Other non-operating income (expense), net\" on our consolidated income statements as summarized in the table below:\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\n2023\nGain (loss) on de-designation of cash flow hedges\n$\n27.0\n \n($\n16.3\n)\n$\n—\n \nAmount attributable to noncontrolling partners in NGHC\n17.6\n \n(\n10.6\n)\n—\n \nAmount attributable to Air Products after tax\n7.2\n \n(\n4.3\n)\n—\n \nWe re-designated certain affected swaps as outstanding borrowings under the available project financing became commensurate with the swaps’ notional values. The remaining de-designated swaps will continue to be excluded from hedge accounting until additional borrowings align with their notional amounts, at which point they may re-qualify for cash flow hedge accounting.\n88\nTable of Contents\nLand Lease\nThe green hydrogen-based ammonia production facility is being constructed on land owned by our joint venture partner, NEOM Company. NGHC signed a \n50-year\n lease agreement for the site, which commenced during the third quarter of fiscal year 2023. As a result, we recognized an operating lease with a right-of-use asset and corresponding liability of $\n223\n, of which $\n209\n was paid as a lump-sum in August 2023. Additional lease payments are due after the first \n30\n years of the lease term.\nNGHC Balance Sheet\nThe \ntable below summarizes balances associated with NGHC as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets:\n30 September \n30 September \n2025\n2024\nAssets\nCash and cash items\n$\n40.3\n \n$\n34.5\n \nTrade receivables, net\n1.1\n \n6.7\n \nPrepaid expenses\n20.7\n \n31.2\n \nOther receivables and current assets\n107.2\n \n120.6\n \nTotal Current Assets\n$\n169.3\n \n$\n193.0\n \nPlant and equipment, net\n6,593.9\n \n3,929.9\n \nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net\n218.0\n \n233.9\n \nOther noncurrent assets\n153.5\n \n37.1\n \nTotal Noncurrent Assets\n$\n6,965.4\n \n$\n4,200.9\n \nTotal Assets\n$\n7,134.7\n \n$\n4,393.9\n \nLiabilities\nPayables and accrued liabilities\n$\n201.7\n \n$\n308.4\n \nAccrued income taxes\n1.2\n \n2.0\n \nShort-term borrowings\n24.0\n \n51.6\n \nTotal Current Liabilities\n$\n226.9\n \n$\n362.0\n \nLong-term debt\n4,677.6\n \n3,053.3\n \nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities\n17.8\n \n24.5\n \nOther noncurrent liabilities\n1.6\n \n30.4\n \nDeferred income taxes\n13.8\n \n3.2\n \nTotal Noncurrent Liabilities\n$\n4,710.8\n \n$\n3,111.4\n \nTotal Liabilities\n$\n4,937.7\n \n$\n3,473.4\n \nEquity\nAccumulated other comprehensive income\n$\n38.3\n \n$\n13.8\n \nNoncontrolling interests\n1,493.6\n \n937.6\n \n89\nTable of Contents\nJIGPC Joint Venture\nJIGPC is a joint venture with Saudi Aramco Power Company (a subsidiary of Aramco), ACWA Power, and Air Products Qudra (“APQ”). JIGPC entered into project financing to purchase power blocks, gasifiers, air separation units, syngas cleanup assets, and utilities to supply electricity, steam, hydrogen, and utilities to Aramco’s refinery and terminal complex under a \n25\n-year agreement, which commenced in the first quarter of fiscal year 2022. JIGPC recorded financing receivables upon acquisition of the assets and recognizes financing income over the supply term.\nWe determined JIGPC is a VIE for which we exercise significant influence but are not the primary beneficiary as we do not have the power to direct the activities that are most significant to its economic performance. Instead, these activities, including plant dispatch, operating and maintenance decisions, budgeting, capital expenditures, and financing, require unanimous approval of the owners or are controlled by the customer. Accordingly, we account for our \n55\n% investment, which includes \n4\n% that is attributable to the noncontrolling partner of APQ, under the equity method within the Middle East and India segment. \nOur loss exposure is limited to our investment in the joint venture. The carrying value of our investment, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, totaled $\n3.1\n billion\n \nand $\n2.9\n billion as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively. The balance as of 30 September 2025 reflects a final investment of approximately $\n115\n that we completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. This investment was made in the form of a shareholder loan, which the joint venture used to purchase the remaining project assets. \nOur total investment in JIGPC primarily consists of shareholder loans that qualify as in-substance common stock in the joint venture. Certain shareholders receive a preferred cash distribution pursuant to the joint venture agreement, which specifies each shareholder’s share of income after considering the amount of cash available for distribution. As such, the earnings attributable to Air Products may not be proportionate to our ownership interest in the venture.\nWorld Energy\nIn November 2023, we purchased a sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) facility in Paramount, California, from World Energy and accounted for the transaction as a financing arrangement because the agreement contained an embedded sales-type lease. As of 30 September 2024, the related financing receivable had a carrying value of approximately $\n300\n. Additionally, we entered into a Master Project Agreement (\"MPA\") that included terms for operation of the acquired facility as well as amended terms for the construction and operation of an SAF expansion project subject to construction at the same location. The MPA also included a tolling arrangement whereby we would receive feedstock from and produce renewable fuels for World Energy over a term to conclude \n15\n years after onstream of the expansion project with the option to renew for \ntwo\n \nfive-year\n terms. Subsequently, the expansion project was put on hold pending receipt of permits. \nWe determined that World Energy is a VIE, and our financing receivable represented a variable interest in World Energy. We are not the primary beneficiary as we do not have control over their key operating decisions, including feedstock supply, production of renewable fuels, and negotiating and executing supply agreements with customers. \nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we terminated the MPA and announced our decision to exit the project. In connection with this decision, we recorded project exit charges totaling approximately $\n1.9\n billion, the majority of which were recognized at the time of the announcement. The charges included approximately $\n1.6\n billion to write down assets that had primarily been reflected within \"Plant and equipment, net\" and $\n300\n to establish an allowance for credit loss equal to the value of the financing receivable, which had previously been placed on non-accrual status. The remaining charge primarily reflects estimated costs to terminate contractual commitments and satisfy other obligations associated with exiting the site. We have no further loss exposur\ne related to our variable interest in World Energy as of \n30 September 2025\n; however, there could be \nfuture impacts to ea\nrnings as we finalize our exit from the project.\nThe ch\narges discussed above were recorded in aggregate with those related to other actions as described in Note 5, \nBusiness and Asset Actions\n. Estimates used to calculate the charges reflect our best judgment based on information available as of 30 September 2025.\n \n90\nTable of Contents\n4. \nGAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESS\nFiscal Year 2025 Sale of Singapore Business\nIn April 2025, we completed the sale of our \n100\n% ownership interest in a consolidated subsidiary located in Singapore. The transaction resulted in cash proceeds of $\n104.3\n, which was received in full upon closing. As a result of the divestiture, we recognized a gain of $\n67.3\n ($\n51.9\n after tax) that is presented as “Gain on sale of business” on our consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2025. The gain was not recorded in the results of the Asia segment.\nPrior to the divestiture, the subsidiary contributed annual sales of approximately $\n50\n to our Asia segment, primarily through the merchant gas supply mode. Assets divested in the transaction primarily included regionally located on-site production facilities and associated infrastructure.\nFiscal Year 2024 Sale of LNG Business\nOn 30 September 2024, we completed the sale of our liquefied natural gas (\"LNG\") process technology and equipment business to Honeywell International Inc. for approximately $\n1.8\n billion in an all-cash transaction. As a result of the transaction, we recorded a gain of approximately $\n1.6\n billion during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 that is reflected within \"Gain on sale of business\" on our consolidated income statements (approximately $\n1.2\n billion after tax). This gain was not recorded in the results of the Corporate and other segment.\nThe LNG business did not qualify for presentation as a discontinued operation because the disposal did not represent a strategic shift that had or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results. The LNG business generated operating income for our Corporate and other segment of approximately $\n135\n in fiscal year 2024 and $\n120\n in fiscal year 2023.\n91\nTable of Contents\n5.  \nBUSINESS AND ASSET ACTIONS\nThe table below summarizes charges related to business and asset actions as reflected on our consolidated income statements. These charges are not included in segment results.\n2025\n2024\n2023\nProject exit costs\n$\n3,623.3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n217.6\n \nGlobal cost reduction plan\n123.7\n \n57.0\n \n27.0\n \nBusiness and asset actions recorded through operating results\n$\n3,747.0\n \n$\n57.0\n \n$\n244.6\n \nProject exit-related impairment of equity method investment\n(A)\n6.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \nSubtotal\n$\n3,753.8\n \n$\n57.0\n \n$\n244.6\n \nIncome tax benefit\n695.2\n \n13.2\n \n34.7\n \nAmount attributable to noncontrolling interests\n10.7\n \n—\n \n5.0\n \nBusiness and asset actions attributable to Air Products after-tax\n$\n3,047.9\n \n$\n43.8\n \n$\n204.9\n \n(A)\nAmount recorded through \"Equity affiliates' income\" reflects an other-than-temporary impairment of a joint venture in China that had been formed to develop clean hydrogen infrastructure in the region.\nProject Exit Costs\nFiscal Year 2025\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, our Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer initiated a project review to focus resources on projects we believe will deliver the greatest value to our shareholders. As a result of this review, we made the decision to exit various projects, primarily related to clean energy generation and distribution. The review remains ongoing and may result in additional costs in future periods.\nIn connection with this review, we recognized project exit costs totaling approximately $\n3.6\n billion in fiscal year 2025. These costs primarily consisted of noncash write-downs of project assets to their estimated net realizable value or fair value less cost to sell, as well as estimated costs to terminate contractual commitments. Of the total charge, approximately $\n2.4\n billion related to our decision to exit \nthree\n U.S.-based projects within our Americas segment in the second quarter and approximately $\n755\n related to several smaller-scale projects across our global portfolio, primarily supporting the energy transition. These exits were driven by challenging commercial conditions, unfavorable regulatory actions, project-specific economic factors, and slower-than-expected development in certain markets. The remaining $\n425\n charge related to the impairment of \ntwo\n coal gasification plants in China that we decided to market for sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 due to customer-related challenges. These actions did not result in the impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.\nThe table below reconciles project exit charges recognized in operating results for fiscal year 2025 to the related accrual reflected in “Payables and Accrued Liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheet as of 30 September 2025:\nProject exit costs\n$\n3,623.3\n \nNoncash expenses\n(A)\n(\n3,282.7\n)\nCash payments\n(B)\n(\n174.4\n)\nCurrency translation adjustment\n12.1\n \nAmount accrued as of 30 September 2025\n$\n178.3\n \n(A)\nNoncash expenses included approximately $\n2.5\n billion to write down plant and equipment. The remaining amount primarily relates to other assets associated with our exit from the sustainable aviation fuel expansion project with World Energy as discussed in Note 3, \nVariable Interest Entities\n.\n(B)\nCash expenditures associated with these actions primarily reflect costs to terminate contractual commitments and settle asset retirement obligations. Total cash outflows are projected to be approximately $\n355\n once the exit strategy is fully implemented.\n92\nTable of Contents\nWe determined that assets and liabilities associated with \ntwo\n coal gasification plants in our Asia segment met the criteria for held-for-sale classification. As discussed above, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately $\n425\n to write down the assets to their estimated fair value less costs to sell. Of the charge, $\n350.6\n related to plant and equipment. As of 30 September 2025, our consolidated balance sheet included assets held for sale of $\n427.7\n, which primarily consisted of plant and equipment with an estimated value of $\n418.3\n, and liabilities held for sale of $\n50.5\n. \nWe expect to complete the sales of these plants in fiscal year 2026. Any gain or loss from the sales will be recognized at the time of the transaction based on the carrying amounts classified as held for sale. Interim adjustments to these amounts may be recorded prior to closing, depending on changes in market participant assumptions or updated indications of fair value, including developments in the expected selling price and transaction timing.\nIn addition, we identified plant and equipment with a net realizable value of $\n22.5\n that did not meet the held-for-sale criteria but is capable of being marketed through a secondary equipment market. These assets remain classified within \"Plant and equipment, net\" on our consolidated balance sheet as of 30 September 2025.\nBoth the held-for-sale assets and the marketable plant and equipment were subject to Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant unobservable inputs. Refer to Note 16, \nFair Value Measurements,\n for additional information.\nEstimates related to the actions described above reflect our best judgment based on information available as of 30 September 2025. Final settlement of these items may differ materially from our current estimates, which could impact our consolidated financial statements in future periods. While we expect to complete exit activities within the next twelve months, we cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could extend this process beyond one year in certain cases.\nFiscal Year 2023\nIn fiscal year 2023, we recorded a noncash charge of $\n217.6\n to write off assets associated with exited projects that were previously under construction in our Asia and Europe segments. The assets written off included those related to our withdrawal from coal gasification in Indonesia as well as a project in Ukraine that was permanently suspended due to Russia's invasion of the country.\n93\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Cost Reduction Plan\nIn June 2023, we initiated a global cost reduction plan that provides severance and other postemployment benefits to employees designated for involuntary separation. In accordance with our accounting policy, we recognize related costs in the period management formally commits to a defined set of actions under the plan. Benefits are determined based on the terms of our established ongoing benefit arrangements. Since the plan was initiated in 2023, we incurred costs totaling $\n207.7\n for approximately \n3,600\n employees globally.\nThe table below reconciles costs related to our global cost reduction plan to payables and accrued liability balances as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets:\n2023 Charge\n$\n27.0\n \nCash payments\n(\n6.8\n)\nCurrency translation adjustment\n(\n0.4\n)\nAmount accrued as of 30 September 2023\n$\n19.8\n \n2024 Charge\n$\n57.0\n \nCash payments\n(\n43.6\n)\nCurrency translation adjustment\n0.8\n \nAmount accrued as of 30 September 2024\n$\n34.0\n \n2025 Charge\n$\n123.7\n \nCash payments\n(\n57.5\n)\nCurrency translation adjustment\n1.4\n \nAmount accrued as of 30 September 2025\n$\n101.6\n \nThe remaining liability as of 30 September 2025 primarily relates to employees identified during fiscal year 2025.\n \nWe expect implementation of these actions to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal year 2026. However, position eliminations are subject to legal requirements that vary by jurisdiction, which may extend this process beyond one year in certain cases.\n6.  \nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES \nAcquisition of Ijsfabriek Strombeek\nOn 30 April 2025, we acquired a \n100\n% interest in Ijsfabriek Strombeek, an independent industrial gases company located in Belgium. Total consideration, net of cash acquired, was $\n74.2\n, which included $\n59.9\n paid in cash at closing. Ijsfabriek Strombeek produces and distributes a portfolio of merchant gases, including medical gases, dry ice, and carbon dioxide.\nWe accounted for the acquisition as a business combination within our Europe segment. Assets recognized primarily consisted of plant and equipment of $\n32.2\n; goodwill of $\n31.3\n; and intangible assets of $\n15.8\n. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible assets acquired primarily include customer relationships with a weighted-average amortization period of approximately \n10\n years. The acquired assets were recorded at their estimated fair values based primarily on a preliminary purchase price allocation. We may record adjustments to these assets during the preliminary purchase price allocation period, which could be up to one year from the acquisition date.\nFinancing Arrangement: Uzbekistan Facility\nOn 25 May 2023, we entered into an investment agreement with the Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan and Uzbekneftegaz JSC (“UNG”) to purchase a natural gas-to-syngas processing facility in Qashqadaryo Province, Uzbekistan, for $\n1\n billion. Under the agreement, Air Products owns and operates the acquired facility and is supplying all offtake products to UNG under a \n15\n-year on-site contract, with UNG supplying the feedstock natural gas and utilities. Throughout this term, we receive a fixed monthly fee (regardless of whether UNG requires the output) comprised of two components: a plant capacity fee and an operating and maintenance fee.\n94\nTable of Contents\nWe are accounting for the transaction as a financing arrangement as we did not obtain accounting control of the facility due to UNG having the unilateral right to reacquire the facility at the end of the contract term. The repurchase price on a discounted basis, which consists of the total monthly plant capacity fees received over the term of the arrangement plus the repurchase option price, exceeds our purchase price. Accordingly, our payments related to the facility are reflected within \"Financing receivables\" on our consolidated balance sheets. Financing receivables associated with the Uzbekistan transaction were $\n1\n billion as of 30 September 2025 and $\n920\n as of 30 September 2024. Amounts paid in connection with the facility are reflected on our consolidated statements of cash flows within \"Investment in financing receivables\" and were approximately $\n62\n, $\n120\n, and $\n600\n in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nDivestitures\nRefer to Note 4, \nGain on Sale of Business\n, for details regarding gains recognized from the sale of a Singapore subsidiary in fiscal year 2025 and the LNG business in fiscal year 2024.\nSale of Other Assets\nIn June 2025, we sold a regional office in Hersham, England, for cash proceeds of $\n37.7\n. We recognized a gain on sale of $\n31.3\n ($\n23.8\n after tax) that is presented within “Other income (expense), net” on our consolidated income statements for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2025. The gain was not recorded in the results of the Europe segment.\nDeconsolidation of Blue Hydrogen Industrial Gases Company\nIn January 2025, our \n51\n%-owned consolidated subsidiary, Air Products Qudra (\"APQ\"), issued equity in its wholly-owned subsidiary, Blue Hydrogen Industrial Gases Company (\"BHIG\"), resulting in a \n50\n/50 joint venture with Saudi Aramco Development Company (a subsidiary of Aramco). BHIG is currently constructing plants and pipelines to distribute hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen in Saudi Arabia’s Jubail Industrial City.\nAs a result of the transaction, we determined that APQ no longer holds a controlling financial interest in BHIG. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities associated with the entity were derecognized from our consolidated balance sheet during the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. Amounts derecognized primarily included plant and equipment of approximately $\n600\n and long-term debt, net of deferred financing costs, of approximately $\n655\n.\nWhile we no longer control BHIG, we maintain the ability to exercise significant influence regarding key decisions. Accordingly, we recorded an equity method investment for APQ's \n50\n% interest in the entity. This investment is reflected within \"Investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates\" on our consolidated balance sheet and totaled\n \n$\n164.6\n \nas of 30 September 2025.\n95\nTable of Contents\n7.  \nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nNature of Goods and Services\nThe principal activities from which we generate revenue under our contracts with customers are described below, along with the related revenue recognition policies. For a comprehensive overview of these policies, including payment terms and presentation, refer to Note 1, \nBasis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies\n. \nRegional Industrial Gases\nOur industrial gases business, which is organized and operated regionally in the Americas, Asia, Europe, and Middle East and India segments, produces and sells atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon (primarily recovered by the cryogenic distillation of air); process gases such as hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide); and specialty gases. The majority of our revenue is generated from our sale of gas customers within these regional industrial gases segments.\nWe distribute product to our industrial gas customers through either our on-site or merchant supply mode depending on various factors, including the customer's volume requirements and location. Each sale of gas supply mode is described below:\nOn-site Gases\n—This supply mode serves customers who require large volumes of gases and have relatively constant demand. Gases are produced and supplied through large facilities constructed or acquired on or near customer facilities, or by pipeline systems from centralized production locations. These sale of gas arrangements are generally governed by long-term contracts ranging from \n15\n- to \n20\n-years. We also deliver smaller quantities of product through small on-site plants (cryogenic or non-cryogenic generators), generally under \n10\n- to \n15\n-year contracts. Contracts in this supply mode commonly include fixed monthly charges and/or minimum purchase requirements with price escalation provisions that are typically based on external indices. Revenue associated with this supply mode is generally recognized over time during the period in which we deliver or make available the agreed upon quantity of goods.\nMerchant Gases\n—This supply mode includes liquid bulk and packaged gas products. Liquid bulk gases are delivered in either liquid or gaseous form via tanker or tube trailer and stored, usually in its liquid state, in equipment that we typically design and install at the customer’s site for vaporizing into a gaseous state as needed. Packaged gases customers receive small quantities of product delivered in either cylinders or dewars. Sales of both liquid bulk and packaged gases do not include minimum purchase requirements, as they are governed by contracts and/or purchase orders that reflect the customer's specific needs. These contracts contain stated terms that are generally \nfive years\n or less. Performance obligations associated with this supply mode are satisfied at a point in time when the customer receives and obtains control of the product, which generally occurs upon delivery.\nThe timing of revenue recognition for our regional industrial gases business is generally consistent with our right to invoice the customer. Variable components of consideration that may not be resolved within the month, such as the ability to earn an annual bonus or incur a penalty, are more relevant to on-site contracts and are considered constrained as they can be impacted by a single significant event such as a plant outage, which could occur at the end of a contract period. We consider contract modifications on an individual basis to determine appropriate accounting treatment. However, contract modifications are generally accounted for prospectively as they relate to distinct goods or services associated with future periods of performance. \nWe mitigate energy and natural gas price risk contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, and cost pass-through arrangements.\n96\nTable of Contents\nEquipment\nWe design and manufacture equipment for air separation, hydrocarbon recovery and purification, and liquid helium and liquid hydrogen transport and storage. The Corporate and other segment includes activity related to the sale of cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation. The Corporate and other segment also includes the results of our Rotoflow business, which manufactures turboexpanders and other precision rotating equipment, and our Gardner Cryogenics business, which fabricates helium and hydrogen transport and storage containers.\nOur sale of equipment contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation as the individual promised goods or services contained within the contracts are integrated with or dependent upon other goods or services in the contract for a single output to the customer. Revenue from our sale of equipment contracts is generally recognized over time as we have an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date and our performance under the contract terms does not create an asset with alternative use. Otherwise, sale of equipment contracts are satisfied at the point in time the customer obtains control of the equipment, which is generally determined based on the shipping terms of the contract. For contracts recognized over time, we primarily recognize revenue using a cost incurred input method by which costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion are used to measure progress toward satisfying performance obligations. Costs incurred include those for materials, labor, and overhead and represent work contributing and proportionate to the transfer of control to the customer. \nSince our contracts are generally comprised of a single performance obligation, contract modifications are typically accounted for as part of the existing contract and are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such change. In addition, changes in estimates on sale of equipment projects accounted for under the cost incurred input method are recognized as a cumulative adjustment for the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Changes to project revenue and cost estimates unfavorably impacted operating results by approximately $\n85\n in fiscal year 2025, $\n175\n in fiscal year 2024, and $\n115\n in fiscal year 2023.\n97\nTable of Contents\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe tables below present our consolidated sales disaggregated by supply mode for each of our reportable segments.

Refer to Note 4, \nGain on Sale of Business\n, for additional information regarding the sale. \nInterest income from financing and lease arrangements represented approximately \n1\n% of our total consolidated sales in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, and less than \n1\n% in fiscal year 2023.\n \nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAs of 30 September 2025, the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is estimated to be approximately $\n26\n billion. This amount includes fixed-charge contract provisions associated with our on-site and sale of equipment supply modes. We estimate that approximately half of this revenue will be recognized over the next five years and the balance thereafter.\nOur remaining performance obligations do not include (1) expected revenue associated with new on-site plants that are not yet on-stream; (2) consideration associated with contracts that have an expected duration of less than one year; and (3) variable consideration for which we recognize revenue at the amount to which we have the right to invoice, including energy cost pass-through to customers. \nIn the future, actual amounts will differ due to events outside of our control, including, but not limited to, inflationary price escalations; currency exchange rates; and amended, terminated, or renewed contracts. \n98\nTable of Contents\nContract Balances\n \nThe table below details balances arising from contracts with customers:\n30 September\nBalance Sheet Location\n2025\n2024\nAssets\nContract assets – current\nOther receivables and current assets\n$\n152.6\n \n$\n76.2\n \nContract fulfillment costs – current\nOther receivables and current assets\n85.4\n \n103.7\n \nContract assets – noncurrent\nOther noncurrent assets\n82.3\n \n—\n \nContract fulfillment costs – noncurrent\nOther noncurrent assets\n33.8\n \n—\n \nLiabilities\nContract liabilities – current\nPayables and accrued liabilities\n$\n253.4\n \n$\n240.0\n \nContract liabilities – noncurrent\nOther noncurrent liabilities\n283.6\n \n290.0\n \nContract assets and liabilities result from differences in timing of revenue recognition and customer invoicing. These balances are reported on the consolidated balance sheets on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nContract assets primarily relate to our sale of equipment contracts for which revenue is recognized over time. These balances represent unbilled revenue, which occurs when revenue recognized under the measure of progress exceeds the amount invoiced to our customers. Our ability to invoice the customer for contract asset balances is not only based on the passage of time, but also the achievement of certain contractual milestones.\nWe defer contract fulfillment costs for sale of equipment projects that cannot be inventoried due to their custom nature and alignment with specific customer specifications. These costs are expected to be recovered when revenue is recognized, which generally occurs upon transfer of control at project completion. We also defer contract fulfillment costs incurred to enhance on-site supply assets, which are expected to be recovered as performance obligations are satisfied under the corresponding customer agreement.\nCosts to obtain a contract, or \"contract acquisition costs,\" are capitalized at the time we establish a contract with the customer. We elected to apply the practical expedient to expense these costs as they are incurred if the amortization period of the asset that would have otherwise been recognized is one year or less. Our contract acquisition costs capitalized as of 30 September 2025 and 2024 were not material.\n \nContract liabilities include advanced payments or right to consideration prior to performance under the contract and are recognized as revenue when or as we perform. Increases to our contract liabilities primarily relate to new sale of equipment projects as balances associated with our sale of gas contracts are generally related to fixed charges and are relatively consistent period over period. During the fiscal year ended 30 September 2025, we recognized sales of approximately\n \n$\n110\n \nassociated with sale of equipment contracts that were included within our contract liabilities balance as of 30 September 2024. Advanced payments from our customers do not represent a significant financing component as these payments are intended for purposes other than financing, such as to meet working capital demands or to protect us from our customer failing to meet its obligations under the terms of the contract.\n99\nTable of Contents\n8.  \nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\nWe recorded net losses from discontinued operations of $\n8.0\n and $\n13.9\n in fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively, compared to net income from discontinued operations of $\n7.4\n in fiscal year 2023.\nIn fiscal year 2025, a pre-tax loss from discontinued operations of $\n10.6\n was recorded in the third quarter primarily to increase our existing liability for retained environmental remediation obligations related to production facilities in the atmospheric emulsions and global pressure-sensitive adhesives businesses, which were sold in 2008. Refer to the \"Piedmont\" discussion under Note 19, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information. The loss did not impact the statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2025.\nIn fiscal year 2024, a pre-tax loss from discontinued operations of $\n19.4\n was recorded in the fourth quarter to increase our existing liability for retained environmental remediation obligations related to the 2006 sale of the Amines business. Refer to the \"Pace\" discussion under Note 19, \nCommitments and Contingencies\n, for additional information. The loss did not impact the statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2024.\nIn fiscal year 2023, net income from discontinued operations of $\n7.4\n was driven by a net tax benefit recognized during the fourth quarter upon the release of tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions associated with the 2017 sale of the Performance Materials Division. The consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2023 included $\n0.6\n of cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations, resulting from income tax refunds associated with the sale.\n9.  \nINVENTORIES \nThe components of inventories are as follows:\n30 September\n2025\n2024\nFinished goods\n$\n191.9\n \n$\n210.2\n \nWork in process\n42.4\n \n42.2\n \nRaw materials, supplies, and other\n542.2\n \n513.6\n \nInventories\n$\n776.5\n \n$\n766.0\n \n100\nTable of Contents\n10.  \nEQUITY AFFILIATES \n\"Investment in net assets of and advances to equity affiliates\" on our consolidated balance sheets were\n \n$\n5,366.1\n and $\n4,792.5\n as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively. \nAs of 30 September 2025, all of our equity method investments are foreign affiliates.

Refer to Note 6, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n, for additional information. \nDividends and other distributions received from equity affiliates were $\n385.5\n, $\n441.7\n, and $\n344.3\n in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nAs of 30 September 2025 and 2024, the amount of investment in companies accounted for by the equity method included equity method goodwill of $\n34.5\n and $\n38.7\n, respectively.\nSummarized Financial Information\nThe summarized financial information presented below is on a combined 100% basis and has been compiled based on the financial statements of our equity affiliates.\n30 September\n  \n2025\n2024\nCurrent assets\n$\n3,968.5\n \n$\n3,197.2\n \nNoncurrent assets\n16,490.1\n \n14,719.8\n \nCurrent liabilities\n1,441.4\n \n1,138.3\n \nNoncurrent liabilities\n \n12,626.3\n \n11,690.4\n \nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\n2023\nNet sales\n(A)\n$\n5,831.7\n \n$\n5,666.4\n \n$\n5,192.9\n \nGross profit\n2,849.0\n \n2,722.0\n \n2,465.5\n \nOperating income\n2,206.6\n \n2,149.3\n \n1,847.4\n \nNet income\n1,263.6\n \n1,209.5\n \n1,062.9\n \n(A)\nIncludes financing revenue of $\n1,137.3\n, $\n1,128.6\n, and $\n1,011.3\n in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Financing revenue primarily relates to the JIGPC joint venture discussed below.\n101\nTable of Contents\nInvestment in JIGPC\nWe hold a \n55\n% ownership interest in the JIGPC joint venture, of which a \n4\n% interest is attributable to the noncontrolling partner of APQ. We determined JIGPC is a VIE for which we have an equity interest and exercise significant influence but are not the primary beneficiary. Refer to Note 3, \nVariable Interest Entities\n, for additional information.\nOur investment in JIGPC was completed in stages to align with the joint venture’s acquisition of project assets, beginning with an initial investment of $\n1.6\n billion in fiscal year 2022 followed by a $\n908\n investment in fiscal year 2023. The second investment is reflected within \"Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates\" on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2023. These amounts included approximately $\n130\n and $\n73\n received from the noncontrolling partner of APQ for the first and second installments, respectively. \nAs of 30 September 2024, the carrying value of our investment totaled approximately $\n2.9\n billion. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we made a final investment of approximately $\n115\n in the form of a shareholder loan, which the joint venture used to purchase the remaining project assets. The carrying value of our investment totaled approximately $\n3.1\n billion as of 30 September 2025.\nThe carrying value of our investment includes amounts attributable to the noncontrolling partner.\nProject Exit-Related Impairment of Equity Method Investment\nIn fiscal year 2025, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment of a joint venture in China that had been established to develop clean hydrogen infrastructure in the region. As a result, we recorded a charge of $\n6.8\n to write down the full carrying value of the investment. There were no other events or changes in circumstances that indicated the carrying amount of our equity method investments may not be recoverable, and therefore, no further impairment testing was required.\nAdditional information regarding project exit decisions is provided in Note 5, \nBusiness and Asset Actions\n.\n11.  \nPLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET \nThe major classes of plant and equipment are as follows:\n30 September\nUseful life\n2025\n2024\nLand\n$\n343.0\n \n$\n312.1\n \nBuildings\n30\n years\n1,766.1\n \n1,730.7\n \nProduction facilities\n(A)\n10\n-\n20\n years\n21,412.9\n \n21,245.2\n \nDistribution and other machinery and equipment\n(B)\n5\n-\n25\n years\n5,776.0\n \n5,472.7\n \nConstruction in progress\n13,456.8\n \n11,190.2\n \nPlant and equipment, at cost\n$\n42,754.8\n \n$\n39,950.9\n \nLess: Accumulated depreciation\n17,417.0\n \n16,580.0\n \nPlant and equipment, net\n$\n25,337.8\n \n$\n23,370.9\n \n(A)\nDepreciable lives of production facilities related to long-term customer supply contracts are generally matched to the contract lives.\n(B)\nThe depreciable lives for various types of distribution equipment are: \n10\n to \n25\n years for cylinders, depending on the nature and properties of the product; \n20\n years for tanks; generally \n7.5\n years for customer stations; and \n5\n to \n15\n years for tractors and trailers.\nDepreciation expense was $\n1,526.9\n,\n \n$\n1,419.6\n, and $\n1,325.8\n in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\n102\nTable of Contents\n12.  \nGOODWILL \nChanges to the carrying amount of consolidated goodwill by segment are as follows:\nAmericas\nAsia\nEurope\nMiddle East and India\nCorporate and other\nTotal\nGoodwill, net as of 30 September 2023\n$\n146.6\n \n$\n171.9\n \n$\n493.5\n \n$\n15.8\n \n$\n33.9\n \n$\n861.7\n \nCurrency translation and other\n(\n0.3\n)\n2.8\n \n40.8\n \n—\n \n0.1\n \n43.4\n \nGoodwill, net as of 30 September 2024\n$\n146.3\n \n$\n174.7\n \n$\n534.3\n \n$\n15.8\n \n$\n34.0\n \n$\n905.1\n \nAcquisition\n—\n \n—\n \n31.3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n31.3\n \nCurrency translation and other\n(\n2.8\n)\n(\n2.2\n)\n32.3\n \n—\n \n0.2\n \n27.5\n \nGoodwill, net as of 30 September 2025\n$\n143.5\n \n$\n172.5\n \n$\n597.9\n \n$\n15.8\n \n$\n34.2\n \n$\n963.9\n \n30 September\n2025\n2024\n2023\nGoodwill, gross\n$\n1,238.6\n \n$\n1,199.8\n \n$\n1,158.4\n \nAccumulated impairment losses\n(A)\n(\n274.7\n)\n(\n294.7\n)\n(\n296.7\n)\nGoodwill, net\n$\n963.9\n \n$\n905.1\n \n$\n861.7\n \n(A)\nAccumulated impairment losses are attributable to our Latin America reporting unit (\"LASA\") within the Americas segment and include the impact of currency translation.\nWe review goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might not be recoverable. The impairment test for goodwill involves an optional assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If qualitative factors alone are not sufficient to support this conclusion, we perform quantitative testing that involves calculating the fair value of each reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as a goodwill impairment charge, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we conducted our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value.\n103\nTable of Contents\n13.  \nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe table below summarizes the major classes of our intangible assets:\n2025\n2024\n30 September\nGross\nAccumulated\nAmortization/\nImpairment\nNet\nGross\nAccumulated\nAmortization/\nImpairment\nNet\nFinite-lived:\nCustomer relationships\n$\n532.3\n \n($\n318.5\n)\n$\n213.8\n \n$\n524.9\n \n($\n298.2\n)\n$\n226.7\n \nPatents and technology\n31.1\n \n(\n21.0\n)\n10.1\n \n32.9\n \n(\n20.7\n)\n12.2\n \nOther\n64.4\n \n(\n29.9\n)\n34.5\n \n69.3\n \n(\n32.9\n)\n36.4\n \nTotal finite-lived intangible assets\n$\n627.8\n \n($\n369.4\n)\n$\n258.4\n \n$\n627.1\n \n($\n351.8\n)\n$\n275.3\n \nIndefinite-lived:\nTrade names and trademarks\n44.6\n \n(\n9.5\n)\n35.1\n \n46.2\n \n(\n9.9\n)\n36.3\n \nTotal intangible assets\n$\n672.4\n \n($\n378.9\n)\n$\n293.5\n \n$\n673.3\n \n($\n361.7\n)\n$\n311.6\n \nAmortization expense for intangible assets was $\n37.3\n, $\n31.5\n, and $\n32.5\n in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

The impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets involves an optional assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value. If qualitative factors alone are not sufficient to support this conclusion, we perform quantitative testing that involves calculating the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss, not to exceed the total carrying value of the asset. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, we conducted our annual impairment test and concluded that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each indefinite-lived intangible asset was greater than its carrying value.\n104\nTable of Contents\n14.  \nLEASES \nLessee Accounting\nWe are the lessee under various agreements for real estate, vehicles, aircraft, and other equipment that are accounted for as operating leases. Our finance leases principally relate to the right to use machinery and equipment and are not material. \nAmounts associated with operating leases and their presentation on our consolidated balance sheets are as follows:\n30 September\n2025\n2024\nOperating lease right-of-use assets, net\n$\n944.0\n \n$\n1,047.7\n \nOperating lease liabilities\nPayables and accrued liabilities\n91.8\n \n100.3\n \nNoncurrent operating lease liabilities\n616.0\n \n677.9\n \nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$\n707.8\n \n$\n778.2\n \n30 September\n2025\n2024\nWeighted-average remaining lease term in years\n(A)\n20.7\n20.0\nWeighted-average discount rate\n(B)\n2.9\n%\n2.9\n%\n(A)\nCalculated on the basis of the remaining lease term and the lease liability balance for each lease as of the reporting date.\n(B)\nCalculated on the basis of the discount rate used to calculate the lease liability for each lease and the remaining balance of the lease payments for each lease as of the reporting date.\n \nThe following maturity analysis of our operating lease liabilities as of 30 September 2025 presents the undiscounted cash flows for each of the next five years and thereafter with a reconciliation to the lease liability recognized on our balance sheet:\nOperating\nLeases\n2026\n$\n109.0\n \n2027\n72.6\n \n2028\n62.0\n \n2029\n49.9\n \n2030\n48.5\n \nThereafter\n647.9\n \nTotal undiscounted lease payments\n989.9\n \nImputed interest\n(\n282.1\n)\nPresent value of lease liability recognized on balance sheet\n$\n707.8\n \n105\nTable of Contents\nOperating lease expense was $\n124.0\n, $\n122.4\n, and $\n109.9\n for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. These amounts do not include short-term and variable lease expenses, which were not material. The impacts associated with our operating leases on the consolidated statements of cash flows are reflected within \"Other adjustments\" within operating activities. This includes the noncash operating lease expense as well as a use of cash of $\n125.2\n, $\n154.6\n, and $\n337.8\n for payments on amounts included in the measurement of the lease liability for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Payments in fiscal year 2023 included a lump-sum payment of $\n209\n for a land lease associated with the NGHC joint venture. Refer to Note 3, \nVariable Interest Entities\n, for additional information.\nWe recorded noncash right-of-use asset additions of approximately $\n65\n, $\n159\n, and $\n150\n in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nLessor Accounting\nCertain contracts associated with facilities that are built to provide product to a specific customer have been accounted for as containing embedded leases. Refer to Note 1, \nBasis of Presentation and Major Accounting Policies\n, for a description of our accounting policy for arrangements in which we are the lessor. \n\"Lease receivables, net\" relate to sales-type leases on certain on-site assets for which payments are collected over the contract term. \nThe table below details balances associated with our lease receivables:\n30 September\n2025\n2024\nCurrent lease receivables, net\n(A)\n$\n49.4\n \n$\n74.5\n \nNoncurrent lease receivables, net\n307.1\n \n392.1\n \nTotal lease receivables, net\n$\n356.5\n \n$\n466.6\n \n(A)\nPresented within \"Other receivables and current assets\" on our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe majority of our leases are of high credit quality and were originated prior to fiscal year 2017.

Instead, renewal of such contracts requires negotiation of mutually agreed terms by both parties. Unless the customer terminates within the required notice period, the contract will go into evergreen. Given the long-term duration of our contracts, there is \nno\n assumed residual value for the assets at the end of the lease term.\n106\nTable of Contents\n15.  \nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \nCurrency Price Risk Management\nOur earnings, cash flows, and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency-denominated transactions and net investments in foreign operations. It is our policy to seek to minimize our cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. This is accomplished by identifying and evaluating the risk that our cash flows will change in value due to changes in exchange rates and by executing strategies necessary to manage such exposures. Our objective is to maintain economically balanced currency risk management strategies that provide adequate downside protection.\nForward Exchange Contracts\nWe enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce the cash flow exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with highly anticipated cash flows and certain firm commitments, such as the purchase of plant and equipment. We also enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the cash flow exposure on intercompany loans and third-party debt. This portfolio of forward exchange contracts consists primarily of the U.S. Dollar and each of the South Korean Won, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, and Euro. The maximum remaining term of any forward exchange contract currently outstanding and designated as a cash flow hedge at 30 September 2025 is \n2.5\n years.\nForward exchange contracts are also used to hedge the value of investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and affiliates by creating a liability in a currency in which we have a net equity position. The primary currency pair in this portfolio of forward exchange contracts is the U.S. Dollar and Chilean Peso.\nWe also utilize forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges. These contracts are used to economically hedge foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities, primarily working capital. The primary objective of these forward exchange contracts is to protect the value of foreign currency-denominated monetary assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange rates that might occur prior to their receipt or settlement. This portfolio of forward exchange contracts consists of multiple foreign currency pairs, with a profile that changes from time to time depending on our business activity and sourcing decisions.\nThe table below summarizes our outstanding currency price risk management instruments:\n2025\n2024\n30 September\nUS$\nNotional\nYears\nAverage\nMaturity\nUS$\nNotional\nYears\nAverage\nMaturity\nForward Exchange Contracts\nCash flow hedges\n$\n3,625.5\n \n0.6\n$\n4,003.2\n \n0.6\nNet investment hedges\n73.9\n \n0.8\n911.4\n \n2.5\nNot designated\n2,968.6\n \n1.2\n1,880.0\n \n0.3\nTotal Forward Exchange Contracts\n$\n6,668.0\n \n0.9\n$\n6,794.6\n \n0.8\nThe increase in the notional value of forward exchange contracts that are not designated is primarily due to the origination of forward exchange contracts that offset other forward exchange contracts previously designated as net investment hedges that were de-designated during fiscal year 2025.\nWe also use foreign currency-denominated debt to hedge the foreign currency exposures of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. The designated foreign currency-denominated debt and related accrued interest was €\n3,188.1\n million ($\n3,741.5\n) at 30 September 2025 and €\n1,905.7\n million ($\n2,121.9\n) at 30 September 2024. The designated foreign currency-denominated debt is presented on our consolidated balance sheets within \"Long-term debt\" as of 30 September 2025 and \"Long-term debt\" and \"Current portion of long-term debt\" as of 30 September 2024.\n107\nTable of Contents\nDebt Portfolio Management\nIt is our policy to identify, on a continuing basis, the need for debt capital and to evaluate the financial risks inherent in funding the Company with debt capital. Reflecting the result of this ongoing review, we manage our debt portfolio and hedging program with the intent to (1) reduce funding risk with respect to borrowings made by us to preserve our access to debt capital and provide debt capital as required for funding and liquidity purposes, and (2) manage the aggregate interest rate risk and the debt portfolio in accordance with certain debt management parameters.\nInterest Rate Management Contracts\nWe enter into interest rate swaps to change the fixed/variable interest rate mix of our debt portfolio in order to maintain the percentage of fixed- and variable-rate debt within the parameters set by management. In accordance with these parameters, the agreements are used to manage interest rate risks and costs inherent in our debt portfolio. Our interest rate management portfolio generally consists of fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps (which are designated as fair value hedges), pre-issuance interest rate swaps and treasury locks (which hedge the interest rate risk associated with anticipated fixed-rate debt issuances and are designated as cash flow hedges), and floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps (which are designated as cash flow hedges). As of 30 September 2025, the outstanding interest rate swaps were denominated in U.S. Dollars. The notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements is equal to or less than the designated debt being hedged. When interest rate swaps are used to hedge variable-rate debt, the indices of the swaps and the debt to which they are designated are the same. It is our policy not to enter into any interest rate management contracts which lever a move in interest rates on a greater than one-to-one basis.\nCross Currency Interest Rate Swap Contracts\nWe enter into cross currency interest rate swap contracts when our risk management function deems necessary. These contracts may entail both the exchange of fixed- and floating-rate interest payments periodically over the life of the agreement and the exchange of one currency for another currency at inception and at a specified future date. The contracts are used to hedge either certain net investments in foreign operations or non-functional currency cash flows related to intercompany loans. The current cross currency interest rate swap portfolio consists of fixed-to-fixed swaps primarily between the U.S. Dollar and each of the Chinese Renminbi, Chilean Peso, and Indian Rupee.\nThe table below summarizes our \noutstanding interest rate management contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps:\n2025\n2024\n30 September\nUS$\nNotional\nAverage Pay %\nAverage\nReceive\n%\nYears\nAverage\nMaturity\nUS$\nNotional\nAverage Pay %\nAverage\nReceive\n%\nYears\nAverage\nMaturity\nInterest rate swaps (fair value hedge)\n$\n800.0\n \nSOFR\n1.64\n%\n2.0\n$\n800.0\n \nSOFR\n1.64\n%\n3.0\nInterest rate swaps (cash flow hedge)\n(A)\n$\n3,106.0\n \n2.78\n%\nSOFR\n20.1\n$\n2,159.3\n \n2.72\n%\nSOFR\n21.2\nInterest rate swaps (not designated)\n(A)\n$\n269.1\n \n3.28\n%\nSOFR\n20.2\n$\n461.4\n \n3.27\n%\nSOFR\n20.5\nCross currency interest rate swaps (net investment hedge)\n$\n70.3\n \n4.86\n%\n4.53\n%\n0.5\n$\n16.7\n \n5.39\n%\n3.64\n%\n0.2\nCross currency interest rate swaps (cash flow hedge)\n$\n247.7\n \n5.21\n%\n3.12\n%\n1.6\n$\n410.6\n \n4.96\n%\n2.80\n%\n1.9\nCross currency interest rate swaps (not designated)\n$\n—\n \n—\n%\n—\n%\n0.0\n$\n34.7\n \n5.39\n%\n3.64\n%\n0.2\n(A)\nIn May 2023, NGHC entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps designed to hedge long-term variable rate debt facilities available under non-recourse project financing during the construction period of the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project.

If our credit rating falls below this threshold, the counterparty to the derivative instruments has the right to request full collateralization on the derivatives’ net liability position. The net liability position of derivatives with credit risk-related contingent features was $\n43.3\n and $\n47.3\n as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively. Because our current credit rating is above the various pre-established thresholds, \nno\n collateral has been posted on these liability positions.\nCounterparty Credit Risk Management\nWe execute financial derivative transactions with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions, all of which are investment grade at this time. Some of our underlying derivative agreements give us the right to require the institution to post collateral if its credit rating falls below the pre-established thresholds with Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, or Fitch. The collateral that the counterparties would be required to post was $\n174.0\n and $\n57.2\n as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively. No financial institution is required to post collateral at this time, as all have credit ratings at or above threshold.\n112\nTable of Contents\n16.  \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \nFair value is defined as an exit price, or the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\nThe fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows:\n•\nLevel 1\n—Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2\n—Inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through market corroboration, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n•\nLevel 3\n—Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liability based on our own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.\nThe methods and assumptions used to measure the fair value of financial instruments are as follows:\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments primarily include time deposits with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year. We estimated the fair value of our short-term investments, which approximates carrying value as of the balance sheet date, using Level 2 inputs within the fair value hierarchy. Level 2 measurements were based on current interest rates for similar investments with comparable credit risk and time to maturity.\nDerivatives\nThe fair value of our interest rate management contracts and forward exchange contracts are quantified using the income approach and are based on estimates using standard pricing models. These models consider the value of future cash flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value using discount factors that match both the time to maturity and currency of the underlying instruments. These standard pricing models utilize inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as interest rate yield curves as well as currency spot and forward rates; therefore, the fair value of our derivatives is classified as a Level 2 measurement. On an ongoing basis, we randomly test a subset of our valuations against valuations received from the transaction’s counterparty to validate the accuracy of our standard pricing models. Counterparties to these derivative contracts are highly rated financial institutions.\nRefer to Note 15, \nFinancial Instruments\n, for a description of derivative instruments, including details related to the balance sheet line classifications.\n113\nTable of Contents\nLong-term Debt, Including Related Party\nThe fair value of our debt is based on estimates using standard pricing models that consider the value of future cash flows as of the balance sheet date, discounted to a present value using discount factors that match both the time to maturity and currency of the underlying instruments. These standard valuation models utilize observable market data such as interest rate yield curves and currency spot rates; therefore, the fair value of our debt is classified as a Level 2 measurement. \nThe carrying values and fair values of financial instruments were as follows:\n2025\n2024\n30 September\nCarrying Value\nFair Value\nCarrying Value\nFair Value \nAssets\nDerivatives\nForward exchange contracts\n$\n81.3\n \n$\n81.3\n \n$\n100.8\n \n$\n100.8\n \nInterest rate management contracts\n163.1\n \n163.1\n \n41.8\n \n41.8\n \nLiabilities\nDerivatives\nForward exchange contracts\n$\n69.5\n \n$\n69.5\n \n$\n59.2\n \n$\n59.2\n \nInterest rate management contracts\n24.1\n \n24.1\n \n41.4\n \n41.4\n \nLong-term debt, including current portion and related party\n17,663.7\n \n17,348.7\n \n14,144.4\n \n13,897.3\n \nThe carrying amounts reported on the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash items, short-term investments, trade receivables, payables and accrued liabilities, accrued income taxes, and short-term borrowings approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.

These assets include:\n•\nAssets meeting the held for sale criteria that are actively being marketed for sale. We utilized an internally- developed discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value, including costs to sell, as there were no observable market prices available. We expect to complete the sale of these assets in fiscal year 2026.\n•\nPlant and equipment that do not meet the held for sale criteria but are capable of being sold through secondary equipment markets. These assets were evaluated for recoverability and the impairment loss was measured using an orderly liquidation valuation approach. The impairment loss was recognized as the difference between the estimated liquidation value and the net book value of the assets as of 31 March 2025. There have been no significant changes in the estimated net realizable value for the remaining assets as of 30 September 2025.\nThe table below presents the nonrecurring fair value measurements of these long-lived assets, categorized within the fair value hierarchy:\nBalance Sheet Location\nTotal Estimated Value\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nFY25\nImpairment Charges\n(A)\nAssets held for sale\n$\n418.3\n \n$— \n$— \n$\n418.3\n \n$\n350.6\n \nPlant and equipment, net\n22.5\n \n— \n— \n22.5\n \n2,116.2\n \n(A)\nImpairment charges were recorded in aggregate with other project exit-related costs as described in Note 5, \nBusiness and Asset Actions\n.\n115\nTable of Contents\n17.  \nDEBT \nThe table below summarizes our total outstanding debt as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets:\n30 September\n2025\n2024\nShort-term borrowings\n(A)\n$\n34.7\n \n$\n83.5\n \nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n(B)\n716.3\n \n611.4\n \nLong-term debt\n16,769.9\n \n13,428.6\n \nLong-term debt – related party\n177.5\n \n104.4\n \nTotal Debt\n$\n17,698.4\n \n$\n14,227.9\n \n(A)\nShort-term borrowings include bank obligations with weighted average interest rates of \n5.0\n% and \n4.0\n% as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(B)\nCurrent portion of long-term debt includes amounts of $\n59.0\n and $\n200.0\n owed to related parties as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nRelated Party Debt\nAs of 30 September 2025, total debt owed to related parties was $\n236.5\n, consisting of shareholder loans with our joint venture partner, Lu’An Clean Energy Company. As of 30 September 2024, total debt owed to related parties was $\n304.4\n.\nFiscal Year 2025 Registered Public Offerings\nIn February 2025, we issued Euro-denominated senior fixed-rate notes with an aggregate principal amount of €\n1.0\n billion (approximately $\n1.0\n billion) in a registered public offering (the \"February 2025 Offering\"). The related proceeds were reduced by deferred financing charges and discounts of approximately $\n8\n. In June 2025, we issued U.S. Dollar- and Euro-denominated senior fixed-rate notes with aggregate principal amounts of $\n1.1\n billion and €\n500\n million (approximately $\n570\n), respectively, in registered public offerings (the \"June 2025 Offerings\"). The related proceeds were reduced by deferred financing charges and discounts of approximately $\n12\n. Deferred financing charges and discounts are amortized through interest expense over the life of the underlying bonds.\nWe used the net proceeds from the February 2025 Offering to repay commercial paper obligations, including those incurred prior to the closing of the February 2025 Offering that were used to repay €\n300\n million (approximately $\n311\n) aggregate principal amount outstanding of our \n1.000\n% Euro-denominated senior fixed-rate notes at maturity, plus accrued interest, and for general corporate purposes. We used the net proceeds from the June 2025 Offerings to repay commercial paper obligations and for general corporate purposes.\n116\nTable of Contents\nSummary of Long-Term Debt Instruments\nThe table below summarizes the coupon interest rates, fiscal year maturities, and carrying amounts of our long-term debt, including current portion and amounts owed to related parties.

As of 30 September 2025, we were in compliance with all the financial and other covenants under our debt agreements.\nCommitted Credit Facilities\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we refinanced our existing \n364\n-day $\n500\n revolving credit agreement to extend its maturity date from 27 March 2025 to 26 March 2026 (the “364-Day Credit Agreement”). All other terms remain consistent with the original 364-Day Credit Agreement. Fees incurred in connection with the refinancing were not material. \nWe also maintain a \nfive-year\n $\n3.0\n billion revolving credit agreement that matures on 31 March 2029 (the “Five-Year Credit Agreement”). Both the \n364\n-Day Credit Agreement and the Five-Year Credit Agreement are syndicated committed facilities that provide a source of liquidity and support our commercial paper program through the availability of senior unsecured debt to us and certain of our subsidiaries. \nNo\n borrowings were outstanding under either of the 364-Day Credit Agreement or the Five-Year Credit Agreement as of 30 September 2025 or 30 September 2024.\nSeparately, certain of our foreign subsidiaries maintain access to committed credit facilities. As of 30 September 2025, the amount available under foreign committed credit facilities totaled $\n394.0\n, all of which was borrowed and outstanding. \nAs of 30 September 2024, these facilities had a combined maximum borrowing capacity of $\n1.2\n billion, of which $\n1.1\n billion was borrowed and outstanding. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2025, we \nderecognized long-term borrowings from two Saudi Riyal-denominated facilities upon deconsolidation of BHIG. These borrowings had been drawn from a \n7.35\n% variable-rate facility and a \n2.00\n% fixed-rate facility, which had carrying values of $\n451.1\n and $\n222.2\n as of 30 September 2024, respectively. As further discussed in Note 6, \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n, we continue to have exposure to BHIG's borrowings through our equity method investment in the entity.\n118\nTable of Contents\n18.  \nRETIREMENT BENEFITS \nWe and certain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans that cover a substantial portion of our worldwide employees. The principal defined benefit pension plans are the U.S. salaried pension plan and the U.K. pension plan. These plans were closed to new participants in 2005, after which defined contribution plans were offered to new employees. The principal defined contribution plan is the Retirement Savings Plan, in which a substantial portion of the U.S. employees participate. A similar plan is offered to U.K. employees. We also provide other postretirement benefits consisting primarily of healthcare benefits to U.S. retirees who meet age and service requirements.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nPension benefits earned are generally based on years of service and compensation during active employment. \nThe components of net periodic cost for our defined benefit pension plans for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 were as follows:\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\n2023\nU.S.\nInter-\nnational\nTotal\nU.S.\nInter-\nnational\nTotal\nU.S.\nInter-\nnational\nTotal\nService cost\n$\n9.1\n \n$\n11.6\n \n$\n20.7\n \n$\n9.6\n \n$\n11.3\n \n$\n20.9\n \n$\n10.9\n \n$\n12.3\n \n$\n23.2\n \nNon-service cost (benefit):\nInterest cost\n119.5\n \n57.0\n \n176.5\n \n134.9\n \n60.0\n \n194.9\n \n129.9\n \n59.9\n \n189.8\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n132.6\n)\n(\n60.0\n)\n(\n192.6\n)\n(\n120.1\n)\n(\n47.3\n)\n(\n167.4\n)\n(\n127.1\n)\n(\n49.2\n)\n(\n176.3\n)\nPrior service cost amortization\n1.1\n \n1.0\n \n2.1\n \n1.1\n \n0.9\n \n2.0\n \n1.2\n \n0.7\n \n1.9\n \nActuarial loss amortization\n46.8\n \n9.7\n \n56.5\n \n57.3\n \n12.9\n \n70.2\n \n59.7\n \n11.6\n \n71.3\n \nSettlements\n0.8\n \n0.5\n \n1.3\n \n1.1\n \n1.2\n \n2.3\n \n1.4\n \n0.6\n \n2.0\n \nCurtailments\n1.2\n \n—\n \n1.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1.9\n)\n(\n1.9\n)\nOther\n—\n \n0.3\n \n0.3\n \n—\n \n0.9\n \n0.9\n \n—\n \n0.9\n \n0.9\n \nNet Periodic Cost\n$\n45.9\n \n$\n20.1\n \n$\n66.0\n \n$\n83.9\n \n$\n39.9\n \n$\n123.8\n \n$\n76.0\n \n$\n34.9\n \n$\n110.9\n \nOur service costs are primarily included within \"Cost of sales\" and \"Selling and administrative expense\" on our consolidated income statements.

De-risking strategies are also employed for closed plans as funding improves, generally resulting in higher allocations to long duration bonds. The plans invest primarily in actively and passively managed equity, debt, and real estate securities and funds. Equity investments are diversified geographically and by investment style and market capitalization. Fixed income portfolios may include investment grade and high yield investments in sovereign, corporate, emerging market debt, asset-backed securities, distressed and convertible debt, loans, and private credit instruments generally denominated in the currency of the plan. The U.S. and U.K. plans' investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives to manage interest and inflation exposure. \nAsset allocation targets are established based on the long-term return, volatility and correlation characteristics of the asset classes, the profiles of the plans’ liabilities, and acceptable levels of risk. As of 30 September 2025, the U.S. and international pension plans were within the allowable target allocation ranges. We continue to monitor the investment portfolios and various investment markets and will take action accordingly. Assets are routinely rebalanced through contributions, benefit payments, and otherwise as deemed appropriate. \nThe actual and target allocations at the measurement date are as follows:\n2025 Target Allocation\n2025 Actual Allocation\n2024 Actual Allocation\nU.S.\nInternational\nU.S.\nInternational\nU.S.\nInternational\nAsset Category\nEquity securities\n15\n - \n25\n%\n5\n - \n22\n%\n16\n%\n14\n%\n20\n%\n14\n%\nFixed income securities\n60\n - \n74\n%\n70\n - \n87\n%\n72\n%\n77\n%\n73\n%\n78\n%\nReal estate\n5\n - \n8\n%\n—\n%\n5\n%\n—\n%\n6\n%\n—\n%\nAlternative credit\n5\n - \n8\n% \n4\n - \n12\n%\n6\n%\n9\n%\n—\n%\n8\n%\nCash\n—\n%\n—\n%\n1\n%\n—\n%\n1\n%\n—\n%\nTotal\n100\n%\n100\n%\n100\n%\n100\n%\nIn fiscal year 2025, the \n5.8\n% expected return for U.S. plan assets was based on a weighted average of estimated long-term returns of major asset classes.

U.S. plan fixed income investments primarily include U.S. corporate bonds, U.S. treasury investments, interest rate swaps, total return swaps, and U.S. treasury future contracts.\nFixed Income Pooled Funds \nFixed income pooled funds may hold government bonds, index linked bonds, corporate bonds, cash, and derivative instruments. The fixed income pooled funds are classified as Level 2 assets since the NAV of these assets is based on quoted market pricing from observable pricing sources or valued based upon comparable securities with similar yields, credit ratings, or factors as of the reporting date.\nAlternative Credit Pooled Funds\nAlternative credit pooled funds may hold high yield bonds, emerging market debt, loans, structured credit, distressed and convertible debt, private credit, and other instruments. Due to the limited market activity of the underlying securities, the NAV of these assets is based on the fund manager's estimate of the fair value of the shares held as of the reporting date. Alternative credit pooled funds are classified as either Level 3 assets or measured using the NAV per share practical expedient, based on how frequently the NAV is determined and how much advance notice is required for redemption.\nOther Pooled Funds\nOther pooled funds are classified as Level 2 assets, as they are valued at the NAV of the shares held at year end, which is based on the fair value of the underlying investments. \nInsurance Contracts\nInsurance contracts are classified as Level 3 assets, as they are carried at contract value, which approximates the estimated fair value. The estimated fair value is based on the fair value of the underlying investment of the insurance company and discount rates that require inputs with limited observability. \n124\nTable of Contents\nContributions and Projected Benefit Payments\nPension contributions to funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans for fiscal year 2025 were $\n29.9\n. Contributions for funded plans resulted primarily from contractual and regulatory requirements. Benefit payments to unfunded plans were due primarily to the timing of retirements. We anticipate contributing $\n25\n to $\n35\n to the defined benefit pension plans in fiscal year 2026. These contributions are anticipated to be driven primarily by contractual and regulatory requirements for funded plans and benefit payments for unfunded plans, which are dependent upon timing of retirements.  \nProjected benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are as follows:\nU.S.\nInternational\n2026\n$\n189.2\n \n$\n69.5\n \n2027\n185.6\n \n74.4\n \n2028\n188.2\n \n74.7\n \n2029\n190.4\n \n76.7\n \n2030\n191.8\n \n80.3\n \n2031-2035\n950.6\n \n433.8\n \nThese estimated benefit payments are based on assumptions about future events. Actual benefit payments may vary significantly from these estimates.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe maintain a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (\"ESOP\") which forms part of the Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (\"RSP\"). The ESOP was established in May of 2002. The balance of the RSP is a qualified defined contribution plan including a 401(k) elective deferral component. A substantial portion of U.S. employees are eligible and participate.\nWe treat dividends paid on ESOP shares as ordinary dividends. Under existing tax law, we may deduct dividends which are paid with respect to shares held by the plan. Shares of our common stock in the ESOP totaled \n1,501,888\n as of 30 September 2025.\nOur contributions to the RSP include a Company core contribution for certain eligible employees who do not receive their primary retirement benefit from the defined benefit pension plans, with the core contribution based on a percentage of pay that is dependent on years of service. For the RSP, we also make matching contributions on overall employee contributions as a percentage of the employee contribution and include an enhanced contribution for certain eligible employees that do not participate in the defined benefit pension plans. Worldwide contributions expensed to income in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 were $\n81.0\n, $\n82.6\n, and $\n71.5\n, respectively.\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nWe provide other postretirement benefits consisting primarily of healthcare benefits to certain U.S. retirees who meet age and service requirements. The healthcare benefit is a continued medical benefit until the retiree reaches age 65. Healthcare benefits are contributory, with contributions adjusted periodically. The retiree medical costs are capped at a specified dollar amount, with the retiree contributing the remainder. The cost of these benefits was not material in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023. Accumulated postretirement benefit obligations as of the end of fiscal years 2025 and 2024 were $\n8.3\n and $\n12.0\n, respectively, of which $\n3.3\n and $\n3.1\n were current obligations, respectively.\nWe recognize changes in other postretirement benefit plan obligations in other comprehensive income on a pretax basis. During fiscal years 2025 and 2024 we recognized a loss of $\n2.8\n and $\n1.7\n, respectively, that arose during the period, and $\n0.4\n and $\n0.5\n of net actuarial gain amortization, respectively.\nThe net actuarial (gain) loss recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss on a pre-tax basis was $\n3.0\n and ($\n0.2\n) as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n125\nTable of Contents\n19.  \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \nLitigation\nWe are involved in various legal proceedings, including commercial, competition, environmental, intellectual property, regulatory, product liability, and insurance matters. We do not currently believe there are any legal proceedings for which it is reasonably possible, individually or in the aggregate, to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nIn September 2010, the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense (\"CADE\") issued a decision against our Brazilian subsidiary, Air Products Brasil Ltda., and several other Brazilian industrial gas companies for alleged anticompetitive activities. CADE imposed a civil fine of R$\n179.2\n million (approximately $\n34\n as of 30 September 2025) on Air Products Brasil Ltda., which was based on a percentage of our total revenue in Brazil in 2003. In May 2014, our appeal was granted and the fine was dismissed. CADE appealed that ruling and in October 2025 the Supreme Court of Brazil rendered a judgment confirming the appellate ruling, which annulled the administrative proceeding and the fine imposed by CADE. Under applicable law, no further remedies are available and the judgment is final.\nEnvironmental\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in legal proceedings under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA,\" the federal Superfund law), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\"RCRA\"), and similar state and foreign environmental laws relating to the designation of certain sites for investigation or remediation. Presently, there are \n26\n sites on which a final settlement or remediation has not been achieved where we, usually along with others, have been designated as a potentially responsible party by environmental authorities or are otherwise engaged in investigation or remediation, including cleanup activity at certain of our former and current manufacturing sites. We continually monitor these sites for which we have environmental exposure.\nAccruals for environmental loss contingencies are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. As of 30 September 2025 and 2024, the consolidated balance sheets included accruals of $\n85.6\n and $\n79.1\n, respectively, primarily as part of \nother noncurrent liabilities\n. These environmental liabilities will be paid over a peri\nod of up to \n30\n years. W\ne estimate the exposure for environmental loss contingencies to range from $\n85\n to a reasonably possible upper exposure of $\n98\n as of 30 September 2025.\nActual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates, given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures. Using reasonably possible alternative assumptions of the exposure level could result in an increase to the environmental accrual. Due to these inherent uncertainties, a significant increase to the reasonably possible upper exposure level could occur if a new site is designated, the scope of remediation is increased, a different remediation alternative is identified, or a significant increase in our proportionate share occurs. We do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with environmental matters in excess of the amounts recorded or disclosed above would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations in any one year.\n126\nTable of Contents\nPace\nAs of 30 September 2025, $\n53.8\n of the environmental accrual was related to our facility in Pace, Florida.\nIn 2006, we sold our Amines business, which included operations at the Pace facility and recognized a liability for retained environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at the facility. We are required by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (\"FDEP\") and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\"USEPA\") to continue our remediation efforts. We recognized a before-tax expense of $\n42\n in fiscal year 2006 in results from discontinued operations and recorded an environmental accrual of $\n42\n in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the first quarter of 2015, we entered into a consent order with the FDEP requiring us to continue our remediation efforts at the Pace facility and complete a cost review every \nfive years\n. In fiscal year 2020, we completed an updated cost review of the environmental remediation status at the Pace facility and increased our environmental accrual for this site by $\n19\n in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheet and recognized a before-tax expense of $\n19\n in results from discontinued operations. In fiscal year 2024, we completed our most recent cost review of the environmental remediation status at the Pace facility. Based on our review, we expect ongoing activities to continue for \n30\n years. Additionally, we increased our estimate of near-term spending for an optimized groundwater recovery system and future annual costs due to higher inflation. As a result of these changes, we increased our environmental accrual for this site by $\n19\n in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized a before-tax expense of $\n19\n in results from discontinued operations in fiscal year 2024. There have been no significant changes to the estimated exposure.\nWe have implemented many of the remedial corrective measures at the Pace facility required under the 1995 consent orders issued by the FDEP and the USEPA. Contaminated soils have been bioremediated, and the treated soils have been secured in a lined on-site corrective action management unit. Several groundwater recovery systems have been installed to contain and remove contamination from groundwater. We completed an extensive assessment of the site to determine the efficacy of existing measures, what additional corrective measures may be needed, and whether newer remediation technologies that were not available in the 1990s might be better suited for groundwater remediation. Based on assessment results, we completed a focused feasibility study that identified alternative approaches that may more effectively remove contaminants. We continue to review alternative remedial approaches with the FDEP, and we completed additional field work during 2021 to support the design of an improved groundwater recovery network. This network targets areas of higher contaminant concentration and avoids areas of high groundwater iron which has proven to be a significant operability issue for the project. The design of the optimized recovery system was completed in fiscal year 2024, with construction expected to begin in fiscal year 2026. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, we completed an updated cost review which resulted in a change in assumptions regarding future operating costs as discussed above. \nPiedmont\n \nAs of 30 September 2025, $\n9.8\n of the environmental accrual was related to a production facility site in Piedmont, South Carolina.\nOn 30 June 2008, we sold our Elkton, Maryland, and Piedmont, South Carolina, production facilities and the related North American atmospheric emulsions and global pressure sensitive adhesives businesses. In connection with the sale, we recognized a liability for retained environmental obligations associated with remediation activities at the Piedmont site. This site is under active remediation for contamination caused by an insolvent prior owner.\nWe are required by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (\"SCDHEC\") to address both contaminated soil and groundwater. Numerous areas of soil contamination have been addressed, and contaminated groundwater is being recovered and treated. The SCDHEC issued its final approval to the site-wide feasibility study on 13 June 2017 and the Record of Decision for the site on 27 June 2018, after which we signed a Consent Agreement Amendment memorializing our obligations to complete the cleanup of the site.\n127\nTable of Contents\nRemediation has started in accordance with the design, which includes in-situ chemical oxidation treatment, as well as soil vapor extraction to remove volatile organic compounds from the unsaturated soils beneath the impacted areas of the plant. We estimate that source area remediation and groundwater recovery and treatment will continue through 2033. Thereafter, we currently expect this site to go into a state of monitored natural attenuation through 2038. We recognized a before-tax expense of $\n24\n in 2008 as a component of income from discontinued operations and recorded an environmental liability of $\n24\n in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets. \nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we completed an updated cost review of the environmental remediation status at Piedmont. Based on our review, we increased our estimate of remaining costs due to the extended period of time that will be required to complete the remediation along with higher annual costs due to inflation. As a result of these changes, we increased the environmental accrual for this site by $\n9\n in continuing operations on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized a before-tax expense of $\n9\n in results from discontinued operations. \nPasadena\nAs of 30 September 2025, $\n9.9\n of the environmental accrual was related to a production facility site in Pasadena, Texas.\nDuring fiscal year 2012, management committed to permanently shutting down our polyurethane intermediates (\"PUI\") production facility in Pasadena, Texas. In shutting down and dismantling the facility, we have undertaken certain obligations related to soil and groundwater contaminants. We have been pumping and treating groundwater to control off-site contaminant migration in compliance with regulatory requirements and under the approval of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (\"TCEQ\"). We estimate that the pump and treat system will continue to operate until 2042. \nWe continue to perform additional work to address other environmental obligations at the site. This additional work includes remediating impacted soils as required, investigating groundwater west of the former PUI facility, cleaning production wells, continuing post closure care for \ntwo\n closed RCRA surface impoundment units, and maintaining engineering controls. Additionally, we have conducted an interim corrective action to treat impacted soils as recommended in the TCEQ 2019 Annual Report. We are currently in the process of renewing the site's RCRA permit. In 2012, we estimated the total exposure at this site to be $\n13\n. There have been no significant changes to the estimated exposure.\n128\nTable of Contents\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nOur asset retirement obligations are primarily associated with long-term on-site supply contracts under which we have built a facility on land owned by the customer and are obligated to remove the facility at the end of the contract term. The retirement of assets includes the contractually required removal of a long-lived asset from service and encompasses the sale, removal, abandonment, recycling, or disposal of the assets as required at the end of the contract term. These obligations are primarily reflected within \"Other noncurrent liabilities\" on the consolidated balance sheets. The timing and/or method of settlement of these obligations are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within our control.\nChanges to the carrying amount of our asset retirement obligations were as follows:\n30 September 2023\n$\n297.3\n \nAdditional accruals\n33.3\n \nLiabilities settled\n(\n13.7\n)\nAccretion expense\n12.0\n \nCurrency translation adjustment\n5.8\n \n30 September 2024\n$\n334.7\n \nAdditional accruals\n(A)\n87.5\n \nLiabilities settled\n(\n11.7\n)\nAccretion expense\n13.0\n \nCurrency translation adjustment\n(\n1.6\n)\nReclass to liabilities held for sale\n(\n15.7\n)\n30 September 2025\n$\n406.2\n \n(A)\nPrimarily relates to project exits discussed in Note 5, \nBusiness and Asset Actions\n.\nWarranties and Guarantees\nWe do not expect that any sum we may have to pay in connection with warranties and guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations.\nWarranties\nWe, in the normal course of business operations, have issued product warranties related to equipment sales. Also, contracts often contain standard terms and conditions which typically include a warranty and indemnification to the buyer that the goods and services purchased do not infringe on third-party intellectual property rights. The provision for estimated future costs relating to warranties is not material to the consolidated financial statements.\nGuarantees\nTo date, \nno\n payments have been made under the guarantees discussed below.\nWe issued performance guarantees as a condition of project financing associated with the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project that would require us to pay up to approximately $\n0.8\n billion in the event of nonperformance in our role as EPC contractor. Our exposure will decline over time before expiring in November 2028. Refer to Note 3, \nVariable Interest Entities,\n for additional information regarding the project.\nWe also have a long-term sale of equipment contract with the JIGPC joint venture to engineer, procure, and construct the industrial gas facilities that will supply gases to Aramco. We provided bank guarantees to the joint venture to support our performance under the contract. As of 30 September 2025, our maximum potential payments were $\n244.5\n.\n129\nTable of Contents\nUnconditional Purchase Obligations\nWe are obligated to make future payments under unconditional purchase obligations as summarized below:\n2026\n$\n4,446\n \n2027\n779\n \n2028\n608\n \n2029\n634\n \n2030\n621\n \nThereafter\n3,380\n \nTotal\n$\n10,468\n \nApproximately $\n4.0\n billion of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to open purchase orders for plant and equipment, of which approximately $\n1\n billion relates to the NEOM Green Hydrogen Project. Although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to reschedule, cancel, or otherwise modify based on our business needs. We have estimated the timing of these payments in the table above; however, timing of actual satisfaction of the obligations may vary.\nApproximately $\n5.0\n billion of our unconditional purchase obligations relate to helium. The majority of these obligations occur after fiscal year 2030. Helium purchases include crude feedstock supply to helium refining plants in North America as well as refined helium purchases from sources around the world. As a rare byproduct of natural gas production in the energy sector, these helium sourcing agreements are medium- to long-term and contain take-if-tendered provisions. The refined helium is distributed globally and sold as a merchant gas, primarily under medium-term requirements contracts. While contract terms in our helium sourcing contracts are generally longer than our customer sales contracts, helium is a rare gas used in applications with few or no substitutions because of its unique physical and chemical properties. \nOur unconditional purchase obligations also include commitments for power and natural gas supply as well as feedstock supply for numerous HyCO (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas) facilities. Our long-term sales contracts to customers are generally matched to the term of these obligations and provide recovery of price increases. As a result, we do not believe these purchase obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\n20.  \nCAPITAL STOCK  \nCommon Stock\nAuthorized common stock consists of \n300\n million shares with a par value of $\n1\n per share. As of 30 September 2025, \n249\n million shares were issued, with \n223\n million issued and outstanding.\nOn 15 September 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $\n1.0\n billion of our outstanding common stock. This program does not have a stated expiration date. If we repurchase shares pursuant to this authorization, we may do so under Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act through repurchase agreements established with one or more brokers. We have not purchased any of our outstanding shares under this program since fiscal year 2013. As of 30 September 2025, $\n485.3\n in share repurchase authorization remained available.\nA summary of the changes in common shares issued and outstanding in fiscal year 2025 is presented below:\nFiscal Year Ended 30 September\n2025\n2024\n2023\nNumber of common shares, beginning of year\n222,372,418\n \n222,199,845\n \n221,838,696\n \nIssuance of treasury shares for stock option and award plans\n215,838\n \n172,573\n \n361,149\n \nNumber of common shares, end of year\n222,588,256\n \n222,372,418\n \n222,199,845\n \nPreferred Stock\nAuthorized preferred stock consisted of \n25\n million shares with a par value of $\n1\n per share. There were \nno\n preferred shares issued or outstanding as of 30 September 2025 and 2024.\n130\nTable of Contents\n21.  \nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION \nOur outstanding share-based compensation program includes market-based and time-based deferred stock units. We issue shares from treasury stock upon the payout of deferred stock units and the exercise of stock options. As of 30 September 2025, there were \n0.9\n million shares available for future grant under our Long-Term Incentive Plan (\"LTIP\"), which is shareholder approved.\nShare-based compensation cost recognized on the consolidated income statements is summarized below:\n2025\n2024\n2023\nBefore-tax share-based compensation cost\n(A)\n$\n76.6\n \n$\n61.7\n \n$\n60.7\n \nIncome tax benefit\n(\n18.3\n)\n(\n14.9\n)\n(\n14.6\n)\nAfter-tax share-based compensation cost\n$\n58.3\n \n$\n46.8\n \n$\n46.1\n \n(A)\nFiscal year 2025 includes noncash executive separation costs of $\n22.4\n to accelerate vesting of share-based awards. Refer to the \"Shareholder Activism-Related Costs\" disclosure in Note 25, \nSupplemental Information\n, for additional information.\nBefore-tax share-based compensation cost is primarily included in \"Selling and administrative expense\" on our consolidated income statements. The amount of share-based compensation cost capitalized in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 was not material.\nDeferred Stock Units\nWe have granted deferred stock units to executives, selected employees, and outside directors. These deferred stock units entitle the recipient to one share of common stock upon vesting, which is conditioned, for employee recipients, on continued employment during the deferral period and may be conditioned on achieving certain performance targets. We grant deferred stock unit awards with a \ntwo\n- to \nfive-year\n deferral period that are subject to payout upon death, disability, or retirement. Deferred stock units issued to outside directors are paid after their service on the Board of Directors ends at the time elected by the director (not to exceed \nten years\n after service ends). We generally expense the grant-date fair value of awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period; however, expense recognition is accelerated for retirement eligible individuals who meet the requirements for vesting upon retirement. We have elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, rather than to estimate them. Forfeitures have not been significant historically.\nMarket-based deferred stock units vest as long as the employee continues to be employed by the Company and upon the achievement of the performance target. The performance target, which is approved by the Compensation Committee, is our share price appreciation and dividends paid, or \"total shareholder return,\" in relation to the S&P 500 Index over a \nthree-year\n performance period beginning 1 October of the fiscal year of grant. We granted \n95,490\n, \n102,120\n, and \n85,612\n market-based deferred stock units in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nThe fair value of market-based deferred stock units was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model as these equity awards are tied to a market condition. The model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying the market condition stipulated in the grant and calculates the fair value of the awards. We generally expense the grant-date fair value of these awards on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The estimated grant-date fair value of market-based deferred stock units was $\n470.13\n, $\n302.10\n, and $\n502.03\n per unit in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. \nThe calculation of the fair value of market-based deferred stock units used the following assumptions:\n2025\n2024\n2023\nExpected volatility\n30.3\n%\n25.0\n%\n32.5\n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.1\n%\n4.3\n%\n4.0\n%\nExpected dividend yield\n2.1\n%\n2.6\n%\n2.4\n%\nIn addition, in fiscal year 2025, we granted \n143,059\n time-based deferred stock units at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $\n328.54\n. In fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we granted \n146,947\n and \n119,954\n time-based deferred stock units at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $\n270.86\n and $\n308.91\n, respectively.\n131\nTable of Contents\nA summary of deferred stock unit activity in fiscal year 2025 is presented below:\nShares (000)\nWeighted Average\nGrant-Date Fair Value\nDeferred stock units outstanding at 30 September 2024\n758\n \n$\n293.99\n \nGranted\n239\n \n385.22\n \nPaid out\n(\n314\n)\n288.02\n \nForfeited\n(\n50\n)\n321.37\n \nDeferred stock units outstanding at 30 September 2025\n633\n \n$\n329.23\n \nCash payments made for deferred stock units totaled $\n4.6\n, $\n2.7\n, and $\n3.6\n in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. As of 30 September 2025, there was $\n68.5\n of unrecognized compensation cost related to deferred stock units. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.7\n years. The total fair value of deferred stock units paid out during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, including shares vested in prior periods, was $\n94.5\n, $\n24.1\n, and $\n45.3\n, respectively.\nStock Options\nWe have not issued stock option awards since fiscal year 2015. These awards generally vested incrementally over three years and remained exercisable for ten years from the date of grant. All stock options have now been exercised, and \nno\n intrinsic value remains as of 30 September 2025.\nA summary of stock option activity in fiscal year 2025 is presented below:\nShares (000)\nWeighted Average\nExercise Price\nStock options outstanding and exercisable at 30 September 2024\n54\n \n$\n134.54\n \nExercised\n(\n54\n)\n134.54\n \nStock options outstanding and exercisable at 30 September 2025\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nThe intrinsic value of stock options exercised during fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 was $\n10.5\n, $\n35.1\n, and $\n53.5\n, respectively.\nCash received from option exercises during fiscal year 2025 was $\n1.1\n.

Income tax payments for fiscal year 2024 include cash paid to purchase $\n50.0\n of transferable tax credits that were used to offset estimated tax payments in 2024. \nU.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nOn 22 December 2017, the United States enacted the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act” or \"Tax Reform\"), which significantly changed existing U.S. tax laws, including a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to \n21\n%, a deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings, as well as other changes. As of 30 September 2025, our outstanding liability for the deemed repatriation tax was $\n60.8\n which will be paid in our second quarter of fiscal year 2026. \n135\nTable of Contents\nEffective Tax Rate\nThe effective tax rate equals the income tax provision divided by income from continuing operations before taxes. \nA reconciliation of the differences between the United States federal statutory tax rate and the effective tax rate is provided below:\n(Percent of income before taxes)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nU.S. federal statutory tax rate\n21.0\n%\n21.0\n%\n21.0\n%\nState taxes, net of federal benefit\n16.1\n1.5\n1.0\nIncome from equity affiliates\n26.6\n(\n2.4\n)\n(\n3.8\n)\nForeign tax differentials\n5.6\n0.3\n0.7\nTax on foreign repatriated earnings\n—\n—\n0.5\nBusiness and asset actions\n(\n49.0\n)\n—\n0.7\nOther\n1.1\n(\n0.8\n)\n(\n1.0\n)\nEffective Tax Rate\n21.4\n%\n19.6\n%\n19.1\n%\nIn fiscal year 2025, our effective tax rate was influenced by pre-tax charges of approximately $\n3.7\n billion related to our decision to exit various projects and other cost reduction measures. These charges, which primarily related to our U.S. operations, resulted in an overall loss from continuing operations before taxes in fiscal year 2025. The related net tax benefit of these actions totaled $\n695.2\n, which includes an $\n11.3\n cost for reserves established for uncertain tax positions related to the deductibility of certain costs in foreign subsidiaries. We also recorded a net tax cost of $\n197.4\n resulting from a $\n364.9\n increase in our valuation allowance net of $\n167.5\n of deferred tax assets related to the future disposal of certain foreign subsidiaries.\nThe approximately $\n3.7\n billion of business and asset actions inflated the presentation of regular, recurring effective tax rate reconciling items. The sale of our LNG business in the prior year resulted in a gain of approximately $\n1.6\n billion. This gain diluted the impact of recurring effective tax rate reconciling items for fiscal year 2024. \nPre-tax charges for business and asset actions in fiscal year 2023 totaled $\n244.6\n. These charges included certain losses for which we could not recognize an income tax benefit and were subject to a valuation allowance of $\n36.0\n. Partially offsetting the valuation allowance cost was a $\n15.9\n income tax benefit from a tax election related to a non-U.S. subsidiary. Fiscal year 2024 includes business and asset actions recorded at applicable statutory income tax rates. \nThe reconciling item for \"State taxes, net of federal benefit\" in fiscal year 2025 reflects the net state tax benefit recorded on our overall U.S. loss for the year. \nShareholder Activism-Related Costs\nIn fiscal year 2025, we incurred costs of $\n86.3\n related to a proxy contest led by an activist shareholder as further discussed in Note 25, \nSupplemental Information\n. The related net tax benefit recorded in fiscal year 2025 was $\n14.6\n. Tax costs related to non-deductible amounts are included within \"Business and asset actions\" in our effective tax rate reconciliation. \nTax on Repatriation of Foreign Earnings\n\"Tax on foreign repatriated earnings\" includes costs related to U.S. taxation of foreign operations (net of foreign tax credits) and foreign taxation on the repatriation of foreign earnings. Our fiscal year 2025 includes an income tax expense of $\n31.4\n recorded in our second quarter related to withholding taxes on foreign earnings that we no longer intend to indefinitely reinvest. There were no other changes to our assumptions regarding the reinvestment of foreign earnings during fiscal year 2025. Our fiscal year 2025 also includes a net income tax benefit of $\n34.9\n related to our intent to file a refund claim after a review of several U.S. Tax Court cases regarding the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition year of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (our fiscal year 2018). While we were not a party to these cases, the opinions resulted in a change to our intent to pursue a refund claim. The $\n34.9\n income tax benefit is net of a $\n67.8\n reserve for an uncertain tax position related to the calculation of the refund amount.\nIncome from Equity Affiliates\nEquity affiliates’ income, which is primarily presented net of income taxes on our consolidated income statements, favorably impacts our effective tax rate. See Note 10, \nEquity Affiliates\n, for additional information.\n136\nTable of Contents\nForeign Tax Differentials\n\"Foreign tax differentials\" represent the differences between foreign earnings subject to foreign tax rates that are different than the U.S. federal statutory rate and include tax holidays, credits, and other incentives. Our income tax holidays relate to operations in jurisdictions that provide reduced income tax rates for certain qualifying activities and are conditioned upon us satisfying certain requirements. These holidays are effective through fiscal years 2030 and 2033, and may be extended. The impact of these tax holidays decreased foreign taxes by $\n30.3\n, $\n25.7\n, and $\n24.8\n for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The benefit of the tax holidays on net income per share was $\n0.14\n, $\n0.12\n, and $\n0.11\n per diluted share for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nFiscal year 2025 includes an overall net benefit for foreign tax differentials primarily due to business and asset actions that reduced our overall earnings in foreign jurisdictions with higher tax rates.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\n30 September\n2025\n2024\nGross Deferred Tax Assets\nBasis difference in foreign subsidiaries\n$\n182.3\n \n$\n—\n \nRevenue recognition\n148.5\n \n100.3\n \nTax loss carryforwards\n137.5\n \n132.2\n \nReserves and accruals\n115.6\n \n83.1\n \nCurrency losses\n60.3\n \n12.6\n \nRetirement benefits and compensation accruals\n59.2\n \n62.5\n \nTax credits and other tax carryforwards\n49.9\n \n45.5\n \nOther\n76.2\n \n44.6\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n506.3\n)\n(\n158.4\n)\nDeferred Tax Assets\n$\n323.2\n \n$\n322.4\n \nGross Deferred Tax Liabilities\nPlant and equipment\n$\n623.5\n \n$\n1,205.8\n \nUnremitted earnings of foreign entities\n125.4\n \n103.4\n \nPartnership and other investments\n18.1\n \n19.2\n \nIntangible assets\n5.2\n \n17.3\n \nOther\n2.7\n \n8.8\n \nDeferred Tax Liabilities\n$\n774.9\n \n$\n1,354.5\n \nNet Deferred Income Tax Liability\n$\n451.7\n \n$\n1,032.1\n \n137\nTable of Contents\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are included within the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\n2025\n2024\nDeferred Tax Assets\nOther noncurrent assets\n$\n127.9\n \n$\n127.8\n \nDeferred Tax Liabilities\nDeferred income taxes\n579.6\n \n1,159.9\n \nNet Deferred Income Tax Liability\n$\n451.7\n \n$\n1,032.1\n \nDeferred tax assets for \"Revenue recognition\" were impacted by increases in revenue recognized for income tax purposes in advance of GAAP. The deferred tax assets for \"Reserves and accruals\" were impacted by changes in tax deferred deductions, including business and asset actions, which impacted our accounts receivable and severance accruals. The deferred tax assets for \"Basis difference in foreign subsidiaries\" were the result of recognizing assets related to our tax investment basis in excess of U.S. GAAP for certain foreign subsidiaries where we have moved the corresponding assets and liabilities to held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet. Deferred tax assets for \"Currency losses\" changed primarily due to movements in unrealized foreign currency losses for income tax purposes.\nDeferred tax liabilities related to \"Plant and equipment\" decreased primarily due to the impact of business and asset action charges recorded during the current fiscal year. \"Unremitted earnings of foreign entities\" increased primarily due to accruals for future foreign withholding taxes upon earnings' repatriation. \nA significant portion of the $\n3.7\n billion business and asset actions charges were not recognized in the current year for income tax purposes and resulted in a significant reduction in our net deferred tax liabilities. The majority of these deferred deductions impacted plant and equipment within the United States. We believe it is more likely than not that future earnings and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to recognize the benefit of these deductions in the future. \nAs of 30 September \n2025\n, we had the following deferred tax assets for certain tax credits:\nJurisdiction\nGross Tax Asset\nExpiration Period\nU.S. State\n$\n1.8\n \n2028 - 2039\nU.S. Federal\n27.6\n \n2030 - 2034\nCredits in Foreign Jurisdictions\n16.2\n \nIndefinite\nAll of our $\n16.2\n credits in foreign jurisdictions have indefinite carryforward periods.\nAs of 30 September 2025, we had the following loss carryforwards:\nJurisdiction\nGross Loss Carryforward\nExpiration Period\nU.S. State Net Operating Loss\n$\n207.2\n \n2027 - 2045\nForeign Net Operating Loss\n371.1\n \n2026 - 2035; Indefinite\nForeign Capital Loss\n208.4\n \nIndefinite\nOf the $\n371.1\n of foreign net operating loss carryforwards, $\n202.8\n have indefinite carryforward periods. \nThe valuation allowance was $\n506.3\n and $\n158.4\n as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively. As of 30 September 2025, the balance primarily related to deferred tax assets of $\n392.0\n, including those established from foreign business and asset actions, $\n55.3\n related to foreign capital losses, $\n44.6\n of foreign loss carryforwards and credits, and $\n10.8\n of U.S. federal foreign income tax credits. If events warrant the reversal of the valuation allowance, it would result in a reduction of tax expense. We believe it is more likely than not that future earnings and reversal of deferred tax liabilities will be sufficient to utilize our deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowance, as of 30 September 2025.\n138\nTable of Contents\nWe record income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures unless those earnings are indefinitely reinvested. Such earnings may be subject to foreign withholding and other taxes. The cumulative undistributed earnings that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures are included in retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheets and amounted to $\n9.8\n billion as of 30 September 2025. An estimated $\n923.1\n in additional foreign withholding and other income taxes would be due if these earnings were remitted as dividends.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, which excludes interest and penalties, is as follows:\n2025\n2024\n2023\nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at beginning of year\n$\n101.0\n \n$\n96.5\n \n$\n103.5\n \nAdditions for tax positions of the current year\n21.2\n \n14.6\n \n10.9\n \nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n92.6\n \n1.4\n \n1.2\n \nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n(\n0.6\n)\n(\n0.3\n)\n(\n6.0\n)\nSettlements\n—\n \n(\n3.7\n)\n(\n3.9\n)\nStatute of limitations expiration\n(\n20.0\n)\n(\n9.9\n)\n(\n10.6\n)\nForeign currency translation\n0.6\n \n2.4\n \n1.4\n \nUnrecognized tax benefits balance at end of year\n$\n194.8\n \n$\n101.0\n \n$\n96.5\n \nOf our unrecognized tax benefits as of 30 September 2025, $\n150.5\n would impact the effective tax rate from continuing operations if recognized. \nIn fiscal year 2025 we recorded a $\n67.8\n reserve related to our intent to file a refund claim after a review of several U.S. Tax Court cases regarding the U.S. taxation of deemed foreign dividends in the transition year of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We also recorded a total of $\n11.3\n in reserves for uncertain tax positions related to the deductibility of business and asset actions incurred in foreign subsidiaries. \nInterest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded as a component of income tax expense and totaled ($\n0.2\n), $\n1.8\n, and $\n5.0\n in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, and include benefits when reserves are released, typically due to the expiration of various statutes of limitation. Our accrued balance for interest and penalties was $\n27.8\n and $\n28.5\n as of 30 September 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n139\nTable of Contents\nIncome Tax Examinations\nWe are currently under examination in a number of tax jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that a change in our unrecognized tax benefits may occur in fiscal year 2026 if any of these examinations are resolved during the next twelve months. However, quantification of an estimated range cannot be made as of the date of this report. \nWe generally remain subject to examination in the following major tax jurisdictions for the years indicated below:\nMajor Tax Jurisdiction\nOpen Tax Years\nNorth America\nUnited States – Federal\n2022\n - \n2025\nUnited States – State\n2015\n - \n2025\nCanada\n2018\n - \n2025\nEurope\nFrance\n2022\n - \n2025\nNetherlands\n2020\n - \n2025\nSpain\n2017\n - \n2025\nUnited Kingdom\n2021\n - \n2025\nMiddle East\nSaudi Arabia\n2020\n - \n2025\nAsia\nChina\n2011\n - \n2025\nSouth Korea\n2015\n - \n2025\nTaiwan\n2020\n - \n2025\nLatin America\nChile\n2020\n - \n2025\n140\nTable of Contents\n25.  \nSUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION \nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have related party sales to some of our equity affiliates and joint venture partners as well as other income primarily from fees charged for use of Air Products' patents and technology. Sales to and other income from related parties totaled approximately $\n355\n, $\n350\n, and $\n380\n in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Sales agreements with related parties include terms that are consistent with those that we believe would have been negotiated at an arm’s length with an independent party. As of 30 September 2025 and 2024, our consolidated balance sheets included related party trade receivables of approximately\n \n$\n105\n \nand $\n120\n, respectively.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2025, we reimbursed $\n24.7\n to Mantle Ridge LP and certain of its affiliated entities (collectively, “Mantle Ridge”) for costs they incurred in connection with the proxy contest that concluded in January 2025. Refer to “Shareholder Activism-Related Costs” below for additional information.\nRefer to Note 17, \nDebt\n, for information concerning debt owed to related parties.\nShareholder Activism-Related Costs\nOur consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2025 includes shareholder activism-related costs totaling $\n86.3\n ($\n71.7\n after tax) recorded in connection with a proxy contest that concluded in January 2025 following certification of the election of directors at the 2025 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.\nOf the total, $\n31.9\n was incurred directly by Air Products for legal and other professional service fees and proxy solicitation expenses, primarily during the first quarter. An additional $\n29.7\n was recorded due to the departure of our former chief executive officer following the Board of Directors’ appointment of a new chief executive officer. These separation costs included a noncash expense of $\n22.4\n to accelerate vesting of share-based awards and $\n7.3\n in severance and other cash benefits paid during the second quarter. The remaining $\n24.7\n relates to a cash reimbursement paid to Mantle Ridge, an investor in Air Products, who nominated three of the nine directors elected in 2025, including Paul C. Hilal, Mantle Ridge’s founder and chief executive officer.\nThe Board of Directors voted to authorize the cash reimbursement during the third quarter, with Mr. Hilal abstaining from the vote. Reimbursed costs included those incurred by Mantle Ridge for legal counsel, proxy engagement services, governance advisors, communication expenses, and other out-of-pocket costs related to its engagement with Air Products. The Board members who voted on this matter unanimously concluded that these expenses were incurred in the interest of enhancing long-term value for all shareholders and that the election of three of Mantle Ridge’s nominees reflected strong shareholder support for Mantle Ridge’s engagement. Accordingly, the Board determined that such expenses should be shared pro rata among all shareholders.\n141\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental Balance Sheet Information\nOther Receivables and Current Assets\n30 September\n2025\n2024\nDerivative instruments\n$\n81.6\n \n$\n93.9\n \nValue added tax receivable\n243.4\n \n195.9\n \nContract fulfillment costs\n85.4\n \n103.7\n \nContract assets\n152.6\n \n76.2\n \nCurrent lease receivables\n49.4\n \n74.5\n \nOther\n77.1\n \n66.6\n \nOther receivables and current assets\n$\n689.5\n \n$\n610.8\n \nOther Noncurrent Assets\n30 September\n2025\n2024\nPension benefits\n$\n210.9\n \n$\n200.0\n \nDerivative instruments\n162.8\n \n48.7\n \nDeferred tax assets\n127.9\n \n127.8\n \nPrepaid tax\n100.4\n \n41.0\n \nContract assets\n82.3\n \n—\n \nContract fulfillment costs\n33.8\n \n—\n \nInvestments other than equity method\n17.4\n \n67.1\n \nDeferred financing fees\n3.8\n \n4.6\n \nWorld Energy deferred project costs\n(A)\n—\n \n329.4\n \nOther\n282.0\n \n352.9\n \nOther noncurrent assets\n$\n1,021.3\n \n$\n1,171.5\n \n(A)\nPrior year balance includes assets that were subsequently written off in fiscal year 2025 as part of our exit from the sustainable aviation fuel expansion project with World Energy.

The accounting policies applied to our reportable segments are consistent with those used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Our reportable segments are as follows:\n•\nAmericas;\n•\nAsia;\n•\nEurope;\n•\nMiddle East and India; and\n•\nCorporate and other\nThe Americas, Asia, Europe, and Middle East and India segments represent the operations of our regional industrial gases business. Each of these segments qualifies as an individual operating segment and does not reflect the aggregation of multiple operating segments. Corporate and other consists of two operating segments that meet the aggregation criteria under GAAP. All segments also include our share of results from several equity method joint ventures, the largest of which operate in Algeria, China, India, Italy, Mexico, and Saudi Arabia.\nOur CODM, who is our Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the performance of our reportable segments through segment operating income. This measure is reviewed regularly in internal management reports and serves as a key metric to monitor actual results against forecasts and prior periods. Segment operating income informs decisions related to resource allocation, including capital investments and employees, and supports strategic planning and long-term project development.\nSegment operating income does not include gains or losses that we do not consider to be indicative of our underlying business performance, such as charges related to business or asset actions. \nRegional Industrial Gases\nThe industrial gases business in the regional segments produces and sells gases to diversified customers in dozens of industries, including those in refining, chemicals, metals, electronics, manufacturing, medical, and food. Our industrial gas portfolio includes atmospheric gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, and argon; process gases such as hydrogen, helium, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, and syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide), and specialty gases. We offer our industrial gas products through either the on-site gases supply mode or the merchant gases supply mode, both of which are described in Note 7, \nRevenue Recognition\n.\nThis business also develops, builds, and operates equipment for the production or processing of gases. Electricity is the largest cost component in the production of atmospheric gases. To produce hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas, steam methane reformers use natural gas as the primary raw material, while gasifiers use liquid and solid hydrocarbons. We mitigate electricity, natural gas, and hydrocarbon price fluctuations contractually through pricing formulas, surcharges, cost pass-through provisions, and tolling arrangements.\nEach of the regional industrial gases segments competes against global industrial gas companies as well as regional competitors. Competition in industrial gases is based primarily on price, reliability of supply, and the development of industrial gas applications. We derive a competitive advantage in locations where we have pipeline networks, which enable us to provide a reliable and economic supply of products to our larger customers.\n144\nTable of Contents\nCorporate and other\nThe Corporate and other segment includes sales of cryogenic and gas processing equipment for air separation that is sold worldwide to customers in a variety of industries, including chemical and petrochemical manufacturing, oil and gas recovery and processing, and steel and primary metals processing. Our Corporate and other segment also includes the results of our turbo machinery and distribution sale of equipment businesses. Competition for our sale of equipment businesses is based primarily on plant efficiency and technological performance, service, technical know-how, and price, as well as schedule and plant performance guarantees.\nOur Corporate and other segment also incurs costs to provide corporate support functions and global management activities that benefit all segments.
