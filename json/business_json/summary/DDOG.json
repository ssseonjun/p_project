  "item1_summary": " It is difficult for us to forecast our future results of operations . If the assumptions that we use to plan our business are incorrect, our stock price could be volatile, and it may be difficult to achieve and maintain profitability . You should not rely on our revenue for any prior quarterly or annual periods as any indication of our future revenue or revenue growth .\n We are not certain whether or when we will obtain a high enough volume of sales to sustain or increase our growth or maintain profitability in the future . We expect our costs and expenses to increase in future periods, which could negatively affect our future results of operations if our revenue does not increase . If we are unable to sustain profitability, the value of our business and Class A common stock may significantly decrease .\n Our ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth . Our revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance . We have encountered, and will continue to encounter, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries .\n Additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us, if at all . If we incur additional debt, the debt holders would have rights senior to holders of common stock to make claims on our assets . We cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing, or nature of any future issuances of debt or equity securities . Our future success depends on our ability to sell additional subscriptions and products to existing customers .\n In order for us to maintain or improve our results of operations, it is important that our customers renew or expand their subscriptions with us . These factors may be exacerbated by unfavorable conditions in the economy, see “Risks Associated with our Growth—Unfavorable conditions in our industry or the global economy, or reductions in information technology spending, could limit our ability to grow .\n Many enterprises have invested substantial personnel and financial resources to integrate traditional on-premise architectures into their businesses . Adoption of SaaS business software may be slower in industries with heightened data security interests or business practices requiring highly-customizable application software . As our market matures, our products evolve, and competitors introduce lower cost or differentiated products that are perceived to compete with our platform and products .\n Failure to effectively develop and expand our sales and marketing capabilities could harm our ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products . We plan to continue expanding our direct sales force, both domestically and internationally . We may not achieve anticipated revenue growth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, integrate and retain talented and effective sales personnel .\n Security breaches or unauthorized access to our platform and products could result in the acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to sensitive information . We may be subject to significant litigation, indemnity obligations, fines, penalties, disputes, investigations and other liabilities . We have previously and may in the future become the target of cyber-attacks by third parties .\n We use third-party technology, systems and services in a variety of contexts, including cloud infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, credit card processing and other functions . Cyber-attacks, computer malware, viruses, employee mistakes or malfeasance, social engineering and social engineering have become more prevalent in our industry, particularly against cloud services .\n There can be no assurance that any security measures that we or the third-parties with whom we work have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats . Any security breach or other security incident could result in a loss of customer confidence in the security of our platform and damage to our brand, the company says .\n We do not directly control content that our customers store in our products . We employ a shared responsibility model where our customers are responsible for using, configuring, and otherwise implementing security measures related to our platform, services, and products . Even if we are not the cause of a resulting customer security issue or incident, our customer relationships, reputation, and business may be adversely impacted . We also process, store and transmit our own data as part of our business and operations .\n We take steps designed to detect, mitigate, and remediate vulnerabilities in our information systems . We may not, however, detect all such vulnerabilities on a timely basis . Among other things, our applications, systems, networks, software, other computer assets and physical facilities could be breached or could otherwise malfunction or fail, or sensitive information that we store could be otherwise compromised .\n A security breach could lead to claims by our customers, or other relevant stakeholders, that we have failed to comply with such legal or contractual obligations . As a result, we could be subject to legal action or our customers could end their relationships with us . The costs to respond to a security breach and/or mitigate any security vulnerabilities that may be identified could be significant, our efforts to address these problems may not be successful .\n The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations . Our software is complex and therefore, undetected errors, failures or bugs have occurred in the past and may occur in the future .\n Despite testing by us, real or perceived errors, failures or bugs may not be found until our customers use our software . Our systems could also be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in acquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies . In such an event, we may be required to expend significant additional resources in order to help correct the problem .\n It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times and as our products and platform capabilities become more complex and our user traffic increases . We may experience a loss of customers, lost or delayed market acceptance of our platform and products, delays in payment to us by customers, injury to our reputation and brand, legal claims against us, and diversion of our resources .\n Any failure of or delay in these efforts could result in impaired system performance and reduced system performance . Failure in optimizing third-party services as we scale could negatively impact our gross margins . We cannot be sure that improvements to our infrastructure will be effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all, and such failures could harm our financial condition .\n Any limitation on capacity of our third-party hosting services could impede our ability to onboard new customers or expand the usage of existing customers . Cyber-attacks, natural disasters, fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failures, outbreaks of contagious diseases, terrorist or other attacks, and other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect our cloud-based products .\n If these strategies fail to be successful, it will be difficult to project future results . The company is offering free trials and a free tier of its products to encourage people to use the platform . The results of the free trial may be affected by a number of factors, such as the cost of the service . The free trial will be required to be completed by the end of the month .\n ude the following: The company's ability to attract new customers and retain existing customers . The company’s ability to control costs, including its operating expenses, is at risk of acquisition, acquisition and integration . The cloud-provider marketplaces are at risk from the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East, the company says .\n Some of these factors may have adverse consequences on us or the third parties on whom we rely . Increased inflation rates can increase our costs, including personnel costs, may increase our risk of losing our business . The company is concerned about the impact of these changes to its business model and its ability to continue to work with customers .\n Historically, we have experienced seasonality in new customer bookings, as we typically enter into a higher percentage of subscription agreements with new customers and renewals with existing customers in the fourth quarter of the year . Downturns or upturns in our sales may not be immediately reflected in our financial position and results of operations .\n We target enterprise customers, and sales to these customers involve risks that may not be present or that are present to a lesser extent with sales to smaller entities . Sales to large customers involve longer sales cycles, more complex customer requirements, substantial upfront sales costs, and less predictability in completing some of our sales . Large enterprise customers often begin to deploy our products on a limited basis, but nevertheless demand configuration, integration services and pricing negotiations .\n Our success and future growth depend largely upon the continued services of our executive officers . We also are dependent on the continued service of our existing software engineers because of the complexity of our products and platform capabilities . Our executive officers and other key employees are employed on an at-will basis, which means that these personnel could terminate their employment with us at any time .\n Datadog: If we fail to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to expand our customer base will be impaired and our business, financial condition and results of operations may suffer . We believe the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market increases . Successfully maintaining and enhancing our brand will depend largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts .\n We believe our culture has been a key contributor to our success to date . Failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel, which is critical to our growth . As we continue to grow and expand globally, we may find it difficult to maintain these important aspects of our culture . If we fail to offer high-quality support, our reputation could suffer .\n Acquisitions, strategic investments, partnerships, or alliances could be difficult to identify, pose integration challenges, divert the attention of management, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, and adversely affect our business . We may encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products and platform capabilities, personnel internal controls or operations of any acquired companies .\n The market in which we compete is relatively new and subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, and changing regulations, as well as changing customer needs, requirements and preferences . The success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to adapt and respond effectively to these changes on a timely basis . We may not be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or business opportunities .\n The success of our platform depends, in part, on its ability to be deployed in a self-service installation process . We currently offer more than 850 out-of-the-box integrations to assist customers in deploying Datadog, and we need to continuously modify and enhance our products to adapt to changes and innovation in existing and new technologies .\n The markets in which we participate are competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed . With respect to cloud monitoring, we compete with native solutions from cloud providers such as AWS, GCP and Microsoft Azure . An increasing number of sales through cloud provider marketplaces could reduce the number of customers with whom we have direct commercial relationships .\n Many of our competitors and potential competitors have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer relationships and installed custom solutions . As we look to market and sell our products and platform capabilities to potential customers with existing internal solutions, we must convince their internal stakeholders that our products are superior to their current solutions . We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including the ability to provide unified, real-time observability of IT environments .\n It is difficult to predict customer adoption rates and demand for our products, the future growth rate and size of the cloud-based software and SaaS business software markets . The expansion of these markets depends on a number of factors, including: the cost, performance, and perceived value associated with cloud . The market for our solutions may develop more slowly or differently than we expect .\n If cloud-based software and SaaS providers experience security incidents, loss of customer data, disruptions in delivery or other similar problems, the market for these applications as a whole, including our platform and products, may be negatively affected . Our competitors may more successfully incorporate AI into their products and achieve higher market acceptance of their AI solutions, which could impair our ability to compete .\n We may also encounter new risks, challenges, and unintended consequences as a result of our use of AI . The issue of intellectual property ownership and license rights surrounding AI technologies has not been fully addressed by U.S. courts or federal or state laws and regulations . Compliance with regulations as well as social and ethical standards relating to AI may require significant research and development costs .\n If we fail to meet contractual commitments, we could be obligated to provide credits for future service . We could also face subscription termination with refunds of prepaid amounts . Any service-level failures could also damage our reputation, which could also affect our revenue and financial condition . We may also be liable for losses suffered or incurred as a result of infringement, misappropriation or other .\n Large indemnity payments could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations . Although we attempt to contractually limit our liability with respect to such indemnity obligations, we are not always successful and may still incur substantial liability . We may be required to cease use of certain functions of our platform or products as a result of any such claims .\n We have legal, contractual and other applicable obligations regarding the protection and appropriate use of sensitive information that we and the third-parties with whom we work process . We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws, directives, regulations, and industry standards . The regulatory framework for and users' expectations around privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving .\n European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom have significantly restricted the transfer of personal data to the United States . Other countries outside of Europe have enacted or are considering enacting similar cross-border data transfer restrictions and laws requiring local data residency, and strict limitations to the processing of personal information . These laws could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services and operating our business .\n Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to suspend or permanently cease certain transfers out of Europe for allegedly violating the GDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations . European legislative proposals and present laws and regulations apply to cookies and similar tracking technologies, electronic communications, and marketing . Inability to import personal information from other jurisdictions to the United States may significantly and negatively impact our business operations .\n We may be required to change the way we market our products, which would impair our ability to reach new or existing customers . Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, customers, data subjects or others . We may also experience difficulty retaining or obtaining new European or multi-national customers due to the legal requirements, compliance cost and potential risk exposure .\n In the United States, laws governing data privacy and security include those promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission Act . Laws in all 50 states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach . States are constantly amending existing laws, requiring attention to frequently changing legal requirements .\n Changes to the CCPA could impact our business activities depending on how they are interpreted . Many other states have enacted or proposed comprehensive privacy laws, which either have gone into effect or are expected to go into effect over the next several years . Plaintiffs have become increasingly more active in bringing privacy-related claims against companies, including class claims and mass arbitration demands .\n Privacy and data security concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our products . Failure by us, our third-party service providers or other parties with whom we do business to comply with our policies or other documentation could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, private parties or others . We are or may also be subject to the terms of our external and internal privacy and security policies .\n We are subject to anti-corruption, anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities . Non-compliance with such laws can harm our business, financial condition and results of operations . We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners and agents .\n We cannot assure you that all of our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of our policies and applicable law . Noncompliance with anti-corruption, anti-bribery, or anti-money laundering laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, enforcement actions, fines, damages, other civil or criminal penalties or injunctions .\n Selling to such entities can be highly competitive, expensive, and time-consuming, often requiring significant upfront time and expense without any assurance that these efforts will generate a sale . Government contracting requirements may change which may restrict our ability to sell into the government sector . Government demand and payment for our products are affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations .\n Our activities are subject to U.S. economic sanctions laws and regulations that prohibit the shipment of most products and services to embargoed jurisdictions or sanctioned parties without the required export authorizations . Obtaining the necessary export license or other authorization for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities .\n Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would adversely affect our business, results of operations, and growth prospects . Any future litigation against us could be costly and time-consuming to defend . Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims .\n Any of our current or future ESG practices and initiatives, if any, could be difficult to achieve and costly to implement . New legal and regulatory ESG requirements and disclosures in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere may lead to significant compliance costs, may heighten scrutiny of our practices . Our processes and controls may not comply with evolving standards for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG metrics .\n A successful assertion by one or more states requiring us to collect taxes where we presently do so could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest . The imposition by state governments of sales tax collection obligations on out-of-state sellers could also create additional administrative burdens for us, put us at a competitive disadvantage, and decrease our future sales .\n Under current law, U.S. federal NOLs incurred in taxable years after December 31, 2017, can be carried forward indefinitely . The deductibility of such NOLS in a particular taxable year is limited to 80% of taxable income in such year . There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOL, may expire or otherwise be unavailable .\n The company's effective tax rate or tax liability could change due to several factors, including changes in tax laws, tax treaties, and regulations . The OECD's Pillar Two model rules introduced a global minimum tax of 15% . There is no material impact on our financial statements for the tax period ending December 31, 2024 .\n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes . Significant estimates and judgments involve revenue recognition, business combinations, and internal-use software development costs . Any of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations .\n Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary technology, know-how and our brand . We rely on a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, patents, copyrights, and other intellectual property laws and confidentiality procedures to establish and protect our proprietary rights .\n Despite our pending patent applications, there can be no assurance that our patent applications will result in issued patents . Even if we continue to seek patent protection in the future, we may be unable to obtain or maintain patent protection for our technology . Patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret protections may not be available to us in every country in which our products are available .\n The value of our intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of our trademarks or trademarks that are similar to our trademarks . We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction . In some cases, litigation or other actions may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights .\n We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that has or may have had access to our proprietary information, know-how and trade secrets . No assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to, distribution, use, misuse, misappropriation, reverse engineering or disclosure of our secrets .\n Software industry is characterized by a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual and proprietary rights . Lawsuits are time-consuming and expensive to resolve and they divert management’s time and attention . Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims against their use .\n We do not currently have a large patent portfolio, which could prevent us from deterring patent infringement claims through our own patent portfolio . Our competitors and others may now and in the future have significantly larger and more mature patent portfolios than we have . We cannot predict the outcome of lawsuits and cannot ensure that the results of any such actions will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations .\n We expect that the occurrence of infringement claims is likely to grow as the market for our platform and products grows . Few of the licenses applicable to open source software have been interpreted by courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions on our ability to commercialize our products .\n We could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software . Litigation could be costly for us to defend, have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our products . If we  fail to comply with these licenses, we could be required to incur significant legal expenses defending against such allegations .\n A component of our growth strategy involves the further expansion of our operations and customer base internationally . Some open source projects have known vulnerabilities and architectural instabilities . If we inappropriately use or incorporate open source software subject to certain types of open source licenses that challenge the proprietary nature of our products, we may be required to re-engineer such products, discontinue the sale of such products or take other remedial actions .\n We expect that our international activities will continue to grow for the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in existing and new international markets . The company's current and future international business and operations involve a variety of risks, including:. The need to adapt and localize our products for specific countries, and the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits, and compliance programs that are specific to each jurisdiction .\n We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rate fluctuations and the resulting effect on our revenue and expenses, and the cost and risk of entering into hedging transactions if we chose to do so in the future . The company is exposed to political instability, terrorist activities and military conflict, including the war in Ukraine and conflicts in the Middle East . It is also exposed to tax burdens and foreign exchange controls that could make it difficult to repatriate earnings .\n A strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our products and platform capabilities to our customers outside of the United States, which could adversely affect our results of operations . An increasing amount of our operating expenses are incurred outside the US and are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates .\n The market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and may fluctuate or decline substantially as a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control . Our financial statements could fail to reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency . We could be required to pay additional taxes, interest, and penalties, which could result in higher effective tax rates .\n The dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with holders of our Class B common stock, including our executive officers, directors and their affiliates . Technology stocks have historically experienced high levels of volatility . In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been subject to securities class action litigation .\n Certain index providers have in the past imposed restrictions on including companies with multiple class share structures in certain of their indexes . Future transfers by holders of our Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for tax or estate planning purposes .\n The shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent such options are exercised, subject to compliance with applicable securities laws . We expect to continue to grant equity awards to employees, directors and consultants under our equity incentive plans . We are unable to predict the timing of or the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A . stock .\n The market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline . We do not have control over the way analysts interpret our financial information and other disclosures . If our financial results fail to meet, or significantly exceed, our announced guidance or the expectations of analysts or public investors, analysts could downgrade our ClassA common stock or publish unfavorable research on us .\n We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock . We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future . Holders of our Class A common stock may need to rely on sales of their holdings after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment .\n Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations . Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management . Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control could also restrict our future access to the capital markets .\n Restated bylaws include provisions that may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management . Because we are incorporated in Delaware, Delaware, these provisions may also be difficult for stockholders of our current board of directors to replace members of our board of . directors, which is responsible for appointing members of . our management .\n Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any “interested” stockholder for a period of three years . Any of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A common stock, and deter potential acquirers of our company .\n Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act . We may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to make payments on our significant debt when due, and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future .\n Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures . If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive .\n Holders of 2025 Notes are entitled to convert the 2025 Notes during the first quarter of 2025 . If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify the outstanding principal of the applicable series of Notes as a current rather than long-term liability . The capped call transactions may affect the value of the Notes and the market price of our Class A common stock .\n The potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the market price of our Class A common stock or the trading price of the Notes will depend in part on market conditions and cannot be ascertained at this time . The option counterparties to the capped call transactions are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that any or all of them might default .\n Past global economic conditions have resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions . If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings . An increase in our exposure will be correlated with an increase in the market price and in the volatility of our Class A common stock .\n We have established an incident response plan that addresses our response to cybersecurity incidents, and we require periodic training for employees on cybersecurity threats . We also deploy technical safeguards that are designed to protect our platform and systems from cybersecurity threats, including firewalls, intrusion prevention, and detection systems . In addition, we maintain cybersecurity insurance, however, the costs related to cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be fully insured .\n Our internal audit function conducts annual interviews across business groups to identify key areas of risk, including cybersecurity risk . Our Chief Information Security Officer also reports separately to our Audit Committee on cyber and information security risk on a quarterly basis . There is no guarantee that these measures and processes will be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us ."
