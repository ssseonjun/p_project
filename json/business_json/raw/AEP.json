Parent financial statements should be read in conjunction with the AEP consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto.  For purposes of these condensed financial statements, AEP wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries are recorded based upon its proportionate share of the subsidiaries’ net assets (similar to presenting them on the equity method).\nIncome Taxes\nParent files a consolidated federal income tax return with its subsidiaries.  The benefit of current tax loss of the parent company (Parent Company Loss Benefit) to the AEP System subsidiaries is accounted for as an allocation through equity.  The consolidated NOL of the AEP System is allocated to each company in the consolidated group with taxable loss.  With the exception of the allocation of the consolidated AEP System NOL, Parent Company Loss Benefit and general business tax credits, the method of allocation reflects a separate return result for each company in the consolidated group.\n2. \n \nCOMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES\nParent and its subsidiaries are parties to environmental and other legal matters.

AEPTCo Parent financial statements should be read in conjunction with the AEPTCo consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto.  For purposes of these condensed financial statements, AEPTCo wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries are recorded based upon its proportionate share of the subsidiaries’ net assets (similar to presenting them on the equity method).\nIncome Taxes\nAEPTCo Parent joins in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return with its affiliates in the AEP System.  The benefit of current tax loss of the parent company (Parent Company Loss Benefit) to the AEP System subsidiaries is accounted for as an allocation through equity.  The consolidated NOL of the AEP System is allocated to each company in the consolidated group with taxable loss.  With the exception of the allocation of the consolidated AEP System NOL, Parent Company Loss Benefit and general business tax credits, the method of allocation reflects a separate return result for each company in the consolidated group.\nNoncontrolling Interest in OHTCo and IMTCo \nIn January 2025, AEP announced a partnership between nonaffiliated entities to acquire a \n19.9\n% noncontrolling interest in OHTCo and IMTCo for $\n2.82\n billion.  The transaction is subject to FERC approval and clearance from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.  In December 2024, Midwest Transmission Holdings, LCC was formed as a consolidated joint venture by AEPTCo Parent in anticipation of the transaction being finalized in the second half of 2025.  AEPTCo Parent recorded Notes Receivable – Affiliated of $\n2.82\n billion as of December 31, 2024 in relation to Midwest Transmission Holdings, LLC.  See Note 4 - Related Party Transactions for additional information.      \n2.  \nCOMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES\nAEPTCo Parent and its subsidiaries are parties to legal matters.  For further discussion, see Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies.\n3. \n \nFINANCING ACTIVITIES\nFor discussion of Financing Activities, see Note 15 - Financing Activities to AEPTCo’s audited consolidated financial statements.\n4.  \nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nPayments on Behalf of Subsidiaries\nDue to occasional time sensitivity and complexity of payments, Parent makes certain insurance, tax and other payments on behalf of subsidiary companies.  Parent is then fully reimbursed by the subsidiary companies.  AEPTCo Parent also makes convenience payments on behalf of its State Transcos.  AEPTCo Parent is then fully reimbursed by its State Transcos.\nLong-term Lending to Subsidiaries\nAEPTCo Parent enters into debt arrangements with nonaffiliated entities.  AEPTCo Parent has long-term debt of $\n5.8\n billion and $\n5.4\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  AEPTCo Parent uses the proceeds from these nonaffiliated debt arrangements to make affiliated loans to its State Transcos using the same interest rates and maturity dates as the nonaffiliated debt arrangements.  AEPTCo Parent has recorded Notes Receivable – Affiliated of $\n8.6\n billion and $\n5.4\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  Related to these nonaffiliated and affiliated debt arrangements, AEPTCo Parent has recorded Accrued Interest of $\n45\n million and $\n40\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  AEPTCo Parent has also recorded Accounts Receivable – Affiliated Companies of $\n62\n million and $\n44\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  AEPTCo Parent has recorded Interest Income – Affiliated of $\n238\n million, $\n215\n million and $\n177\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the Notes Receivable – Affiliated.  AEPTCo \nS-15\nParent has recorded Interest Expense of $\n238\n million, $\n215\n million and $\n177\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to the nonaffiliated debt arrangements.\nShort-term Lending to Subsidiaries\nParent uses a commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of subsidiaries.  The program is used to fund both a Utility Money Pool, which funds the utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain nonutility subsidiaries.  In addition, the program also funds, as direct borrowers, the short-term debt requirements of other subsidiaries that are not participants in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons.  The program also allows some direct borrowers to invest excess cash with Parent.\nInterest expense related to AEPTCo Parent’s short-term borrowing is included in Interest Expense on AEPTCo Parent’s statements of income.  AEPTCo Parent incurred immaterial interest expense for amounts borrowed from AEP affiliates for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nInterest income related to AEPTCo Parent’s short-term lending is included in Interest Income – Affiliated on AEPTCo Parent’s statements of income.  AEPTCo Parent earned interest income for amounts advanced to AEP affiliates of $\n3\n million, $\n3\n million and $\n915\n thousand for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nS-16\nEXHIBIT INDEX\nThe documents listed below are being filed or have previously been filed on behalf of the Registrants shown and are
