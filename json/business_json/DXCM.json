    "item1": "ITEM 1 - BUSINESS\nOverview\nWe are a medical device company primarily focused on the design, development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring, or CGM, systems for the management of diabetes and metabolic health by patients, caregivers, and clinicians around the world.\nWe received approval from the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and commercialized our first product in 2006. We launched our latest generation systems, the Dexcom G6 integrated Continuous Glucose Monitoring System, or G6, in 2018, and we launched the Dexcom G7, or G7,\n \nin 2023. In August 2024, we launched Stelo, our new biosensor designed for adults with prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin, as the first over-the-counter glucose biosensor in the U.S.\nUnless the context requires otherwise, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” the “company,” or “Dexcom” refer to DexCom, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nProducts\nDexcom G7\nIn March 2022, we obtained Conformité Européenne Marking, or CE Mark, approval for G7. In December 2022, we obtained marketing authorization from the FDA for the G7 via the 510(k) review process. Like the G6, the G7 is an integrated continuous glucose monitoring system, or iCGM, and is classified as a Class II device by the FDA, and is subject to special controls. The glucose value algorithm, ability to communicate with approved display and mobile devices, and compatibility with Dexcom Clarity, our cloud-based reporting software, are all substantially equivalent in technical performance and capability to the G6. In the United States, the G7 is covered by Medicare and Medicaid in the majority of states and by commercial insurers, subject to satisfaction of certain eligibility and coverage criteria for individuals with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.\nDexcom G7 is cleared in the United States for all people with diabetes ages two years and older, giving more people than ever access to a powerfully simple diabetes management solution. With an overall Mean Absolute Relative Difference, or MARD, of 8.2%, as well as 94.1% of values within 20% of their comparator, Dexcom G7 is the most accurate CGM cleared by the FDA and is clinically proven to lower A1C (a blood test that provides information about average levels of blood glucose, over the prior three months), reduce hyper- and hypoglycemia, and increase time in range.\nThe G7 carries forward important features of prior generation Dexcom CGM systems:\n•\nFinger stick elimination.\n No finger sticks are needed for calibration or diabetes treatment decisions, consistent with the instructions for use, unless symptoms do not match readings.\n•\nContinuous glucose readings.\n \nAutomatically sends glucose readings to a Dexcom receiver or compatible display device every five minutes.\n•\nMobile app and sharing.\n Compatibility with mobile device applications allows for sharing glucose information with up to 10 other people for added support and care coordination.\n•\nDesigned to integrate with the world’s largest connected CGM ecosystem\n (including insulin pumps and smart insulin pens, Apple Watch, Garmin and other digital health apps).\n•\nCustomizable alarms and alerts.\n \nPersonalized alert schedule immediately warns the user of pending dangerous high and low blood sugar levels.\n•\nEasy sensor application.\n Complete redesign of the sensor applicator allows for one-touch, simple self-insertion.\n•\nMedication blocking.\n New feature allows for more accurate glucose readings without interference from common medications taken at typical indication doses, such as acetaminophen.\n•\nPredictive low alert.\n Alert feature intended to predict hypoglycemia before it hits to help avoid dangerous low blood sugar events.\n•\nExtended 10-day disposable sensor.\n6\nThe G7 also has a number of new or improved features compared to our prior generation devices:\n•\nAn even more discreet and low profile.\n A redesigned transmitter makes for an all-in-one wearable, combining our sensor and transmitter that is 60% smaller than the G6, making it even more comfortable and easier to wear under clothing.\n•\nFaster warm up.\n 30-minute sensor warm up, fastest of any CGM on the market.\n•\nExpanded time to replace sensors.\n 12-hour grace period to replace finished sensors for a more seamless transition between sessions.\n•\nNew mobile app.\n Redesigned and simplified mobile app with Dexcom Clarity integration.\n•\nImproved alert settings for enhanced discretion at the user’s option\n.\n•\nRedesigned receiver. \nThe optional receiver is smaller, with a more vibrant, easier to read display.\n•\nNew indications for use. \nIndicated in the United States for wear on the back of the upper arm for ages 2 years and older or the upper buttocks for ages 2-6 years old.\n•\nLess waste.\n Smaller plastic components and packaging, resulting in less waste than the G6.\nOther than the foregoing, the G7 is generally consistent with our prior generation CGM systems in its technical capabilities and its indications. Since the G7 is classified by the FDA as a Class II device, it is subject to special controls and modifications of, or revisions to, the device may be made under the 510(k) process.\nDexcom G6\nIn March 2018, we obtained marketing authorization from the FDA for the G6 via the \nde novo\n process. The G6 was the first type of CGM system permitted by the FDA to be used as part of an integrated system with other compatible medical devices and electronic interfaces, which may include automated insulin delivery systems, insulin pumps, blood glucose meters or other electronic devices used for diabetes management. G6 and substantially equivalent devices of this generic type that may later receive marketing authorization are referred to as integrated continuous glucose monitoring systems, or iCGMs, and have been classified as Class II devices by the FDA. Along with this classification, the FDA established criteria, called special controls, which outline requirements for assuring CGM accuracy, reliability and clinical relevance, and which also describe the type of studies and data required to demonstrate acceptable CGM performance. The G6 is designed to automatically transfer data from the transmitter to the Dexcom receiver device as well as allow our transmitter to run an algorithm to generate a glucose value and to communicate directly to a patient’s compatible mobile device, including iPhone\n®\n, iPod touch\n®\n, iPad\n®\n, and certain Android\n®\n mobile devices. A patient’s glucose data can also be displayed on wearable devices, like the Apple Watch\n®\n and Wear OS by Google devices. The G6 transmitter has a labeled useful life of three months. Data from the G6 can be integrated with Dexcom Clarity, our cloud-based reporting software, for personalized, easy-to-understand analysis of trends that may improve diabetes management. In the United States, the G6 is covered by Medicare and Medicaid in the majority of states and by commercial insurers, subject to satisfaction of certain eligibility and coverage criteria for individuals with both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.\nIn June 2018, we received CE Mark approval for the G6, which allows us to market the system in the European Union and the countries in Asia and Latin America that recognize the CE Mark, as well as New Zealand, though certain countries may require compliance with certain local administrative requirements and/or additional marketing authorizations (for example, the inclusion of medical devices on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods in Australia).\nIn October 2019, we also received marketing authorization from the FDA for the Dexcom G6 Pro, or G6 Pro, which allows healthcare professionals to purchase the G6 for use by their patients. The G6 Pro has many of same features as the G6 and is intended for healthcare professionals to use with their patients ages two years and up. The G6 Pro may be used in a blinded or unblinded mode for up to 10 days.\nFor the G6, the sensor is inserted by the user and is intended to be used continuously for up to 10 days, after which it may be replaced with a new disposable sensor. Our transmitter is reusable until it reaches the end of its use life, labeled as three months. Our receiver is also reusable. As we continue to establish an installed base of customers using our products, we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenues through recurring sales of our disposable sensors.\nThe G6 carries forward important features of prior generation Dexcom CGM systems:\n•\nContinuous glucose readings.\n \nAutomatically sends glucose readings to a Dexcom receiver or compatible display device every five minutes.\n7\n•\nMobile app and sharing.\n Compatibility with mobile device applications allows for sharing glucose information with up to 10 other people for added support and care coordination.\n•\nIntegration with the world’s largest connected CGM ecosystem\n (including Apple Watch, Garmin and other digital health apps).\n•\nCustomizable alarms and alerts.\n \nPersonalized alert schedule immediately warns the user of pending dangerous high and low blood sugar levels.\nThe G6 also has a number of new or improved features compared to our prior generation devices:\n•\nFinger stick elimination.\n No finger sticks are needed for calibration or diabetes treatment decisions, consistent with the instructions for use, unless symptoms do not match readings.\n•\nEasy sensor application.\n Complete redesign of the sensor applicator allows for one-touch, simple self-insertion.\n•\nDiscreet and low profile.\n A redesigned transmitter with a 28% lower profile than the previous generation Dexcom CGM system makes the device comfortable and easy to wear under clothing.\n•\nMedication blocking.\n Allows for more accurate glucose readings without interference from common medications taken at typical indication doses, such as acetaminophen.\n•\nPredictive low alert.\n Alert feature intended to predict hypoglycemia before it hits to help avoid dangerous low blood sugar events.\n•\nExtended 10-day disposable sensor.\n Up to 10-day sensor use allows for 43% longer wear than previous generation Dexcom CGM systems.\nOther than the foregoing, the features of the G6 are generally consistent with our prior generation CGM systems in its technical capabilities and its indications. Since the G6 is classified by the FDA as a Class II device, it is subject to special controls and modifications of, or revisions to, the device may be made under the 510(k) process.\nDexcom ONE\nIn July 2021, we obtained CE Mark approval for our Dexcom ONE CGM system, or Dexcom ONE, which we have launched in several countries in Europe. Dexcom ONE consists of three main components: a sensor, a transmitter, and a display device consisting of either the Dexcom ONE app for users with a compatible mobile device, or a Dexcom ONE receiver. Dexcom ONE carries many of the same features as the G6, and is indicated for persons, including pregnant women, ages 2 years and older. Like our other CGM systems, Dexcom ONE is designed to replace finger stick blood glucose testing for diabetes treatment decisions.\nIn November 2023, we obtained CE Mark approval for Dexcom ONE+. This updated version of our Dexcom ONE system builds upon the software experience of Dexcom ONE with certain additional features, while allowing customers to adopt the all-in-one wearable technology of our G7 CGM system.\nStelo\nIn August 2024, we launched Stelo, our new biosensor designed for adults with prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin, as the first over-the-counter glucose biosensor in the U.S.\nDexcom Share\nThe Dexcom Share remote monitoring system, offered for use with any current Dexcom system, uses an app on the patient’s compatible iPhone, iPod touch, iPad or Android mobile device to securely and wirelessly transmit glucose information to the cloud and then to apps on the mobile devices of up to ten designated recipients, or “followers,” who can remotely monitor a patient’s glucose information and receive alert notifications anywhere they have a wireless connection. A patient’s glucose data can also be displayed on a patient’s or follower’s wearable device, such as the Apple Watch and Wear OS by Google devices, when used in conjunction with the patient’s or follower’s compatible iPhone or Android mobile device.\nData and Insulin Delivery Collaborations\nWe have entered into multiple collaboration agreements that leverage our technology platform to integrate our CGM products with insulin delivery systems. The general purpose of these development and commercial relationships is to integrate our technology into the insulin pump or pen product offerings of the respective partner, enabling the partner’s insulin delivery device to receive and display glucose readings from our transmitter and, in some cases, use the glucose readings for semi-automated insulin delivery. We have existing insulin delivery partnerships, and we are also working with other companies that are pursuing varying strategies surrounding semi-automated insulin delivery and data analytics to improve outcomes and ease-of-use in diabetes management.\n8\nWe have also entered into collaborations with several organizations that are currently using, or are developing, programs for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes that utilize our current CGM systems. These collaborations align with the strategy to seek broader access to our CGM systems for people with Type 2 diabetes, including those who are not treated with intensive insulin therapy.\nVerily Collaboration\nOur Restated Collaboration Agreement with Verily Life Science LLC (an Alphabet Company) and Verily Ireland Limited (collectively, Verily) provides us with an exclusive license to use intellectual property of Verily resulting from the collaboration, and certain Verily patents, in the development, manufacture and commercialization of blood-based or interstitial glucose monitoring products more generally (subject to certain exclusions, which are outside of the CGM field as it is commonly understood). It also provides us with non-exclusive license rights under Verily’s other intellectual property rights to develop, manufacture, and commercialize those kinds of glucose monitoring products and certain CGM product companion software functionalities. In connection with the Restated Collaboration Agreement, we developed, launched and commercialized a CGM product in connection with the collaboration.\nIn consideration of Verily’s performance of its obligations under the joint development plan of the Restated Collaboration Agreement, the licenses granted to us and the amendment of the original agreement, we made upfront, incentive, and the product regulatory approval payments, and payments for contingent sales-based milestones upon the achievement of certain revenue targets. See Note 2 “\nDevelopment and Other Agreements\n” to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report and Exhibit 10.13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further description of the Restated Collaboration Agreement, including the number of shares of stock for milestone payments.\nMarket Opportunity\nDiabetes\nDiabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease for which there is no known cure and which has other significant adverse consequences for human health throughout the world. The disease is caused by the body’s inability to produce or effectively utilize the hormone insulin. This inability prevents the body from adequately regulating blood glucose levels. Glucose, the primary source of energy for cells, must be maintained at certain concentrations in the blood in order to permit optimal cell function and health. Normally, the pancreas provides control of blood glucose levels by secreting the hormone insulin to decrease blood glucose levels when concentrations are too high. In people with diabetes, the body does not produce sufficient levels of insulin, or fails to utilize insulin effectively, causing blood glucose levels to rise above normal. This condition is called hyperglycemia and often results in acute complications as well as chronic long-term complications such as heart disease, limb amputations, loss of kidney function and blindness. When blood glucose levels are high, people with diabetes often administer insulin in an effort to decrease blood glucose levels. Unfortunately, insulin administration can drive blood glucose levels below the normal range, resulting in hypoglycemia. In cases of severe hypoglycemia, people with diabetes risk acute complications, such as loss of consciousness or death. Due to the drastic nature of acute complications associated with hypoglycemia, many people with diabetes are reluctant to reduce blood glucose levels. Consequently, these individuals often remain in a hyperglycemic state, increasing their odds of developing long-term chronic complications. Diabetes is typically classified into two major groups: Type 1 and Type 2.\nThe International Diabetes Federation, or IDF, estimates that in 2021, 537 million adults (aged 20-79) around the world had diabetes. IDF estimates that by 2045, the worldwide incidence of people suffering from diabetes will reach 783 million. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, in its National Diabetes Statistics Report, 2024, or the 2024 CDC Report, crude estimates for the prevalence of diabetes in the United States as of 2021 include 38.4 million people with diabetes, of which 29.7 million people have diagnosed diabetes.\nThis growing diabetes prevalence and its associated health outcomes also result in sobering economic burdens for global health systems. According to the American Diabetes Association, or ADA, one in every four healthcare dollars was spent on treating people with diabetes in 2022, and the direct medical costs and indirect expenditures attributable to diabetes in the United States were an estimated $413 billion, an inflation-adjusted increase of approximately 35% since 2012. Of the $413 billion in overall expenses, the ADA estimated that approximately $307 billion were direct costs associated with diabetes care, chronic complications and excess general medical costs, and $106 billion were indirect costs. The ADA also found that in 2022, average medical expenditures among people with diagnosed diabetes were 2.6 times higher than for people without diabetes. According to the IDF, 2021 expenditures attributable to diabetes were estimated to be $966 billion globally, an increase of 27% from their previous estimate in 2019.\n9\nType 1 Diabetes\nAccording to the 2024 CDC Report, as of 2021 there were an estimated 2.0 million adults and youth with diagnosed Type 1 diabetes in the United States. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder that usually develops during childhood and is characterized by an absence of insulin, resulting from destruction of the insulin producing cells of the pancreas. Individuals with Type 1 diabetes must rely on frequent insulin injections in order to regulate and maintain blood glucose levels.\nType 2 Diabetes\nType 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder which results when the body is unable to produce sufficient amounts of insulin or becomes insulin resistant. Depending on the severity of Type 2 diabetes, individuals may require diet and nutrition management, exercise, oral medications or insulin injections to regulate blood glucose levels. We estimate that between 5.0 and 6.0 million people with Type 2 diabetes in the United States must use insulin to manage their diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes is occurring with increasing frequency in young people, with the increase in prevalence related to an increase in obesity amongst children. According to the CDC, as of 2017-2020, approximately 19.7% of children and adolescents aged 2-19 years, or 14.7 million children, in the United States were obese. In the United States, the percentage of children and adolescents affected by obesity has more than tripled since the 1970s.\nImportance of Glucose Monitoring\nBlood glucose levels can be affected by many factors, including the carbohydrate and fat content of meals, exercise, stress, illness or impending illness, hormonal releases, variability in insulin absorption and changes in the effects of insulin in the body. Given the many factors that affect blood glucose levels, maintaining glucose within a normal range is difficult, resulting in frequent and unpredictable excursions above or below normal blood glucose levels. People with diabetes administer insulin or ingest carbohydrates throughout the day in order to maintain blood glucose levels within normal ranges. People with diabetes frequently overcorrect and fluctuate between hyperglycemic and hypoglycemic states, often multiple times during the same day. As a result, many people with diabetes are routinely outside the normal blood glucose range. Failure to maintain blood glucose levels within the normal range leads to numerous and significant health risks. These risks include eye disease, nerve disease, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and potentially hypoglycemic events.\nLimitations of Existing Glucose Monitoring Products\nSingle-point finger stick devices are the most prevalent devices for glucose monitoring. These devices require taking a blood sample with a finger stick, placing a drop of blood on a test strip and inserting the strip into a glucose meter that yields a single point in time blood glucose measurement. We believe that these devices suffer from several limitations, including:\n•\nLimited Information.\n Even if people with diabetes test several times each day, each measurement represents a single blood glucose value at a single point in time. Given the many factors that can affect blood glucose levels, excursions above and below the normal range often occur between these discrete measurement points in time. Without the ability to determine whether their blood glucose level is rising, falling or holding constant, and the rate at which their blood glucose level is changing, the individual’s ability to effectively manage and maintain blood glucose levels within normal ranges is severely limited. Further, people with diabetes cannot test themselves during sleep, when the risk of hypoglycemia is significantly increased.\nThe illustrative graph below shows the limited information provided by four single-point measurements during a single day using a traditional single-point finger stick device, compared to the data provided by our continuous sensor. The continuous data indicates that, even with four finger sticks in one day, the patient’s blood glucose levels were above the target range of 80-140 milligrams per deciliter (“mg/dl”) for a period of 13.5 hours.\n10\nSingle Day Continuous Data\n•\nInconvenience.\n The process of measuring blood glucose levels with single-point finger stick devices can cause significant disruption in the daily activities of people with diabetes and their families. People with diabetes using single-point finger stick devices must stop whatever they are doing several times per day, self-inflict a painful prick and draw blood to measure blood glucose levels. To do so, people with diabetes must always carry a fully supplied kit that may include a spring-loaded needle, or lancet, disposable test strips, cleansing wipes and the meter, and then safely dispose of the used supplies. This process is inconvenient and may cause uneasiness in social situations.\n•\nDifficulty of Use.\n To obtain a sample with single-point finger stick devices, people with diabetes generally prick one of their fingertips or, occasionally, a forearm with a lancet. They then squeeze the area to produce the blood sample and another prick may be required if a sufficient volume of blood is not obtained the first time. The blood sample is then placed on a disposable test strip that is inserted into a blood glucose meter. This task can be difficult for individuals with decreased tactile sensation and visual acuity, which are common complications of diabetes.\n•\nPain.\n Although the fingertips are rich in blood flow and provide a good site to obtain a blood sample, they are also densely populated with highly sensitive nerve endings. This makes the lancing and subsequent manipulation of the finger to draw blood painful. The pain and discomfort are compounded by the fact that fingers offer limited surface area, so tests are often performed on areas that are sore from prior tests. People with diabetes may also suffer pain when the finger prick site is disturbed during regular activities.\nThe Dexcom Approach\nWe believe continuous glucose monitoring has the potential to enable more people with diabetes to achieve and sustain tight glycemic control with minimal disruption to their daily lives.\nThe landmark 1993 Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, or DCCT, demonstrated that improving blood glucose control lowers the risk of developing diabetes-related complications by up to 50%. The study also demonstrated that people with Type 1 diabetes achieved sustained benefits with intensive management.\nVarious clinical studies and real-world evidence also demonstrate the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring in the management of Type 1 diabetes and insulin-requiring Type-2 diabetes, when compared to regimens relying on self-monitoring of blood glucose. Results of several early clinical trials established that CGM usage was associated with improved glycemic outcomes.\nReal-time alerts and multi-device integration further differentiate CGM-based and self-monitoring of blood glucose, or SMBG, based diabetes regimens. Alerts triggered by existing or impending abnormal glucose values are associated with less exposure to hypo- and hyperglycemia in large real-world data sets, and multi-device integration \n11\nallows some CGM systems to communicate with automated insulin delivery systems. One such automated insulin delivery system that uses the G6 was studied in a large clinical trial that associated its use with numerous quality-of-life and glycemic benefits.\nOur current target market consists primarily of people with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes who utilize insulin therapy as well as certain non-insulin using people with diabetes that struggle with hypoglycemia. We also believe that our CGM systems are beginning to have a positive impact on the broader Type 2 population that does not utilize insulin or have hypoglycemia risk, a group that we estimate to be greater than 25 million people in the United States alone. We are extending our commercial efforts for this population through several channels, including through strategic partnerships. In the future, we plan to expand our product offering to people who are pregnant and cleared/approved indications to address people with pre-diabetes, people who are obese, and people in the hospital setting. Although the majority of our revenue has been generated in the United States, we have expanded our operations to include additional markets in North America, Africa, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East.\nOur current CGM systems offer the following potential advantages to people with diabetes:\n•\nPotential for Improved Outcomes.\n Randomized clinical trials and peer reviewed published data have demonstrated that patients with diabetes who used continuous glucose monitoring devices to help manage their disease experienced significant improvements in glucose control, including when compared to patients relying solely on single-point finger stick measurements (i.e., less time in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia) and reductions in A1c levels when compared to baseline.\n•\nAccess to Real-Time Values, Trend Information and Alerts.\n People with diabetes can view their current glucose value, along with a graphical display of the historical trend information on our receiver or alternate display device. Without continuous monitoring, the individual is often unaware if his or her glucose is rising, declining or remaining constant. Access to continuous real-time glucose measurements provides people with diabetes information that may aid in attaining better glucose control. Additionally, our current CGM systems alert people with diabetes when their glucose levels approach inappropriately high or low levels so that they may intervene.\n•\nIntuitive User Interface.\n We have developed a user interface that we believe is intuitive and easy to use. Our current CGM system receivers are compact with an easy-to-read color display, simple navigation tools, audible alerts and graphical display of trend information. Similar benefits are available via the interfaces we have made available on compatible mobile devices. These devices can serve as substitutes for our receivers or alternate display units in certain geographies.\n•\nConvenience and Comfort.\n Our current CGM systems provide people with diabetes with the benefits of continuous monitoring, without having to perform finger stick tests for every measurement. Additionally, the disposable sensor that is inserted under the skin is a very thin wire, minimizing potential discomfort associated with inserting or wearing the disposable sensor. The external portion of the sensor, attached to the transmitter, is small, has a low profile and is designed to be easily worn under clothing. The wireless receiver is the size of a small smart phone and can be carried discreetly in a pocket or purse. We believe that convenience is an important factor in achieving widespread adoption of a CGM system.\n•\nConnectivity to Wearables and Others. \nPatients can monitor their glucose levels and trends on compatible wearable devices, such as Apple Watch and Wear OS by Google devices, when used with a compatible mobile device. Also, our Share remote monitoring systems enable users of our current CGM systems to have their sensor glucose information remotely monitored by their family, friends or other designated recipient, or follower, by wirelessly transmitting data from the user’s smart phone to the cloud and then to the follower’s mobile device. Several followers can remotely monitor a patient’s glucose information and receive secondary alert notifications from almost anywhere with an Internet connection via each follower’s mobile device.\nOur Strategy\nOur objective is to remain a leading provider of glucose biosensors and related products to enable people with diabetes and those seeking to optimize metabolic health to more effectively and conveniently manage their glucose levels. We are also developing and commercializing products that integrate our CGM technologies into the insulin delivery systems or data platforms of our respective partners. In addition, we continue to pursue development partnerships with other insulin delivery companies, including automated insulin delivery systems, as well as other players in the disease management sector. We are focusing on the following business strategies as we pursue these objectives:\n12\n•\nEstablishing and maintaining our technology platform as the leading approach to CGM and leveraging our development expertise to rapidly bring products to market, including for expanded indications.\n•\nSupporting use of our ambulatory products through a direct sales and marketing effort, as well as key distribution arrangements.\n•\nSupporting innovation through technology integration partnerships.\n•\nSeeking broad coverage policies and reimbursement for our products from private third-party payors and national health systems.\n•\nProviding cloud-based data repository platform that enables people with diabetes to aggregate and analyze data from numerous diabetes devices and share the data with their healthcare providers and other individuals involved in their diabetes management and care.\n•\nPursuing expansion of use of our products to other patient care settings and patient demographics, including use for people with Type 2 diabetes who are not on intensive insulin therapy, population health, patient monitoring including in the hospital setting, and people who are pregnant.\n•\nProviding a high level of customer support, service and education.\n•\nPursuing the highest safety and quality levels for our products.\nOur Technology Platform\nWe believe we have a broad technology platform that will support the development of multiple products for continuous glucose monitoring.\nSensor Technology\nThe key enabling technologies for our sensors include biomaterials, membrane systems, electrochemistry and low power microelectronics. Our membrane technology consists of multiple polymer layers configured to selectively allow the appropriate mix of glucose and oxygen to travel through the membrane and react with a glucose specific enzyme to create an extremely low electrical signal, measured in pico-amperes. This electrical signal is then translated into glucose values. We believe that the capability to measure very low levels of an electrical signal and to accurately translate those measurements into glucose values is also a unique and distinguishing feature of our technology. We have also developed technology to allow sensitive electronics to be packaged in a small, fully contained, lightweight sealed unit that minimizes inconvenience and discomfort for the user.\nReceiver and Transmitter Technology\nOur current CGM systems wirelessly transmit information from the transmitter to our receiver or to a compatible mobile device. We have developed technology for reliable transmission and reception and have consistently demonstrated a high rate of successful transmissions from transmitter to receiver or compatible mobile device in our clinical trials. Our receiver or the mobile device, via our apps, then displays both real-time and trended glucose values, and provides alerts and alarms. We have used our extensive database of continuous glucose data to create and refine software, algorithms and other technology for the display of data to customers.\nCompatible Mobile Devices\nWith our G6 and G7 systems, the functionalities of our proprietary receiver can be obtained through the use of a compatible mobile device, such as an iOS or Android device, and our mobile applications, depending on the patient’s geographic location. A receiver may be required as the primary display device or a backup to the mobile device in some jurisdictions, including the United States.\nDexcom Real-Time API\nIn July 2021, we received FDA marketing clearance for \nan iCGM system incorporating\n our Real-Time Application Programming Interfaces (API), which is an added software component that expands connectivity and interoperability of the \nDexcom\n CGM digital ecosystem, enabling communication of iCGM data to client software intended to receive data through the cloud. \nDexcom\n Real-Time API enables authorized third-party software developers to integrate real-time CGM data into their digital health apps and devices \nfor specific and permitted use cases including non-medical device application, medical device data analysis, iCGM secondary display alarm, active patient monitoring, and treatment decisions. Real-Time API is not permitted for use in environments not currently cleared for the Dexcom CGM System (e.g., hospital inpatient care), and is not intended to be used by automated insulin delivery systems.\n13\nProducts in Development\nWe have gained our technology expertise by developing implants designed to withstand the rigors of functioning within the human body for extended periods of time, and designed to address other considerations such as device sealing, miniaturization, durability and sensor geometry.\nWe are leveraging this technology platform with the goal of enhancing the capabilities of our current products (including obtaining expanded indications for use) and to develop additional CGM products. We plan to develop future generations of technologies that are focused on improved performance and convenience and that will enable intelligent insulin administration. Over the longer term, we plan to continue to develop and improve networked platforms with open architecture, connectivity and transmitters capable of communicating with other devices. We intend to expand our efforts to accumulate CGM patient data and metrics and apply predictive modeling and machine learning to generate interactive CGM insights that can inform patient behavior.\nWe continue to pursue and support development partnerships with insulin pump companies and companies or institutions developing insulin delivery systems, including automated insulin delivery systems. With the introduction of Stelo, we are also pursuing and supporting development partnerships with consumer technology product companies that seek to provide metabolic health insights to their customers.\nWe are also exploring how to extend our offerings to other opportunities, including for people with pre-diabetes, people who are obese, people who are pregnant, and people in the hospital setting. Eventually, we may apply our technological expertise to products beyond glucose monitoring.\nCommercial Operations\nWe have built a direct sales organization in North America and certain international markets to call on health care professionals, such as endocrinologists, physicians and diabetes educators, who can educate patients about continuous glucose monitoring. We believe that focusing efforts on these participants is important given the instrumental role they each play in the decision-making process for diabetes therapy, and to ensure that health care professionals and patients are knowledgeable about our products and their functionality. We focus on delivering this important information to participants to drive adoption of our current CGM systems. In addition, our direct sales efforts include the use of e-commerce resources in certain international markets where we have not built a sales force.\nTo complement our direct sales efforts, we have entered into distribution arrangements in North America and several international markets that allow distributors to sell our products. We expect to continue investing in our field sales force and believe our direct, highly specialized and focused sales organization and our domestic and international distribution agreements are sufficient for us to support our sales efforts for at least the next twelve months.\nWe use a variety of marketing tools to drive adoption, ensure continued use and establish brand loyalty for our CGM systems by:\n•\ncreating awareness of the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring and the advantages of our technology with endocrinologists, physicians, diabetes educators, people with diabetes and those seeking to optimize metabolic health;\n•\nproviding strong and simple educational and training programs to healthcare providers and people with diabetes to ensure easy, safe and effective use of our systems; and\n•\nmaintaining a readily accessible telephone and web-based technical and customer support infrastructure, which includes clinicians, diabetes educators and reimbursement specialists, to help referring physicians, diabetes educators, people with diabetes and those seeking to optimize metabolic health as necessary.\nDirect-to-consumer (DTC) marketing is one of our key initiatives to increase awareness of our CGM systems and drive new leads for people with diabetes and those seeking to optimize metabolic health to our website. In jurisdictions where DTC marketing is permitted, we currently focus on reaching people with Type 1 and people with Type 2 diabetes who use insulin. We advertise on television, in print, digital and video media, CRM, offer sponsorships, host or participate in diabetes related events, conduct public relations and maintain a brand ambassador program.\nWe typically experience seasonality, with lower sales in the first quarter of each year compared to the immediately preceding fourth quarter. This seasonal sales pattern relates to U.S. annual insurance deductible resets and unfunded flexible spending accounts.\n14\nCompetition\nThe market for glucose monitoring devices is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. In selling our current CGM systems, we compete directly with the Diabetes Care division of Abbott Laboratories; Medtronic plc’s Diabetes Group; Roche Diabetes Care, a division of Roche Diagnostics; privately-held LifeScan, Inc.; and Ascensia Diabetes Care, each of which manufactures and markets products for the single-point finger stick device market. Collectively with us, these companies currently account for the majority of the worldwide sales of self-monitored glucose testing systems.\nSeveral companies are developing or commercializing products for continuous or periodic monitoring of glucose levels in the interstitial fluid under the skin that compete directly with our products. We have competed with Abbott and their Libre family of CGM products for many years. Medtronic markets and sells a standalone glucose monitoring product called Guardian Connect, both internationally and in the United States, and a disposable CGM system called Simplera in international markets.\nMedtronic and other third parties have developed or are developing, insulin pumps integrated with continuous glucose monitoring systems that provide, among other things, the ability to suspend insulin administration while the user’s glucose levels are low and to automate basal or bolus insulin dosing. Likewise, Abbott Diabetes Care has received FDA clearance to integrate certain versions of their Libre sensors into automated insulin delivery systems and is pursuing such integrations with third-party insulin delivery devices.\nWe are also aware of companies outside the traditional medical device sector that are attempting to develop competitive products and services, including for the general health and wellness, or population health space. Some of the companies developing or marketing competing devices are large and well-known publicly traded companies.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:\n•\nsafe, reliable and high-quality performance of products;\n•\ncost of products and eligibility for reimbursement;\n•\ncomfort and ease of use of products;\n•\neffective sales, marketing and distribution networks;\n•\nbrand awareness and strong acceptance by healthcare professionals, people with diabetes and those seeking to optimize metabolic health;\n•\ncustomer service and support and comprehensive education for people with diabetes, diabetes care providers and those seeking to optimize metabolic health;\n•\nspeed of product innovation and time to market;\n•\nregulatory expertise; and\n•\ntechnological leadership and superiority.\nFor additional information on competition, please see our Risk Factor entitled “\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and face competition from large, well-established companies with significant resources, and, as a result, we may not be able to compete effectively.”\nManufacturing\nWe currently manufacture our products at our headquarters in San Diego, California and at our manufacturing facilities in Mesa, Arizona and Penang, Malaysia, where we collectively have approximately 80,600 square feet of laboratory space and approximately 159,600 square feet of controlled environment rooms. We are currently building out a new manufacturing facility in Athenry, Ireland. We anticipate that the new facility will add substantial manufacturing capacity.\nThere are technical challenges to increasing manufacturing capacity, finding or enhancing new manufacturing facilities capable of meeting regulatory requirements, government licensure of manufacturing facilities, equipment design and automation, material procurement, problems with production yields, and quality control and assurance. While we have focused significant effort on continual improvement programs in our manufacturing operations intended to improve quality, yields and throughput, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to produce an adequate supply of product to support our commercialization efforts.\nWe have recently experienced manufacturing and inventory challenges for G7 that have resulted, and may continue to result from time to time, in disruptions in our ability to supply certain markets, including in the U.S. and other \n15\ncountries. While we are currently working to remedy such challenges, we cannot predict when such manufacturing and inventory challenges will be remedied. If we fail to produce a sufficient amount of our products, our ability to supply our markets will be compromised and health care providers and people with diabetes’ decisions to use our products may be negatively impacted. This could lead to loss of sales of and revenues from our products, could potentially decrease our market share, and/or our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects could be materially adversely affected. See the section of the Risk Factors entitled “\nRisks Related to Manufacturing, Commercial Operations and Commercialization.\n”\nAdditionally, the production of our continuous glucose monitoring systems must occur in a highly controlled and clean environment to minimize particles and other yield-limiting and quality-limiting contaminants. Developing and maintaining commercial-scale manufacturing facilities has and will continue to require the investment of substantial additional funds and the hiring and retention of additional management, quality assurance, quality control and technical personnel who have the necessary manufacturing experience.\nWe manufacture our current CGM systems with certain components supplied by outside vendors and other components that we manufacture internally. Key components that we manufacture internally include our wire-based sensors. The remaining components and assemblies are purchased from outside vendors. We then assemble, test, package and ship the finished systems, which may include a reusable transmitter, a receiver and disposable sensors.\nWe purchase certain components and materials used in manufacturing from single sources due to quality considerations, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory or other requirements. As of December 31, 2024, those single sources include suppliers of application-specific integrated circuits used in our transmitters, seals used for the applicator and certain polymers used to synthesize polymeric membranes for our sensors. For additional information, please see our Risk Factor entitled “\nWe depend upon third-party suppliers and outsource to other parties, making us vulnerable to supply disruptions, suboptimal quality, non-compliance and/or price fluctuations, which could harm our business.\n”\nThird-Party Coverage and Reimbursement\nAs a medical device company, coverage and reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental healthcare programs or systems and private third-party healthcare payors is an important element of our success. Medicare covers the CGM system, which includes supplies necessary for the use of the device, under the Durable Medical Equipment, or DME, benefit category. Previously, Medicare coverage for CGM was only available to Medicare patients who take at least three doses of insulin a day, limiting CGM reimbursement for Medicare beneficiaries with intensive Type 1 and 2 diabetes. The Local Coverage Determination, or LCD, that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) released in April 2023 extends Medicare CGM coverage to all patients using insulin. Further, the LCD also allows coverage for patients not taking insulin if the patient has a history of problematic hypoglycemia. We also have coverage under certain international markets and Medicaid coverage in approximately 47 states.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the eight largest private third-party payors in the United States, in terms of the number of covered lives, have issued coverage policies for the category of continuous glucose monitoring devices. In addition, we have negotiated contracted rates with all of those third-party payors for the purchase of our current CGM systems by their members. We have personnel with reimbursement expertise to assist customers in obtaining reimbursement from private third-party payors. We also maintain a field-based reimbursement team charged with calling on third-party private payors to obtain coverage decisions and contracts. We have continued our efforts to create and liberalize coverage policies with third-party payors, including obtaining reimbursement for our products under pharmacy benefits and for more people with diabetes.\nFor additional information on third-party reimbursement, please see our see Risk Factors in the section entitled “\nRisks Related to Pricing and Reimbursement\n.”\nIntellectual Property\nProtection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, nondisclosure agreements and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights.\nOur patent portfolio includes numerous issued and pending patent applications in the U.S. and other parts of the world, which, in the aggregate, we believe to be of material importance in the operation of our business. U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest application \n16\nwas filed. In some cases, the patent term may be extended. Our issued patents as of December 31, 2024 are set to expire over a range of years, from 2025 with respect to some of our earlier patents, to 2043, subject to any extensions. We also have various registered U.S. trademarks, registered European Community trademarks, and many other trademark registrations and pending trademark applications around other parts of the world. In addition, we have entered into exclusive and non-exclusive licenses in the ordinary course of business relating to a wide array of technologies or other intellectual property rights or assets.\nOur patents and patent applications seek to protect aspects of our core membrane and sensor technologies and our product concepts for continuous glucose monitoring. We believe that our patent position provides us with sufficient rights to protect our current and proposed commercial products. However, our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and any patents that have been issued or might be issued may not protect our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, we operate in an industry characterized by extensive patent litigation, and our patents may not be upheld if challenged. Any patents issued to us may be challenged by third parties as being invalid or unenforceable, and patent litigation may result in significant damage awards and injunctions that could prevent the manufacture and sale of affected products or result in significant royalty payments in order to continue selling the products. Third parties may also independently develop similar or competing technology that avoids our patents. The steps we have taken may not prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property, particularly in international countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We also face risks associated with intellectual property infringement.\nWe also rely on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property by generally requiring our employees, consultants, contractors, suppliers, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors to execute non-disclosure and assignment of invention agreements on commencement of their employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also forbid them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. We also generally require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials. We cannot guarantee that employees and third parties will abide by the confidentiality or assignment terms of these agreements. Despite measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties might copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.\nSustainability\nWe believe that taking into account the interests of our various stakeholders – including patients, caregivers, those seeking to optimize metabolic health, employees, investors, and our communities – enables us to operate in a sustainable manner, supports the success of our business and drives long-term value. We do this by holding true to our core values: Listen, Think Big, Be Dependable, and Serve with Integrity.\n•\nListen\n – We believe in listening to our customers and our employees. We have launched a number of programs to advocate for individuals living with diabetes and we support our employees and their families through a number of benefit programs that are available. In addition, we seek to promote diversity, practice fairness, and treat everyone with respect and dignity.\n•\nThink Big \n– We seek to expand global healthcare access for people with diabetes and actively work to increase access to our products. We also have committed to operate our business in a manner that is environmentally sustainable and conserves natural resources and reduces waste.\n•\nBe Dependable \n– We are committed to quality and believe that is best achieved through a safe and healthy workplace as well as a Quality Management System that is compliant with all applicable regulatory requirements and which is continuously being improved.\n•\nServe with Integrity –\n While oversight of our ethics and governance structure begins with our Board of Directors and Executive Leadership Team, we expect all employees to foster a culture of accountability in line with our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics. We also maintain a compliance program to help enforce ethical conduct and adherence to applicable laws and regulations.\nThe Nominating and Governance Committee of the Board of Directors oversees and reviews Dexcom’s policies and programs concerning corporate social responsibility and Dexcom’s participation and visibility as a global corporate citizen. In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee oversees and reviews our sustainability performance and the assessment and management of environmental, sustainability and governance risks affecting our business. Our management-level Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee, which is comprised of the functional leads from our Commercial, Operations, Human Capital, Finance and Legal departments, is responsible for, among other things, setting the strategy with respect to sustainability to align with Dexcom’s mission and long-\n17\nterm strategy, taking into consideration environmental, social and economic dimensions (subject to direction from the Chief Executive Officer and oversight of the Nominating and Governance Committee), establishing programs, policies and practices to integrate sustainability into Dexcom’s strategy, and assisting the Nominating and Governance Committee in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to Dexcom’s performance and behavior for sustainability matters. The Corporate Sustainability Steering Committee reports to our Chief Executive Officer and provides periodic updates regarding our corporate sustainability programs, policies and practices to the Nominating and Governance Committee.\nOur Sustainability Report is available at https://investors.dexcom.com/governance/governance-documents, which is provided for reference only and is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe medical devices that we manufacture are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, the most comprehensive of which requires that a clinical evaluation program be conducted before a device receives approval for commercial distribution. In addition, healthcare regulatory bodies in the United States and around the world impose a range of requirements related to the payment for medical devices and the procedures in which they are used, including laws intended to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse of healthcare dollars.\nU.S. Laws and Regulations\nAt the U.S. federal level, our products are medical devices subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA. The U.S. Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, referred to as the FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations govern product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, pre-market clearance, authorization or approval, establishment registration and product listing, product manufacturing, product labeling, product storage, advertising and promotion, product sales, distribution, recalls and field actions, servicing and post-market clinical surveillance. A number of U.S. states also impose licensing and compliance regimes on companies that manufacture or distribute prescription devices in the state.\nIn addition, the delivery of our devices in the U.S market is subject to regulation by various U.S. Department of Health and Human Services divisions including CMS, the DHHS Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and comparable state agencies responsible for reimbursement and regulation of payment for health care items and services. U.S. laws and regulations are imposed primarily in connection with the Medicare, Medicaid, and TRICARE programs, as well as the government’s interest in regulating the quality and cost of health care.\nFDA Regulation\nUnless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require either prior 510(k) clearance, prior \nde novo\n down-classification and a related grant of marketing authorization, or prior approval from the FDA through the premarket approval, or PMA process. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre-market notification, and adherence to the FDA’s manufacturing requirements, which are contained in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. Class II devices are subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling, as well as general controls. Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the pre-market notification (i.e., 510(k) clearance) requirement, and/or the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. As an example, the mobile applications that comprise the Share System were classified by the FDA as Class II exempt. With the mobile applications classified as Class II exempt, we must comply with certain general and special controls required by the FDA but we do not need prior FDA review to commercialize changes to the mobile applications. Some devices are placed in Class III, which requires approval of a PMA application, if they are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or to be “not substantially equivalent” either to a previously 510(k) cleared device or to a “preamendment” Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which PMA applications have not been required.\nIf a previously unclassified new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. Under FDA law, the \nde novo\n classification procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel \n18\ndevice is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the FDA agrees with the down-classification, the \nde novo\n applicant will then receive authorization to market the device, and a classification regulation will be established for the device type. The device can then be used as a predicate device for future 510(k) submissions by the manufacturer or a competitor.\n A PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device. A PMA application also must include a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling.\nIn addition to our CGM devices, we have a Class I data management service which we market to clinics. This service helps healthcare providers and patients see, understand and use blood glucose meter data to diagnose and manage diabetes. The service also allows researchers to control the transfer of data from certain diabetes devices to research tools and databases according to their own research workflows.\nThe infrastructure of the data management service is considered “medical device data systems,” or MDDS. MDDS are hardware or software products that transfer, store, convert formats, and display medical device data. An MDDS does not modify the data or modify the display of the data, and it does not by itself control the functions or parameters of any other medical device. MDDS are not intended to be used for active patient monitoring. The 21st Century Cures Act excluded certain software functions from the definition of “device”, thus products meeting the definition of MDDS (which previously might have been regulated as Class I, 510(k)-exempt devices) are no longer considered devices and thus are not subject to FDA regulatory requirements.\nAdditional functions of, or intended uses for, our software platform may require us to obtain marketing authorization from the FDA.\nAfter a device is authorized for marketing and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:\n•\nestablishment registration and device listing;\n•\nQSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, storage, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;\n•\nlabeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses or indications and impose other restrictions on labeling, advertising and promotion;\n•\nmedical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur;\n•\nvoluntary and mandatory device recalls to address problems when a device is defective and/or could be a risk to health; and\n•\ncorrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health.\nAlso, the FDA may require us to conduct post-market surveillance studies or order us to establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services and other applicable government regulatory agencies enforce regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of our clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:\n•\nwarning letters or untitled letters that require corrective action;\n•\nfines and civil penalties;\n•\nunanticipated expenditures;\n•\ndelays in approving or refusal to approve our future continuous glucose monitoring systems or other products;\n•\nFDA refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export our products for sale in other countries;\n19\n•\nsuspension or withdrawal of FDA approval;\n•\nproduct recall or seizure;\n•\ninterruption of production;\n•\noperating restrictions;\n•\ninjunctions; and\n•\ncriminal prosecution.\nWe and our contract manufacturers, specification developers, and some suppliers of components or device accessories, are also required to manufacture our products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes we or any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down our manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. We may be unable to comply with all applicable FDA regulations.\nU.S. Fraud and Abuse Laws and Other Compliance Requirements\nThe healthcare industry is subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in U.S. federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.\nAnti-kickback Laws.\n The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either (i) the referral of an individual, or (ii) purchasing, ordering, recommending, or arranging for the purchase or order of a good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments to consultants, waiver of payments, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Given the breadth of this prohibition, Congress has issued a number of exceptions and has granted authority to the OIG to issue safe harbor regulations, each of which set forth certain provisions which, if satisfied in their entirety, will exempt an arrangement from being found to violate the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within one or more exceptions or safe harbors is not per se illegal; rather, each arrangement is subject to a facts and circumstances analysis to determine whether the requisite improper intent exists. Therefore, conduct and business arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable exception or safe harbor element may result in increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities or invite litigation by private citizens under federal whistleblower laws. Violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute is a felony and conviction could result in the assessment of fines of up to $100,000 per violation or imprisonment for up to 10 years or both.\nFederal Civil False Claims Act.\n The federal Civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented a false claim or the knowing use of false statements or records to obtain payment from the federal government. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be subject to repayment of three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus significant mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. Suits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals (known as “relators” or, more commonly, as “whistleblowers”) may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. These whistleblower-initiated False Claims Act cases are commonly referred to as “qui tam” actions. False Claims Act cases may also be initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice or any of its local U.S. Attorneys’ Offices. In addition, certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, even before the validity of the claim is established and even if the government decides not to intervene in the lawsuit. Healthcare companies may decide to agree to large settlements with the government and/or whistleblowers to avoid the cost, distraction and negative publicity associated with litigation. Federal enforcement agencies also have shown increased interest in pharmaceutical and medical device companies’ product promotion, health care professional engagements, and patient assistance programs, including reimbursement and co-pay support services, and a number of investigations \n20\ninto these programs have resulted in significant civil and criminal settlements. In addition, the Affordable Care Act amended federal law to provide that the government may assert that a claim for items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Criminal prosecution is also possible under the Criminal False Claims Act for knowingly making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government.\nFederal Physician Self-Referral Law. \nThe Federal Physician Self-Referral Law, also referred to as the Stark Law, prohibits a physician (or an immediate family member of a physician) who has a financial relationship with an entity from referring patients to that entity for certain designated health services, including durable medical equipment such as the CGM receiver and supplies, payable by Medicare, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits such an entity from presenting or causing to be presented a claim to the Medicare program for such designated health services provided pursuant to a prohibited referral, and provides that certain collections related to any such claims must be refunded in a timely manner. Exceptions to the Stark Law include, among other things, exceptions for certain financial relationships, including both ownership and compensation arrangements. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, therefore, to the extent that the statute is implicated and an exception does not apply, the statute is violated. Violations of the Stark Law must be reported and payment for improper referrals returned to Medicare in order to avoid potential liability under the federal False Claims Act for avoiding a known obligation to return identified overpayments. In the fall of 2020, we transitioned our Medicare business to distributors and we no longer bill Medicare directly for DME and related supplies. In doing so, we have limited our exposure under the Stark Law. In addition to the Stark Law, many states have implemented similar physician self-referral prohibitions that may extend to Medicaid, third party payors, and/or self-pay patients, and may be applicable to our relationships with physicians and other health care providers.\nCivil Monetary Penalties Law\n. The Civil Monetary Penalties Law, or CMPL, authorizes the imposition of substantial civil money penalties against an entity that engages in certain prohibited activities including but not limited to violations of the Stark Law or Anti-Kickback Statute, knowing submission of a false or fraudulent claim, employment of an individual excluded from participation in federal health care programs, and the provision or offer of anything of value to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the transferring party knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider or supplier from which to receive items or services for which payment may be made in whole or part by a federal health care program, commonly known as the Beneficiary Inducement CMP. Remuneration is defined under the CMPL as any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value. There are certain exceptions to the definition of remuneration for offerings that meet the Financial Need, Preventative Care, or Promoting Access to Care exceptions. Sanctions for violations of the CMPL include civil monetary penalties and administrative penalties up to and including exclusion from participation in federal health care programs.\nViolations of the Stark Law, the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and/or the federal False Claims Act can also form the basis for exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs.\nState Analogs of Federal Fraud and Abuse Laws\n. Many U.S. states have their own laws intended to protect against fraud and abuse in the health care industry and more broadly. In some cases these laws prohibit or regulate additional conduct beyond that covered under federal law. Penalties for violating these laws can range from fines to criminal sanctions.\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). \nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and implementing regulations, collectively HIPAA, created two federal crimes: healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs, or integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.\nHIPAA and Other U.S. Privacy Laws and Regulations. \nNumerous federal and state laws, rules and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, security and confidentiality of personal information. HIPAA, in addition to the criminal powers above, extensively regulates the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, through the Privacy, Security, and Breach Notification Rules. HIPAA requires covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the privacy and security of covered information (known as “protected health information”) and sets limits and conditions on the uses and disclosures that may be made of such protected health information. HIPAA’s Security Rule and certain provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and Breach Notification Rule apply to business associates of \n21\ncovered entities (i.e., entities that provide services to covered entities that may require access and use of protected health information on behalf of covered entities), and business associates are subject to direct liability for violation of these rules. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to criminal and civil penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay and notification must also be made to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. The OCR enforces the HIPAA Rules and performs compliance audits and investigations. In addition to enforcement by OCR, HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunction or damages in response to HIPAA violations that impact state residents.\nOn December 1, 2022, OCR issued a bulletin on the requirements under HIPAA for online tracking technologies (e.g., cookies, pixels) to protect the privacy and security of health information. This bulletin outlined OCR’s position on the use of online tracking technology vendors, when certain information received by such vendors constitutes protected health information under HIPAA, and accordingly, when business associate agreements must be executed between covered entities, like us, and such vendors. We are a covered entity under HIPAA because we are a health care provider that engages in certain electronic standard transactions. In certain circumstances, we may also be a business associate of another covered entity or of another business associate. We have assessed our responsibilities under the bulletin and undertaken a number of initiatives to support our compliance with HIPAA and other requirements relating to online tracking technologies, including updates to our cookie banners and preference center. These steps are in addition to measures we had taken previously and we continue to evaluate our compliance with applicable laws and adjust our practices to address developments in the field over time. The HIPAA Rules impose and will continue to impose significant costs on us in order to comply with these standards.\nThere are numerous other laws, regulations and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security of personal information. We also remain subject to federal and state privacy-related laws that may be more restrictive or contain different requirements than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, uses its consumer protection authority to initiate enforcement actions against companies relating to their use and disclosure of personally identifiable information. Specifically, FTC has asserted authority and issued enforcement actions in response to actual or perceived unfair or deceptive practices by a company in the handling of consumer information. The FTC has also pursued enforcement actions against companies for violations of its Health Breach Notification Rule and the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Our use of personal information is also subject to our published privacy policies and notices.\nFurther, certain states have proposed or enacted legislation that will create new data privacy and security obligations for certain entities. These laws include, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which came into effect January 1, 2020 and was amended and expanded by the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which came into effect on January 1, 2023; the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, effective as of January 1, 2023; the Colorado Privacy Act and the Connecticut Data Privacy Act, both effective as of July 1, 2023; the Utah Consumer Privacy Act, effective as of December 31, 2023; the Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370, both effective as of March 31, 2024; the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, and the Florida Digital Bill of Rights, all effective as of July 1, 2024; the Montana Consumer Data Privacy Act, effective as of October 1, 2024; the Delaware Personal Data Privacy Act, the Nebraska Data Privacy Act, the New Hampshire Data Privacy Act, and the Iowa Act Relating to Consumer Data Protection, effective as of January 1, 2025; the Tennessee Information Protection Act, effective as of July 1, 2025; and the Indiana Consumer Data Protection Act, effective as of January 1, 2026. Several other states have enacted, or are proposing to enact, their own comprehensive privacy laws. Among other things, these state-specific laws create new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provide new privacy rights to state residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. A particular focus of legislatures appears to be consumer health data which is not subject to HIPAA, as evidenced by passage of the Washington My Health My Data Act and Nevada Senate Bill 370. The CCPA also created a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach, and other laws, such as the Telephone Consumer Privacy Act and the Washington My Health My Data Act, also have private rights of action for violations. Regulations implementing the California and Colorado laws have been published, but many questions remain as to how all of the new statutes will be interpreted and enforced. The effects of state data protection laws are significant and have required us to modify our data processing practices. They may also cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to ensure ongoing compliance, particularly given our base of operations in California. Various U.S. state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals and state agencies in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable information.\n22\nIn addition to the laws discussed above, we may see more stringent state and federal privacy legislation passed, as the increased cyber-attacks during recent international conflicts have once again put a spotlight on data privacy and security in the U.S. and other jurisdictions. We cannot predict where new legislation might arise, the scope of such legislation, or the potential impact to our business and operations.\nFCPA and Other Anti-Bribery and Anti-Corruption Laws. \nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA would include interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries, either directly or through our contracted distributors. Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and/or regulations.\nPhysician Payment Sunshine Act. \nPursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that was signed into law in March 2010, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. As a manufacturer of U.S. FDA‑regulated devices reimbursable by federal healthcare programs, we are subject to this law, which requires us to track and annually report certain direct or indirect payments and other transfers of value we make to certain U.S.-licensed health care practitioners and U.S. teaching hospitals. We are also required to report certain ownership or investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In 2018, the law was amended to require tracking and reporting of payments and transfers of value provided to health care practitioners besides physicians, including physician assistants, nurse practitioners, and other mid-level practitioners. \nThese expanded reporting requirements took effect in 2022 for payments and transfers of value made to these additional practitioner-types in 2021.\n CMS has the potential to impose penalties of up to $1,406,728 per year (adjusted annually) for violations of the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, depending on the circumstances, and reported payments also have the potential to draw scrutiny to our relationships with health care practitioners and academic medical institutions, which may have implications under the Anti-Kickback Statute and other healthcare laws. CMS has the right to audit reporting entities for compliance. CMS began its first audits in fiscal year 2023.\nIn addition, certain states also have laws and regulations related to payments and other transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities. Similar to the federal law, certain states have adopted marketing and/or transparency laws relevant to device manufacturers, some of which are broader in scope. Certain states also mandate that device manufacturers implement compliance programs. Other states impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. The need to build and maintain a robust compliance program with different compliance and/or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a company may violate one or more of the requirements, resulting in fines and penalties.\nInternational Regulation\nInternational sales of medical devices are subject to international government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in an international country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.\nThe regulatory framework governing medical devices is largely harmonized within the European Union, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. To be placed on the European Union market, devices must undergo a conformity assessment and bear the CE mark, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable rules. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third-party assessment, which may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product, is always required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union, except in case of Class I medical devices (those entailing the lowest level of risk). Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval needs to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our products. The European Union Medical Device Regulation, or MDR, went into force in 2017, and replaced the existing Directive. The MDR initially provided three years for transition and compliance, which was subsequently extended to May 2026, December 2027, or December 2028, depending on the device classification. The MDR became applicable in the European Union on May 26, 2021, changing several aspects of the existing regulatory framework. Other countries have adopted medical device regulatory regimes, such as the Classification Rules for Medical Devices published by the Hong Kong Department of Health, the Health Sciences Authority of \n23\nSingapore regulation of medical devices under the Health Products Act, and Health Canada’s risk classification system for invasive devices, among others. Each country may have its own processes and requirements for medical device licensing, approval, and regulation, therefore requiring us to seek regulatory approvals on a country-by-country basis.\nOutside the United States a range of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, as well and some industry-specific laws and codes of conduct, apply to the medical device industry and interactions with government officials and entities and healthcare professionals. Laws include the UK Bribery Act of 2010. Further, the EU member countries have emphasized a greater focus on healthcare fraud and abuse and have indicated greater attention to the industry by the European Anti-Fraud Office. MedTech Europe, the medical device industry association, also introduced the Code of Ethical Business Practices, which came into effect on January 1, 2017. Countries in Asia have also become more active in their enforcement of anti-bribery laws and with respect to procurement and supply chain fraud.\nIn the European Union, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have substantial impact on the use of patient data across the healthcare industry became effective in May 2018. The EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, applies across the European Union and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The GDPR fine framework can be up to 20 million euros, or up to 4% of the company’s total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. The GDPR also requires companies processing personal data of individuals residing in the European Union to comply with EU privacy and data protection rules, even if the company itself does not have a physical presence in the European Union. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities. Due to the strong consumer protection aspects of the GDPR, companies subject to its purview are allocating substantial legal costs to the development of necessary policies and procedures and overall compliance efforts. We expect continued costs associated with maintaining compliance with GDPR into the future. For example, on July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment in Case C-311/18 that declared the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework invalid (Data Protection Commissioner v Facebook Ireland Ltd and Maximillian Schrems, also knowns as “Schrems II”). In the absence of the new adequacy decision, this judgment still results in additional compliance obligations for companies that rely on mechanisms other than the Privacy Shield, like standard contractual clauses and appropriate supplementary measures to ensure a valid basis for the transfer of personal data outside of Europe. Though a new adequacy decision (the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework) has been adopted, and it may also be subject to challenges similar to those faced by the Privacy Shield. In view of this and other developments, data transfer risk remains a potential issue that requires regular monitoring. We expect continued costs associated with maintaining compliance with the GDPR into the future, and these requirements, as interpreted by EU data protection authorities, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain governments around the world are also adopting laws and regulations pertaining to mandatory corporate sustainability reporting. For example, the European Union has adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) that will require us to disclose certain social, governance and environmental information and data.\nEnvironmental Regulation\nOur research and development and clinical processes involve the handling of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous and biological materials and we incur expenses relating to compliance with these laws and regulations. If violations of environmental, health and safety laws occur, we could be held liable for damages, penalties and costs of remedial actions. These expenses or this liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition. We may violate environmental, health and safety laws in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Environmental laws could become more stringent over time, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations. We are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political, business and environmental groups. Changes to or restrictions on permitting requirements or processes, hazardous or biological material storage or handling might require an unplanned capital investment or relocation. Failure to comply with new or existing laws or regulations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdvisory Boards and Consultants\nWe have relied upon the advice of experts in the development and commercialization of our products. Since 2005, we have used experts in various disciplines on a consulting basis as needed to solve problems or accelerate development pathways. We may continue to engage advisors from the academic, consultancy, governmental or \n24\nother areas to assist us as necessary. Relationships between manufacturers and physicians, including in consultancy and advisory board roles, is subject to scrutiny under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and its state law equivalents. Due to this scrutiny, we incur legal and consulting fees to ensure our relationships with physicians and other health care providers meet regulatory requirements, including that compensation paid to such physicians is within fair market value.\nHuman Capital\nWe aim to foster an inclusive and engaging culture that values each person’s unique skill set and to continue to attract – and retain – top talent throughout the organization. 2024 represented a year of continued growth across Dexcom; our employee population grew both by number and global footprint. Our consistent support of hybrid work provides access to a broader talent pool. As of December 31, 2024, we have approximately 10,300 employees around the globe, including 10,200 full-time employees.\nCountry\nFemale\nMale\nGrand Total\nEthnically Diverse\n(US Only)*\nUnited States\n2,400 \n2,900 \n5,300 \n3,100 \nInternational\n2,700 \n2,300 \n5,000 \nN/A\nGrand Total**\n5,100 \n5,200 \n10,300 \n3,100 \n*All diversity data is self-reported. We capture ethnic diversity data in the United States only, comprised of the following categories: Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Two or More Races.\n**Includes full time and part time employees.\nThe human capital measures and objectives that we focus on include equity and inclusion; communications and engagement; health, safety and wellness; total rewards and pay equity; and talent growth and development.\nEquity and Inclusion\nOur journey to create a more equitable and inclusive workplace continues. As Dexcom continues to grow and scale, we believe our initiatives have been critical not only for company culture but also for the growing diversity of patients our products will benefit across the globe.\nOur human resources team, Employee Resource Group sponsors (ERG), and senior leaders work together to advance the broader equity strategy across the organization. We are proud to support our ERGs; their employee-led activities and initiatives foster a sense of belonging throughout all our global locations. We integrate equity and inclusion into talent conversations, especially at senior levels, making our processes fairer for all Dexcom employees.\nCommunications and Engagement\nThrough strategic communications, we continue to strengthen the connection between our leaders and our business goals, as well as the behaviors needed to drive a positive employee experience. We also believe by listening to our employees, we can create a dynamic workplace that will foster productivity while promoting work-life balance and connection across the organization. We have continued to seek out “the voice of the employee” through life cycle surveys. Each year, we offer an engagement survey titled “We’re Listening.” Employee engagement scores consistently remained high based on a six-factor index. Notably, a strong majority of employees indicated they are proud to work for Dexcom and see a clear link between their work and the Dexcom mission.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\nWe are deeply committed to the safety, health and wellness of our employees. The Dexcom Environmental, Health, Safety & Sustainability team develops global safety practices and procedures, trains employees, and monitors compliance. Through these efforts, along with leadership commitment and investment of resources in support of workplace safety initiatives, our total US injury rate has consistently tracked below industry averages.\nWe also provide comprehensive health and well-being programs that support our employees and their families. For example, Inspire, our global wellness program, and our global mental health and employee assistance programs are designed to help employees and their family members develop and achieve their physical, emotional, and financial well-being goals.\n25\nOur goal to support our employees’ needs remains constant. We continued to provide both COVID and flu vaccination clinics for employees and their families, and continued support of remote work for employees whose roles allow for it. We also continue to evaluate how to maintain a hybrid workplace beyond the pandemic to ensure that we meet our employees’ ever-changing needs outside the workplace.\nTotal Rewards and Pay Equity\nOur total rewards package includes market competitive pay, comprehensive and competitive global benefits and retirement offerings, paid time off and family leave, tuition reimbursement and on-site services. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of employees with shareholders, we offer an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and restricted stock units are provided to eligible employees under our broad-based stock incentive programs.\nIn 2024, we continued our proactive year-end global market adjustment process intended to ensure we maintain pay equity between active employees and potential new external hires. Through this process, employees who meet predefined criteria may be eligible for an additional adjustment in base salary if they have fallen below Dexcom’s determined minimum. We believe by continuing to ensure equitable pay between existing and new hires, we will be better positioned to retain valued employees.\nAdditionally, we continue to proactively review both gender and ethnicity pay equity for our global employees in the same or similar roles. The goal of these reviews is to identify and close any gaps in average pay, after accounting for legitimate business factors that may explain differences, such as performance, time in role, and tenure with the company. We have incorporated the findings into our compensation assessment cycles, and we recognize the need to regularly review pay equity to maintain our pay equity goals. With the implementation of our global market adjustment process, we conduct the gender and ethnicity review annually.\nTalent Growth and Development\nWe continue to invest in new learning systems and programming to support employee development. To support the personal and professional growth of our workforce, we have built an extensive library of development offerings to empower employees at all levels to advance their skill sets and knowledge base. Because there is no one-size-fits-all approach to career development, we continue to evolve our curriculum to meet the needs of our diverse workforce.\nAdditional details regarding our human capital and other matters can be found in our Sustainability Report. Although not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our Sustainability Report can be accessed on our investors website at investors.dexcom.com, by clicking “Governance Documents & Sustainability”.\n26",
    "item1a": "Item 1A of this Annual Report, cybersecurity threats pose multiple risks to us, including potentially to our results of operations and financial condition. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Privacy and Security.” As cybersecurity threats become more frequent, sophisticated and coordinated, it is reasonably likely that we will be required to expend greater resources as we pursue our strategy of continuously modifying and enhancing our protective measures while developing and commercializing products that incorporate our CGM technologies and integrate with the insulin delivery systems or data platforms of our partners. \nThe technology integration and cloud-based depository platforms we continue to focus on can make us more vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, thereby making our pursuit of such strategies more costly.\nGovernance\nOur Board of Directors is responsible for exercising oversight of management’s identification and management of, and planning for, risks from cybersecurity threats. \nWhile the full Board has overall responsibility for risk oversight, the Board has delegated oversight responsibility related to risks from cybersecurity threats to the Board’s Technology Committee.\n The Technology Committee reports to the Board as necessary with respect to its activities, including making such reports and recommendations to the Board and its other committees as necessary and appropriate and consistent with its purpose, described below.\n69\nThe Technology Committee, comprised of independent Board members, is responsible for reviewing cybersecurity, privacy, data protection and other major technology risk exposures of the Company, the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures, and the Company’s compliance with applicable cybersecurity and data privacy laws and industry standards. These reviews are provided at least annually. The Technology Committee receives management updates and reports, primarily through the Company’s Cybersecurity and Privacy Committee, a multidisciplinary team responsible for the overall governance, decision-making, risk management, awareness and compliance for cybersecurity and privacy activities across the Company.\nThe Cybersecurity and Privacy Committee is co-chaired by our \nInformation Security Officer (ISO)\n, Product Security Officer (PSO), and Chief Privacy Officer (CPO), and its members include executive officers of the Company, including our Chief Technology Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Legal Officer, as well as representatives from the finance, internal audit, quality, regulatory, and legal teams. Management’s role in assessing and managing the material risks from cybersecurity threats is accomplished primarily through the committee.\nMembers of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Committee have broad ranges of expertise and experience in information technology and security. Our ISO, a co-chair of the committee, has over fifteen years of experience in the field of information security management, having previously led security operations and infrastructure and IT functions for a public university campus and a non-profit organization, and holds several licenses and certifications relating to information security, including a Certified Information Systems Security Manager from the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), a Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP) from the International Information Security System Security Certification Consortium (ISC2) and several technical cybersecurity certifications from the Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC). Our PSO, also a co-chair of the committee, has over twenty-five years of previous experience in cyber security architecture and cyber security management for a number of large Fortune 500 technology companies and holds several certifications including CISSP from the International Information Security System Security Certification Consortium, C-CISO from EC-Council, Numerous certifications from Microsoft, CISCO, Juniper, Checkpoint among others and has completed several advanced GIAC security classes from the SANS Institute.\nOur ISO reports directly to our Senior Vice President, Chief Information Officer (CIO), who is a member of the committee. She has held this role at Dexcom since 2024 and is responsible for global information technology at Dexcom. Our CIO brings 30 years of diverse strategic and operational experience in IT management, data engineering, AI, digital, ecommerce, infrastructure modernization and supply chain. Prior to Dexcom, our CIO served as Senior Vice President, Chief Information Officer at Bausch + Lomb. Additionally, our CIO has held transformational roles at Johnson & Johnson, Bristol Myers Squibb, American Standard and Price Waterhouse Coopers. She holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics and Management Information Systems from the University of Delaware. Our Executive Vice President, Chief Technology Officer (CTO) is also a member of the committee. Our CTO has held this role since 2022 and has 25 years of experience spanning consumer electronics, data storage, IoT and broadband industries. From 2011 to 2022 he worked at Technicolor (now known as Vantiva), most recently serving as Chief Technology Officer and General Manager of the Broadband Business Division. In addition to an MBA, he holds a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering.\nThe prevention, detection, mitigation and remediation of cybersecurity incidents at Dexcom is accomplished pursuant to various policies, procedures and processes, including incident response plans and the cybersecurity and privacy programs and controls described above under “Risk Management and Strategy.” These measures include escalation protocols through which the Cybersecurity and Privacy Committee is informed about cybersecurity and incidents by our ISO and PSO, who are informed through our business units. As described above, members of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Committee provide updates to the \nTechnology Committee of the Board\n on a regular basis, and the full Board receives updates from the Technology Committee. In addition, there are protocols in place for immediate escalation in the event of any cybersecurity issues or developments that may require consideration between regularly scheduled Technology Committee or Board meetings.\n70",

    "item1c": "ITEM 1C - CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have processes in place for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, which are integrated into our overall enterprise risk management processes.\n The processes for assessing, identifying and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, including threats associated with our use of third-party service providers, include identifying the relevant assets that could be affected, determining possible threat sources and threat events, assessing threats based on their potential likelihood and impact, and identifying controls that are in place or necessary to manage and/or mitigate such risks.\nWe have established cybersecurity and privacy programs to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, availability, and privacy of protected information and ensure compliance with relevant security/privacy regulations, contractual requirements, and industry-standard frameworks. \nOur cybersecurity program includes annual review and assessment by external, independent third parties, who certify and report on these programs.\n For example, our Information Security Management System (ISMS) is certified as being in conformity with ISO/IEC 27001 by SRI Quality System Registrar. We maintain cybersecurity and privacy policies and procedures in accordance with industry-standard control frameworks and applicable regulations, laws, and standards. All corporate cybersecurity policies are reviewed and approved by senior leadership at least annually as part of our ISMS.\nOur cybersecurity controls, which are the mechanisms in place to prevent, detect and mitigate threats in accordance with our policies and procedures, are based on the regulatory requirements to which we are subject and are monitored and tested both internally and externally by third parties at least annually.\n These controls include regular system updates and patches, employee training on cybersecurity and privacy requirements, incident reporting, and the use of encryption to secure sensitive information. In addition, we also regularly perform phishing tests of our employees and update our training plan at least annually. We maintain business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities to mitigate interruptions to critical information systems and/or the loss of data and services from the effects of natural or man-made disasters to Dexcom locations. We also provide annual privacy and security training for all employees. Our security training incorporates awareness of cyber threats (including but not limited to malware, ransomware and social engineering attacks), password hygiene, incident reporting process, as well as physical security best practices.\nIn the last three fiscal years, we have not experienced any material cybersecurity incidents and the expenses we have incurred from security incidents were immaterial. \nAs a result, we do not believe that risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incidents, have materially affected us, our results of operations and financial condition.\n However, as discussed under “Risk Factors” in Part I,"
