Business for further discussion of the Company's segments.\nDow’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is Operating EBIT as this is the manner in which the chief executive officer, chief operating officer, chief financial officer, general counsel and corporate secretary, and senior vice president of corporate development, together the \"executive committee\" and chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"), assesses performance and allocates resources. The CODM compares quarterly results to both the year-ago and sequential periods to assess performance and allocate resources to each segment. The Company defines Operating EBIT as earnings (i.e., \"Income before income taxes\") before interest, excluding the impact of significant items. Operating EBIT by segment includes all operating items relating to the businesses; items that principally apply to Dow as a whole are assigned to Corporate. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliations of these measures.\n38\nTable of Contents\nFor comparison of segment results for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on January 31, 2024\n.\nPACKAGING & SPECIALTY PLASTICS\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nNet sales\n$\n21,776 \n$\n23,149 \nOperating EBIT\n$\n2,373 \n$\n2,700 \nEquity earnings\n$\n81 \n$\n130 \nPackaging & Specialty Plastics\nPercentage change from prior year\n2024\n2023\nChange in Net Sales from Prior Period due to:\nLocal price & product mix\n(4)\n%\n(16)\n%\nCurrency\n— \n— \nVolume\n(2)\n(5)\nTotal\n(6)\n%\n(21)\n%\n2024 Versus 2023\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics net sales were $21,776 million in 2024, down 6 percent from net sales of $23,149 million in 2023, with local price down 4 percent, volume down 2 percent and currency flat. Local price decreased in Packaging and Specialty Plastics in all geographic regions, primarily driven by lower pricing of downstream polymers. Local price was flat in Hydrocarbons & Energy. Volume increased in Packaging and Specialty Plastics, primarily in EMEAI and the U.S. & Canada, due to higher downstream polymers and polyethylene demand. Volume decreased in Hydrocarbons & Energy in all geographic regions, led by EMEAI, primarily driven by higher internal derivative demand and lighter feedslate cracking. \nOperating EBIT was $2,373 million in 2024, down $327 million from Operating EBIT of $2,700 million in 2023. Operating EBIT decreased primarily due to lower selling prices, lower volumes in Hydrocarbons & Energy, higher planned maintenance costs, and the impact of an unplanned ethylene facility outage, which were partially offset by lower raw material, energy and feedstock costs.\nINDUSTRIAL INTERMEDIATES & INFRASTRUCTURE\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nNet sales\n$\n11,869 \n$\n12,538 \nOperating EBIT\n$\n125 \n$\n124 \nEquity losses\n$\n(102)\n$\n(276)\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure\nPercentage change from prior year\n2024\n2023\nChange in Net Sales from Prior Period due to:\nLocal price & product mix\n(6)\n%\n(14)\n%\nCurrency\n— \n(1)\nVolume\n1 \n(9)\nTotal\n(5)\n%\n(24)\n%\n2024 Versus 2023\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure net sales were $11,869 million in 2024, down 5 percent from $12,538 million in 2023, with local price down 6 percent, volume up 1 percent and currency flat. Local price \n39\nTable of Contents\ndecreased in both businesses and across all geographic regions, led by industrial and building and construction applications. Volume in Industrial Solutions increased, led by industrial and coatings applications, and in all geographic regions except the U.S. & Canada, which was flat, reflecting the impacts of an outage in 2023 at the Louisiana Operations Glycol-2 unit in Plaquemine, Louisiana, which successfully restarted in June 2024. Volume in Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals decreased in all geographic regions, except EMEAI, driven by lower demand, particularly in consumer durables and industrial applications, which were partially offset by an increase in building and construction applications. \nOperating EBIT was $125 million in 2024, up $1 million from Operating EBIT of $124 million in 2023. Operating EBIT increased primarily due to lower raw material and feedstock costs and improved results at the EQUATE and Sadara joint ventures, which were offset by lower selling prices in both businesses and the impact of an outage in 2023 at the Louisiana Operations Glycol-2 unit in Plaquemine, Louisiana, which successfully restarted in June 2024.\nPERFORMANCE MATERIALS & COATINGS\nPerformance Materials & Coatings\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nNet sales\n$\n8,574 \n$\n8,497 \nOperating EBIT\n$\n318 \n$\n219 \nEquity earnings\n$\n11 \n$\n20 \nPerformance Materials & Coatings\nPercentage change from prior year\n2024\n2023\nChange in Net Sales from Prior Period due to:\nLocal price & product mix\n(3)\n%\n(15)\n%\nCurrency\n(1)\n(1)\nVolume\n5 \n(5)\nTotal\n1 \n%\n(21)\n%\n2024 Versus 2023\nPerformance Materials & Coatings net sales were $8,574 million in 2024, up 1 percent from net sales of $8,497 million in 2023, with volume up 5 percent, local price down 3 percent and an unfavorable currency impact of 1 percent. Volume increased in both businesses. In Coatings & Performance Monomers, volume increased in all geographic regions except EMEAI, led by acrylic monomers. Volume increased in Consumer Solutions in all geographic regions, primarily in downstream silicones, led by consumer and electronics and home and personal care applications. Local price decreased in both businesses and was broad-based. In Coatings & Performance Monomers, local price decreased in all geographic regions except Asia Pacific, and in Consumer Solutions local price decreased in all geographic regions. Currency was flat in Coatings & Performance Monomers and had an unfavorable impact on sales in Consumer Solutions, driven by Asia Pacific.\nOperating EBIT was $318 million in 2024, up $99 million from Operating EBIT of $219 million in 2023. Operating EBIT increased primarily due to improved demand and higher operating rates, which were partially offset by lower selling prices and higher raw material costs.\nCORPORATE\nCorporate\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nNet sales\n$\n745 \n$\n438 \nOperating EBIT\n$\n(228)\n$\n(265)\nEquity earnings\n$\n4 \n$\n7 \n40\nTable of Contents\n2024 Versus 2023\nNet sales for Corporate, which primarily relate to the Company's insurance operations, were $745 million in 2024, up from net sales of $438 million in 2023, largely driven by premiums received for insurance policies covering third parties.\nOperating EBIT was a loss of $228 million in 2024, compared with a loss of $265 million in 2023. Operating EBIT improved primarily due to lower environmental costs and increased income from insurance operations.\nOUTLOOK\nOperating Segments & End-Market Expectations\nThe Company remains confident that it will benefit from the completion of its near-term incremental growth projects and an enhanced focus on operational discipline in 2025. In addition, the Company is optimistic that it will see further demand growth in attractive end-markets such as packaging, energy and electronics. Dow's differentiated portfolio and strong balance sheet enables it to deliver on all of its capital allocation priorities, including an industry-leading dividend. Until there are more definitive indications of a true recovery taking hold, and in order to deliver improved margins, the Company is taking actions to reduce its costs by approximately $1 billion and capital expenditures plan by $300 million to $500 million. Dow will complete these actions while staying the course on its long-term strategic priorities. The Company's proactive interventions are necessary for it to continue to successfully navigate this economic downcycle.\nIn Packaging & Specialty Plastics, supply improvements driven by new polyethylene capacity coming online during 2025, combined with improved reliability, will allow the Company to continue to drive volume growth and improve margins. Local prices are expected to be impacted by market supply and demand dynamics as well as volatility in feedstocks due to sensitivity to external economic and geopolitical factors. The Company’s feedstock flexibility and advantaged regional footprint will continue to position the segment well to navigate market dynamics throughout the year. In-region presence and superior derivative flexibility will allow the segment to continue to optimize price and volume mix.\nIn Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, improved demand is expected based on improving fiscal conditions resulting from interest rate cuts across several regions. The Company will benefit from the full-year impact of resumed production at the Louisiana Operations Glycol-2 unit in Plaquemine, Louisiana, which successfully restarted in June 2024. Recent and in-flight growth investments in specialty amines and alkoxylation capacity are expected to support long-term, above GDP volume growth in key markets including energy transition, pharmaceuticals and consumer health, and sustainable surfactants.\nIn Performance Materials & Coatings, the Company will continue to prioritize key end-markets in performance silicones in which its innovation and footprint can drive value and volume growth above GDP. Pricing for specialty products is expected to remain relatively stable, with anticipated modest but steady economic expansion. Volume growth is expected in feedstocks and intermediates on improved regional supply and demand dynamics, and while competitive pressures in the market impacting local price persist, lower interest rates are expected to drive improved demand and local price. Market conditions impacting sales of coatings are expected to improve compared with recent years based on lower interest rates and an increase in residential spending.\nProjected Sources and Uses of Cash\nItems that may impact the consolidated statements of cash flows in 2025 include:\n•\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately $3 billion to $3.2 billion.\n•\nCash inflows related to the Company's sale of a 40 percent ownership stake in its Dow InfraCo, LLC subsidiary are expected to be approximately $2.4 billion.\n•\nCash dividends from equity companies are expected to be approximately $300 million. \n•\nCash contributions to pension plans are expected to be approximately $175 million.\n \n•\nCash outflows related to the Company's 2023 Restructuring Program, including restructuring implementation costs, are expected to be approximately $100 million.\n•\nCash outflows related to the Company's targeted actions to further achieve its cost reduction initiatives, including implementation costs, are expected to be $100 million to $150 million.\n41\nTable of Contents\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2,189 million at December 31, 2024 and $2,987 million at December 31, 2023, of which $1,427 million at December 31, 2024 and $1,984 million at December 31, 2023, was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including U.S. territories. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States. \nCash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. Dow has the ability to repatriate additional funds to the United States, which could result in an adjustment to the tax liability for foreign withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes and the impact of foreign currency movements. At December 31, 2024, management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the United States. The Company has and expects to continue repatriating certain funds from its non-U.S. subsidiaries that are not needed to finance local operations; however, these particular repatriation activities have not and are not expected to result in a significant incremental tax liability to the Company.\nFor comparison of cash flows for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on January 31, 2024.\nThe Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:\nCash Flow Summary\nDow Inc.\nTDCC\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCash provided by (used for):\nOperating activities - continuing operations\n$\n2,903 \n$\n5,164 \n$\n2,939 \n$\n5,109 \nOperating activities - discontinued operations\n11 \n32 \n— \n— \nOperating activities\n$\n2,914 \n$\n5,196 \n$\n2,939 \n$\n5,109 \nInvesting activities\n$\n(2,368)\n$\n(2,928)\n$\n(2,368)\n$\n(2,928)\nFinancing activities\n$\n(1,168)\n$\n(3,115)\n$\n(1,193)\n$\n(3,028)\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2024 was primarily driven by the Company's cash earnings and dividends from equity method investments, which were partially offset by cash used for working capital, performance-based compensation payments, pension contributions and severance payments related to the 2023 Restructuring Program. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2023 was primarily driven by the Company's cash earnings, dividends from equity method investments and cash provided by working capital, which were partially offset by performance-based compensation payments, severance payments related to the 2023 Restructuring Program and pension contributions.\nNet Working Capital and Current Ratio at Dec 31\nDow Inc.\nTDCC\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nCurrent assets\n$\n16,590 \n$\n17,614 \n$\n16,565 \n$\n17,676 \nCurrent liabilities\n10,288 \n9,957 \n10,210 \n9,849 \nNet working capital\n$\n6,302 \n$\n7,657 \n$\n6,355 \n$\n7,827 \nCurrent ratio\n1.61:1\n1.77:1\n1.62:1\n1.79:1\nWorking Capital Metrics\nTwelve Months Ended\nDec 31, 2024\nDec 31, 2023\nDays sales outstanding in trade receivables\n40 \n42 \nDays sales in inventory\n60 \n60 \nDays payables outstanding\n60 \n64 \n42\nTable of Contents\nCash provided by operating activities from discontinued operations reflected cash payments and receipts for certain agreements and matters related to the Company's separation from DowDuPont Inc.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used for investing activities in 2024 and 2023 was primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of investments, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. In addition, 2024 included a cash inflow for the sale of the flexible packaging laminating adhesives business and a cash outflow for the acquisition of Circulus Holdings, LLC, a U.S. mechanical recycling company.\nThe Company's capital expenditures were $2,940 million in 2024 and $2,356 million in 2023. Capital spending was higher in 2024 as the Company continued the ramp up of investments in its higher return, lower risk and quicker payback incremental growth projects, and also included ramp up of the construction of the Fort Saskatchewan Path2Zero project aligned to the Company's Decarbonize & Grow strategy. The Company expects capital spending in 2025 to be approximately $3 billion to $3.2 billion, which includes construction of the Fort Saskatchewan Path2Zero project. The Company expects capital spending for this key growth project to average approximately $1 billion annually through 2029. Enterprise-wide capital spending is expected to exceed depreciation and amortization through 2027, during the first phase of the project, and average depreciation and amortization over the economic cycle. As evidenced across prior economic cycles, the Company will adjust its spending as economic conditions evolve.\nCapital spending in recent years has included the addition of an integrated methylene diphenyl diisocyanate distillation and prepolymers facility in Freeport, Texas, which was completed in 2023; construction of a world-scale polyethylene unit on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which is expected to be completed in 2025; and construction of the world's first net-zero Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide equivalent (\"CO\n2\ne\") emissions integrated ethylene and derivatives complex in Alberta, Canada.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash used for financing activities in 2024 for Dow Inc. was primarily related to dividends paid to stockholders, purchases of treasury stock and payments on long-term debt, which were partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt. TDCC included cash outflows for dividends paid to Dow Inc. Cash used for financing activities in 2023 was primarily for debt related activities. In addition, Dow Inc. included cash outflows for dividends paid to stockholders and purchases of treasury stock. TDCC included cash outflows for dividends paid to Dow Inc. See Notes 14 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the issuance and retirement of debt and the Company's share repurchases and dividends.\nNon-GAAP Cash Flow Measures\nFree Cash Flow \nDow defines Free Cash Flow as \"Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations,\" less capital expenditures. Under this definition, Free Cash Flow represents the cash generated by Dow from operations after investing in its asset base. Free Cash Flow, combined with cash balances and other sources of liquidity, represents the cash available to fund obligations and provide returns to shareholders. Free Cash Flow is an integral financial measure used in the Company's financial planning process.\nOperating EBITDA\nDow defines Operating EBITDA as earnings (i.e., \"Income before income taxes\") before interest, depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact of significant items.\nCash Flow Conversion (Cash Flow From Operations to Operating EBITDA)\nDow defines Cash Flow Conversion (Cash flow from operations to Operating EBITDA) as \"Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations,\" divided by Operating EBITDA. Management believes Cash Flow Conversion is an important financial metric as it helps the Company determine how efficiently it is converting its earnings into cash flow.\nThese financial measures are not recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") and should not be viewed as alternatives to GAAP financial measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, Dow's definitions may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies. \n43\nTable of Contents\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Cash Flow Measures\nDow Inc.\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nCash provided by operating activities - continuing operations (GAAP)\n$\n2,903 \n$\n5,164 \nCapital expenditures\n(2,940)\n(2,356)\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\n$\n(37)\n$\n2,808 \nReconciliation of Cash Flow Conversion (Cash Flow From Operations to Operating EBITDA)\nDow Inc.\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nNet income (GAAP)\n$\n1,201\n$\n660\n + Provision (credit) for income taxes\n399\n(4)\nIncome before income taxes\n$\n1,600\n$\n656\n -  Interest income\n200\n229\n + Interest expense and amortization of debt discount\n811\n746\n -  Significant items \n1\n(377)\n(1,605)\nOperating EBIT (non-GAAP)\n$\n2,588\n$\n2,778\n + Depreciation and amortization\n2,894\n2,611\nOperating EBITDA (non-GAAP)\n$\n5,482\n$\n5,389\nCash provided by operating activities - continuing operations (GAAP)\n$\n2,903\n$\n5,164\nCash flow from operations to net income (GAAP)\n241.7 \n%\n782.4 \n%\nCash Flow Conversion (Cash flow from operations to Operating EBITDA) (non-GAAP)\n53.0 \n%\n95.8 \n%\n1.\nThe year ended December 31, 2024, includes restructuring charges and implementation and efficiency costs associated with the Company's 2023 Restructuring Program, gains associated with a previously impaired equity investment, impairment charges related to the write-down of certain manufacturing assets, a charge related to an arbitration settlement agreement for historical product claims from a divested business and activity related to the separation from DowDuPont.

See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLiquidity & Financial Flexibility \nThe Company’s primary source of incremental liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. The generation of cash from operations and the Company's ability to access capital markets is expected to meet the Company’s cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt maturities, contributions to pension plans, dividend distributions to stockholders, share repurchases and other needs. In addition to cash from operating activities, the Company’s current liquidity sources also include TDCC's U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, committed and uncommitted accounts receivable facilities, a medium-term notes program, a U.S. retail note program (“InterNotes\n®\n”) and other debt markets.\nThe Company continues to maintain a strong financial position with all of its committed credit facilities undrawn and fully available at December 31, 2024. Cash and committed and available forms of liquidity were $12.0 billion at December 31, 2024, a decrease of $800 million from December 31, 2023. The Company also has no substantive long-term debt maturities due until 2027. Additional details on sources of liquidity are as follows:\nCommercial Paper\nTDCC issues promissory notes under its U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs.

Subsequent to December 31, 2024, TDCC issued commercial paper and had approximately $2.1 billion of commercial paper outstanding at February 4, 2025.\n44\nTable of Contents\nCommitted Credit Facilities\nThe Company also has the ability to access liquidity through TDCC's committed and available credit facilities. At December 31, 2024, TDCC had total committed and available credit facilities of $8.4 billion. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on committed and available credit facilities.\nUncommitted Credit Facilities\nThe Company has entered into various uncommitted bilateral credit arrangements as a potential source of excess liquidity. These lines can be used to support short-term liquidity needs and for general purposes. The Company had no drawdowns outstanding at December 31, 2024.\nAccounts Receivable Securitization Facilities\nIn addition to the above credit facilities, the Company maintains a committed accounts receivable facility in the United States where eligible trade accounts receivable, up to $900 million, may be sold at any point in time. The Company also maintains a committed accounts receivable facility in Europe where eligible trade accounts receivable, up to €500 million, may be sold at any point in time. In 2024, there were $290 million in sales of receivables under the U.S. and Europe committed accounts receivable facilities ($39 million in sales of receivables in 2023). At December 31, 2024, no material balances of sold receivables remained outstanding ($5 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2023). \nIn addition, the Company has an uncommitted accounts receivable facility in the United States providing additional liquidity. In 2024, sales of receivables under this facility were $378 million ($73 million in sales of receivables in 2023). At December 31, 2024, no material balances of sold receivables remained outstanding ($73 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2023). See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information\n. \nEarly Settlement of Letters of Credit\nThe Company utilizes, from time-to-time, letters of credit discounting programs to manage and expedite the settlement of letters of credit in certain regions. These letters of credit are associated with accounts receivable and the Company retains no interest in the transferred letters of credit or receivables once sold.\nAccounts Receivable Discounting Facilities\nThe Company has access to accounts receivable discounting facilities, under which receivables are transferred with limited recourse. The Company retains no interest in the transferred receivables once sold. In 2024, sales of receivables under these facilities were $865 million ($91 million in sales of receivables in 2023). At December 31, 2024, approximately $287 million of sold receivables were outstanding ($91 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2023). See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information\n.\nThe Company maintains these facilities and also participates in certain customers’ supply chain financing and other early pay programs as a routine source of working capital. \nLetters of Credit\nTDCC utilizes letters of credit to support commitments made in the ordinary course of business. While the terms and amounts of letters of credit change, TDCC generally has approximately $600 million of outstanding letters of credit at any given time.\nCompany-Owned Life Insurance\nThe Company has investments in company-owned life insurance (\"COLI\") policies, which are recorded at their cash surrender value as of each balance sheet date. The Company has the ability to monetize its investment in its COLI policies as an additional source of liquidity. The Company had no outstanding monetization of its existing COLI policies' surrender value at December 31, 2024 ($97 million at December 31, 2023). See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nShelf Registration - United States\nOn June 13, 2022, Dow Inc. and TDCC filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The shelf indicates that Dow Inc. may offer common stock; preferred stock; depositary shares; debt securities; guarantees; warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock and debt securities; and stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units, with pricing and availability of any such offerings depending on market conditions.

Also, in 2022, TDCC filed a prospectus supplement under this shelf registration to register an undetermined amount of securities for issuance under a medium-term notes program. In 2024, TDCC filed a prospectus supplement under this shelf registration to register $1.25 billion of securities for issuance in connection with its Green Finance Framework. The shelf registration expires on June 13, 2025. The Company expects to renew the shelf registration.\nDebt\nAs the Company continues to maintain its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, management is focused on net debt (a non-GAAP financial measure), as the Company believes this is the best representation of its financial leverage at this point in time. As shown in the following table, net debt is equal to total gross debt minus \"Cash and cash equivalents\" and \"Marketable securities.\"\nTotal Debt at Dec 31\nDow Inc.\nTDCC\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNotes payable\n$\n135\n$\n62\n$\n135\n$\n62\nLong-term debt due within one year\n497\n117\n497\n117\nLong-term debt\n15,711\n14,907\n15,711\n14,907\nGross debt\n$\n16,343\n$\n15,086\n$\n16,343\n$\n15,086\n - Cash and cash equivalents\n2,189\n2,987\n2,189\n2,987\n - Marketable securities \n1\n383\n1,300\n383\n1,300\nNet debt (non-GAAP)\n$\n13,771\n$\n10,799\n$\n13,771\n$\n10,799\nTotal equity\n$\n17,851\n$\n19,108\n$\n18,032\n$\n19,406\nGross debt as a percentage of total capitalization\n47.8 \n%\n44.1 \n%\n47.5 \n%\n43.7 \n%\nNet debt as a percentage of total capitalization (non-GAAP)\n43.5 \n%\n36.1 \n%\n43.3 \n%\n35.8 \n%\n1.\nIncluded in \"Other current assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company issued $1.25 billion of senior unsecured notes.

As a result of the redemption, the Company recognized a pretax gain on the early extinguishment of debt of $5 million, included in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Corporate.\nIn 2024, the Company issued an aggregate principal amount of $94 million of InterNotes\n®\n. The Company also issued $122 million of foreign currency loans. Additionally, the Company repaid $83 million of long-term debt at maturity.\nThe Company may at any time repurchase certain debt securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to: the applicable terms under which any such debt securities were issued, certain internal approvals of the Company, and applicable laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction in which any such potential transactions might take place. This in no way obligates the Company to make any such repurchases nor should it be considered an offer to do so.\nTDCC’s public debt instruments and primary, private credit agreements contain, among other provisions, certain customary restrictive covenant and default provisions. TDCC’s most significant debt covenant with regard to its financial position is the obligation to maintain the ratio of its consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization at no greater than 0.70 to 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (\"Revolving Credit Agreement\") equals or exceeds \n46\nTable of Contents\n$500 million. The ratio of TDCC’s consolidated indebtedness as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement was 0.45 to 1.00 at December 31, 2024. Management believes TDCC was in compliance with all of its covenants and default provisions at December 31, 2024. For information on TDCC's debt covenants and default provisions, see Note 14. There were no material changes to the debt covenants and default provisions related to TDCC’s outstanding long-term debt and primary, private credit agreements in 2024. \nDow Inc. is obligated, substantially concurrently with the issuance of any guarantee in respect of outstanding or committed indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, to enter into a supplemental indenture with TDCC and the trustee under TDCC’s existing 2008 base indenture governing certain notes issued by TDCC. Under such supplemental indenture, Dow Inc. will guarantee all outstanding debt securities and all amounts due under such existing base indenture and will become subject to certain covenants and events of default under the existing base indenture. \nIn addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement includes an event of default which would be triggered in the event Dow Inc. incurs or guarantees third party indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $250 million or engages in any material activity or directly owns any material assets, in each case, subject to certain conditions and exceptions. Dow Inc. may, at its option, cure the event of default by delivering an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee to the administrative agent within thirty days of the event or events giving rise to such event of default.\nNo such events have occurred or have been triggered at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to TDCC’s notes payable and long-term debt activity and information on TDCC’s debt covenants and default provisions.\nWhile taking into consideration the current economic environment, management expects that the Company will continue to have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet all of its business obligations.\nCredit Ratings\nTDCC's credit ratings at January 31, 2025 were as follows:\nCredit Ratings\nLong-Term Rating\nShort-Term Rating\nOutlook\nFitch Ratings\nBBB+\nF1\nStable\nMoody’s Ratings\nBaa1\nP-2\nNegative\nStandard & Poor’s\nBBB\nA-2\nStable\nFitch Ratings affirmed TDCC's BBB+ and F1 rating and its outlook of stable on July 1, 2024. Standard & Poor's affirmed TDCC's BBB and A-2 rating and its outlook of stable on July 1, 2024 and December 9, 2024. Moody's Ratings affirmed TDCC's Baa1 and P-2 rating and its outlook of stable on August 6, 2024, and re-affirmed TDCC's Baa1 and P-2 rating and revised its outlook to negative from stable on October 28, 2024. These credit agencies' decisions were made as part of their annual review process and reflect the Company's supportive financial policies, scale, liquidity and cost-advantaged footprint.\nDividends\nDow Inc.\nDow Inc. has paid dividends on a quarterly basis and expects to continue to do so, subject to approval by the Board. The dividends declared by the Board align to the Company's strategy announced in 2018 of returning approximately 45 percent of Operating Net Income to shareholders through dividends and total shareholder remuneration of approximately 65 percent, when including share repurchases, over the economic cycle. The Company defines Operating Net Income, a non-GAAP measure, as \"Net income available for Dow Inc. common stockholders,\" excluding the impact of significant items. The following tables provide information on dividends declared and paid to common stockholders: \nDividends Paid for the Years Ended Dec 31\n2024\n2023\nIn millions, except per share amounts\nDividends paid, per common share\n$\n2.80 \n$\n2.80 \nDividends paid to common stockholders\n$\n1,966 \n$\n1,972 \n47\nTable of Contents\nDow Inc.

Funding is accomplished through intercompany loans. TDCC's Board of Directors reviews and determines a dividend distribution to Dow Inc. to settle the intercompany loans. For the year ended December 31, 2024, TDCC declared $2,578 million of dividends to Dow Inc. and paid $2,485 million of dividends to Dow, Inc. ($2,510 million for the year ended December 31, 2023). At December 31, 2024, TDCC's intercompany loan balance with Dow Inc. was insignificant. See Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nShare Repurchase Program \nOn April 13, 2022, the Board approved a share repurchase program authorizing up to $3 billion for the repurchase of the Company's common stock, with no expiration date. The Company repurchased $494 million of its common stock in 2024. At December 31, 2024, approximately $931 million of the share repurchase program authorization remained available for repurchases. As previously announced, the Company intends to repurchase shares at a minimum to cover dilution over the economic cycle. The Company may from time to time expand its share repurchases beyond dilution, based on a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions, free cash flow generation, and the Dow share price. Any share repurchases, when coupled with the Company's dividends, are intended to implement the long-term strategy of targeting shareholder remuneration of approximately 65 percent over the economic cycle.\nPension Plans \nThe Company has both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the United States and a number of other countries. The Company’s funding policy is to contribute to funded plans when pension laws and/or economics either require or encourage funding. In 2024 and 2023, the Company contributed $121 million and $142 million to its pension plans, respectively, including contributions to fund benefit payments for its unfunded pension plans. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company received a pension plan reversion of approximately $70 million (approximately $90 million in the second quarter of 2023) for a portion of the excess funding of one of its plans in Europe, included in \"Other assets and liabilities, net\" in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company expects to contribute approximately $175 million to its pension plans in 2025, inclusive of a plan contribution previously expected to be made in 2024, now expected to be contributed in 2025. \nAs announced in 2021, all U.S. pension plans were frozen for substantially all employees who participated in the U.S. defined benefit pension programs ef\nfective December 31, 2023. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company spun off a portion of each of the Company’s existing tax-qualified U.S defined benefit pension plans into new tax-qualified pension plans, which include the tax-qualified benefit obligations for substantially all employees hired after January 1, 2008. These employees earned benefits based on a set percentage of annual pay, plus interest, and the spin of these plans provides the Company the ability to separately manage the assets and obligations of these plans with like benefits. In the second quarter of 2024, as part of its ongoing pension de-risking initiatives, the Company initiated the termination of the new tax-qualified pension plans. As part of the plan termination process, the Company will offer participants of these plans annuity or lump sum distribution options. Final asset distributions are expected to be paid from plan assets in the fourth quarter of 2025. The Company anticipates that these asset distributions will result in pension settlement charges, with the amounts dependent on various factors, including interest rates, plan asset returns, annuity pricing and participant distribution elections.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the Company’s pension plans.\n48\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring\nThe actions related to the 2023 Restructuring Program are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of $60 million, primarily through the first quarter of 2025 and consist primarily of severance and related benefit costs. Restructuring implementation and efficiency costs, primarily decommissioning and demolition activities related to asset actions, and costs associated with the Company's productivity and efficiency actions, are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of approximately $40 million, primarily through the first quarter of 2025. Restructuring implementation and efficiency costs totaled $230 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 ($243 million for the year ended December 31, 2023).\nThe Company expects to incur additional costs in the future related to its restructuring activities, which will be recognized as incurred. The Company also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's restructuring activities.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations, commercial commitments and expected cash requirements for interest at December 31, 2024.

In addition to these items, Dow Inc. includes liabilities related to noncurrent obligations with DuPont and Corteva. The table excludes uncertain tax positions due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with the respective taxing authorities and deferred tax liabilities as it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact related to these liabilities. The table also excludes deferred revenue as it does not represent future cash requirements arising from contractual payment obligations.\nThe Company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations.\n49\nTable of Contents\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements are obligations the Company has with nonconsolidated entities related to transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements. The Company holds variable interests in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these joint ventures and therefore is not required to consolidate these entities (see Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the transfer of financial assets.\nGuarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, committed accounts receivable facilities and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specific triggering events occur. Additional information related to guarantees can be found in the “Guarantees” section of Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \nFair Value Measurements \nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets; see Note 21 for information related to other-than-temporary impairments; and, see Note 22 for additional information concerning fair value measurements. \nOTHER MATTERS\nRecent Accounting Guidance\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of recent accounting guidance.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Following are the Company’s accounting policies impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates:\nAsbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation\nUnion Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past several decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide’s premises, and Union Carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. (\"Amchem\"). Each year, Ankura Consulting Group, LLC (\"Ankura\") performs a review for Union Carbide based upon historical asbestos claims, resolution and asbestos-related defense and processing costs, through the terminal year of 2049. Union Carbide compares current asbestos claim and resolution activity, including asbestos-related defense and processing costs, to the results of the most recent Ankura study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the asbestos-related liability continues to be appropriate.\nFor additional information, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings; Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company determines the costs of environmental remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on evaluations of current law and existing technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. At December 31, 2024, the Company had accrued obligations of $1,113 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $234 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. This is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n50\nTable of Contents\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could have been settled at December 31, 2024, rate of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. The U.S. pension plans represent 73 percent of the Company’s pension plan assets and 70 percent of the pension obligations. The U.S. pension plans were frozen effective December 31, 2023, and therefore, participants do not accrue additional benefits for future service and compensation.\nThe Company uses the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the United States and other selected countries, as applicable. Under the spot rate approach, the Company calculates service cost and interest cost by applying individual spot rates from the Willis Towers Watson RATE:Link yield curve (based on high-quality corporate bond yields) for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost; service cost and interest cost for all other plans are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations.\nThe following information relates to the U.S. plans only; a similar approach is used for the Company’s non-U.S. plans.\nThe Company determines the expected long-term rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the Company's Investment Committee and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class. The Company’s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered. The expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience. The expected long-term rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year. The weighted-average long-term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2024 was 7.07 percent. The weighted-average assumption to be used for determining 2025 net periodic pension expense is 7.04 percent. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the Company’s pension plans.\nThe discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the U.S. plans are based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date. Future expected actuarially determined cash flows for the Company’s U.S. plans are individually discounted at the spot rates under the Willis Towers Watson U.S. RATE:Link 60-90 corporate yield curve (based on 60th to 90th percentile high-quality corporate bond yields) to arrive at the plan’s obligations as of the measurement date. The weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligations increased to 5.74 percent at December 31, 2024, from 5.30 percent at December 31, 2023.\nAt December 31, 2024, the net underfunded status of the U.S. tax-qualified plans on a projected benefit obligation basis was $1,360 million. The net underfunded amount increased $168 million compared with December 31, 2023. The increase in the net underfunded amount in 2024 was primarily due to the unfavorable returns on plan assets partially offset by the market-related impact of higher discount rates. The Company uses a generational mortality table to determine the duration of its pension and other postretirement obligations.\nThe following discussion relates to the Company’s significant pension plans.\nThe Company bases the determination of pension expense on a market-related valuation of plan assets that reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets. Since the market-related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. Over the life of the plans, both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized. At December 31, 2024, net losses of $2,899 million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of plan assets. These net \n51\nTable of Contents\nlosses will result in increases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the market-related value of assets. \nThe net decrease in the market-related value of assets due to the recognition of prior losses is presented in the following table:\nNet Decrease in Market-Related Asset Value Due to Recognition of Prior Losses\nIn millions\n2025\n$\n1,126 \n2026\n1,264 \n2027\n266 \n2028\n243 \nTotal\n$\n2,899 \nExcluding the impact of the Company's 2024 one-time pension events, the Company expects net periodic benefit cost (\"NPBC\") credit to decrease in 2025 by approximately $88 million compared with 2024. The reduction in the NPBC credit is due to a smaller expected increase in assets and increased amortization, partially offset by reduced interest and service cost.\nA 25 basis point increase or decrease in the long-term return on assets assumption would change the Company’s NPBC credit for 2025 by $48 million. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would increase the Company's NPBC credit for 2025 by $9 million. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would decrease the Company's NPBC credit for 2025 by $8 million. \nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had a net deferred tax asset balance of $865 million, after valuation allowances of $2,748 million.\nIn evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, the Company relies on, in order of increasing subjectivity, taxable income in prior carryback years, the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results.\nThe Company files tax returns in multiple jurisdictions and is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Tax authorities have the ability to review and challenge matters that could be subject to differing interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of tax attributes. The ultimate resolution of such uncertainties could last several years. When an uncertain tax position is identified, the Company considers and interprets complex tax laws and regulations    in order to determine the need for recognizing a provision in its financial statements. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and measurement of uncertain tax positions. The Company utilizes internal and external expertise in interpreting tax laws to support the Company's tax positions. The Company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. At December 31, 2024, the Company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of $422 million and $327 million for interest and penalties.\nGoodwill\nThe Company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are the level at which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by business management on a regular basis. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter), or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative and/or quantitative testing procedures. At December 31, 2024, goodwill was carried by five out of six of the Company's reporting units.\n52\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the Company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the Company chooses not to complete a qualitative assessment for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is required.\nQuantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with its carrying value. If the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units. This valuation technique has been selected by management as the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the Company's reporting units. However, where market comparables are available, the Company includes EBIT/EBITDA multiples as part of the reporting unit valuation analysis. The discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions: projected revenue growth rates or compounded annual growth rates, discount rates, tax rates, terminal values, currency exchange rates, and forecasted long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices, by geographic region and by year, which include the Company's key feedstocks as well as natural gas and crude oil (due to its correlation to naphtha). Currency exchange rates and long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices are established for the Company as a whole and applied consistently to all reporting units, while revenue growth rates, discount rates and tax rates are established by reporting unit to account for differences in business fundamentals and industry risk. These key assumptions drive projected EBIT/EBITDA and EBIT/EBITDA margins, which are key elements of management’s internal control over the reporting unit valuation analysis.\n2024 Goodwill Impairment Testing\n \nIn 2024, there were no events or changes in circumstances that warranted interim goodwill impairment testing. In the fourth quarter of 2024, qualitative testing was performed for all reporting units carrying goodwill. Based on the results of the qualitative testing, quantitative testing was performed on one reporting unit. For the qualitative assessments, management considered factors at both the Company level and the reporting unit level. Based on the qualitative assessments for the reporting units, management concluded it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the reporting unit is less than the fair value of the reporting unit. For the quantitative testing, the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit. \nEnvironmental Matters\nEnvironmental Policies\nDow is committed to world-class environmental, health and safety (“EH&S”) performance, as demonstrated by industry-leading results, a long-standing commitment to the American Chemistry Council's Responsible Care\n®\n program, a strong commitment to achieve the Company's 2025 Sustainability Goals and Dow's drive to deliver against its targets around a circular economy and climate protection. These goals and targets set the standard for sustainability in the chemical industry, focusing on improvements in the Company’s local corporate citizenship and product stewardship, and by actively pursuing methods to reduce the Company's environmental impact.\nTo meet the Company’s public commitments, as well as the stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation to which its global operations are subject, the Company has well-defined policies, requirements and management systems. The Company's EH&S Management System (“EMS”) defines the “who, what, when and how” needed for the businesses to implement the Company’s policies and requirements and meet performance objectives, leadership expectations and public commitments. To ensure effective utilization, the EMS is integrated into a company-wide management system for EH&S, Operations, Quality and Human Resources.\nThe Company believes third-party verification and transparent public reporting are cornerstones of world-class EH&S performance and building public trust. Numerous Dow sites in EMEAI, Latin America, Asia Pacific and the U.S. & Canada have received third-party verification of the Company’s compliance with Responsible Care\n®\n and with outside specifications such as ISO-14001. The Company continues to be a global champion of Responsible Care\n®\n and has worked to broaden the application and impact of Responsible Care\n®\n around the world through engagement with peer companies, suppliers, customers and joint venture partners.\n53\nTable of Contents\nDow manages environmental data for reporting with a waste, water and emissions inventory system. All emitting manufacturing sites globally record their emissions and water use in the system. The data is reviewed at the facility level and then by global coordinators before being aggregated for corporate environmental reporting purposes.\nDow's EH&S policies help to ensure the Company achieves its annual health and safety performance targets and the Company seeks to continuously improve on these targets through process and personal safety project implementations. Improvement in these areas, as well as environmental compliance, remains a top management priority, as the Company continues to implement its 2025 Sustainability Goals and progressive, multi-decade sustainability targets that include advancing a circular economy and climate protection. Progress is reviewed annually by management and with the Environment, Health, Safety & Technology (\"EHS&T\") Committee of the Board.\nDetailed information on Dow’s performance regarding environmental matters and goals is accessible through the Company's Science & Sustainability webpage at \nwww.dow.com/sustainability\n. Dow's website and its content are not deemed incorporated by reference into this report.\nChemical Security\nPublic and political attention continues to be placed on the protection of critical infrastructure, including the chemical industry, from security threats. Sabotage, terrorism, war, natural disasters and cybersecurity incidents have increased global concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution. Many, including the Company and the American Chemistry Council, have called for uniform risk-based and performance-based national standards for securing the U.S. chemical industry. The Company is subject to U.S. regulations with established risk-based and performance-based standards that must be met at U.S. Coast Guard-regulated facilities promulgated by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Company is also subject to the requirements of the Rail Transportation Security Rule issued by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. The Company continues to support uniform risk-based national standards for securing the chemical industry.\nThe Company maintains a comprehensive, multi-level security plan that focuses on security, emergency planning, preparedness and response. This plan, which has been activated in response to significant world and national events, is reviewed on an annual basis. The Company continues to improve its security plans, placing emphasis on the safety of Dow communities and people by being prepared to meet risks at any level and to address both internal and external identifiable risks. The security plan includes regular vulnerability assessments, security audits, mitigation efforts and physical security upgrades designed to reduce vulnerability. The Company’s security plans are also designed to avert interruptions of normal business operations that could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company played a key role in the development and implementation of the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care\n®\n Security Code (\"Security Code\"), which requires that all aspects of security – including facility, transportation and cyberspace – be assessed and gaps addressed. Through the global implementation of the Security Code, the Company has permanently heightened the level of security – not just in the United States, but worldwide. The Company employs several hundred employees and contractors in its Emergency Services and Security department worldwide. In 2019, the Company established its Global Security Operations Center (\"GSOC\") to provide 24-hour/day, 365-day/year real-time monitoring of global risks to Dow assets and people. The GSOC employs state-of-the-art social media monitoring, threat reporting and geo-fencing capabilities to analyze global risks and report those risks, facilitating decision-making and actions to prevent Dow crises.\nThrough the implementation of the Security Code, including voluntary security enhancements and upgrades, the Company is well-positioned to comply with U.S. chemical facility regulations and other regulatory security frameworks. The Company participates with the American Chemistry Council to periodically review and update the Security Code.\nThe Company continues to work collaboratively across the supply chain on Responsible Care\n®\n, supply chain design, emergency preparedness, shipment visibility and transportation of hazardous materials. The Company cooperated with public and private entities to lead the implementation of advanced tank car design, and track and trace technologies. Further, the Company’s Distribution Risk Review process addresses potential threats in all modes of transportation across the Company’s supply chain. To reduce vulnerabilities, the Company maintains security measures that meet or exceed regulatory and industry security standards in all areas in which they operate.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe Company's initiatives relative to chemical security, emergency preparedness and response, Community Awareness and Emergency Response and crisis management are implemented consistently at all Dow sites on a global basis. Each Dow site has established outreach programs designed to engage community stakeholders with objectives centered around awareness of Dow operations, products, and efforts to protect worker and community health and the environment. These programs also educate community members on emergency planning and response, emissions and waste, future site plans to reduce waste and emissions, and process safety systems. Finally, these outreach efforts establish an opportunity for Dow site leaders to hear about community stakeholder expectations and address questions and concerns about safety, health, environmental or other issues. The Company participates with chemical associations globally and participates as an active member of the Global Congress on Chemical Security and Emerging Threats and in positions of leadership in the U.S. Chemical Sector Coordinating Council.\nClimate Protection \nEvaluation of climate-related risks and opportunities continues to be a catalyst for the development of the Company’s Decarbonize & Grow strategy (Dow’s climate transition plan), its broad water stewardship efforts and its new nature goal. Dow's science-based strategy includes a phased approach to decarbonize while meeting the growing demand for Dow's products and contributing to a low-emissions future through continued investment in new products, technologies and processes. \nIn 2020, Dow set a target to be carbon neutral by 2050 across Scopes 1, 2 and 3, as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, plus product benefits. Dow’s Protect the Climate goals include reducing net annual GHG emissions by 5 million metric tons by 2030 versus its 2020 baseline, representing approximately a 15 percent reduction versus 2020 and a nearly 30 percent reduction since 2005. In 2021, Dow outlined a path to decarbonize its production processes (Scope 1 and 2 CO\n2\ne emissions), utilizing a phased approach in which end-of-life capacity is replaced with higher-efficiency, lower GHG emitting assets. In 2024, Dow continued near-term progression in its Decarbonize & Grow strategy by starting construction of its Fort Saskatchewan Path2Zero project which will be the world’s first net-zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions ethylene complex, when completed, and will decarbonize approximately 20 percent of Dow’s global ethylene production capacity. Dow also continued to advance a project with X-energy, a nuclear energy innovation company, to commercialize an advanced small modular nuclear reactor that will generate GHG emissions-free process heat and energy at its site in Seadrift, Texas. In the near term, energy reduction and optimization projects will provide continuous progress toward Dow’s carbon-neutral ambitions.\nDow is also committed to advancing water stewardship within the Company's operations and supply chain and with downstream customers and to working collaboratively to enhance water management at the watershed level. In addition to Dow's target to reduce freshwater intake intensity at six key water-stressed sites by 20 percent from its 2015 baseline by the end of 2025, Dow announced in 2024 a robust new 2050 water resilience strategy as well as a 50,000 acre habitat conservation target to address these key elements of climate adaptation.\nDespite these commitments, climate change-related risks and uncertainties, legal or regulatory responses to climate change, and failure to meet climate change commitments could negatively impact Dow’s results of operations, financial condition and/or reputation. Climate-related risks include both physical and transition risks.\nPhysical Risks\nClimate-related physical risks include more frequent severe weather events, potential changes in precipitation patterns, water scarcity and extreme variability in weather patterns, which can disrupt the operations of the Company as well as those of its customers, partners and vendors.\nTo evaluate physical risks, Dow partnered with S&P Global Trucost (“Trucost”) to assess the Company’s exposure to physical risks based on the geographic location of its manufacturing operations. The risks assessed included water stress, flood, heat waves, cold waves, hurricanes, wildfires and sea level rise. The analysis included an assessment of the physical risks using a baseline year of 2020 with time periods for medium- (year 2030) and long-term (year 2050) using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change representative concentration pathways. These pathways represent varying degrees of global atmospheric GHG concentrations (low, medium and high), and thus different expectations on global temperature rise. Results will be incorporated into Dow’s long-term assessments of its manufacturing sites, which is a key input into Dow’s capital approval process.\n55\nTable of Contents\nTransition Risks\nClimate-related transition risks include the availability, development and affordability of lower GHG emissions technology, the effects of CO\n2\ne pricing, and changes in public sentiment, regulations, taxes, public mandates or requirements as they relate to CO\n2\ne, water or land use.\nClimate-related risks, including both physical and transition risks, are assessed with input from internal and external sources including corporate, business, function and geographic leaders; subject matter experts; investors; and other stakeholders. The evaluation of climate-related risks and opportunities is integrated into an annual company-wide risk management process, known as enterprise risk management (“ERM”). ERM identifies significant or major risks to the Company and develops action plans to modify or mitigate risks.\nEvery few years, Dow also utilizes a robust scenario analysis to assess the long-term materiality and impact of climate-related risks and opportunities. Scenario analysis is used to challenge business-as-usual assumptions and strengthen the resiliency of the Company’s Decarbonize & Grow strategy. Scenarios are used to evaluate both physical and transition risk and are particularly useful in evaluating the potential and impact of emerging risks.\nManaging Climate Risks\nManagement of climate risk is assigned to Dow’s Climate Steering Team (“CST”), which is accountable for developing and implementing plans to mitigate risk and for tracking actions and progress against those plans. With oversight and accountability by the CST, specific carbon-related risks are managed by Dow’s Climate Program Management Office (“PMO”). The PMO partners with subject matter experts to develop and implement strategies to mitigate or eliminate climate-related risks. The team develops specific action plans and ensures owners are assigned to drive forward progress in order to reduce Dow’s risk exposure. Risk mitigation status updates are provided to executive leaders on a regular basis and discussions include risk time horizons and/or magnitude of impact to confirm that the strategy remains solid.\nDecarbonize & Grow\nDow’s Decarbonize & Grow strategy involves specific actions to mitigate identified climate-related physical and transition risks, while also advancing opportunities in several key areas. These include:\n•\nOptimizing Manufacturing Facilities and Processes for Sustainability: In addition to implementing near-term growth and efficiency investments, Dow is phasing out inefficient assets, decarbonizing remaining assets and building best-in-class, net-zero assets, as well as investing in innovative technologies such as clean hydrogen, advanced nuclear and carbon capture and storage. Dow has committed to investing approximately $1 billion in annual capital across the economic cycle to decarbonize assets in a phased approach, while growing capacity.\n•\nIncreasing Use of Clean Energy and Steam: As a major user and producer of energy, Dow is committed to reducing the use of fossil fuels for energy production and increasing consumption of clean energy, including both renewable and net-zero-emissions sources.\n•\nDeveloping Low-Emissions Products, Technologies and Services: As a leading materials science company, Dow products are capable of making important contributions to the reduction of GHG emissions, including products that facilitate energy efficiency, lightweighting, fuel transition, circularity, increased operational efficiency and resource reductions.\n•\nDeveloping Next Generation, Low-Carbon Manufacturing Technologies: Dow is investing in longer-term, future-focused manufacturing technologies that will be critical in the decarbonization of the Company's manufacturing.\n•\nBuilding a Value-Generating Scope 3 Decarbonization Pathway: Approximately 70 percent of Dow’s emissions footprint fall into Scope 3 categories and more than half of those emissions derive from the raw materials, transportation and other services purchased as a company. Dow is actively validating and developing Scope 3 emissions reduction and mitigation efforts. Collaboration with the Company’s partners along the entire value chain is key to lowering Scope 3 carbon emissions.\nWater Stewardship\nWater is Dow’s largest dependency on nature. Water-related risk considers water availability (too much, too little), water quality (intake and effluents), access to safe drinking water, health of ecosystems and reputational and regulatory challenges. Dow’s approach to identifying water-related risks and impacts includes identification of \n56\nTable of Contents\nphysical, regulatory and reputational risks. Dow’s methodology uses scientifically robust external tools such as WRI Aqueduct and the World Wildlife Fund water risk filter tool. Dow’s actions are also informed by the Trucost physical risk assessment, wherein water scarcity is recognized and addressed as the biggest climate-related threat to corporate assets with potential substantive financial or strategic impact on business.\nDow’s water risk management approach recognizes that every site and every business is accountable for water and certain watersheds require additional measures to address specific water stress challenges. Many Dow locations have specific water action plans to address local challenges, and Dow's new water strategy calls for water stewardship plans at its 20 water-dependent sites by 2030 and for all manufacturing sites by 2035. These action plans include mitigations for local water scarcity or quality issues and consider the needs of other local users for freshwater. Additionally, in 2015 Dow identified six sites, located in Texas (2); Bahia Blanca, Argentina; Terneuzen, The Netherlands; Böhlen, Germany; and Tarragona, Spain; where its operations are located in a water-stressed watershed, have local water quality issues, have competition among local users for water, or have some local knowledge of watershed challenges, and these six sites have since been the focus of Company actions. In 2024, the Company secured the use of a reservoir asset at one of its main U.S. Gulf Coast manufacturing sites, with a 35-year contract period that is expected to commence upon completion of construction in 2028. \nIn addition to site water stewardship efforts, Dow will work with suppliers to understand and mitigate water and biodiversity impacts and dependencies in its supply chain and will continue to innovate products that enable society to have reduced impacts on water bodies and other ecosystems.\nAccountability for operational water stewardship begins at the site level where the operating permits exist. The Company's progress against its broader water and nature targets is reviewed regularly by management and with the EHS&T Committee of the Board. \nAdvancing a Circular Economy\nSince Dow is only one part of the materials ecosystem, Dow advocates for the adoption of policies to accelerate the broader pathway to circularity. Circularity-enabling policies such as recycling mandates; mandates for recycled content in products; extended producer responsibility systems to finance state-of-the-art local access to collection, sorting and recycling; and policies to incentivize investments in innovative circular technologies are all critical to ensure that post-use products are diverted away from landfilling, incineration, open dumps and open burning and instead enter the circular economy. To accelerate the materials ecosystem, Dow is working toward its Transform the Waste target collectively with partners. The goal is to boost recycling rates for materials by developing the associated ecosystems to increase collection, sorting and recycling. As part of Dow’s sustainability targets, Dow intends to transform waste and alternative feedstocks to commercialize 3 million metric tons per year of circular and renewable solutions by 2030.\nAlthough the volume base is fairly small today, circular products are seeing increasing promise with commercially attractive growth rates, and Dow expects this market to gain an increasingly larger market share over the coming decades, as supporting policies, technology and economics improve. Dow is partnering to build industrial ecosystems to collect, reuse or recycle waste and expand its portfolio to meet rapidly growing demand for circular solutions. Further, Dow is redesigning product formulations in order to use circular feedstocks such as waste and renewable materials, thereby reducing the reliance on virgin fossil feedstocks.\nA circular economy requires embedding circularity in all parts of the value chains downstream from Dow. This includes product design for recyclability, accessible collection, sorting and recycling facilities, and appropriate economic incentives to make recycling economically viable. Through innovative developments, combined with partnerships and value chain collaboration, Dow is assisting its customers to design downstream applications for recyclability.\nDeveloping Safer Materials\nChemistry-based products provide many benefits to society. Like any product, they must be managed responsibly to minimize any potential adverse effects on humans or the environment. Dow takes this responsibility seriously and works hard to ensure that its products are designed, stored, transported, used, disposed of, or recycled in a manner that shows high regard for human health, safety and environmental stewardship.\nDow utilizes the Company’s strong innovation pipeline to develop safer materials or reduce or eliminate priority substances in its products. Dow also invests in clean upstream manufacturing technologies to reduce facility emissions and, where necessary, restricts downstream uses of some substances.\n57\nTable of Contents\nAt Dow, material safety is a continuous journey made possible through innovation, design and more predictive, enabling technologies. Dow works to offer products that – if used properly and in the manner intended – pose low risk to the environment, health and safety, and seeks to optimize products so they use resources more efficiently and sustainably.\nDow is working to deliver a sustainable future through its materials science expertise and collaboration with its customers. By constantly innovating how it sources, manufactures and delivers material solutions, Dow helps customers achieve their goals and create a better tomorrow. Dow also transparently communicates information on substances to customers via safety data sheets, regulatory data sheets and, in some cases, product handling guides.\nDow is committed to demonstrating the value of chemistry and materials science to society and improving the way the world understands and considers science in decision-making to maximize benefits to businesses, society and the planet. Through Dow’s 2025 Safe Materials for a Sustainable Planet goal, the Company has made progress toward this vision by innovating sustainable materials of tomorrow, leading candid conversations about product safety and committing to the advancement of open and transparent chemistry with value chain partners, customers and the public.\nEnvironmental Remediation\nFor comparison of environmental remediation-related matters for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on January 31, 2024.\nThe Company accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and regulatory requirements. The nature of such remediation can include management of soil and groundwater contamination. The accounting policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. To assess the impact on the financial statements, environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and the ability to apply remediation technologies. These liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. The Company had an accrued liability of $879 million at December 31, 2024, related to the remediation of current or former Dow-owned sites. At December 31, 2023, the liability related to remediation was $939 million.\nIn addition to current and former Dow-owned sites, under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\") and equivalent state laws (hereafter referred to collectively as \"Superfund Law\"), the Company is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where the Company allegedly disposed of, or arranged for the treatment or disposal of, hazardous substances. Because Superfund Law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site, the Company has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that have also been named potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at each site, the estimated apportionment of costs among all PRPs, and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share. The Company’s remaining liability for the remediation of Superfund sites was $234 million at December 31, 2024 ($241 million at December 31, 2023). The Company has not recorded any third-party recovery related to these sites as a receivable.\n58\nTable of Contents\nInformation regarding environmental sites is provided below:\nEnvironmental Sites\nDow-owned Sites \n1\nSuperfund Sites \n2\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nNumber of sites at Jan 1\n154 \n171 \n133 \n130 \nSites added during year\n2 \n6 \n1 \n4 \nSites closed during year\n— \n(23)\n(3)\n(1)\nNumber of sites at Dec 31\n156 \n154 \n131 \n133 \n1.\nDow-owned sites are sites currently or formerly owned by the Company. In the United States, remediation obligations are imposed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or analogous state law. At December 31, 2024, 25 of these sites (24 sites at December 31, 2023) were formerly owned by Dowell Schlumberger, Inc., a group of companies in which the Company previously owned a 50 percent interest. The Company sold its interest in Dowell Schlumberger in 1992.\n2.\nSuperfund sites are sites, including sites not owned by the Company, where remediation obligations are imposed by Superfund Law.\nAdditional information is provided below for the Company’s Midland, Michigan, manufacturing site and Midland off-site locations (collectively, the \"Midland sites\"), as well as a Superfund site in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, the locations for which the Company has the largest potential environmental liabilities.\nIn the early days of operations at the Midland manufacturing site, wastes were usually disposed of on-site, resulting in soil and groundwater contamination, which has been contained and managed on-site under a series of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act permits and regulatory agreements\n.\n The Hazardous Waste Operating License for the Midland manufacturing site, issued in 2003, and renewed and replaced in September 2015, also included provisions for the Company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off-site contamination from historic Midland manufacturing site operations. In January 2010, the Company, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and the State of Michigan (\"State\") entered into an Administrative Order on Consent that requires the Company to conduct a remedial investigation, a feasibility study and a remedial design for the Tittabawassee River, the Saginaw River and the Saginaw Bay, and pay the oversight costs of the EPA and the State under the authority of CERCLA. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to Midland off-site environmental matters.\nRohm and Haas, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a PRP at the Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, Ventron/Velsicol Superfund Site, and the adjacent Berry’s Creek Study Area (\"BCSA\") (collectively, the \"Wood-Ridge sites\"). Rohm and Haas is a successor in interest to a company that owned and operated a mercury processing facility, where wastewater and waste handling resulted in contamination of soils and adjacent creek sediments. In 2018, the Berry’s Creek Study Area Potentially Responsible Party Group (“PRP Group”), consisting of over 100 PRPs, completed a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study for the BCSA. During that time, the EPA concluded that an “iterative or adaptive approach” was appropriate for cleaning up the BCSA. Thus, each phase of remediation will be followed by a period of monitoring to assess its effectiveness and determine if there is a need for more work. In September 2018, the EPA signed a Record of Decision (\"ROD 1\") which describes the initial phase of the EPA’s plan to clean-up the BCSA. ROD 1 will remediate waterways and major tributaries in the most contaminated part of the BCSA. The PRP Group has signed agreements with the EPA to design the selected remedy. Although there is currently much uncertainty as to what will ultimately be required to remediate the BCSA and Rohm and Haas's share of these costs has yet to be determined, the range of activities that are required in the interim Record of Decision is known in general terms. The PRP Group has been approached by the EPA to convene discussions for the Remedial Action Consent Decree the EPA is preparing for the Berry’s Creek Site. The group submitted the 95 percent design for EPA review and has identified and contracted with a Remedial Action contractor to support completion of the 100 percent design. Allocation remains incomplete.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had accrued liabilities totaling $303 million ($319 million at December 31, 2023) for environmental remediation at the Midland and Wood-Ridge sites. In 2024, the Company spent $45 million ($48 million in 2023) for environmental remediation at the Midland and Wood-Ridge sites.\nIn total, the Company’s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was $1,113 million at December 31, 2024, compared with $1,180 million at December 31, 2023. This is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on \n59\nTable of Contents\nthe Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled $197 million in 2024 and $203 million in 2023. The amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to operating the Company's current pollution abatement facilities, excluding internal recharges, totaled $823 million in 2024 and $758 million in 2023. Capital expenditures for environmental protection were $208 million in 2024 and $228 million in 2023. \nAsbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation\nUnion Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past several decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide’s premises, and Union Carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem. In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide’s products.\nFor comparison of asbestos-related matters of Union Carbide Corporation for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, see Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on January 31, 2024.\nThe table below provides information regarding asbestos-related claims pending against Union Carbide and Amchem based on criteria developed by Union Carbide and its external consultants:\nAsbestos-Related Claim Activity\n2024\n2023\nClaims unresolved at Jan 1\n6,367 \n6,873 \nClaims filed\n4,568 \n4,199 \nClaims settled, dismissed or otherwise resolved\n(5,122)\n(4,705)\nClaims unresolved at Dec 31\n5,813 \n6,367 \nClaimants with claims against both Union Carbide and Amchem\n(1,005)\n(1,236)\nIndividual claimants at Dec 31\n4,808 \n5,131 \nPlaintiffs’ lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants. As a result, the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to Union Carbide, Amchem or any other particular defendant, even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury. For these reasons and based upon Union Carbide’s litigation and settlement experience, Union Carbide does not consider the damages alleged against Union Carbide and Amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos-related liability.\nFor additional information see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. \n60\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe Company’s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices. To manage such risks effectively, the Company enters into hedging transactions, pursuant to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk. Derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities, where appropriate. A secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non-specific exposure within established limits and policies; derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges. The potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the Company’s results.\nThe global nature of the Company’s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets. The Company has assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary objective of the Company’s foreign currency risk management is to optimize the U.S. dollar value of net assets and cash flows. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts, over-the-counter option contracts, cross-currency swaps and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies. Exposures primarily relate to assets, liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies, as well as economic exposure, which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities. The largest exposures are denominated in European currencies, the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen, the Thai baht and the Argentinian peso, although exposures also exist in other currencies in Asia Pacific, Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and India.\nThe main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges using interest rate swaps, “swaptions,” and exchange-traded instruments. The Company’s primary exposure is to the U.S. dollar yield curve.\nThe Company has a portfolio of debt and equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries. This exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the Company’s market risk policies and procedures. The Company also uses equity and debt derivatives to hedge its exposure to non-qualified plans.\nInherent in the Company’s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities. Some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments. Natural gas and crude oil, along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production, constitute the main commodity exposures. Over-the-counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks, when feasible.\nThe Company uses value-at-risk (“VAR”), stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes. VAR estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values, given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time, using specified confidence levels. The VAR methodology used by the Company is a variance/covariance model. This model uses a 97.5 percent confidence level and includes at least one year of historical data. \nThe 2024 and 2023 year-end and average daily VAR for the aggregate of all positions are shown below. These amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of the Company.\nTotal Daily VAR by Exposure Type at Dec 31\n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nYear-end\nAverage\nYear-end\nAverage\nCommodities\n$\n10 \n$\n12 \n$\n14 \n$\n11 \nEquity securities\n11 \n11 \n6 \n8 \nForeign exchange\n23 \n22 \n20 \n17 \nInterest rate\n118 \n139 \n139 \n177 \nComposite\n$\n162 \n$\n184 \n$\n179 \n$\n213 \nThe Company’s daily VAR for the aggregate of all positions decreased from a composite VAR of $179 million at December 31, 2023 to a composite VAR of $162 million at December 31, 2024. The interest rate VAR decreased due to a decrease in interest rate volatility. The equity securities VAR increased due to an increase in equity exposure. The foreign exchange VAR increased due to an increase in outstanding derivatives and bonds designated as hedging instruments. The commodities VAR decreased due to a decrease in managed exposures. See Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosure regarding market risk.\n61\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established \nin Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 4, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nUncertain Tax Positions — Refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company has a complex legal structure involving numerous domestic and foreign locations with constantly changing tax laws, regulations, and legal interpretations. The Company’s management is required to interpret and apply these tax laws and regulations in determining the amount of its income tax liability and provision. When an uncertain tax position is identified by management, the Company must evaluate if it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the uncertain tax position will be sustained upon examination. The Company recognizes a benefit for tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be \n62\nTable of Contents\nrealized. The Company establishes a liability for unrecognized tax benefits that do not meet this threshold. The evaluation of each uncertain tax position requires management to apply specialized skill, knowledge, and significant judgment related to the identified position. The Company’s liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related accrued interest and penalties as of December 31, 2024 was $\n422\n million and $\n327\n million, respectively.\nBecause of the complexity of tax laws, regulations, and legal interpretations relevant to numerous taxing jurisdictions in which the Company operates, auditing uncertain tax positions and the determination of whether the more likely than not threshold was met requires a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our income tax specialists.\n \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to uncertain tax positions included the following, among others:\n \n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of internal controls over income taxes, including those over identifying uncertain tax positions and measuring liabilities.\n•\nWe evaluated, with the assistance of our income tax specialists, the Company’s uncertain tax positions by performing the following:\n◦\nObtaining Company and third-party opinions or memoranda regarding the uncertain tax positions.\n◦\nIdentifying key judgements underlying the Company’s position and evaluating whether the conclusions are consistent with our interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations. \n◦\nEvaluating the Company’s method of measuring its liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including underlying data and assumptions.\n◦\nEvaluating the basis for certain intercompany transactions, such as transfer pricing, by comparison to economic studies performed by management and third-party data.\n◦\nEvaluating matters raised by taxing authorities in former and ongoing tax audits. \n◦\nAssessing changes and interpretation of applicable tax law.\n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nMidland, Michigan\nFebruary 4, 2025\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1905.\n63\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nTo the Stockholder and the Board of Directors of The Dow Chemical Company \nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Dow Chemical Company and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\").

Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in nonconsolidated affiliates (20-50 percent owned companies or less than 20 percent owned companies over which significant influence is exercised) are primarily accounted for using the equity method.\nDow Inc. owns all of the outstanding common shares of TDCC. As a result of the parent/subsidiary relationship between Dow Inc. and TDCC, and considering that the financial statements and disclosures of each company are substantially similar, the companies are filing a combined report for this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information reflected in the report is equally applicable to both Dow Inc. and TDCC, except where otherwise noted. Transactions between TDCC and Dow Inc. are treated as related party transactions for TDCC. See Note 24 for additional information.\nThe Company conducts its worldwide operations through six global businesses which are organized into the following operating segments: Packaging & Specialty Plastics, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and Performance Materials & Coatings. Corporate contains the reconciliation between the totals for the operating segments and the Company's totals. See Note 25 for additional information.\n76\nTable of Contents\nExcept as otherwise indicated by the context, the term \"Union Carbide\" means Union Carbide Corporation and the term \"Dow Silicones\" means Dow Silicones Corporation, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nUse of Estimates in Financial Statement Preparation\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company’s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nAsbestos-Related Matters \nAccruals for asbestos-related matters, including defense and processing costs, are recorded based on an analysis of claim and resolution activity, defense spending, and pending and future claims. These accruals are assessed at each balance sheet date to determine if the asbestos-related liability remains appropriate. Accruals for asbestos-related matters are included in the consolidated balance sheets in “Accrued and other current liabilities” and “Asbestos-related liabilities - noncurrent.” See Note 15 for additional information.\nLegal Costs\n \nThe Company expenses legal costs as incurred, with the exception of defense and processing costs associated with asbestos-related matters.\n \nForeign Currency Translation\nThe local currency has been primarily used as the functional currency throughout the world. Translation gains and losses of those operations that use local currency as the functional currency are included in the consolidated balance sheets in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" (\"AOCL\"). For certain subsidiaries, the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency. This occurs when the subsidiary operates in an economic environment where the products produced and sold are tied to U.S. dollar-denominated markets, or when the foreign subsidiary operates in a hyper-inflationary environment. Where the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency, foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in income.\n \nEnvironmental Matters\nAccruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment and remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets in “Accrued and other current liabilities” and “Other noncurrent obligations” at undiscounted amounts. Accruals for related insurance or other third-party recoveries for environmental liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a recovery will be realized and are included in the consolidated balance sheets in “Accounts and notes receivable - Other” or \"Noncurrent receivables.\"\nEnvironmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life of the property, increase its capacity and/or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Environmental costs are also capitalized in recognition of legal asset retirement obligations resulting from the acquisition, construction and/or normal operation of a long-lived asset. Costs related to environmental contamination treatment and cleanup are charged to expense. Estimated future incremental operations, maintenance and management costs directly related to remediation are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include time deposits and investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments using quoted market prices when available. When quoted market prices are not available for financial instruments, the Company uses standard pricing models with market-based inputs that take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows.\nThe Company utilizes derivatives to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rate risk. The fair values of all derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date. \n77\nTable of Contents\nChanges in the fair values of these instruments are reported in income or AOCL, depending on the use of the derivative and whether the Company has elected hedge accounting treatment.\nGains and losses on derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments are recorded in AOCL until the underlying transactions are recognized in income. Gains and losses on derivative and non-derivative instruments used as hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign operations are recorded in AOCL as part of the cumulative translation adjustment. \nGains and losses on derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedging instruments, as well as the offsetting losses and gains on the hedged items, are reported in income in the same accounting period. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are marked-to-market at the end of each accounting period with the results included in income.\nAccounts Receivable Programs\nThe Company maintains accounts receivable securitization and discounting facilities with various financial institutions, which allow for the sale of eligible trade accounts receivable at any point in time. The securitized accounts receivable are isolated in wholly owned special purpose entities and support the securities issued by those entities. The Company derecognizes the eligible trade receivables upon sale and retains no interest in the sold trade receivables. The Company continues to service the trade receivables and remit payments received from customers to the financial institutions. Amounts collected from customers but not yet remitted to the applicable financial institution are included in “Accrued and other current liabilities” in the consolidated balance sheets. When previously sold trade receivables are repurchased, they are included in “Accounts and notes receivable – Other” in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 13 for additional information.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The method of determining cost for each subsidiary varies among last-in, first-out (“LIFO”); first-in, first-out (“FIFO”); and average cost, and is used consistently from year to year. See Note 9 for additional information.\nThe Company routinely utilizes exchange, swap and tolling arrangements with other companies for raw materials and finished goods to increase sourcing options, shorten delivery times, and reduce freight and other transportation costs. These transactions are treated as non-monetary exchanges and are valued at cost.\nProperty\nLand, buildings and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Property under finance lease agreements is carried at the present value of lease payments over the lease term less accumulated amortization. Depreciation is based on the estimated service lives of depreciable assets and is calculated using the straight-line method. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until they are disposed. In the case of disposals, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from disposal, are included in income.\n \nImpairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets (property, finite-lived intangible assets and lease right-of-use assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When undiscounted future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover an asset’s carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value based on bids received from third parties or a discounted cash flow analysis based on market participant assumptions.\nLong-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, if material, are classified as held for sale and reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, and depreciation/amortization is ceased. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until they are disposed of and reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, and depreciation/amortization is recognized over the remaining useful life of the assets.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Company records goodwill when the purchase price of a business combination exceeds the estimated fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has more likely than not declined below its carrying value. When testing goodwill for \n78\nTable of Contents\nimpairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is performed. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. If the quantitative testing indicates that goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge is recognized based on the difference between the reporting unit's carrying value and its fair value. The Company primarily utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units. \nFinite-lived intangible assets such as developed technology, customer-related assets, trademarks, tradenames and software, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis for periods ranging primarily from \n3\n to \n20\n years.\n \nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company records asset retirement obligations as incurred and reasonably estimable, including obligations for which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the Company. The fair values of obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis and are accreted over time for the change in present value. Costs associated with the liabilities are capitalized and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the assets.\n \nInvestments\nInvestments in debt securities, primarily held by the Company's insurance operations, are classified as trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Investments classified as trading are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses related to mark-to-market adjustments included in income. Those classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCL. Those classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost. The cost of investments sold is determined by FIFO or specific identification. \nInvestments in equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses related to mark-to-market adjustments included in income. Equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are accounted for at cost, adjusted for impairments and observable price changes in orderly transactions. \nThe Company routinely reviews its investments for declines in fair value below the cost basis. When events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the security is written down, establishing a new cost basis.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at contract inception. A contract contains a lease if there is an identified asset and the Company has the right to control the asset. \nOperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses the incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. If lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease, the ROU asset and lease liability are measured based on the reasonably certain decision. Leases with a term of 12 months or less at the commencement date are not recognized on the balance sheet and are expensed as incurred. \nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component for nearly all classes of leased assets for which the Company is the lessee. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, the portfolio approach is applied to account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities. In the consolidated statements of income, lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, interest expense is recognized on the lease liability and the ROU asset is amortized over the lease term.\nSome leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent upon usage or output, or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance or tax payments. Variable lease payments are recognized as incurred and are not presented as part of the ROU asset or lease liability. See Note 16 for additional information.\n79\nTable of Contents\nRevenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. See Note 3 for additional information.\nRevenue related to the Company's insurance operations includes third-party insurance premiums, which are earned over the terms of the related insurance policies and reinsurance contracts.\n \nSeverance Costs\nThe Company routinely reviews its operations around the world in an effort to ensure competitiveness across its businesses and geographic regions. When the reviews result in a workforce reduction related to the shutdown of facilities or other optimization activities, severance benefits are provided to employees primarily under the Company’s ongoing benefit arrangements. These severance costs are accrued once management commits to a plan of termination and it becomes probable that employees will be entitled to benefits at amounts that can be reasonably estimated.\nGovernment Assistance\nThe Company receives grants, subsidies and incentives (collectively \"incentives\") from governments in various jurisdictions in support of its operations and capital projects. The incentives are recorded when it is probable that the Company will comply with the terms and conditions attached to the incentives and that the incentives will be received. Incentives are recognized on a systematic basis over the periods in which the related cost or expenditures occur and are included in the Company's financial statements as reductions of \"Cost of sales\" or \"Research and development expenses\" in the Company’s consolidated statements of income or as a reduction of \"Property\" in the consolidated balance sheets. \nIn 2024, the Company received $\n272\n million\n of government incentives ($\n183\n million\n in 2023 and $\n260\n million\n in 2022) primarily related to the cost of energy used in the Company’s production processes. These incentives, from various governments, are typically based on level of energy consumption and are recorded as a reduction to \"Cost of sales\" in the consolidated statements of income and as \"Accounts and notes receivable - Other\" until received or as a reduction to \"Accounts payable - Trade\" in the consolidated balance sheets. \nIn 2024, the Company recognized $\n56 million\n in government incentives (\nzero\n in 2023 and 2022) related to the construction of certain energy assets in the United States. These incentives are recorded as a reduction of “Property” in the consolidated balance sheets and will lower depreciation expense over the useful lives of the related energy assets through a reduction to “Cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income.\nOther forms of government assistance received by the Company in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were not material.\nIncome Taxes \nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets or liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from AOCL. \nThe Company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The Company accrues for other tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. The current portion of uncertain income tax positions is included in “Income taxes payable” and the long-term portion is included in “Other noncurrent obligations” in the consolidated balance sheets.\nProvision is made for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be permanently invested.\n80\nTable of Contents\nEarnings per Common Share\nThe calculation of earnings per common share is based on the weighted-average number of the Company's common shares outstanding for the applicable period. The calculation of diluted earnings per common share reflects the effect of all potential common shares that were outstanding during the respective periods, unless the effect of doing so is antidilutive.\nTDCC Dividends\nTDCC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Inc. and TDCC's Board of Directors determines whether or not there will be a dividend distribution to Dow Inc. See Notes 17 and 24 for additional information.\nNOTE 2 – \nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nOn January 1, 2024, the Company adopted the amendments in Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2023-02, \"Investments — Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method\" and elected to account for certain tax equity investments using the proportional amortization method, as provided by the ASU. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of tax equity investments in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). The adoption of the ASU did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company adopted the annual and interim disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07, \"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\" The amendments expand a public business entity's segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM, clarifying when an entity may report one or more additional measures to assess segment performance, requiring enhanced interim disclosures, providing new disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment, and requiring other new disclosures. See Note 25 for applicable reportable segment disclosures required by this guidance.\nAccounting Guidance Issued But Not Adopted at December 31, 2024\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued ASU 2023-09, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,\" which is intended to enhance the transparency, decision usefulness and effectiveness of income tax disclosures. The amendments in this ASU require a public business entity to disclose a tabular tax rate reconciliation, using both percentages and currency, with specific categories. A public business entity is also required to provide a qualitative description of the states and local jurisdictions that make up the majority of the effect of the state and local income tax category and the net amount of income taxes paid, disaggregated by federal, state and foreign taxes and also disaggregated by individual jurisdictions. The amendments also remove certain disclosures that are no longer considered cost beneficial. The amendments are effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, and early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. The adoption of the ASU is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \"Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses,\" which is intended to improve disclosures about a public business entity's expenses and address requests from investors for more detailed information about the types of expenses in commonly presented expense captions. Such information should allow investors to better understand an entity's performance, assess future cash flows, and compare performance over time and with other entities. The amendments will require public business entities to disclose in the notes to the financial statements, at each interim and annual reporting period, specific information about certain costs and expenses, including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization included in each expense caption presented on the face of the income statement, and the total amount of an entity's selling expenses. The amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on the consolidated financial statements.\n81\nTable of Contents\nSEC Final Rules Not Adopted at December 31, 2024\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") adopted final rules under SEC Release Nos. 33-11275 and 34-99678, \"The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors,\" which requires registrants to disclose certain climate related information in registration statements and annual reports. The final rules include requirements to disclose material climate-related risks; activities to mitigate or adapt to such risks; information about the board of directors' oversight of climate-related risks and management’s role in managing material climate-related risks; and information on any climate-related targets or goals that are material to the registrant's business, results of operations, or financial condition. Registrants are also required to disclose the financial statement effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions in the notes to the financial statements. Certain large registrants are also required to disclose Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions, when material. The final rules include a phased-in compliance period for all registrants. As a large accelerated filer, most disclosure requirements are effective for the Company beginning with the year ending December 31, 2025. GHG emissions disclosures are required for the year ending December 31, 2026. The Company will also be required to obtain limited assurance on its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions disclosures beginning with the year ending December 31, 2029, with reasonable assurance required beginning with the year ending December 31, 2033. In April 2024, the SEC informed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (\"Court\") that it would voluntarily stay the final rules until various legal challenges are resolved by the Court. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the final rules on its consolidated financial statements and annual disclosures.\nNOTE 3 – \nREVENUE\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is derived from product sales. In 2024, \n98\n percent of the Company's revenue related to product sales (\n98\n percent in 2023 and \n99\n percent in 2022). The remaining sales were primarily related to the Company's insurance operations and licensing of patents and technologies.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nDow disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by operating segment and business, as the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows.

The Company considers order confirmations or purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master supply agreements, to be contracts with a customer. Product sale contracts are generally short-term contracts where the time between order confirmation and satisfaction of all performance obligations is less than one year. However, the Company has some long-term contracts which can span multiple years.\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the product, which occurs at a point in time, usually upon shipment, with payment terms typically in the range of 30 to 60 days after invoicing, depending on business and geographic region. When the Company performs shipping and handling activities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g., when control transfers prior to shipment), these are considered fulfillment activities, and accordingly, the costs are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues. The Company elected to use the practical expedient to expense cash and non-cash sales incentives, as the amortization period for the costs to obtain the contract would have been one year or less.\nCertain long-term contracts include a series of distinct goods that are delivered continuously to the customer through a pipeline (e.g., feedstocks). For these types of product sales, the Company invoices the customer in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance to date. As a result, the Company recognizes revenue based on the amount billable to the customer in accordance with the right to invoice practical expedient.\nThe transaction price includes estimates for reductions in revenue from customer rebates and right of returns on product sales. These amounts are estimated based upon the most likely amount of consideration to which the customer will be entitled. All estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and the Company’s best judgment at the time to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. All estimates for variable consideration are reassessed periodically. The Company elected the practical expedient to not adjust the amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component for all instances in which the period between payment and transfer of the goods will be one year or less.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price is the observable price which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances.\nPatents, Trademarks and Licenses\nThe Company enters into licensing arrangements in which it licenses certain rights of its patents and technology to customers. Revenue from the majority of the Company’s licenses for patents and technology is derived from sales-based royalties. The Company estimates the amount of sales-based royalties it expects to be entitled to based on historical sales to the customer. For the remaining revenue from licensing arrangements, payments are typically received from the Company's licensees based on billing schedules established in each contract. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations. At December 31, 2024, the Company had unfulfilled performance obligations of $\n759\n million ($\n744\n million at December 31, 2023) related to the licensing of technology and expects revenue to be recognized for the remaining performance obligations over the next five years. \nThe Company has additional remaining performance obligations for product sales that have expected durations of one year or less, product sales of materials delivered through a pipeline for which the Company has elected the \"right to invoice\" practical expedient, and variable consideration attributable to royalties for licenses of patents and technology. The Company has received advance payments from customers related to long-term supply agreements that are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract, with remaining contract terms that range up to \n19\n years. The Company will have rights to future consideration for revenue recognized when product is delivered to the customer. These payments are included in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" and \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n83\nTable of Contents\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets include amounts related to the Company’s contractual right to consideration for completed performance obligations not yet invoiced. Contract liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are recognized in revenue when the performance obligations are met. \"Contract liabilities - current\" primarily reflects deferred revenue from prepayments from customers for product to be delivered in 12 months or less and royalty payments that are deferred and will be recognized in 12 months or less. \"Contract liabilities - noncurrent\" includes advance payments that the Company has received from customers related to long-term supply agreements and royalty payments that are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract.\nRevenue recognized in 2024 from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was approximately $\n190\n million (approximately $\n315\n million in 2023 and $\n250\n million in 2022). In 2024, the amount of contract assets reclassified to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional was insignificant (approximately $\n45\n million in 2023). The Company did not recognize any asset impairment charges related to contract assets in 2024 (no impairment charges in 2023 and immaterial in 2022).\nThe following table summarizes contract assets and liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nContract Assets and Liabilities at Dec 31\nBalance Sheet Classification\n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nAccounts and notes receivable - trade\nAccounts and notes receivable - trade\n$\n4,756\n \n$\n4,718\n \nContract assets - current \nOther current assets\n$\n—\n \n$\n13\n \nContract assets - noncurrent\nDeferred charges and other assets\n$\n2\n \n$\n4\n \nContract liabilities - current \n1\nAccrued and other current liabilities\n$\n244\n \n$\n195\n \nContract liabilities - noncurrent \n2\nOther noncurrent obligations\n$\n1,480\n \n$\n1,642\n \n1.\nThe increase from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the reclassification of deferred royalty payments from noncurrent to current, partially offset by recognition of deferred royalty payments. \n2.\nThe decrease from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 was primarily due to recognition of revenue on long-term product supply agreements and the reclassification of deferred royalty payments from noncurrent to current, partially offset by deferred royalty payments.\nNOTE 4 – \nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nDivestiture of the Flexible Packaging Laminating Adhesives Business \nOn December 2, 2024, the Company sold its flexible packaging laminating adhesives business, within Packaging & Specialty Plastics, to Arkema S.A. for cash proceeds of $\n115\n million, net of working capital adjustments, costs to sell and other transaction expenses and subject to customary post-closing adjustments. The divestiture included five manufacturing sites in the United States, Italy and Mexico as well as the associated inventory, customer contracts and lists, process technology and certain intellectual property. Divested assets included inventory of $\n51\n million, property with a net book value of $\n51\n million, and goodwill of $\n16\n million. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $\n1\n million\n \nin the fourth quarter of 2024, included in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" in the consolidated statements of income. Additionally, the Company recognized impairment charges related to write-downs of certain manufacturing assets included in this divestiture. See Notes 5 and 22 for additional information.\nThe Company evaluated the divestiture of its flexible packaging laminating adhesives business and determined it did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results and did not qualify as an individually significant component of the Company. As a result, the divestiture is not reported as discontinued operations.\nAcquisition of North American Polyethylene Recycler\nOn August 1, 2024, the Company acquired Circulus Holdings, LLC, a U.S. mechanical recycling company that converts plastic waste into post-consumer resin, for a cash purchase of approximately $\n130\n million. The acquisition includes two facilities in the United States with a total recycling capacity of 50,000 metric tons per year and supports Dow's efforts to transform plastic waste and other forms of alternative feedstocks into 3 million metric tons of circular and renewable solutions annually by 2030.

Under the terms of this program, a vendor can voluntarily enter into an agreement with a participating financial intermediary to sell its receivables due from the Company. The vendor receives payment from the financial intermediary, and the Company pays the financial intermediary on the terms originally negotiated with the vendor, which generally range from \n90\n to \n120\n days. The vendor negotiates the terms of the agreements directly with the financial intermediary and the Company is not a party to that agreement. The financial intermediary may allow the participating vendor to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which may provide the vendor with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company does not provide guarantees related to the SCF program. At December 31, 2024, outstanding obligations confirmed as valid under the SCF program were $\n291\n million\n ($\n285\n million\n at December 31, 2023), included in “Accounts payable – Trade” in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table summarizes the activity of the SCF program for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nSupplier Finance Program Activity\n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at Jan 1\n$\n285\n \n$\n267\n \nInvoices confirmed to financial intermediary\n1,313\n \n1,308\n \nConfirmed invoices paid to financial intermediary\n(\n1,307\n)\n(\n1,290\n)\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at Dec 31\n$\n291\n \n$\n285\n \nAccrued and Other Current Liabilities\n“Accrued and other current liabilities” were $\n2,521\n million and $\n2,405\n million at December 31, 2024 and $\n2,704\n million and $\n2,575\n million at December 31, 2023, for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively.

The Company has a \n35\n percent equity interest in this joint venture and continues to be responsible for marketing a significant portion of Sadara’s products through the Company’s established sales channels. In 2021, Dow and the Saudi Arabian Oil Company agreed to a marketing rights transition plan. Execution of the transition plan is ongoing and progressing towards aligning marketing rights and responsibilities to levels more consistent with each partner's equity ownership. This transition will not impact equity earnings, but is expected to reduce the Company's sales of Sadara products over the transition period.\nThe Company’s investment in Sadara was $\n1,280\n million less than Dow’s proportionate share of the carrying value of the underlying net assets held by Sadara at December 31, 2024 ($\n1,387\n million less at December 31, 2023). This basis difference, which resulted from the 2019 impairment of the investment, is primarily attributed to the long-lived assets of Sadara and is being amortized over the remaining useful lives of the assets. At December 31, 2024, the Company had a negative investment balance in Sadara of $\n517\n million classified as \"Other noncurrent obligations\" (negative $\n128\n million at December 31, 2023) in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The negative investment in Sadara Chemical Company at December 31, 2024 is primarily due to the equity losses generated during the year. See Note 15 for additional information related to guarantees.\nEQUATE\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had a negative investment balance in EQUATE of $\n51\n million classified as \"Other noncurrent obligations\" (negative $\n101\n million at December 31, 2023) in the consolidated balance sheets. The reduction in the negative investment was driven by improved results during the year. The Company's investment in EQUATE was $\n417\n million less than the Company's proportionate share of EQUATE's underlying net assets at December 31, 2024 ($\n432\n million less at December 31, 2023), which represents the difference between the fair values of certain MEGlobal assets acquired by EQUATE and the Company's related valuation on a U.S. GAAP basis at the acquisition date. A basis difference of $\n97\n million at December 31, 2024 ($\n111\n million at December 31, 2023), is being amortized over the remaining useful lives of the assets and the remainder is considered a permanent difference.\nAgroFresh Solutions Inc. (\"AFSI\")\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company no longer holds an investment in AFSI.\n93\nTable of Contents\nTransactions with Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nThe Company has service agreements with certain nonconsolidated affiliates, including contracts to manage the operations of manufacturing sites and the construction of new facilities; licensing and technology agreements; and marketing, sales, purchase, lease and sublease agreements. \nThe Company sells excess ethylene glycol produced at manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe to MEGlobal, a subsidiary of EQUATE. The Company also sells ethylene to MEGlobal as a raw material for its ethylene glycol plants in Canada. Sales of these products to MEGlobal represented \n1\n percent of total net sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Sales of ethylene to MEGlobal are reflected in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment and represented \n2\n percent of the segment's sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022. Sales of ethylene glycol to MEGlobal are reflected in the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment and represented \n1\n percent of the segment's sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nThe Company is responsible for marketing the majority of Sadara products outside of the Middle East zone through the Company’s established sales channels. Under this arrangement, the Company purchases and sells Sadara products for a marketing fee. Purchases of Sadara products represented \n6\n percent of \"Cost of sales\" in 2024 (\n6\n percent in 2023 and \n7\n percent in 2022).\nThe Company purchases products from The SCGC-Dow Group, primarily for marketing and distribution in Asia Pacific. Purchases of products from The SCGC-Dow Group represented \n3\n percent of \"Cost of sales\" in 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nSales to and purchases from other nonconsolidated affiliates were not material to the consolidated financial statements.\nBalances due to or due from nonconsolidated affiliates at December 31, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:\nBalances Due To or Due From Nonconsolidated Affiliates at Dec 31\n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nAccounts and notes receivable - Other\n$\n300\n \n$\n189\n \nAccounts payable - Other\n$\n748\n \n$\n823\n \nPrincipal Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nThe Company had an ownership interest in \n38\n nonconsolidated affiliates at December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nThe Company's principal nonconsolidated affiliates and its ownership interest (direct and indirect) for each at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, are as follows: \nPrincipal Nonconsolidated Affiliates at Dec 31\nCountry\nOwnership Interest\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nEQUATE Petrochemical Company K.S.C.C. \nKuwait\n42.50\n \n%\n42.50\n \n%\n42.50\n \n%\nThe Kuwait Olefins Company K.S.C.C. \nKuwait\n42.50\n \n%\n42.50\n \n%\n42.50\n \n%\nThe Kuwait Styrene Company K.S.C.C.\nKuwait\n42.50\n \n%\n42.50\n \n%\n42.50\n \n%\nMap Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited \n1\nThailand\n32.77\n \n%\n32.77\n \n%\n32.77\n \n%\nSadara Chemical Company\nSaudi Arabia\n35.00\n \n%\n35.00\n \n%\n35.00\n \n%\nThe SCGC-Dow Group:\nSiam Polyethylene Company Limited\nThailand\n50.00\n \n%\n50.00\n \n%\n50.00\n \n%\nSiam Polystyrene Company Limited\nThailand\n50.00\n \n%\n50.00\n \n%\n50.00\n \n%\nSiam Styrene Monomer Company Limited\nThailand\n50.00\n \n%\n50.00\n \n%\n50.00\n \n%\nSiam Synthetic Latex Company Limited\nThailand\n50.00\n \n%\n50.00\n \n%\n50.00\n \n%\n1.\nThe Company's effective ownership of Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited (\"Map Ta Phut\") is \n32.77\n percent, of which the Company directly owns \n20.27\n percent and indirectly owns \n12.50\n percent through its equity interest in Siam Polyethylene Company Limited.\n94\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s investment in and equity earnings from its principal nonconsolidated affiliates are as follows:\nInvestment in Principal Nonconsolidated Affiliates at Dec 31\n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nInvestment in principal nonconsolidated affiliates \n$\n740\n \n$\n754\n \nOther noncurrent obligations\n(\n568\n)\n(\n229\n)\nNet investment in principal nonconsolidated affiliates\n$\n172\n \n$\n525\n \nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Principal Nonconsolidated Affiliates\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIn millions\nEquity in earnings (losses) of principal nonconsolidated affiliates\n$\n(\n57\n)\n$\n(\n192\n)\n$\n192\n \nThe summarized financial information that follows represents the combined accounts (at \n100\n percent) of the principal nonconsolidated affiliates.\nSummarized Balance Sheet Information at Dec 31\n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nCurrent assets\n$\n5,414\n \n$\n4,904\n \nNoncurrent assets\n20,695\n \n21,832\n \nTotal assets\n$\n26,109\n \n$\n26,736\n \nCurrent liabilities\n$\n3,842\n \n$\n3,490\n \nNoncurrent liabilities\n19,158\n \n18,794\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n23,000\n \n$\n22,284\n \nNoncontrolling interests\n$\n136\n \n$\n157\n \nSummarized Income Statement Information \n1\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIn millions\nSales\n$\n12,094\n \n$\n11,102\n \n$\n14,026\n \nGross profit\n$\n598\n \n$\n289\n \n$\n1,246\n \nIncome (loss), net of tax\n$\n(\n748\n)\n$\n(\n1,053\n)\n$\n(\n91\n)\n1.\nThe results in this table include purchase and sale activity between certain principal nonconsolidated affiliates and the Company, as previously discussed in the \"Transactions with Nonconsolidated Affiliates\" section.\nNOTE 12 – \nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following table shows changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nGoodwill\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure\nPerformance Materials & Coatings\nTotal\nIn millions\nBalance at Jan 1, 2023\n$\n5,100\n \n$\n1,093\n \n$\n2,451\n \n$\n8,644\n \nForeign currency impact\n3\n \n1\n \n(\n7\n)\n(\n3\n)\nBalance at Dec 31, 2023\n$\n5,103\n \n$\n1,094\n \n$\n2,444\n \n$\n8,641\n \nForeign currency impact\n(\n6\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n89\n)\n(\n97\n)\nPurchase of Circulus Holdings, LLC\n37\n \n—\n \n—\n \n37\n \nSale of laminating adhesives business\n(\n16\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n16\n)\nBalance at Dec 31, 2024\n$\n5,118\n \n$\n1,092\n \n$\n2,355\n \n$\n8,565\n \nThe Company has six reporting units in total: Coatings & Performance Monomers, Consumer Solutions, Hydrocarbons & Energy, Industrial Solutions, Packaging and Specialty Plastics and Polyurethanes & Construction \n95\nTable of Contents\nChemicals.

Failure of TDCC to comply with any of its covenants, could result in a default under the applicable indenture and allow the note holders to accelerate the due date of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the underlying notes.\nTDCC's indenture covenants include obligations to not allow liens on principal U.S. manufacturing facilities, enter into sale and lease-back transactions with respect to principal U.S. manufacturing facilities, merge or consolidate with any other corporation, or sell, lease or convey, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of TDCC’s assets. The outstanding debt also contains customary default provisions. TDCC remains in compliance with these covenants.\nTDCC’s primary, private credit agreements also contain certain customary restrictive covenant and default provisions in addition to the covenants set forth above with respect to TDCC’s debt. Significant other restrictive covenants and default provisions related to these agreements include:\n(a)\nthe obligation to maintain the ratio of TDCC’s consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization at no greater than \n0.70\n to 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (\"Revolving Credit Agreement\") dated November 23, 2021, equals or exceeds $\n500\n million,\n(b)\na default if TDCC or an applicable subsidiary fails to make any payment, including principal, premium or interest, under the applicable agreement on other indebtedness of, or guaranteed by, TDCC or such applicable subsidiary in an aggregate amount of $\n100\n million or more when due, or any other default or other event under the applicable agreement with respect to such indebtedness occurs which permits or results in the acceleration of $\n400\n million or more in the aggregate of principal, and\n(c)\na default if TDCC or any applicable subsidiary fails to discharge or stay within 60 days after the entry of a final judgment against TDCC or such applicable subsidiary of more than $\n400\n million.\nFailure of TDCC to comply with any of the covenants or default provisions could result in a default under the applicable credit agreement which would allow the lenders to not fund future loan requests and to accelerate the due date of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on any outstanding indebtedness.\nDow Inc. is obligated, substantially concurrently with the issuance of any guarantee in respect of outstanding or committed indebtedness under TDCC's Revolving Credit Agreement, to enter into a supplemental indenture with TDCC and the trustee under TDCC’s existing 2008 base indenture governing certain notes issued by TDCC. Under such supplemental indenture, Dow Inc. will guarantee all outstanding debt securities and all amounts due under such existing base indenture and will become subject to certain covenants and events of default under the existing base indenture. \nIn addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement includes an event of default which would be triggered in the event Dow Inc. incurs or guarantees third party indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $\n250\n million or engages in any material activity or directly owns any material assets, in each case, subject to certain conditions and exceptions. Dow Inc. may, at its option, cure the event of default by delivering an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee to the administrative agent within thirty days of the event or events giving rise to such event of default.\nNo such events have occurred or have been triggered at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n100\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 15 – \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEnvironmental Matters\nIntroduction\nAccruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. At December 31, 2024, the Company had accrued obligations of $\n1,113\n million\n for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs ($\n1,180\n million\n at December 31, 2023), including $\n234\n million for the remediation of Superfund sites ($\n241\n million at December 31, 2023). This is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies for handling site remediation and restoration. As new or additional information becomes available and/or certain spending trends become known, management will evaluate such information in determination of the current estimate of the environmental liability.\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the Company's accrued obligations for environmental matters for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nAccrued Obligations for Environmental Matters\n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nBalance at Jan 1\n$\n1,180\n \n$\n1,192\n \nAccrual adjustment\n216\n \n211\n \nPayments against reserve\n(\n259\n)\n(\n229\n)\nForeign currency impact\n(\n24\n)\n6\n \nBalance at Dec 31\n$\n1,113\n \n$\n1,180\n \nThe amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled $\n197\n million\n in 2024, $\n203\n million\n in 2023 and $\n176\n million\n in 2022. Capital expenditures for environmental protection were $\n208\n million in 2024, $\n228\n million in 2023 and $\n137\n million in 2022.\nMidland Off-Site Environmental Matters \nOn June 12, 2003, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (\"MDEQ\") issued a Hazardous Waste Operating License (the \"License\") to the Company’s Midland, Michigan, manufacturing site (the “Midland Site”), which was renewed and replaced by the MDEQ on September 25, 2015, and included provisions requiring the Company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off-site contamination in the City of Midland soils, the Tittabawassee River and Saginaw River sediment and floodplain soils, and the Saginaw Bay, and, if necessary, undertake remedial action. In 2016, final regulatory approval was received from the MDEQ for the City of Midland and the Company is continuing the long-term monitoring requirements of the Remedial Action Plan.\nTittabawassee and Saginaw Rivers, Saginaw Bay\nThe Company, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the State of Michigan (\"State\") entered into an administrative order on consent (“AOC”), effective January 21, 2010, that requires the Company to conduct a remedial investigation, a feasibility study and a remedial design for the Tittabawassee River, the Saginaw River and the Saginaw Bay, and pay the oversight costs of the EPA and the State under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. These actions, to be conducted under the lead oversight of the EPA, will build upon the investigative work completed under the State Resource Conservation Recovery Act program from 2005 through 2009. \nThe Tittabawassee River, beginning at the Midland Site and extending down to the first six miles of the Saginaw River, are designated as the first Operable Unit for purposes of conducting the remedial investigation, feasibility study and remedial design work. This work will be performed in a largely upriver to downriver sequence for eight geographic segments of the Tittabawassee and upper Saginaw Rivers. In the first quarter of 2012, the EPA \n101\nTable of Contents\nrequested the Company address the Tittabawassee River floodplain (\"Floodplain\") as an additional segment. In January 2015, the Company and the EPA entered into an order to address remediation of the Floodplain. The remedial work is expected to continue as river levels allow. The remainder of the Saginaw River and the Saginaw Bay are designated as a second Operable Unit and the work associated with that unit may also be geographically segmented. The AOC does not obligate the Company to perform removal or remedial action; that action can only be required by a separate order. The Company and the EPA have been negotiating orders separate from the AOC that obligate the Company to perform remedial actions under the scope of work of the AOC. The Company and the EPA have entered into six separate orders to perform limited remedial actions in seven of the eight geographic segments in the first Operable Unit, including the Floodplain. Dow has received from the EPA a Notice of Completion of Work for three of these six orders and the Company continues the long-term monitoring requirements. In 2024, Dow continued its evaluation of the final geographic segment of the first Operable Unit and completed the implementation of the remedial actions for the three open orders for other areas in the first Operable Unit.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution Process\nThe Company, the EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the natural resource damage trustees (which include the Michigan Office of the Attorney General, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Saginaw-Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan) have been engaged in negotiations to seek to resolve potential governmental claims against the Company for natural resource damages related to historical off-site contamination associated with the City of Midland, the Tittabawassee and Saginaw Rivers and the Saginaw Bay. The Company and the governmental parties started meeting in the fall of 2005 and entered into a Confidentiality Agreement in December 2005.\nOn July 20, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (\"District Court\") entered a final consent decree in Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-13292 between the Company and federal, state and tribal trustees to resolve allegations of natural resource damages arising from the historic operations of the Company’s Midland Site. The consent decree required the Company to pay a $\n15\n million cash settlement to be used for long-term maintenance and trustee-selected remediation projects with an additional $\n7\n million to specified local projects managed by third parties. These funds were paid in December 2020. The consent decree further requires the Company to complete or fund 13 additional environmental restoration projects which are valued by the trustees at approximately $\n77\n million, to be conducted over the next several years. To date, five of the eight Dow-led projects have been completed, including four environmental restoration projects/public amenities opened to the public. The Company continues to work with the trustees on the remaining projects.\nAt December 31, 2024, the accrual for these off-site matters was $\n80\n million (included in the total accrued obligation of $\n1,113\n million\n). At December 31, 2023, the Company had an accrual for these off-site matters of $\n89\n million (included in the total accrued obligation of $\n1,180\n million\n).\nEnvironmental Matters Summary\nIt is the opinion of the Company’s management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those disclosed will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nLitigation\nAsbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation\nIntroduction\nUnion Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past several decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide’s premises and Union Carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. (\"Amchem\"). In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide’s products. Union Carbide expects more asbestos-related suits to be filed against Union Carbide and Amchem in the future, and will aggressively defend or reasonably resolve, as appropriate, both pending and future claims.\n102\nTable of Contents\nEstimating the Asbestos-Related Liability\nUnion Carbide has engaged Ankura Consulting Group, LLC (\"Ankura\") to perform periodic studies to estimate the undiscounted cost of disposing of pending and future claims against Union Carbide and Amchem through the terminal year of 2049, including a reasonable forecast of future defense and processing costs. Each October, Union Carbide requests Ankura to review its historical asbestos claim and resolution activity through the third quarter of the current year, including asbestos-related defense and processing costs, to determine the appropriateness of updating the most recent study. At each balance sheet date, Union Carbide also compares current asbestos claim and resolution activity, including asbestos-related defense and processing costs, to the results of the most recent Ankura study to determine whether the accrual continues to be appropriate.\nIn December 2022, Ankura completed a study of Union Carbide's historical asbestos claim and resolution activity through September 30, 2022, including asbestos-related defense and processing costs, and provided estimates for the undiscounted cost of disposing of pending and future claims against Union Carbide and Amchem through the terminal year of 2049. Based on the study and Union Carbide's internal review process, it was determined that no adjustment to the accrual was required.\nIn December 2023, Ankura stated that an update of its December 2022 study would not provide a more likely estimate of future events than the estimate reflected in that study and, therefore, the estimate in that study remained applicable. Based on Union Carbide's internal review process and Ankura's response, Union Carbide determined that no adjustment to the accrual was required. At December 31, 2023, the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims against Union Carbide and Amchem, including future asbestos-related defense and processing costs, was $\n867\n million, and approximately \n25\n percent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately \n75\n percent related to future claims.\nIn December 2024, Ankura completed a study of Union Carbide's historical asbestos claim and resolution activity through September 30, 2024, including asbestos-related defense and processing costs, and provided estimates for the undiscounted cost of disposing of pending and future claims against Union Carbide and Amchem through the terminal year of 2049. Based on the study and Union Carbide's internal review process, it was determined that no adjustment to the accrual was required. At December 31, 2024, the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims against Union Carbide and Amchem, including future asbestos-related defense and processing costs, was $\n791\n million, and approximately \n23\n percent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately \n77\n percent related to future claims.\nSummary\nThe Company's management believes the amounts recorded by Union Carbide for the asbestos-related liability, including defense and processing costs, reflect reasonable and probable estimates of the liability based upon current, known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed and/or received each year, the average cost of defending and disposing of each such claim, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the United States over a significant period of time, could cause the actual costs for Union Carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded. Any such events could result in an increase or decrease in the recorded liability.\nBecause of the uncertainties described above, Union Carbide cannot estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos-related claims facing Union Carbide and Amchem. As a result, it is reasonably possible that an additional cost of disposing of Union Carbide's asbestos-related claims, including future defense and processing costs, could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position.\nLegacy Matters\nThe Company is the subject of various complaints related to alleged groundwater contamination based on decades-old sales and applications of certain agricultural chemical products (\"Groundwater Matters\"). The costs associated with these Groundwater Matters were previously covered by insurance policies that have since been depleted. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company completed a study of the Groundwater Matters now deemed to be probable and estimable based on the public reporting of sampling data and historical information to develop a reasonable estimate of the cost of pending and future claims. As a result, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $\n177\n million, included in \"Cost of sales\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure. At December 31, 2024, the total liability related to such alleged Groundwater Matters settlements was $\n155\n million ($\n232\n million at December 31, 2023), which was included in “Accrued and other current liabilities” and \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n103\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is also the subject of other groundwater contamination complaints, including claims related to 1,4-dioxane. The Company continues to defend itself in this litigation and it has determined that the Company's exposure to liability, if any, is not currently probable or estimable at December 31, 2024.\nSeparately, on October 10, 2024, the Company executed a settlement agreement related to arbitration for historical product claims from a divested business. As a result, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $\n75\n million in the third quarter of 2024, which is included in \"Cost of sales\" in the consolidated statements of income, related to Corporate, and was paid in the fourth quarter of 2024. This is management's best estimate of loss, although the amount is subject to further arbitration and it is reasonably possible that the total loss could range up to approximately three times that amount.\nOther Litigation Matters\nIn addition to the specific matters described above, the Company is party to a number of other claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business with respect to product liability, patent infringement, employment matters, governmental tax and regulation disputes, contract and commercial litigation, and other actions. Certain of these actions purport to be class actions and seek damages in very large amounts. All such claims are being contested. The Company has an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers at various times. These policies may provide coverage that could be utilized to minimize the financial impact, if any, of certain contingencies described above. It is the opinion of the Company’s management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such other claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company.\nIndemnifications with Corning Incorporated (\"Corning\")\nIn connection with the June 1, 2016, ownership restructure of Dow Silicones, the Company is indemnified by Corning for at least \n50\n percent of future losses associated with certain pre-closing liabilities, subject to certain conditions and limits. The maximum amount of indemnified losses which may be recovered are subject to a cap that declines over time. Indemnified losses are capped at $\n1\n billion between May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2023, and \nno\n recoveries are permitted on claims initially submitted after May 31, 2023. The Company had indemnification assets of $\n43\n million at December 31, 2024 ($\n100\n million at December 31, 2023), which was included in \"Other current assets\" and \"Noncurrent receivables\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\nGain Contingency - Dow v. Nova Chemicals Corporation Patent Infringement Matter\nIn December 2010, Dow filed suit in the Federal Court in Ontario, Canada (\"Federal Court\") alleging that Nova Chemicals Corporation (\"Nova\") was infringing the Company's Canadian polyethylene patent 2,106,705 (the \"'705 Patent\"). Nova counterclaimed on the grounds of invalidity and non-infringement. In accordance with Canadian practice, the suit was bifurcated into a merits phase, followed by a damages phase. Following trial in the merits phase, in May 2014, the Federal Court ruled that the Company's '705 Patent was valid and infringed by Nova. Nova appealed to the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal, which affirmed the Federal Court decision in August 2016. Nova then sought leave to appeal its loss to the Supreme Court of Canada (\"Canadian Supreme Court\"), which dismissed Nova’s petition in April 2017. As a result, Nova exhausted all appeal rights on the merits, and it was undisputed that Nova owed the Company the profits it earned from its infringing sales as determined in the trial for the damages phase.\nIn April 2017, the Federal Court issued a Public Judgment in the damages phase, which detailed its conclusions on how to calculate the profits to be awarded to the Company. In June 2017, the Federal Court ordered Nova to pay $\n645\n million Canadian dollars to the Company, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, for which the Company received payment equivalent to $\n501\n million U.S. dollars in July 2017. Although Nova was appealing portions of the damages judgment, certain portions of it were indisputable and could be retained by the Company regardless of the outcome of any further appeals by Nova. As a result of these actions and in accordance with ASC Topic 450-30 \"Gain Contingencies,\" the Company recorded a $\n160\n million pretax gain in the second quarter of 2017. \nOn September 15, 2020, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Nova's appeal of the damages judgment, thus affirming the trial court's decision in its entirety. In November 2020, Nova filed an application for leave to appeal this decision to the Canadian Supreme Court. In November 2022, the Canadian Supreme Court dismissed Nova's appeal, thereby exhausting all of Nova's appeal rights for the damages judgment. As a result, the Company recorded a pretax gain of $\n341\n million in the fourth quarter of 2022 for the previously disputed portion of the damages judgment, of which $\n321\n million was included in \"Sundry income (expense) - net,\" related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics, and $\n20\n million was included in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in the consolidated statements of income.\n104\nTable of Contents\nGain Contingency - Dow v. Nova Chemicals Corporation Ethylene Asset Matter\nOn September 18, 2019, the Court of the King's Bench in Alberta, Canada, signed a judgment ordering Nova to pay the Company $\n1.43\n billion Canadian dollars (equivalent to approximately $\n1.08\n billion U.S. dollars) by October 11, 2019, for damages the Company incurred through 2012 related to the companies’ jointly-owned ethylene asset in Joffre, Alberta, Canada, which has been received by the Company. The Court of the King's Bench in Alberta, Canada, which initially ruled in June 2018, found that Nova failed to operate the ethylene asset at full capacity for more than ten years, and furthermore, that Nova violated several contractual agreements related to the Company receiving its share of the asset’s ethylene production. These actions deprived the Company of millions of pounds of ethylene. Nova appealed the judgment; however, certain portions were no longer in dispute and would be retained by the Company regardless of the outcome of any further appeals by Nova. As a result and in accordance with ASC Topic 450-30 “Gain Contingencies,” the Company recorded a $\n186\n million pretax gain in 2019. In 2020 and 2023, f\nurther actions by Nova and/or related court decisions upholding \nthe majority of Dow's damages \nmade additional portions of the ruling in Dow's favor final and no longer subject to dispute. \nAs a result, the Company recorded additional pretax gains of $\n570\n million in 2020 and $\n122\n million in 2023. In 2023, $\n106\n million of the pretax gain was included in \"Sundry income (expense) - net,\" related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics, and $\n16\n million was included in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in the consolidated statements of income. \nAt December 31, 2024, $\n201\n million ($\n201\n million at December 31, 2023) was included in \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the Company's consolidated balance sheets related to the disputed portion of the damages judgment. Dow continues to seek an award of additional damages for the period from 2013 through 2018 to account for the ethylene shortfall during those years. The damages hearing that began in the trial court in November 2021 to resolve the impact of the appellate ruling and quantify Dow's damages for the 2013-2018 period has concluded; the parties are awaiting the court's ruling. Dow has also filed another lawsuit in the same Alberta, Canada court to account for damages due to lost ethylene after June 2018.\nBrazilian Tax Credits\nIn March 2017, the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (“Brazil Supreme Court”) ruled in a leading case that a Brazilian value-added tax (\"ICMS\") should not be included in the base used to calculate a taxpayer's federal contribution on total revenue known as PIS/COFINS (the “2017 Decision”). Previously, three of the Company’s Brazilian subsidiaries filed lawsuits challenging the inclusion of ICMS in their calculation of PIS/COFINS, seeking recovery of excess taxes paid. In response to the 2017 Decision, the Brazilian tax authority filed an appeal seeking clarification of the amount of ICMS tax to exclude from the calculation of PIS/COFINS. In May 2021, the Brazil Supreme Court ruled in a leading case related to the amount of ICMS tax to exclude from the calculation of PIS/COFINS, which resolved two of the lawsuits filed by the Company. In May 2022, a court decision related to the remaining lawsuit, ruling in favor of the Company's Brazilian subsidiary, became final and unappealable and the Company recorded pretax gains of $\n112\n million for certain excess PIS/COFINS paid, plus applicable interest, which the Company expects to apply to future required federal tax payments, and the reversal of related liabilities. The pretax gains were recorded in “Cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2024, related tax credits available and expected to be applied to future required federal tax payments totaled $\n63\n million ($\n114\n million at December 31, 2023).\nPurchase Commitments\nIn the third quarter of 2024, the Company entered into a commitment for the use of a reservoir asset that will be used to supply water to one of Dow’s main U.S. Gulf Coast manufacturing locations. The related contract became effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, with a 35 year contract period expected to commence in 2028 upon completion of construction. The aggregate value of the fixed and determinable portion over the expected contract period is $\n1.3\n billion (approximately $\n650\n million on a present value basis) at December 31, 2024.\n105\nTable of Contents\nGuarantees\nThe following table provides a summary of the final expiration, maximum future payments and recorded liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for guarantees:\nGuarantees\nDec 31, 2024\nDec 31, 2023\nIn millions\nFinal\nExpiration\nMaximum Future Payments \n1\nRecorded Liability\nFinal\nExpiration\nMaximum Future Payments \n1\nRecorded Liability\nGuarantees\n2038\n$\n1,456\n \n$\n155\n \n2038\n$\n1,385\n \n$\n196\n \n1.\nIn addition, TDCC has provided guarantees, in proportion to the Company's \n35\n percent ownership interest, of all future interest payments that will become due on Sadara’s project financing debt during the grace period, which Dow's share is estimated to be $\n158\n million at December 31, 2024 ($\n298\n million at December 31, 2023). The Company does not expect to be required to perform under the guarantees.\nGuarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, committed accounts receivable facilities and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others (via delivery of cash or other assets) if specified triggering events occur. With guarantees, such as commercial or financial contracts, non-performance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation of the Company to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee. The majority of the Company’s guarantees relate to debt of nonconsolidated affiliates, which have expiration dates ranging from less than one year to 14 years. The Company’s current expectation is that future payment or performance related to the non-performance of others is considered remote.\nThe Company maintains accounts receivable facilities with various financial institutions, with committed and uncommitted facilities in the United States and a committed facility in Europe. Under the terms of the Programs, the Company continues to service the receivables from the customers, but retains no interest in the receivables, and remits payment to the financial institutions. The Company also has access to accounts receivable discounting facilities, under which receivables are transferred with limited recourse. The Company’s maximum guaranteed liability for the accounts receivable facilities is $\n239\n million at December 31, 2024 ($\n150\n million at December 31, 2023). The Company expects receivable collections and remittances to occur within the next six months.\nTDCC has entered into guarantee agreements related to Sadara, a nonconsolidated affiliate. Sadara reached an agreement with its lenders to re-profile its outstanding project financing debt in the first quarter of 2021. In conjunction with the debt re-profiling, TDCC entered into a guarantee of up to approximately $\n1.3\n billion of Sadara’s debt, proportionate to the Company's \n35\n percent ownership interest. The debt re-profiling includes a grace period until June 2026, during which Sadara is obligated to make interest-only payments which are guaranteed by TDCC in proportion to the Company's \n35\n percent ownership interest. As part of the debt re-profiling, Sadara established a $\n500\n million revolving credit facility guaranteed by Dow, which would be used to fund Dow’s pro-rata share of any potential shortfall during the grace period. See Note 11 for additional information on Dow's investment in Sadara.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company has \n91\n manufacturing sites in \n30\n countries. Most of these sites contain numerous individual manufacturing operations, particularly at the Company’s larger sites. Asset retirement obligations are recorded as incurred and reasonably estimable, including obligations for which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the Company. The retirement of assets may involve such efforts as remediation and treatment of asbestos, contractually required demolition, and other related activities, depending on the nature and location of the assets; and retirement obligations are typically realized only upon demolition of those facilities. In identifying asset retirement obligations, the Company considers identification of legally enforceable obligations, changes in existing law, estimates of potential settlement dates and the calculation of an appropriate discount rate to be used in calculating the fair value of the obligations. The Company has a well-established global process to identify, approve and track the demolition of retired or to-be-retired facilities; and no assets are retired from service until this process has been followed. The Company typically forecasts demolition projects based on the usefulness of the assets; environmental, health and safety concerns; and other similar considerations. Under this process, as demolition projects are identified and approved, reasonable estimates are determined for the time frames during which any related asset retirement obligations are expected to be settled. For those assets where a range of potential settlement dates may be reasonably estimated, obligations are recorded. The Company routinely reviews all changes to items under consideration for demolition to determine if an adjustment to the value of the asset retirement obligation is required.\n106\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has recognized asset retirement obligations for the demolition and remediation activities at manufacturing sites primarily in Europe, the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Japan, and capping activities at landfill sites in the United States, Brazil and Canada. The Company has also recognized conditional asset retirement obligations related to asbestos encapsulation as a result of planned demolition and remediation activities at manufacturing and administrative sites primarily in the United States and Europe. The aggregate carrying amount of conditional asset retirement obligations recognized by the Company (included in the asset retirement obligations balance shown below) was $\n19\n million at December 31, 2024 ($\n21\n million at December 31, 2023). \nThe following table shows changes in the aggregate carrying amount of the Company’s asset retirement obligations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nBalance at Jan 1\n$\n140\n \n$\n119\n \nAdditional accruals\n45\n \n26\n \nLiabilities settled\n(\n13\n)\n(\n2\n)\nAccretion expense\n4\n \n3\n \nRevisions in estimated cash flows\n3\n \n1\n \nOther\n(\n5\n)\n(\n7\n)\nBalance at Dec 31\n$\n174\n \n$\n140\n \nThe discount rate used to calculate the Company’s asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2024, was \n4.93\n percent (\n5.07\n percent at December 31, 2023). These obligations are included in the consolidated balance sheets as \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" and \"Other noncurrent obligations.\"\nThe Company has not recognized conditional asset retirement obligations for which a fair value cannot be reasonably estimated in its consolidated financial statements. Assets that have not been submitted/reviewed for potential demolition activities are considered to have continued usefulness and are generally still operating normally. Therefore, without a plan to demolish the assets or the expectation of a plan, such as shortening the useful life of assets for depreciation purposes in accordance with the accounting guidance related to property, plant and equipment, the Company is unable to reasonably forecast a time frame to use for present value calculations. As such, the Company has not recognized obligations for individual plants/buildings at its manufacturing sites where estimates of potential settlement dates cannot be reasonably made. In addition, the Company has not recognized conditional asset retirement obligations for the capping of its approximately \n25\n underground storage wells and \n79\n underground brine mining and other wells at Company-owned sites when there are no plans or expectations of plans to exit the sites. It is the opinion of the Company’s management that the possibility is remote that such conditional asset retirement obligations, when estimable, will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on current costs.\nNOTE 16 - \nLEASES\nOperating lease ROU assets are included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" while finance lease ROU assets are included in \"Net property\" in the consolidated balance sheets. With respect to lease liabilities, operating lease liabilities are included in \"Operating lease liabilities - current\" and \"Operating lease liabilities - noncurrent,\" and finance lease liabilities are included in \"Long-term debt due within one year\" and \"Long-Term Debt\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\nDow routinely leases sales and administrative offices, power plants, production facilities, warehouses and tanks for product storage, aircraft, motor vehicles, railcars, office machines and equipment. Some leases contain renewal provisions, purchase options and escalation clauses and the terms for these leased assets vary depending on the lease agreement. These leased assets have remaining lease terms of up to \n51\n years.

Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, InfraPark has the option to purchase up to an additional \n9\n percent of Dow InfraCo, LLC's membership interests in exchange for additional cash proceeds of up to $\n600\n million within six months of the closing date of the Transaction. The Company is targeting to close the Transaction in mid-2025, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. Upon closing the Transaction, InfraPark's ownership is expected to be accounted for as a noncontrolling interest in Dow InfraCo, LLC. Dow InfraCo, LLC and its subsidiaries operate certain non-product producing energy, environmental, pipeline and infrastructure assets located at five of the Company's manufacturing sites in the U.S. Gulf Coast.\nNOTE 19 – \nPENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nThe Company has both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in the United States and a number of other countries. The U.S. tax-qualified plans administered by the parent company are the largest plans. In 2021, the Company announced changes to the design of its U.S. tax-qualified and non-qualified pension plans (collectively, the \"U.S. Plans\"), which covered substantially all U.S. employees. As a result, effective December 31, 2023, the Company froze the pensionable compensation and credited service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for substantially all employees who participated in the U.S. Plans.\nSeparately, in the fourth quarter of 2023, certain Company pension plans in the United States and Canada purchased or converted to nonparticipating group annuity contracts from certain insurance companies, irrevocably transferring approximately $\n1,681\n million of benefit obligations and $\n1,617\n million of related plan assets to the insurers. These transactions did not require any cash funding from the Company and did not impact the pension benefits of participants. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized pretax, non-cash settlement charges of $\n642\n million in 2023, primarily related to the accelerated recognition of a portion of the accumulated actuarial losses of the plans, recorded in “Sundry income (expense) – net” in the consolidated statements of income and related to Corporate. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company initiated the termination of certain U.S. tax-qualified pension plans, which include the tax-qualified benefit obligations for substantially all employees hired after January 1, 2008. These employees earned benefits based on a set percentage of annual pay, plus interest. As part of the plan termination process, the Company will offer participants of these plans annuity or lump sum distribution options. Final asset distributions are expected to be paid from plan assets in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n113\nTable of Contents\nThe Company's funding policy is to contribute to the plans when pension laws and/or economics either require or encourage funding. Total global pension contributions were $\n121\n million in 2024, which includes contributions necessary to fund benefit payments for the Company's unfunded pension plans. Additionally, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company received a pension plan reversion of approximately $\n70\n million (approximately $\n90\n million in the second quarter of 2023) for a portion of the excess funding of one of its plans in Europe, included in \"Other assets and liabilities, net\" in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company expects to contribute approximately $\n175\n million to its pension plans in 2025.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine pension plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost for all plans are summarized in the table below:\nWeighted-Average Assumptions for All Pension Plans \nBenefit Obligations\n at Dec 31\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost \nfor the Year Ended\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n5.13\n \n%\n4.73\n \n%\n4.73\n \n%\n5.26\n \n%\n2.57\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate for applicable benefits\n3.81\n \n%\n3.99\n \n%\n3.99\n \n%\n4.19\n \n%\n3.57\n \n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.40\n \n%\n3.80\n \n%\n3.80\n \n%\n4.05\n \n%\n3.94\n \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n6.42\n \n%\n6.62\n \n%\n6.68\n \n%\n \nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine pension plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost for U.S. plans are summarized in the table below:\nWeighted-Average Assumptions for U.S. Pension Plans\nBenefit Obligations\n at Dec 31\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost \nfor the Year Ended\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n5.74\n \n%\n5.30\n \n%\n5.30\n \n%\n5.76\n \n%\n3.04\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate for applicable benefits\n3.54\n \n%\n4.50\n \n%\n4.50\n \n%\n4.50\n \n%\n4.50\n \n%\nRate of compensation increase \n1\n— \n%\n4.25\n \n%\n4.25\n \n%\n4.25\n \n%\n4.25\n \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n7.07\n \n%\n7.46\n \n%\n7.95\n \n%\n1.\nThe rate of compensation increase assumption is not relevant for the U.S. Plans at December 31, 2024, due to the freezing of plan benefits.\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees and survivors. The Company’s plans outside of the United States are not significant; therefore, this discussion relates to the U.S. plans only. The plans provide health care benefits, including hospital, physicians’ services, drug and major medical expense coverage, and life insurance benefits. In general, for employees hired before January 1, 1993, the plans provide benefits supplemental to Medicare when retirees are eligible for these benefits. The Company and the retiree share the cost of these benefits, with the Company portion increasing as the retiree has increased years of credited service, although there is a cap on the Company portion. The Company has the ability to change these benefits at any time. Employees hired after January 1, 2008, are not covered under the plans.\nThe Company funds most of the cost of these health care and life insurance benefits as incurred. In 2024, the Company did not make any contributions to its other postretirement benefit plan trusts. The trusts did not hold assets at December 31, 2024. The Company does not expect to contribute assets to its other postretirement benefit plan trusts in 2025.\n114\nTable of Contents\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine other postretirement benefit plan obligations and net periodic benefit cost for the U.S. plans are provided below:\nWeighted-Average Assumptions for U.S. Other Postretirement Benefits Plans\nBenefit Obligations\n at Dec 31\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost \nfor the Year Ended\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n5.66\n \n%\n5.23\n \n%\n5.23\n \n%\n5.57\n \n%\n2.85\n \n%\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year\n7.00\n \n%\n6.61\n \n%\n6.61\n \n%\n6.79\n \n%\n6.50\n \n%\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate health care cost trend rate)\n5.00\n \n%\n5.00\n \n%\n5.00\n \n%\n5.00\n \n%\n5.00\n \n%\nYear that the rate reaches the ultimate health care cost trend rate\n2033\n2033\n2033\n2033\n2028\nAssumptions\nThe Company determines the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by performing a detailed analysis of key economic and market factors driving historical returns for each asset class and formulating a projected return based on factors in the current environment. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, inflation, real economic growth, interest rate yield, interest rate spreads and other valuation measures and market metrics. The expected long-term rate of return for each asset class is then weighted based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the governing body for each plan. The Company’s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered. \nThe Company uses the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the United States and other selected countries, as applicable. Under the spot rate approach, the Company calculates service cost and interest cost by applying individual spot rates from the Willis Towers Watson RATE:Link yield curve (based on high-quality corporate bond yields) for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost. Service cost and interest cost for all other plans are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations.\nThe discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the U.S. plans are based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date. Future expected actuarially determined cash flows for the Company’s U.S. plans are individually discounted at the spot rates under the Willis Towers Watson U.S. RATE:Link 60-90 corporate yield curve (based on 60th to 90th percentile high-quality corporate bond yields) to arrive at the plan’s obligations as of the measurement date. \nThe Company’s mortality assumption used for the U.S. plans is a benefit-weighted version of the Society of Actuaries’ RP-2014 base table with future rates of mortality improvement based on a modified version of the assumptions used in the Social Security Administration’s 2021 trustees report. \n115\nTable of Contents\nSummarized information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans is as follows:\nChange in Projected Benefit Obligations, Plan Assets and Funded Status of All Significant Plans\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nChange in projected benefit obligations:\nBenefit obligations at beginning of year\n$\n22,467\n \n$\n22,861\n \n$\n914\n \n$\n893\n \nService cost\n57\n \n272\n \n3\n \n4\n \nInterest cost\n1,005\n \n1,110\n \n44\n \n45\n \nPlan participants' contributions\n16\n \n9\n \n—\n \n—\n \nActuarial changes in assumptions and experience\n(\n877\n)\n1,086\n \n(\n56\n)\n65\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n1,237\n)\n(\n1,385\n)\n(\n88\n)\n(\n94\n)\nPlan amendments\n—\n \n6\n \n—\n \n—\n \nOther\n8\n \n6\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEffect of foreign exchange rates\n(\n360\n)\n279\n \n(\n5\n)\n1\n \nSettlements/curtailments/termination benefits \n1\n(\n69\n)\n(\n1,777\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nBenefit obligations at end of year\n$\n21,010\n \n$\n22,467\n \n$\n812\n \n$\n914\n \nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n$\n19,634\n \n$\n21,231\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nActual return on plan assets \n9\n \n1,228\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEmployer contributions\n121\n \n142\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPlan participants' contributions\n16\n \n9\n \n—\n \n—\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n1,237\n)\n(\n1,385\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nSettlements \n2\n(\n34\n)\n(\n1,777\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nOther \n3\n(\n56\n)\n(\n73\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nEffect of foreign exchange rates\n(\n284\n)\n259\n \n—\n \n—\n \nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n$\n18,169\n \n$\n19,634\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nFunded status:\nU.S. plans with plan assets\n$\n(\n1,360\n)\n$\n(\n1,192\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nNon-U.S. plans with plan assets\n(\n888\n)\n(\n1,017\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nAll other plans\n(\n593\n)\n(\n624\n)\n(\n812\n)\n(\n914\n)\nFunded status at end of year\n$\n(\n2,841\n)\n$\n(\n2,833\n)\n$\n(\n812\n)\n$\n(\n914\n)\nAmounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets at Dec 31:\nDeferred charges and other assets\n$\n757\n \n$\n889\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nAccrued and other current liabilities\n(\n73\n)\n(\n67\n)\n(\n77\n)\n(\n86\n)\nPension and other postretirement benefits - noncurrent\n(\n3,525\n)\n(\n3,655\n)\n(\n735\n)\n(\n828\n)\nNet amount recognized\n$\n(\n2,841\n)\n$\n(\n2,833\n)\n$\n(\n812\n)\n$\n(\n914\n)\nPretax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss at Dec 31:\nNet loss (gain)\n$\n7,996\n \n$\n7,709\n \n$\n(\n417\n)\n$\n(\n402\n)\nPrior service credit\n(\n44\n)\n(\n84\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nPretax balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss at end of year\n$\n7,952\n \n$\n7,625\n \n$\n(\n417\n)\n$\n(\n402\n)\n1.\nThe 2024 impact primarily relates to the curtailment, special termination benefits and settlement of certain pension benefit obligations of a European plan resulting from the 2023 Restructuring Program, and the settlement and curtailment impacts of certain pension benefit obligations in Canada, China and Europe.

Includes benefit payments related to the planned termination of certain U.S. tax qualified pension plans.\nPlan Assets\nPlan assets consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities of United States and foreign issuers, and include alternative investments, such as real estate, private equity and absolute return strategies. Plan assets totaled $\n18.2\n billion at December 31, 2024 and $\n19.6\n billion at December 31, 2023 and included no directly held common stock of Dow Inc.\nThe Company's investment strategy for plan assets is to manage the assets in relation to the liability in order to pay retirement benefits to plan participants over the life of the plans. This is accomplished by identifying and managing the exposure to various market risks, diversifying investments across various asset classes and earning an acceptable long-term rate of return consistent with an acceptable amount of risk, while considering the liquidity needs of the plans.\nThe plans are permitted to use derivative instruments for investment purposes, as well as for hedging the underlying asset and liability exposure and rebalancing the asset allocation. The plans use value-at-risk, stress testing, scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to monitor and manage both the risk within the portfolios and the surplus risk of the plans.\nEquity securities primarily include investments in large- and small-cap companies located in both developed and emerging markets around the world. Fixed income securities include investment and non-investment grade corporate bonds of companies diversified across industries, U.S. treasuries, non-U.S. developed market securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, emerging market securities and fixed income related funds. Alternative investments primarily include investments in real estate, private equity and absolute return strategies. Other significant investment types include various insurance contracts and interest rate, equity, commodity and foreign exchange derivative investments and hedges.\nThe Company mitigates the credit risk of investments by establishing guidelines with investment managers that limit investment in any single issue or issuer to an amount that is not material to the portfolio being managed. These guidelines are monitored for compliance both by the Company and external managers. Credit risk related to derivative activity is mitigated by utilizing multiple counterparties, collateral support agreements and centralized clearing, where appropriate. A short-term investment money market fund is utilized as the sweep vehicle for the U.S. plans, which from time to time can represent a significant investment.\n118\nTable of Contents\nThe weighted-average target allocation for plan assets of the Company's pension plans is summarized as follows:\nTarget Allocation for Plan Assets at Dec 31, 2024\nTarget Allocation\nAsset Category\nEquity securities\n20\n \n%\nFixed income securities\n49\n \nAlternative investments\n26\n \nOther investments\n5\n \nTotal \n100\n \n%\nFair value calculations may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nFor pension plan assets classified as Level 1 measurements (measured using quoted prices in active markets), total fair value is either the price of the most recent trade at the time of the market close or the official close price, as defined by the exchange on which the asset is most actively traded on the last trading day of the period, multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs.\nFor pension plan assets classified as Level 2 measurements, where the security is frequently traded in less active markets, fair value is based on the closing price at the end of the period; where the security is less frequently traded, fair value is based on the price a dealer would pay for the security or similar securities, adjusted for any terms specific to that asset or liability. Market inputs are obtained from well-established and recognized vendors of market data and subjected to tolerance and quality checks. For derivative assets and liabilities, standard industry models are used to calculate the fair value of the various financial instruments based on significant observable market inputs, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, swap rates, interest rates and implied volatilities obtained from various market sources. For other pension plan assets for which observable inputs are used, fair value is derived through the use of fair value models, such as a discounted cash flow model or other standard pricing models.\nFor pension plan assets classified as Level 3 measurements, total fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs including assumptions where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment.\nCertain pension plan assets are held in funds where fair value is based on an estimated net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as of the most recently available fund financial statements which are received on a monthly or quarterly basis.

In addition, beginning on January 1, 2024, all eligible U.S. employees also received an automatic non-elective contribution of \n4\n percent of eligible compensation to their respective defined contribution plans. Defined contribution plans also cover employees in some subsidiaries in other countries, including Brazil, The Netherlands, Canada, Korea, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Expense recognized for all defined contribution plans was $\n312\n million in 2024, $\n214\n million in 2023 and $\n150\n million in 2022.\nNOTE 20 – \nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company grants stock-based compensation to employees and non-employee directors under stock incentive plans, in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, PSUs and RSUs. The Company also provides stock-based compensation in the form of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which grants eligible employees the right to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a discounted price. \nThe total stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of income was $\n159\n million, $\n212\n million and $\n211\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements were $\n35\n million, $\n47\n million and $\n47\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants stock-based compensation awards that vest over a specified period or upon employees meeting certain performance and/or retirement eligibility criteria. The fair value of equity instruments issued to employees is measured on the grant date. The fair value of liability instruments (granted to executive employees subject to stock ownership requirements, that provide the recipient the option to elect to receive a cash payment equal to the value of the stock award on the date of delivery) is measured at the end of each quarter. The fair value of equity and liability instruments is expensed over the vesting period or, in the case of retirement, from the grant date to the date on which retirement eligibility provisions have been met and additional service is no longer required. The Company estimates expected forfeitures based on historical activity.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options. \nThe weighted-average assumptions used to calculate total stock-based compensation are included in the following table:\nWeighted-Average Assumptions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDividend yield\n5.08\n \n%\n4.74\n \n%\n4.59\n \n%\nExpected volatility\n29.70\n \n%\n30.30\n \n%\n30.20\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.24\n \n%\n3.83\n \n%\n2.00\n \n%\nExpected life of stock options granted during period (years)\n6.00\n6.00\n6.25\n121\nTable of Contents\nThe dividend yield assumption was equal to the dividend yield on the grant date, which reflected the Company's quarterly dividend payments of $\n0.70\n per share in 2024, 2023 and 2022 on Dow Inc. common stock. The expected volatility assumptions for the 2024, 2023 and 2022 stock options were based on an equal weighting of the historical daily volatility for the expected term of the awards and current implied volatility from exchange-traded options. The expected volatility assumption for the market portion of the 2024, 2023 and 2022 PSU awards were based on historical daily volatility for the term of the award. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury strip rates over the expected life of the 2024, 2023 and 2022 options. The expected life of stock options granted was based on an analysis of historical exercise patterns.\nStock Incentive Plan\nThe Company has historically granted equity awards under various plans (the \"Prior Plans\"). On February 9, 2012, the TDCC Board of Directors authorized The Dow Chemical Company 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2012 Plan\"), which was approved by stockholders at TDCC's annual meeting on May 10, 2012 (\"2012 Plan Effective Date\"), and became effective on that date. On February 13, 2014, the TDCC Board of Directors adopted The Dow Chemical Company Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2012 Restated Plan\"). The 2012 Restated Plan was approved by stockholders at TDCC's annual meeting on May 15, 2014, and became effective on that date. The Prior Plans were superseded by the 2012 Plan and the 2012 Restated Plan (collectively, the \"2012 Plan\"). Under the 2012 Plan, the Company granted options, RSUs, PSUs, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and stock units to employees and non-employee directors, subject to an aggregate limit and annual individual limits. The terms of the grants were fixed at the grant date. TDCC's stock-based compensation programs were assumed by DowDuPont and continued in place with the ability to grant and issue DowDuPont common stock until separation.\nOn April 1, 2019 (\"Original Effective Date\"), in connection with the separation, the Company adopted the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2019 Plan\"). On February 11, 2021, the Board approved the first amendment, which was approved by the Company's stockholders at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on April 15, 2021. Under the 2019 Plan, as amended in 2021, the Company may grant stock options, RSUs, PSUs, stock appreciation rights and stock units to employees and non-employee directors until the tenth anniversary of the Original Effective Date, subject to an aggregate limit and annual individual limits. The terms of the grants are fixed at the grant date. At December 31, 2024, there were approximately \n36\n million shares of common stock available for grant under the 2019 Plan.\nStock Options\nThe Company grants stock options to certain employees, subject to certain annual and individual limits, with terms of the grants fixed at the grant date. The exercise price of each stock option equals the market price of the common stock on the grant date. Options vest from \none year\n to \nthree years\n and have a maximum term of \nten years\n. \nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for 2024:\nStock Options \n2024\nShares in thousands\nShares\nExercise\nPrice \n1\nOutstanding at Jan 1, 2024\n13,303\n \n$\n56.79\n \nGranted\n1,308\n \n$\n55.17\n \nExercised\n(\n1,171\n)\n$\n48.38\n \nForfeited/Expired\n(\n70\n)\n$\n59.75\n \nOutstanding at Dec 31, 2024\n13,370\n \n$\n57.35\n \nRemaining contractual life in years\n4.55\nAggregate intrinsic value in millions\n$\n—\n \nExercisable at Dec 31, 2024\n10,984\n \n$\n57.37\n \nRemaining contractual life in years\n3.70\nAggregate intrinsic value in millions\n$\n—\n \n1\n. \nWeighted-average per share.\n122\nTable of Contents\nAdditional Information about Stock Options\nIn millions, except per share amounts\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted-average fair value per share of options granted\n$\n10.94\n \n$\n12.13\n \n$\n11.08\n \nTotal compensation expense for stock option plans\n$\n13\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n13\n \nRelated tax benefit\n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \nTotal amount of cash received from the exercise of options\n$\n53\n \n$\n77\n \n$\n109\n \nTotal intrinsic value of options exercised \n1\n$\n9\n \n$\n40\n \n$\n73\n \nRelated tax benefit\n$\n2\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n16\n \n1.\nDifference between the market price at exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the options.\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards of $\n4\n million at December 31, 2024, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n1.54\n years.\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company grants RSUs to certain employees and non-employee directors.

At December 31, 2024, approximately \n1.8\n million RSUs with a grant date weighted-average fair value per share of $\n57.81\n had previously vested, but were not issued. These shares are scheduled to be issued to employees within six months to three years or to non-employee directors upon retirement. \nPerformance Stock Units\nThe Company grants PSUs to certain employees. The grants vest when the Company attains specified performance targets, such as return on capital, cumulative cash from operations, environmental, social and governance metrics, and relative total shareholder return, over a predetermined period, generally \none year\n to \nthree years\n. Performance and payouts are determined independently for each metric. Compensation expense related to PSU awards is recognized over the lesser of the service or performance period.

Under the 2024 ESPP offering, most employees were eligible to purchase shares of common stock of Dow Inc. valued at up to \n10\n percent of their annual total base salary or wages. The number of shares purchased was determined using the amount contributed by the employee divided by the plan price. The plan price of the stock was equal to \n85\n percent of the fair market value (closing price) of the common stock at April 1, 2024 (beginning) or October 4, 2024 (ending) of the offering period, whichever was lower.\n124\nTable of Contents\nIn 2024, employees subscribed to the right to purchase approximately \n2.4\n million shares at a weighted-average price of $\n47.04\n per share.

To manage such risks effectively, the Company enters into hedging transactions, pursuant to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk. Derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities, where appropriate. A secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non-specific exposure within established limits and policies; derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges. The potential impact of creating such additional exposure is not material to the Company’s results. Accounting guidance requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value.\nThe Company’s risk management program for interest rate, foreign currency and commodity risks is based on fundamental, mathematical and technical models that take into account the implicit cost of hedging. Risks created by derivative instruments and the mark-to-market valuations of positions are strictly monitored at all times, using value-at-risk and stress tests. Counterparty credit risk arising from these contracts is not significant because the Company minimizes counterparty concentration, deals primarily with major financial institutions of solid credit quality, and the majority of its hedging transactions mature in less than three months. In addition, the Company minimizes concentrations of credit risk through its global orientation by transacting with large, internationally diversified financial counterparties. It is the Company’s policy to not have credit risk-related contingent features in its derivative instruments. No significant concentration of counterparty credit risk existed at December 31, 2024. The Company does not anticipate losses from credit risk, and the net cash requirements arising from counterparty risk associated with risk management activities are not expected to be material in 2025.\n126\nTable of Contents\nThe Company revises its strategies as market conditions dictate and management reviews its overall financial strategies and the impacts from using derivatives in its risk management program with the Company’s senior leadership who also reviews these strategies with the Board and/or relevant committees thereof.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe notional amounts of the Company's derivative instruments at December 31, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:\nNotional Amounts \n1\nDec 31, 2024\nDec 31, 2023\nIn millions\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts\n$\n1,870\n \n$\n3,000\n \nForeign currency contracts\n$\n3,144\n \n$\n2,316\n \nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts\n$\n14\n \n$\n59\n \nForeign currency contracts\n$\n9,244\n \n$\n5,824\n \n1.\nNotional amounts represent the absolute value of open derivative positions at the end of the period. Multi-leg option positions are reflected at the maximum notional position at expiration.\nThe notional amounts of the Company's commodity derivatives at December 31, 2024 and 2023, were as follows:\nCommodity Notionals \n1\nDec 31, 2024\nDec 31, 2023\nNotional Volume Unit\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nHydrocarbon derivatives\n3.2\n \n3.7\n \nmillion barrels of oil equivalent\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nHydrocarbon derivatives\n1.1\n \n1.4\n \nmillion barrels of oil equivalent\n1.\nNotional amounts represent the net volume of open derivative positions outstanding at the end of the period.\nMaturity Dates of Derivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nYear\nInterest rate contracts\n2025\nForeign currency contracts\n2026\nCommodity contracts\n2028\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges using interest rate swaps, “swaptions,” and exchange-traded instruments.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nThe global nature of the Company's business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets. The Company has assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary objective of the Company's foreign currency risk management is to optimize the U.S. dollar value of net assets and cash flows. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts, over-the-counter option contracts, cross-currency swaps and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies. Exposures primarily relate to assets, liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies, as well as economic exposure, which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities. \nCommodity Risk Management\nThe Company has exposure to the prices of commodities in its procurement of certain raw materials. The primary purpose of commodity hedging activities is to manage the price volatility associated with these forecasted inventory purchases.\n127\nTable of Contents\nDerivatives Not Designated in Hedging Relationships\nForeign Currency Contracts\nThe Company also uses foreign exchange forward contracts, options and cross-currency swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments primarily to manage foreign currency exposure.\nCommodity Contracts\nThe Company utilizes futures, options and swap instruments that are effective as economic hedges of commodity price exposures, but do not meet hedge accounting criteria for derivatives and hedging, to reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations on purchases of raw materials and inventory.\nInterest Rate Contracts\nThe Company uses swap instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments to manage interest rate exposures. The Company uses interest rate swaps, \"swaptions,\" and exchange-traded instruments to accomplish this objective.\nTotal Return Swaps\nThe Company uses total return swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments to manage equity indexed based exposures in employee benefit plans.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nCash Flow Hedges\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCL; it is reclassified to income in the same period or periods that the hedged transaction affects income. The unrealized amounts in AOCL fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts at the end of each reporting period. The Company anticipates volatility in AOCL and net income from its cash flow hedges. The amount of volatility varies with the level of derivative activities and market conditions during any period.\nThe portion of the mark-to-market effects of the foreign currency contracts is recorded in AOCL; it is reclassified to income in the same period or periods that the underlying item affects income, except for amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness that are recognized in earnings through an amortization approach.\nCommodity swaps, futures and option contracts with maturities of not more than 60 months are utilized and designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. The designated portion of the mark-to-market effect of the cash flow hedge instrument is recorded in AOCL; it is reclassified to income in the same period or periods that the underlying commodity purchase affects income.\nFair Value Hedges\nFor interest rate instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedge item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current period income and reflected as “Interest expense and amortization of debt discount” in the consolidated statements of income, except for amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness that are recognized in earnings through an amortization approach.\nNet Foreign Investment Hedges\nThe Company designates derivatives that qualify as effective net foreign investment hedges, the results of which are presented in the effect of derivative instruments table. The Company also utilizes non-derivative instruments as net foreign investment hedges. The Company had outstanding foreign-currency denominated debt designated as a hedge of net foreign investment of $\n2,466\n million at December 31, 2024 ($\n2,629\n million at December 31, 2023).\n \n128\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables provide the fair value and balance sheet classification of derivative instruments at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nDec 31, 2024\nDec 31, 2023\nIn millions\nGross\nCounterparty and Cash Collateral Netting \n1\nNet \n2\nGross\nCounterparty and Cash Collateral Netting \n1\nNet \n2\nAsset derivatives\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts \n3\n$\n20\n \n$\n(\n20\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n73\n \n$\n(\n73\n)\n$\n—\n \nInterest rate contracts \n4\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n59\n \n(\n56\n)\n3\n \nForeign currency contracts \n3\n33\n \n(\n15\n)\n18\n \n21\n \n(\n5\n)\n16\n \nForeign currency contracts \n4\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n5\n \n—\n \n5\n \nCommodity contracts \n3\n25\n \n(\n14\n)\n11\n \n27\n \n(\n21\n)\n6\n \nCommodity contracts \n4\n46\n \n(\n36\n)\n10\n \n2\n \n(\n1\n)\n1\n \nTotal\n$\n124\n \n$\n(\n85\n)\n$\n39\n \n$\n187\n \n$\n(\n156\n)\n$\n31\n \nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts \n3\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n1\n \nForeign currency contracts \n3\n74\n \n(\n16\n)\n58\n \n33\n \n(\n16\n)\n17\n \nCommodity contracts \n3\n16\n \n(\n1\n)\n15\n \n33\n \n(\n28\n)\n5\n \nCommodity contracts \n4\n4\n \n(\n3\n)\n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n94\n \n$\n(\n20\n)\n$\n74\n \n$\n70\n \n$\n(\n47\n)\n$\n23\n \nTotal asset derivatives \n$\n218\n \n$\n(\n105\n)\n$\n113\n \n$\n257\n \n$\n(\n203\n)\n$\n54\n \nLiability derivatives\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts \n5\n$\n46\n \n$\n(\n20\n)\n$\n26\n \n$\n95\n \n$\n(\n73\n)\n$\n22\n \nInterest rate contracts \n6\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n56\n \n(\n56\n)\n—\n \nForeign currency contracts \n5\n75\n \n(\n15\n)\n60\n \n8\n \n(\n5\n)\n3\n \nForeign currency contracts \n6\n40\n \n—\n \n40\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCommodity contracts \n5\n16\n \n(\n14\n)\n2\n \n34\n \n(\n22\n)\n12\n \nCommodity contracts \n6\n37\n \n(\n36\n)\n1\n \n2\n \n(\n1\n)\n1\n \nTotal\n$\n214\n \n$\n(\n85\n)\n$\n129\n \n$\n195\n \n$\n(\n157\n)\n$\n38\n \nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments\nInterest rate contracts \n5\n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n—\n \nForeign currency contracts \n5\n27\n \n(\n16\n)\n11\n \n38\n \n(\n16\n)\n22\n \nCommodity contracts \n5\n8\n \n(\n1\n)\n7\n \n34\n \n(\n28\n)\n6\n \nCommodity contracts \n6\n4\n \n(\n3\n)\n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n40\n \n$\n(\n20\n)\n$\n20\n \n$\n75\n \n$\n(\n47\n)\n$\n28\n \nTotal liability derivatives \n$\n254\n \n$\n(\n105\n)\n$\n149\n \n$\n270\n \n$\n(\n204\n)\n$\n66\n \n1.\nCounterparty and cash collateral amounts represent the estimated net settlement amount when applying netting and set-off rights included in master netting arrangements between the Company and its counterparties and the payable or receivable for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty.\n2.\nRepresents the net amounts included in the consolidated balance sheets.\n3.\nIncluded in \"Other current assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n4.\nIncluded in \"Deferred charges and other assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n5.\nIncluded in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n6.\nIncluded in \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n \n129\nTable of Contents\nAssets and liabilities related to forward contracts, interest rate swaps, currency swaps, options and other conditional or exchange contracts executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement are netted.

Market inputs are obtained from well-established and recognized vendors of market data and subjected to tolerance and quality checks.\nFor derivative assets and liabilities, standard industry models are used to calculate the fair value of the various financial instruments based on significant observable market inputs, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, swap rates, interest rates and implied volatilities obtained from various market sources. Market inputs are obtained from well-established and recognized vendors of market data and subjected to tolerance/quality checks.\nFor all other assets and liabilities for which observable inputs are used, fair value is derived through the use of fair value models, such as a discounted cash flow model or other standard pricing models.

The Level 3 asset value represents the fair value of an investment in a corporate bond, accounted for as a debt security. At December 31, 2023, the level 3 asset values also included an investment in a limited liability company, accounted for as an investment in nonconsolidated affiliates, and with no unfunded commitment. \nThe following table summarizes the changes in fair value measurements of the investment in a corporate bond using Level 3 inputs for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nFair Value Measurements Using Level 3 Inputs for Investment in Corporate Bond at Dec 31, \n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nBalance at Jan 1\n$\n111\n \n$\n—\n \nRecognition of asset \n1\n—\n \n200\n \nGain (Loss) included in AOCL \n2\n40\n \n(\n89\n)\nBalance at Dec 31\n$\n151\n \n$\n111\n \n1.\nIncluded in \"Other investments\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2.\nIncluded in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n \nFor liabilities classified as Level 3 measurements, the fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs including assumptions where there is little, if any, market activity. The fair value of the Company’s accrued liability related to the guarantee of Sadara's debt is in proportion to the Company's \n35\n percent ownership interest in Sadara. The estimated fair value of the guarantee was calculated using a \"with\" and \"without\" method. The fair value of the debt was calculated \"with\" the guarantee less the fair value of the debt \"without\" the guarantee. The \"with\" and \"without\" values were calculated using a discounted cash flow method based on contractual cash flows as well as projected prepayments made on the debt by Sadara. See Note 15 for further information on guarantees classified as Level 3 measurements. \n132\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the changes in fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nFair Value Measurements Using Level 3 Inputs for Accrued Liability of Sadara Guarantee at Dec 31, \n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nBalance at Jan 1\n$\n(\n178\n)\n$\n(\n199\n)\nGain included in earnings \n1\n23\n \n21\n \nBalance at Dec 31\n$\n(\n155\n)\n$\n(\n178\n)\n1.\nIncluded in \"Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates\" in the consolidated income statements.\nFor equity securities calculated at net asset value per share (or its equivalent), the Company had $\n90\n million in private equity and $\n15\n million in real estate at December 31, 2024 ($\n86\n million in private equity and $\n18\n million in real estate at December 31, 2023).

The Company's variable interests in these joint ventures relate to arrangements between the joint ventures and the Company, involving the majority of the output on take-or-pay terms with pricing ensuring a guaranteed return to the joint ventures.\nEthylene Storage Joint Venture\nThe Company has variable interests in a joint venture that provides ethylene storage in Alberta, Canada. The Company's variable interests relate to arrangements involving a majority of the joint venture's storage capacity on take-or-pay terms with pricing ensuring a guaranteed return to the joint venture; and favorably priced leases provided to the joint venture. The Company provides the joint venture with operation and maintenance services and utilities.\nAccounts Receivable Monetization\nThe Company holds a variable interest in an entity created to monetize accounts receivable of select European entities. The Company is the primary beneficiary of this entity as a result of holding subordinated notes while maintaining servicing responsibilities for the accounts receivable.\nAssets and Liabilities of Consolidated VIEs\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The other equity holders’ interests are reflected in \"Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\" in the consolidated statements of income and \"Noncontrolling interests\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying amounts of these entities’ assets and liabilities included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nAssets and Liabilities of Consolidated VIEs at Dec 31 \nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n22\n \n$\n26\n \nOther current assets\n250\n \n130\n \nNet property\n122\n \n139\n \nOther noncurrent assets\n15\n \n15\n \nTotal assets \n1\n$\n409\n \n$\n310\n \nCurrent liabilities\n$\n24\n \n$\n26\n \nOther noncurrent obligations\n13\n \n12\n \nTotal liabilities \n2\n$\n37\n \n$\n38\n \n1.\nRestricted assets totaled $\n192\n million and $\n216\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n2.\nAll liabilities were nonrecourse at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAmounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets and the table above as restricted assets or nonrecourse obligations relating to consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2024 and 2023, are adjusted for intercompany eliminations.\nUpon closing of the transaction discussed in Note 18, Dow InfraCo, LLC is expected to be disclosed as a consolidated VIE of the Company.\n134\nTable of Contents\nNonconsolidated VIEs\nThe Company holds a variable interest in the following entities for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary:\nSilicon Joint Ventures\nThe Company holds minority voting interests in certain joint ventures that produce silicon inputs for the Company. These joint ventures operate under supply agreements that sell inventory to the equity owners using pricing mechanisms that guarantee a return, therefore shielding the joint ventures from the obligation to absorb expected losses. As a result of the pricing mechanisms of these agreements, these entities are determined to be VIEs. The Company is not the primary beneficiary, as it does not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities; therefore, the entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these variable interest entities is determined to be the carrying value of the investment in these entities. At December 31, 2024, the Company's investment in these joint ventures was $\n143\n million ($\n134\n million at December 31, 2023), classified as \"Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates\" in the consolidated balance sheets, representing the Company's maximum exposure to loss.\nNOTE 24 – \nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nTDCC has committed to fund Dow Inc.'s dividends paid to common stockholders and share repurchases, as approved by the Board from time to time, as well as certain governance expenses.

The CODM compares quarterly results to both the year-ago and sequential periods to assess performance and allocate resources to each segment. The Company defines Operating EBIT as earnings (i.e., \"Income before income taxes\") before interest, excluding the impact of significant items. Operating EBIT by segment includes all operating items relating to the businesses; items that principally apply to Dow as a whole are assigned to Corporate.\nSegment Operating EBIT \n1\nPack. & Spec.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Dow Inc. and The Dow Chemical Company (the \"Companies\") carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Companies' Disclosure Committee and the Companies' management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Companies' disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companies' disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Companies' internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 that was conducted during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companies' internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companies' internal control framework and processes are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Companies' consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe Companies' internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Companies;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Companies are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the Companies; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companies' assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Companies' internal control over financial reporting and concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, such internal control is effective. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013).\nThe Companies' independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, with direct access to the Board of Directors through the Audit Committee of Dow Inc., have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Companies. Their reports on the consolidated financial statements are included in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Deloitte & Touche LLP’s reports on the Companies' internal control over financial reporting are referenced therein and included herein.\n139\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Dow Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Dow Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in\n Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 4, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and financial statement schedule.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying \nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/\nS\n/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nMidland, Michigan\nFebruary 4, 2025\n140\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nTo the Stockholder and the Board of Directors of The Dow Chemical Company\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of The Dow Chemical Company and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).
