  "item1_summary": " Our software customers generally consist of large enterprises that have computing environments from multip computing environments . We recognize revenue upon the delivery of our products to distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly . Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer’s organization .\n Our private cloud infrastructure suite of solutions are available directly from Broadcom, resellers and distributors, hyperscale cloud providers, value-added OEMs and VMware cloud service provider partners . We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth .\n Total cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges . Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or support of subscription and services revenue . General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel .\n In-process research and development (“IPR&D”), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, is reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives . Restructuring and other charges consist of non-recurring charges related to compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, IP litigation, and other exit costs .\n These Singapore tax incentives are scheduled  to expire in November 2030 . The corporate income tax rate in Singapore that would otherwise apply to us would be 17%. We also have a tax holiday from our qualifying income earned in Malaysia, which is scheduled to expire in 2028 . We may elect to modify our operational structure and tax strategy, which may not be as beneficial to us as the benefits provided under the tax concession arrangements .\n We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances . Our actual financial results may differ materially and adversely from our estimates . Our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements . Those policies include revenue recognition, business combinations, valuation of goodwill and long-lived assets, and income taxes .\n An allowance for distributor credits covering price adjustments is made based on our estimate of historical experience rates . We record reductions of revenue for rebates in the same period that the related revenue is recorded . We reverse the accrual of unclaimed rebate amounts as specific rebate programs contractually end and when we believe unclaimed rebates are no longer subject to payment and will not be paid .\n The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment . Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results . We perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist . We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount .\n After assessing the totality of events and circumstances, if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed . The goodwill impairment test uses both the income approach and the market approach to estimate a reporting unit's fair value .\n We assess the impairment of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable . Factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include: (i) significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results, (ii) significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business, or (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends .\n In evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions, we accrue an income tax liability when such positions do not meet the more likely-than-not threshold for recognition . The calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations . An adjustment to the valuation allowance will either increase or decrease our provision for or benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is made .\n The financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are presented in accordance with GAAP and expressed in U.S. dollars . The reversal of the accrued liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities no longer exist .\n Direct sales to one customer, which is a distributor, accounted for 28% and 21% of our net revenue for fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively . We expect to continue to experience significant customer concentration in future periods . The macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and may cause net revenue to fluctuate significantly and impact our results of operations .\n A substantially smaller percentage of our net revenue is ultimately dependent on sales of either our product or our customers’ product incorporating our product, to end customers located in China (including Hong Kong) The following tables set forth net revenue by segment for the periods presented: (In millions, except percentages) (As a percentage of net revenue)\n Research and Development Expense increased $4,057 million, or 77%, in fiscal year 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year . The increase was primarily due to higher compensation, including higher stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in headcount from the VMware Merger . Restructuring and other charges recognized in operating expenses were $1,533 million and $244 million in fiscal years 2024 and 2023 .\n The increase was primarily due to equity awards assumed and granted in connection with the VMware Merger and annual employee equity awards granted at higher grant-date fair values . The remaining weighted-average service period was 3.0 years . The following table sets forth the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based awards outstanding and expected to vest as of November 3, 2024 .\n Unallocated expenses increased 192% in fiscal year 2024, compared to the prior fiscal year, primarily due to higher amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and restructuring and other charges . Other income (expense), net, net includes interest income, gains and losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement and other miscellaneous items .\n Our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase . Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements primarily arise from: (i) business acquisitions and investments we may make from time to time, (ii) working capital requirements, (iii) research and development and capital expenditure needs, (iv) cash dividend payments (if and when declared by our Board of Directors)\n We expect capital expenditures to be higher in the fiscal year ending November 2, 2025 as compared to fiscal year 2024 . We funded the cash portion of the consideration with net proceeds from the issuance of $30,390 million in term loans (the 2023 Term Loans) We also assumed $8,250 million of VMware’s outstanding senior unsecured notes .\n Our ability to service our senior unsecured notes, the 2023 Term Loans and any other indebtedness we may incur will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future . We may also elect to sell additional debt or equity securities for reasons other than those specified above . The amounts involved may be material. ll be available on terms acceptable to us or at all .\n Current portion of long-term debt decreased primarily due to $2,813 million of repayments, offset in part by $1,245 million becoming due within the next twelve months . During fiscal years 2024 and 2023, we repurchased and retired approximately 67 million and 91 million shares of our common stock for $7,176 million and $5,824 million, respectively .\n The $1,877 million increase in cash provided by operations during fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to contributions from VMware . The $8,187 million decrease in net income was largely driven by $13,058 million higher non-cash adjustments including amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and deferred taxes related to the VMware Merger .\n The $13,890 million increase in cash flows from financing activities for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to $39,954 million of net proceeds from the 2023 Term Loans and the issuance of senior notes . A hypothetical 10% change in currency exchange rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements .\n As of November 3, 2024, Broadcom Inc. had $13.6 billion of outstanding 2023 Term Loans, which are subject to floating interest rates . A hypothetical 100 basis point change in the interest rate would increase or decrease the interest expense on the 2023 term Loans for the next 12 months by approximately $137 million .\n In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements presented fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023 . We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting . The firm is a public accounting firm registered with the Pub Pub Pub .\n We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement . We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions, and that effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained .\n Internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding reliability of financial reporting . It is intended to ensure that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles . It also ensures that receipts and expenditures of the company are made only with authorizations of management and directors .\n The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion . The present value of projected cash flows included significant judgment and assumptions regardin our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments .\n The auditor determined that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the VCF developed technology, certain customer contracts and related relationships, VCF in-process research and development, and the VMware trade name intangible assets acquired in the VMware acquisition is a critical audit matter . The principal considerations for our determination are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimates; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures .\n Addressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our opinion on the consolidated financial statements . These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the acquired developed technology, customer contracts and related relationships, in-process research and development, and the trade names .\n PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has served as the Company’s auditor since 2006 .

Level 1 assets include cash equivalents, banker's acceptances, trading securities investments and investment funds . Level 3 assets and liabilities include investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment .\n We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair . We use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired . The assumptions and estimates are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies .\n Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results . Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed annually (or more frequently if impairment indicators arise) for impairment .\n If fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no further assessment is performed . Determining fair value involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions . Long-lived assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization . Purchased IPR&D projects are capitalized at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset .\n An impairment loss must be measured if the sum of the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and before interest) from the use and eventual disposition of the asset (or asset group) is less than the net book value . We monitor factors and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long-lived assets, including purchased intangible assets, ROU assets, and property, plant and equipment, may not be recoverable .\n We recognize revenue from sales to direct customers and distributors when control transfers to a customer . We have elected to exclude from the transaction price any taxes collected from a customer and to account for shipping and handling activities performed after a customer obtains control of the product . From time to time, certain customers agree to pay us secure supply fees in exchange for prioritized supplies .\n Software revenue consists of sales and royalties from software arrangements, support services, professional services, transfer of IP, and non-recurring engineering (NRE) arrangements . Software licenses have standalone functionality from which customers derive benefit, and the customer obtains control of the software when it is delivered or made available for download . Support services consist of telephone support and the provision of unspecified updates and upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis .\n The obligation to provide professional services is generally satisfied over time, with the customer simultaneously receiving and consuming the benefits as we satisfy our performance obligations . IP revenue recognition is dependent on the nature and terms of each agreement . The majority of our NRE contract revenues meet the over time criteria . Revenue allocated to material rights is recognized whr. enue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement .\n The standalone selling price reflects the price we would charge for a specific product or service if it were sold separately in similar circumstances and to similar customers . We use directly observable transactions to determine the standalone selling prices for performance obligations . We allocate total contract consideration to each distinct performance obligation in a bundled arrangement on a relative standalone sale price basis .\n Certain contracts contain a right of return that allows the customer to cancel all or a portion of the product or service and receive a credit . We do not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue at the time .\n For contracts that were modified before the beginning of the earliest reporting period presented, we have not retrospectively restated the contract for those modifications . We have disclosed the aggregate effect of all modifications when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations . We recognize compensation expense for time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) using the straight-line amortization method .\n We will recognize additional expense if actual forfeitures are lower than we estimated .

The components of income before income taxes by U.S. and foreign jurisdictions were as follows .\n The increase in provision for income taxes in fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to the impact of a non-recurring intra-group transfer of certain IP rights to the United States as a result of supply chain realignment and the resulting shift in jurisdictional mix of income, partially offset by an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based awards .\n The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to substantially all U.S. state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credits that may not be realized . As a result of the acquisition of VMware, we established $3,642 million of net deferred tax liabilities on the excess of book basis over the tax basis of acquired assets .\n As of November 3, 2024, we had tax effected U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $.u.m. and foreign net . operating loss of $.2,176m of state research and development tax credits which begin to expire in fiscal year 2025 .

Our portfolio of infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments . We also offer mission-critical FC SAN products and related software .\n The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies .
