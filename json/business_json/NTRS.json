    "item1": "Item 1, “Business,” and Note 32, “Regulatory Capital Requirements,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The use of estimates and assumptions is required in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and actual results could differ from those estimates. The SEC has issued guidance relating to the disclosure of critical accounting estimates. Critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on Northern Trust’s future financial condition and results of operations. Due to the inherent imprecision in accounting estimates, other estimates or assumptions could reasonably have been used in 2024 and changes in estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period.\nFor Northern Trust, accounting estimates that are viewed as critical are those relating to the allowance for credit losses and pension plan accounting. Management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting estimate with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee).\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Allowance for Credit Losses—which represents management’s estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk, off-balance sheet credit exposure, and specific borrower relationships—is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. The allowance for a financial asset that does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets is determined through an individual evaluation.\nManagement’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of Allowance for Credit Losses are not dependent on any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables and takes into consideration past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. \nThe Allowance for Credit Losses consists of the following components:\nAllowance Evaluated on a Collective Basis.\n Northern Trust utilizes a quantitative probability of default/loss given default approach for the calculation of its credit allowance on a collective basis. For each segment, the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the exposure at default for each projected quarter to determine the quantitative component of the allowance. The quantitative allowance is then reviewed within a comprehensive qualitative adjustment framework, through which management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology, and other factors that are not fully contemplated in the forecast to compute an adjustment to the quantitative allowance for each segment and class of the loan portfolio.\nThe allowance estimation methodology for the collective assessment is based on data representative of the Corporation’s financial asset portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan portfolio into segments and classes based on similar risk characteristics or risk monitoring methods. \nFor each class, the probability of default and loss given default are derived for each quarter of the remaining life of each instrument. For the first two years (the reasonable and supportable period), these factors are derived by applying quarterly macroeconomic projections using models developed from historical data on macroeconomic factors and loans with similar characteristics. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable period, Northern Trust reverts to its long-run historical loss experience on a straight-line basis over four quarters. The projected exposure at default for every quarter is based on contractual balance projections as of each quarter-end, with adjustments made for potential draws on off-balance sheet commitments.\nEstimating expected lifetime losses requires the use of projected macroeconomic factors. The Corporation uses multiple forecasts approved by Northern Trust’s Macroeconomic Scenario Development Committee (MSDC). The baseline forecast aligns with the Corporation’s latest thinking on macroeconomic projections for the next eight quarters. An alternative scenario is also considered, which reflects a recession that incorporates the experiences of a wider set of historical economic cycles. The forecasts are probability-weighted at each evaluation period and are management’s best estimate of future economic projections at that time.\nThe allowance estimate is sensitive to changes in portfolio composition, portfolio quality, and macroeconomic forecasts. Increases in the amount of borrowing and material downgrades to the quality of the lending portfolio will \n68\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nincrease the reserve, all else equal. Similarly, deteriorating projections for macroeconomic conditions will increase the reserve. Macroeconomic factors that are particularly correlated to Northern Trust’s loan portfolio are GDP growth, unemployment, non-farm employment, corporate profits, consumer spending, personal income, commercial real estate prices, credit spreads, and market volatility. To demonstrate the sensitivity to changes in macroeconomic conditions, Northern Trust applied a 100% probability weighting to downturn conditions, resulting in an increase to the collective component of the allowance for the loan portfolio of approximately $126.5 million. The investment security and other financial assets portfolios are less sensitive to macroeconomic factors in terms of overall reserve impact due to factors such as high credit quality, short duration, and low historical losses. \nThe commercial and institutional (C&I) portfolio utilizes Northern Trust’s internal borrower rating assessments to determine initial credit quality. A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the impact of upgrades or downgrades by shifting the rating up or down by one rating class, assuming no changes to other factors, such as macroeconomic projections or qualitative adjustments. The analysis excludes defaulted loans and does not assume a default event; hence, borrowers in the lowest non-default rating class were not downgraded. Similarly, those in the highest rating class could not be upgraded. Assuming the final forecast probability weighting, the collective component of the allowance assigned to the C&I portfolio would increase by approximately $77.6 million if all C&I borrowers were downgraded by one performing rating class. The C&I collective allowance would decrease by approximately $38.9 million if borrower ratings were upgraded by one rating class. \nThe results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Credit Loss Reserve Committee, which receives input from Financial Risk Management, Treasury, Corporate Finance, the Economic Research Department, and each of Northern Trust’s reporting business units. The Credit Loss Reserve Committee determines the probability weights applied to each forecast approved by MSDC, and also reviews and approves qualitative adjustments to the collective allowance in line with Northern Trust’s qualitative adjustment framework.\nAllowance Evaluated on an Individual Basis.\n The allowance evaluated on an individual basis is determined through individual evaluations of loans and lending-related commitments that have defaulted, generally those with Borrower Ratings of 8 and 9. These evaluations are based on expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, and other factors that may impact the borrowers’ ability to pay. For defaulted loans for which the amount of allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying real estate collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. These appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.\nPension Plan Accounting\nNorthern Trust maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees (U.S. Qualified Plan) and a U.S. noncontributory supplemental pension plan (U.S. Non-Qualified Plan). Certain European-based employees also retain benefits in local defined benefit pension plans, of which the majority are closed to new employees and to future benefit accruals. Measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of several assumptions regarding future interest rates, asset returns, compensation increases, mortality rates, and other actuarial-based projections relating to the plans. Due to the long-term nature of this obligation and the estimates that are required to be made, the assumptions used in determining the periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation are closely monitored and reviewed annually for adjustments that may be required. Pension accounting guidance requires that differences between estimates and actual experience be recognized as other comprehensive income in the period in which they occur. The differences are amortized into net periodic pension expense from accumulated other comprehensive income over the average remaining service pe\nriod of active participants or over the expected remaining lifetime of plan participants for plans that have been previously frozen. A\ns a result, differences between the estimates made in the calculation of periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation and actual experience affect stockholders’ equity in the period in which they occur but continue to be recognized as expense systematically and gradually over subsequent periods.\nNorthern Trust recognizes the significant impact that these pension-related assumptions have on the determination of the pension obligations and related expense and has established procedures for monitoring and setting these assumptions each year. These procedures include an annual review of actual demographic and investment experience with the pension plans’ actuaries. In addition to actual experience, adjustments to these assumptions consider observable yields on fixed income securities, known compensation trends and policies, as well as economic conditions and investment strategies that may impact the estimated long-term rate of return on plan assets.\nIn determining the pension expense for the U.S. Qualified Plan and for the U.S. Non-Qualified Plan in 2024, Northern Trust utilized a discount rate of 5.03% and 4.95% as of December 31, 2023, respectively. For both plans, the rate of increase in the compensation level is based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averaged 5.56%. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. Qualified Plan assets was 7.25% as of December 31, 2023.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n69\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn evaluating pension-related assumptions for the U.S. pension plans as of Northern Trust’s December 31, 2024 measurement date, the following were considered:\n•\nDiscount Rate:\n Northern Trust estimates the discount rate for its U.S. pension plans by applying the plan specific projected cash flows for future benefit payments for each plan to the Aon AA Above Median yield curve as of the measurement date. This yield curve is composed of individual zero-coupon interest rates for 198 different time periods over a 99-year time horizon. Zero-coupon rates utilized by the yield curve are mathematically derived from observable market yields for AA-rated corporate bonds. This yield curve model referenced by Northern Trust in establishing the discount rate resulted in a rate of 5.70% and 5.55% at December 31, 2024 for the U.S. Qualified and U.S. Non-Qualified Plans, respectively.\n•\nCompensation Level:\n Based on a review of actual and anticipated salary experience, the compensation scale assumption is, consistent with prior year, based on a graded schedule from 9.00% to 2.50% that averages 5.56%.\n•\nRate of Return on Plan Assets:\n The expected return on plan assets is based on an estimate of the long-term (30 years) rate of return on plan assets, which is determined using a building block approach that considers the current asset mix and estimates of return by asset class based on historical experience, giving proper consideration to diversification and rebalancing. Current market factors such as inflation and interest rates are also evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. Peer data and historical returns are reviewed to check for reasonability and appropriateness. As a result of these analyses, Northern Trust’s rate of return assumption for the U.S. Qualified Plan continues to be 7.25% for 2025.\n•\nMortality Table:\n Northern Trust had adopted the aggregate Pri-2012 mortality table with a 2012 base year in 2019. Northern Trust’s pension obligations reflect proposed future improvement under scale MP-2021, which was released by the Society of Actuaries in October 2021. As in prior year, no change to these assumptions was made in 2024 since the Society of Actuaries did not release any updates to its mortality tables and improvement scales in 2024 due to the still uncertain long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mortality assumptions on lump sum payments remain static and continue to be in line with the IRS prescribed table for minimum lump sums in 2025.\nNet pension expense in 2025 is expected to increase slightly by approximately\n $1.0 million, p\nrimarily driven by higher amortization of previously incurred asset losses, partially offset by the positive expense impacts from higher discount rates and the $125 million contribution made to the U.S. Qualified Plan at the beginning of 2025.\nIn order to illustrate the sensitivity of these assumptions on the expected U.S pension plans’ 2025 periodic pension expense and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024, the following table is presented to show the effect of increasing or decreasing each of the assumptions by 25 basis points.\nTABLE 38: SENSITIVITY OF U.S. PENSION PLANS ASSUMPTIONS \n(In Millions)\n25 BASIS\nPOINT INCREASE\n25 BASIS\nPOINT DECREASE\nIncrease (Decrease) in 2025 Pension Expense\nDiscount Rate Change\n$\n(2.7)\n$\n2.8 \nCompensation Level Change\n2.4 \n(2.3)\nRate of Return on Plan Assets Change\n(3.9)\n3.9 \nIncrease (Decrease) in December 31, 2024 Projected Benefit Obligation\nDiscount Rate Change\n(30.0)\n31.4 \nCompensation Level Change\n9.1 \n(8.8)\nPension Contributions.\n The deduction limits specified by the Internal Revenue Code for contributions made by sponsors of defined benefit pension plans are based on a “Target Liability” under the provisions of the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Northern Trust contributed to the U.S. Qualified Plan $125.0 million for the 2025 plan year and $200.0 million for the 2024 plan year at the beginning of 2025 and 2024, respectively. The remaining maximum deductible contribution for 2025 is estimated at $255.0 million. The minimum required contribution to the U.S. Qualified Plan is expected to be zero for 2025. \n70\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS AND DEVELOPMENTS\nIn December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures” (ASU 2023-09). ASU 2023-09 enhances disclosures by further disaggregating existing annual income tax disclosures related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the impact of ASU 2023-09 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and therefore is not expected to have an impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, “Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses” (ASU 2024-03). ASU 2024-03 requires disaggregated disclosures in tabular format for specific income statement expense categories as well as a narrative disclosure about selling expenses. The amendments in ASU 2024-03 do not change or remove existing income statement presentation or disclosure requirements. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, the impact of ASU 2024-03 will be limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and therefore is not expected to have an impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income. \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-04, “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20): Induced Conversions of Convertible Debt Instruments” (ASU 2024-04). The amendments in ASU 2024-04 provide additional guidance for determining whether certain settlements of convertible debt instruments with conversion terms that differ from the instruments’ preexisting terms should be accounted for as an induced conversion or extinguishment of convertible debt. ASU 2024-04 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2025, although early adoption is permitted. Upon adoption, ASU 2024-04 is not expected to have a significant impact on Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income. \nRISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk Management Overview\nNorthern Trust employs an integrated risk management framework to enable a risk-informed profile and support its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. The framework provides a methodology to identify, manage, report and govern both internal and external risks to Northern Trust, and promotes a culture of risk awareness and good conduct across the organization. Northern Trust’s risk culture encompasses the general awareness, attitude and conduct of employees with respect to risk and the management of risk across all lines of defense within the organization. Northern Trust cultivates a culture of effective risk management by defining and embedding risk management accountabilities in all employee performance expectations and provides training, development and performance rewards to reinforce this culture.\nNorthern Trust’s risk management framework contains three inter-related elements, designed to support consistent enterprise risk identification, management and reporting: a comprehensive risk inventory, a static taxonomy of risk categories and a dynamic taxonomy of risk themes. The risk inventory is a detailed register of the risks inherently faced by Northern Trust. The risk categories and risk themes are classification systems used for classifying and managing the risk inventory and enabling different risk profile views. All identified risks inherent in Northern Trust’s business activities are cataloged into the following risk categories: credit, operational, fiduciary, compliance, liquidity, market, and strategic risk. All material risks are also dynamically cataloged into various risk themes which are defined groupings that share common characteristics, focus on business outcomes and span across risk categories.\nNorthern Trust implements its risk management framework through a “three lines of defense” operating model, embedding a robust risk management capability within its businesses. The model, used to communicate risk management expectations across the organization, contains three roles, each with a complementary level of risk management accountability. Within this operating model, Northern Trust’s businesses are the first line of defense for protecting it against the risks inherent in its businesses and are supported by dedicated business risk management teams. The Risk Management function, the second line of defense, sets the direction for Northern Trust’s risk management activities and provides aggregate risk oversight and reporting in support of risk governance. Audit Services, the third line of defense, provides independent assurance as to the effectiveness of the integrated risk framework.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n71\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRisk Governance and Oversight Overview\nRisk governance is an integral aspect of corporate governance at Northern Trust, and includes clearly defined accountabilities, expectations, internal controls and processes for risk-based decision-making and escalation of issues. The following diagram provides a high-level overview of Northern Trust’s risk governance structure, highlighting oversight by the Board of Directors and key risk-related committees.\nTABLE 39: RISK GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE \nNorthern Trust Corporation Board of Directors\nAudit Committee\nBusiness Risk Committee\nCapital Governance Committee\nHuman Capital and Compensation Committee\n–\nCybersecurity Risk Oversight Subcommittee\nGlobal Enterprise Risk Committee (GERC)\nCredit Risk Committee\nMarket & Liquidity Risk Committee\nOperational Risk Committee\nFiduciary Risk Committee\nCompliance & Ethics Oversight Committee\nInformation Technology Risk Committee\nModel Risk Oversight Committee\nThe Board of Directors provides oversight of risk management directly and through certain of its committees: the Audit Committee, the Business Risk Committee, the Capital Governance Committee and the Human Capital and Compensation Committee. \nThe Board of Directors annually approves Northern Trust’s Risk Management Framework and Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. \nThe Audit Committee\n provides oversight with respect to financial reporting and legal risk. \nThe Business Risk Committee\n assumes primary responsibility and oversight with respect to credit risk, operational risk, fiduciary risk, compliance risk, market risk, liquidity risk, strategic risk, and associated risk themes. The Cybersecurity Risk Oversight Subcommittee is a subcommittee of the Business Risk Committee and assists the Business Risk Committee in discharging its duties with respect to risks related to cybersecurity inherent in Northern Trust’s businesses. \nThe Human Capital and Compensation Committee\n oversees the development and operation of Northern Trust’s incentive compensation program. The Committee annually reviews management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the design and performance of Northern Trust’s incentive compensation arrangements and practices in providing incentives that are consistent with Northern Trust’s safety, soundness, and culture. This assessment includes an evaluation of whether Northern Trust’s incentive compensation arrangements and practices discourage inappropriate risk-taking behavior by participants. \nThe Capital Governance Committee\n assists the Board of Directors in discharging its oversight duties with respect to capital management and resolution planning activities. Among other responsibilities, the Capital Governance Committee oversees Northern Trust’s capital management assessments, forecasting, and stress testing processes and activities, including the annual CCAR exercise, and challenges management, as appropriate, on various elements of such processes and activities. Accordingly, the Capital Governance Committee provides oversight with respect to Northern Trust’s linkage of material risks to the capital adequacy assessment process.\n72\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Chief Risk Officer (CRO) oversees Northern Trust’s management of risk and compliance, promotes risk awareness and fosters a proactive risk management environment wherein risks inherent in the business strategy are identified, understood, appropriately monitored and mitigated. The CRO reports directly to the Business Risk Committee and the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer. The CRO regularly advises the Business Risk Committee and reports to the Committee at least quarterly on risk exposures, risk management deficiencies and emerging risks. In accordance with the risk management framework, the Chief Risk Officer, Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer, Head of Financial Risk, Head of Non-Financial Risk, Head of Strategic Risk, Chief Fiduciary Risk Officer, International Chief Risk Officer, Head of Enterprise Risk Management, Chief Executive Officer, President—Asset Management, President—Asset Servicing, President—Wealth Management, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer and Chief Operating Officer, meet as the Global Enterprise Risk Committee (GERC) to provide executive management oversight and guidance with respect to the management of the categories of risk and risk themes within Northern Trust. The Chief Audit Executive, or such officer’s designee, and the General Counsel, or such officer’s designee, are invited to attend each GERC meeting as a non-voting member. All other members of the executive management team of the Corporation are also standing invitees. Among other risk management responsibilities, GERC receives reports, escalations, or recommendations from senior risk committees that are responsible for the management of risk, and from time to time may delegate responsibility to such committees for risk issues. Senior risk committees include:\nThe Credit Risk Committee (CRC)\n is the most senior credit committee at Northern Trust, with responsibility for establishing, approving, and monitoring credit-related policies and programs throughout the Bank. The Chief Credit Officer reports directly to the CRO, chairs the CRC, and heads the Credit Risk Management function at Northern Trust. \nThe Market & Liquidity Risk Committee (MLRC) \noversees activities relating to the management of market and liquidity risks by facilitating a focused review of market and liquidity risk exposures and providing rigorous challenge of related policies, key assumptions, and practices.\nThe Operational Risk Committee (ORC)\n provides independent oversight and is responsible for setting the operational risk-related policies and developing and implementing the operational risk management framework and programs that support coordination of operational risk activities. \nThe Fiduciary Risk Committee (FRC)\n is responsible for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and establishing the fiduciary risk framework, governance and programs that support the coordination of fiduciary risk activities. \nThe Compliance & Ethics Oversight Committee (CEOC)\n provides oversight and direction with respect to compliance policies, implementation of the compliance and ethics program, and the coordination of regulatory compliance initiatives across the Corporation. \nThe Information Technology Risk Committee (ITRC) \nprovides oversight and direction with respect to information security, technology and cyber risk. The committee is responsible for recommending the policies related to, and overseeing development and implementation of the risk management framework, standards and processes supporting coordination and governance of, information security, technology and cyber risk management activities.\nThe Model Risk Oversight Committee (MROC) \nis responsible for providing management attention, direction, and oversight of the model risk management framework and model risk within Northern Trust.\nIn addition to the aforementioned committees, Northern Trust establishes business and regional risk committees, as well as a Swap Dealer Risk Committee, that also report into GERC.\nRisk Assessment, Appetite and Reporting Processes\nAs part of the integrated risk framework, Northern Trust has established key risk identification and risk management processes, embedded within its businesses to enable a risk-informed profile that supports its business decisions and the execution of its corporate strategies. Northern Trust’s risk assessment process consists of a series of programs across the first and second lines of defense that identify, measure, manage and report risks in line with risk appetite and guidelines.\nNorthern Trust defines its risk appetite as the aggregate level and types of risk the Board of Directors and senior management are willing to assume to achieve the Corporation’s strategic objectives and business plan, consistent with prudent management of risk and applicable capital, liquidity, and other regulatory requirements. It includes consideration of the likelihood and impact of risks, using both monetary loss and non-financial measures across risk themes to monitor against tolerance thresholds and guideline levels that trigger escalation to risk committees, senior management, and the Board of Directors or committees thereof, as appropriate.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n73\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRisk Control\nRisk Control is an internal, independent review function within the Risk Management function. Risk Control is managed by the Head of Risk Control and is comprised of Model Risk Management, Credit Review, and Global Compliance Testing groups, each with its own risk focus and oversight. Model Risk Management is responsible for the implementation and management of the enterprise-wide model risk framework and independently validating new models and reviewing and re-validating existing models. Credit Review provides an independent, ongoing assessment of credit exposure and related credit risk management processes across Northern Trust. Lastly, Global Compliance Testing evaluates the effectiveness of procedures and controls designed to comply with relevant laws and regulations, as well as corresponding Northern Trust policies governing regulatory compliance activities. The Business Risk Committee has oversight responsibility with respect to Risk Control generally as well as each of these groups.\nAudit Services\nAudit Services is an independent control function that assesses and validates controls within Northern Trust’s risk management framework. Audit Services is managed by the Chief Audit Executive with oversight from the Audit Committee. Audit Services tests the overall adequacy and effectiveness of the system of internal controls associated with the framework on an ongoing basis and reports the results of these audits directly to the Audit Committee. Audit Services includes professionals with a broad range of audit and industry experience, including risk management expertise. The Chief Audit Executive reports directly to the Audit Committee and administratively reports to the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and is a non-voting member of GERC.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the risk to interest income or principal from the failure of a borrower, issuer, or counterparty to perform on an obligation.\nCredit Risk Overview\nCredit risk is inherent in many of Northern Trust’s activities. The bulk of credit risk relates to loans, securities, and wholesale counterparty-related exposures, such as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives and securities financing activities. Northern Trust’s loan portfolio differs significantly from those of other large U.S. financial institutions in that Northern Trust is generally:\n•\nnot an originator of loan products intended to be sold into a secondary market or to be bundled into asset securitizations;\n•\nnot an agent bank or syndicator of loans, where risk management is achieved post-close through the sale of participations; and\n•\nnot a participant in leveraged financial transactions, such as project finance, hedge fund leveraging, loans to private equity sponsored companies, or prime brokerage activities.\nCredit Risk Framework and Governance\nThe CRC is the most senior credit committee at Northern Trust, with responsibility for establishing, approving, and monitoring credit-related policies and programs throughout the Bank. The Chief Credit Officer reports directly to the CRO, chairs the CRC, and heads the Credit Risk Management function at Northern Trust. \nThe Credit Risk Management function is the focal point of the credit risk framework and, while independent of the business units that manage client relationships, it works closely with them to achieve the goal of assuring proactive management of credit risk. To monitor and control credit risk, the Credit Risk Management function maintains a framework that consists of policies, standards, and programs designed to promote a prudent credit culture and monitors adherence to those internal policies, standards, and programs, as well as external regulations. Independent oversight and review of the credit risk framework also is provided by Risk Control.\nThe credit risk framework stipulates authority levels for approval of the extension of credit. Individual credit authority for commercial and personal loans is limited to specified amounts and maturities. Credit requests exceeding policies or standards because of amount, maturity, rating, or other conditions, are referred to the relevant Group Credit Approval Committee. Credit decisions involving requests in excess of Group Credit Approval Committee limits require the approval of the Senior Credit Committee. The Capital Markets Credit Committee has sole authority for the approval, modification, or renewal of credit exposure limits to all wholesale market counterparties. The Senior Credit Committee and Capital Markets Credit Committee are both direct sub-committees of the CRC. The Treasury Credit Committee provides similar approval for investments in assets subject to credit risk, such as bonds and equities.\n74\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCredit Risk Measurement\nThe credit risk framework covers a number of different measurements of credit risk at Northern Trust, including RWA, the allowance for credit losses, and stress tests using various macroeconomic scenarios, such as the internal capital adequacy approval program and CCAR. \nAn integral component of credit risk measurement is Northern Trust’s internal risk rating system. Northern Trust’s internal risk rating system enables identification, measurement, approval and monitoring of the Corporation’s credit risk. Calculations include entity-specific information about the obligor’s or counterparty’s probability of default (PD) and  exposure-specific information about loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD), and maturity. Northern Trust’s internal risk rating system is intended to rank its credit risk without any direct linkage to external credit ratings.\nObligors are assigned PDs after consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. Although the criteria vary, the objective is for assigned PDs to be consistent in the measurement and ranking of risk. LGD and EAD are assigned based on obligor, product, collateral and instrument characteristics. \nRisk ratings are assigned at the time a counterparty or an obligation is approved, renewed, or amended. Risk ratings are reviewed annually or when new information relevant to the rating is received. Risk ratings are utilized for credit underwriting, management reporting, and the calculation of regulatory capital.\nThe Credit Risk Management function is responsible for the ongoing oversight of each model that supports the internal risk-rating system. Independent model governance and oversight is further supported by the activities of Risk Control.\nLoans and Other Extensions of Credit\nA significant component of credit risk relates to the loan portfolio, including contractual obligations such as legally binding commitments to extend credit, commercial letters of credit, and standby letters of credit. These contractual obligations and arrangements are discussed in Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nUndrawn commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since a significant portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements. The following table provides information about the industry sector and expiration dates of undrawn commitments to extend credit as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n75\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTABLE 40: UNDRAWN COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT BY INDUSTRY SECTOR \nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nCOMMITMENTS\nCOMMITMENTS\n(In Millions)\nTOTAL\nONE YEAR\nAND LESS\nOVER ONE\nYEAR\nOUTSTANDING\nLOANS\nTOTAL\nONE YEAR\nAND LESS\nOVER ONE\nYEAR\nOUTSTANDING\nLOANS\nCommercial\nCommercial and Institutional\n(1)\nFinance and Insurance\n$\n3,936.8\n \n$\n1,928.3\n \n$\n2,008.5\n \n$\n927.0\n \n$\n3,536.8 \n$\n1,664.0 \n$\n1,872.8 \n$\n1,109.3 \nHolding Companies\n7.4\n \n—\n \n7.4\n \n31.9\n \n— \n— \n— \n28.9 \nManufacturing\n6,255.5\n \n873.9\n \n5,381.6\n \n1,231.2\n \n6,551.9 \n1,104.3 \n5,447.6 \n1,619.1 \nMining\n472.5\n \n24.5\n \n448.0\n \n33.5\n \n461.8 \n29.8 \n432.0 \n29.8 \nPrivate Equity\n2,414.8\n \n2,110.7\n \n304.1\n \n3,154.6\n \n2,740.4 \n1,888.9 \n851.5 \n3,248.9 \nPublic Administration\n50.0\n \n50.0\n \n—\n \n0.9\n \n50.0 \n50.0 \n— \n28.1 \nRetail Trade\n882.5\n \n323.7\n \n558.8\n \n204.6\n \n1,003.8 \n382.2 \n621.6 \n244.2 \nServices\n5,671.2\n \n2,551.6\n \n3,119.6\n \n3,812.6\n \n6,133.1 \n2,528.1 \n3,605.0 \n4,041.7 \nTransportation and Warehousing\n318.9\n \n75.0\n \n243.9\n \n242.8\n \n239.9 \n3.7 \n236.2 \n273.2 \nUtilities\n1,363.1\n \n9.6\n \n1,353.5\n \n73.5\n \n1,246.3 \n8.5 \n1,237.8 \n36.8 \nWholesale Trade\n739.9\n \n15.2\n \n724.7\n \n491.6\n \n759.2 \n60.0 \n699.2 \n510.4 \nOther Commercial\n141.8\n \n93.4\n \n48.4\n \n332.9\n \n159.7 \n49.5 \n110.2 \n384.9 \nCommercial and Institutional\n22,254.4\n \n8,055.9\n \n14,198.5\n \n10,537.1\n \n22,882.9 \n7,769.0 \n15,113.9 \n11,555.3 \nCommercial Real Estate\n376.5\n \n139.1\n \n237.4\n \n5,314.2\n \n413.0 \n58.3 \n354.7 \n5,134.2 \nNon-U.S.\nOther Non-US\n1,549.3\n \n898.7\n \n650.6\n \n1,143.9\n \n1,340.4 \n677.7 \n662.7 \n1,543.0 \nPrivate Equity \n210.1\n \n141.6\n \n68.5\n \n970.0\n \n446.2 \n446.2 \n— \n1,235.5 \nNon-U.S.\n1,759.4\n \n1,040.3\n \n719.1\n \n2,113.9\n \n1,786.6 \n1,123.9 \n662.7 \n2,778.5 \nOther\n83.5\n \n83.5\n \n—\n \n2,313.6\n \n87.5 \n87.5 \n— \n5,944.8 \nTotal Commercial\n24,473.8\n \n9,318.8\n \n15,155.0\n \n20,278.8\n \n25,170.0 \n9,038.7 \n16,131.3 \n25,412.8 \nPersonal\nPrivate Client\n2,635.2\n \n995.8\n \n1,639.4\n \n15,848.8\n \n3,876.2 \n2,033.6 \n1,842.6 \n14,360.0 \nResidential Real Estate\n679.5\n \n214.0\n \n465.5\n \n6,109.9\n \n804.2 \n251.3 \n552.9 \n6,327.1 \nNon-U.S.\n354.3\n \n321.0\n \n33.3\n \n674.7\n \n908.7 \n525.9 \n382.8 \n428.8 \nOther\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n478.4\n \n— \n— \n— \n1,088.3 \nTotal Personal\n3,669.0\n \n1,530.8\n \n2,138.2\n \n23,111.8\n \n5,589.1 \n2,810.8 \n2,778.3 \n22,204.2 \nTotal\n$\n28,142.8\n \n$\n10,849.6\n \n$\n17,293.2\n \n$\n43,390.6\n \n$\n30,759.1 \n$\n11,849.5 \n$\n18,909.6 \n$\n47,617.0 \n(1) \nThe commercial and institutional industry sector information is presented on the basis of the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS).\nAs part of Northern Trust’s credit processes, the Credit Risk Management function oversees a range of portfolio reviews that focus on significant and/or weaker-rated credits. This approach allows management to take remedial action in an effort to deal with potential problems. An integral part of the Credit Risk Management function is a formal review of past due and potential problem loans to determine which credits, if any, need to be placed on nonaccrual status or charged off. Northern Trust maintains a loan portfolio “watch list” for adversely classified credit exposures that includes all nonaccrual credits as well as other loans with elevated risk of default. Independent from the Credit Risk Management function, Credit Review undertakes both on-site and off-site file reviews that evaluate the effectiveness of management’s implementation of Credit Risk Management’s requirements.\nCounterparty Credit Risk\nCounterparty credit risk for Northern Trust primarily arises from a variety of funding, treasury, trading and custody-related activities, including trading OTC foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives, indemnified securities lending transactions, and sponsored repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions. Credit exposure to counterparties is managed by use of a framework for setting limits by product type and exposure tenor.\nTo calculate exposure, Northern Trust treats repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements, indemnified securities lending, and sponsored repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions as repo-style transactions. Foreign exchange exposures and interest rate derivatives are treated as OTC derivatives. The exposure at default measurement methodology for each eligible type of counterparty credit exposure, including the use of netting and collateral as risk mitigants, is determined based on regulatory requirements.\n76\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCredit Risk Mitigation\nNorthern Trust considers cash flow to be the primary source of repayment for client-related credit exposures. However, Northern Trust employs several different types of credit risk mitigants to manage its overall credit risk in the event cash flow is not sufficient to repay a credit exposure. Northern Trust broadly groups its risk mitigation techniques into the following three primary categories.\nPhysical and Financial Collateral:\n One of Northern Trust’s primary credit risk mitigation approaches is the requirement of collateral. Residential and commercial real estate exposures are typically secured by properly margined mortgages on the property. Various other types of physical and financial collateral are also accepted for certain commercial and personal loans, in line with Northern Trust’s lending standards. In cases where loans to clients are secured by marketable securities, the daily values of the securities are monitored closely to ensure adherence to collateral coverage policies.\nNetting:\n On-balance sheet netting is employed where applicable for counterparties with master netting arrangements. Netting is primarily related to foreign exchange transactions with major banks and institutional clients subject to eligible master netting arrangements. \nGuarantees:\n Personal and corporate guarantees are accepted, as warranted, to reduce risk of default, facilitate potential collection efforts, and protect Northern Trust’s claims relative to other creditors. \nAnother important risk management practice is the avoidance of undue concentrations of exposure, such as in any single (or small number of related) obligor/counterparty, loan type, industry, geography, country or risk mitigant. Processes are in place to establish limits on certain concentrations and the monitoring of adherence to the limits.\nOperational Risk\nOperational risk is the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes, human factors and systems, or from external events.\nOperational Risk Overview\nOperational risk is inherent in each of Northern Trust’s businesses and corporate functions and reflects the potential for inadequate information systems, operating problems, challenges related to reliance on third parties, product design and delivery difficulties, potential legal actions or catastrophes to result in losses. This includes the potential that continuity of service and resilience may be impacted.\nOperational risk includes information technology and cybersecurity, compliance, fiduciary and legal risks, which under the Corporation’s risk structure are governed and managed explicitly.\nOperational Risk Framework and Governance\nTo monitor and control operational risk, Northern Trust maintains a framework consisting of risk management policies, programs and practices designed to promote a sound operational environment and maintain the Corporation’s operational risk profile and losses within approved risk appetites and guidelines. The framework implements a structured approach to establishing and communicating operational risk management practices and responsibilities. This structured approach to measuring and managing operational risk addresses operational resilience which requires that Northern Trust minimize service disruptions and limit systemic impacts from adverse events as well as risk quantification. The framework is deployed consistently and globally across all businesses and its objective is to identify and measure the factors that influence risk and drive action to maintain operational resilience and reduce future loss events. The Operational Risk Management function operates within the independent Non-Financial Risk function and is responsible for defining the operational risk management framework and providing independent oversight of the framework implementation and application across Northern Trust. It is the responsibility of each business and corporate function to implement the enterprise-wide operational risk framework and business and function-specific risk management programs to identify, monitor, measure, manage and report on operational risk and mitigate Northern Trust’s exposure to disruption and loss. Several key programs support the operational risk framework, including:\n•\nLoss Event Data Program\n - a program that collects internal and external loss data for use in monitoring operational risk exposure, various business analyses, and operational risk quantification, including the Basel Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA) capital quantification. Both internal and external loss data are used in the operational risk capital quantification. Data is reviewed to increase understanding of Northern Trust’s and industry-wide operational risk exposure and to identify action plans to minimize or prevent future events.\n•\nRisk and Control Self-Assessment\n - a comprehensive, structured risk management process used by Northern Trust’s businesses and corporate functions to identify, measure, monitor and mitigate operational risk exposures throughout the enterprise.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n77\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n•\nOperational Risk Scenario Analysis\n - a systematic process of obtaining expert opinions from business managers and risk management experts to derive reasoned assessments of the likelihood of occurrence and the potential loss impact of plausible operational losses. \n•\nProduct and Process Risk Management Program\n - a program used for evaluating and managing risks associated with the introduction of new and modified products and services and with significant changes to operating processes.\n•\nOperational Resilience\n - a program designed to ensure the resilience and continuity of service delivery of Northern Trust’s most important business services.\n•\nThird-Party Risk Management Program\n - a program that provides processes for evaluating, quantifying and qualifying appropriate risk assessment, measurement, monitoring and management of third and fourth parties (inclusive of external and internal, e.g., Northern Trust legal entity to legal entity relationships).\n•\nGlobal Fraud Risk\n - a program designed to prevent, detect and respond to attempted or actual fraud impacting the bank and its clients globally.\n•\nData Risk\n - a program that includes data management and data governance related activities in Northern Trust processes in order to manage the risk of compromised or degraded data availability and integrity.\n•\nData Privacy Program\n - a program that sets forth a consistent, global approach to compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations relating to privacy and establishes overarching principles for the responsible use and protection of confidential information. \n•\nCyber and Technology Risk Management\n - a program that sets forth a consistent, global approach to communicate risk management processes and controls addressing cybersecurity (inclusive of information security), technology, and related compliance risks to the organization. Please see",
    "item1c": "Item 1C, “Cybersecurity,” for a detailed discussion of cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance.\n•\nBusiness Continuity Management Program\n - a program designed to protect life safety, minimize and manage the business impact and support the recovery of critical functions for clients following an incident.\n•\nPhysical Security \n- a program that provides for the safety of Northern Trust partners, clients, and visitors worldwide by setting and enforcing standards, providing training, establishing partnerships, and encouraging continual improvement in workplace security.\n•\nInsurance Management Program\n - a program designed to reduce the monetary impact of certain operational loss events through the securing of appropriate insurance policy protection.\nAs discussed in “Risk Control” above, Model Risk Management also is part of the operational risk framework.\nThe Operational Risk Committee (ORC) is responsible for overseeing the activities of Northern Trust related to the management of operational risk including establishing and maintaining the Corporate Operational Risk Management Policy and approving the operational risk framework and programs. This committee has the expanded role of coordinating operational risk issues related to information technology, cybersecurity, compliance and fiduciary risks. The purpose of this committee is to provide executive management’s insight and guidance to the management of existing and emerging operational risks. This includes identification and assessment of evolving risk trends across the operational risk framework and how these can be best managed.\nOperational Risk Measurement\nNorthern Trust utilizes the AMA capital quantification process to estimate required capital for the Corporation and applicable U.S. banking subsidiaries. Northern Trust’s AMA capital quantification process incorporates outputs from the Loss Event Data, Risk and Control Self-Assessment and Operational Risk Scenario Analysis programs to derive required capital. While internal loss data is the foundation for the capital quantification, external loss event data and qualitative risk and control self-assessments are also utilized to inform the creation of scenario analysis data employed in the capital quantification process. Business environment factor information is used to estimate loss frequency. The AMA capital quantification process uses a Loss Distribution Approach methodology to combine frequency and severity distributions to arrive at an estimate of the potential aggregate loss at the 99.9\nth\n percentile of the aggregate loss distribution over a one-year time horizon.\nOperational Resilience and Recovery Management\nNorthern Trust’s operational resilience approach encompasses operational resilience and recovery processes enterprise-wide (including staff, technology and facilities) to anticipate and limit disruptions and to ensure that following a disaster or business interruption Northern Trust is able to resume critical business functions and fulfill all regulatory and legal requirements.\nNorthern Trust’s operational resilience mitigation and preventative measures include sophisticated physical security, resilient designs and peer capacity for its corporate data centers, a highly redundant global network, robust network security, resilience centers that offer alternative workstations and transfer of work and work-from-home programs that provide further capability.\n78\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAll of Northern Trust’s businesses are required to risk-assess all of their functions regularly and develop business continuity plans covering resource requirements (people, systems, vendor relationships and other assets), arrangements for obtaining these resources and prioritizing the resumption of each function in compliance with corporate standards. The business continuity programs of all critical third-party vendors to Northern Trust are reviewed on a regular basis. All of Northern Trust’s businesses test their plans at least annually. The ORC annually reviews and presents the corporate business continuity plan to the Business Risk Committee. \nFiduciary Risk\nFiduciary risks are risks arising from the failure: (a) in administering or managing financial and other assets in clients’ fiduciary accounts; (b) to adhere to a fiduciary standard of care if required under the terms of governing documents or applicable laws; or (c) to properly discharge fiduciary duties. Fiduciary status may hinge on the nature of a particular function being performed and fiduciary standards may vary by jurisdiction, type of relationship, and governing document.\nFiduciary Risk Overview\nThe fiduciary risk management framework identifies, assesses, measures, monitors, and reports on fiduciary risk matters deemed significant. Fiduciary risk is best managed at the source of the risk, and is mitigated through internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to identify, understand, and keep such risk at levels consistent with the organization’s overall risk appetite while also managing the inherent risk in each client relationship for which Northern Trust serves in a fiduciary capacity. Each business is responsible for complying with all corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards, and guidelines to manage fiduciary risk within the desired risk appetite.\n \nFiduciary Risk Framework and Governance\nThe FRC is responsible for overseeing activities related to the exercise of fiduciary powers throughout the organization, and for establishing and reviewing the fiduciary risk policies and the fiduciary risk framework that supports the coordination of activities to identify, monitor, manage, and report on fiduciary risk. In addition, the FRC serves as an escalation point for significant issues raised by its subcommittees or elsewhere in the organization.\nCompliance Risk\nCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, other regulatory requirements, or codes of conduct and other standards of self-regulatory organizations applicable to Northern Trust. Compliance risk includes the following two subcategories:\n•\nRegulatory risk - risk arising from failure to comply with prudential and conduct of business or other regulatory requirements.\n•\nFinancial crime risk - risk arising from financial crime (e.g., money laundering, sanctions violations, fraud, insider dealing, theft, etc.) in relation to the products, services, or accounts of the institution, its clients, or others associated with the same.\nCompliance Risk Framework and Governance\nThe compliance risk management framework identifies, assesses, controls, measures, monitors and reports on compliance risk. The framework is designed to minimize compliance risk and maintain an environment in which criminal or regulatory violations do not occur. The framework includes a comprehensive governance structure and a Compliance and Ethics Program approved by the Business Risk Committee.\nEach business is responsible for the implementation and effectiveness of the Compliance and Ethics Program and specific compliance policies within their respective businesses. Each business is responsible for its respective employees’ compliance with corporate policies and external regulations and for establishing specific procedures, standards and guidelines to manage compliance risk in accordance with Northern Trust’s Compliance and Ethics Program.\nThe CEOC oversees and provides direction with respect to the implementation of Northern Trust’s Compliance and Ethics Program and the coordination of compliance initiatives across the enterprise. The CEOC approves policies necessary to effectively manage Regulatory and Financial Crime Risk. The Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer reports to the Business Risk Committee, as appropriate, and chairs the CEOC.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n79\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity Risk Overview\nLiquidity risk is the risk of not being able to raise sufficient funds or maintain collateral to meet balance sheet and contingent liability cash flow obligations when due, because of firm-specific or market-wide stress events. Northern Trust is a Category II institution as defined by the Federal Reserve Board which requires us to adhere to the same regulatory liquidity standards as U.S. GSIBs. In adhering to these standards, Northern Trust engages in a range of reporting and other activities with regulators to affirm our financial strength and stability, including but not limited to, daily Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR), Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), and monthly Liquidity Stress-Testing calculations to regulators.\nNorthern Trust maintains a strong liquidity position and liquidity risk profile. Northern Trust’s balance sheet is primarily liability-driven. That is, the main driver of balance sheet changes comes from changing levels of client deposits, which are generally related to the level of custody assets serviced and commercial and personal deposits and can also be influenced by market conditions. This liability-driven business model differs from a typical asset-driven business model, where increased levels of deposits and wholesale borrowings are required to support, for example, increased levels of lending. Northern Trust’s balance sheet is generally comprised of high-quality assets that are managed to meet anticipated obligations under stress, resulting in low liquidity risk.\nLiquidity Risk Framework and Governance\nNorthern Trust maintains a liquidity risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All liquidity risk activities are overseen by the Risk Management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.\nThe Liquidity Management Policy and exposure limits for liquidity risk are set by the Board of Directors, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as the LCR, the NSFR, and the liquidity stress-testing buffer across a range of time horizons. Treasury, in the first line of defense, proposes liquidity risk management strategies and is responsible for performing liquidity management activities. The Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALCO) provides first-line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows, LCR, NSFR, and stress test results. \nMarket and Liquidity Risk Management, in the second line of defense, provides challenge to the first-line activities, evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness, and escalates material items for corrective action. The Market and Liquidity Risk Committee (MLRC) provides second-line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market and liquidity risk exposures, approving and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive liquidity risk measurement.\nLiquidity Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting\nLiquidity risk is analyzed and monitored in order to ensure compliance with the approved risk appetite. Various liquidity analysis and monitoring activities are employed by Northern Trust to better understand the nature and sources of its liquidity risks, including: liquidity stress testing, liquidity metric monitoring, collateral management, intraday management, cash flow projections, operational deposit modeling, liquid asset buffer measurement, funds transfer pricing, and contingency funding planning.\nThe liquidity risk management process is supported through management and regulatory reporting. Both Northern Trust’s Treasury and Market and Liquidity Risk Management functions produce management reports that enable oversight bodies to make informed decisions and support management of liquidity risk within the approved risk appetite. Holistic liquidity metrics such as LCR, NSFR and internal liquidity stress testing are actively monitored, along with a suite of other metrics that provide early warning indicators of changes in the risk profile.\nRegulatory Environment\nNorthern Trust actively follows regulatory developments and regularly evaluates its liquidity risk management framework against proposed rule-making and industry best practices in order to comply with applicable regulations and further enhance its liquidity policies. Please refer to “Supervision and Regulation—Liquidity Standards” in Item 1, “Business,” for a discussion of applicable liquidity standards.\n80\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nU.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) \nThe LCR Final Rule requires covered banking organizations, which include the Corporation, to maintain an amount of high-quality liquid assets (HQLAs) equal to or greater than 100% of the banking organization’s total net cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day standardized supervisory liquid stress scenario. The requirements of the LCR Final Rule are intended to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of covered banking organizations, improve the banking industry’s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, and improve the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The Corporation and the Bank each satisfied the U.S. liquidity coverage ratio requirements during 2024.\nU.S. Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)\nThe NSFR Final Rule requires covered banking organizations, which include the Corporation, to maintain an amount of available stable funding (ASF) equal to or greater than the banking organization’s projected minimum funding needs, or required stable funding (RSF), over a one-year time horizon. The NSFR is designed to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to a banking organization’s regular sources of funding will compromise its liquidity position, promote effective liquidity risk management, and support the ability of banking organizations to provide financial intermediation to businesses and households across a range of market conditions. The NSFR supports financial stability by requiring banking organizations to fund their activities with stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis, reducing the possibility that funding shocks would substantially increase distress at individual banking organizations. The Corporation and the Bank each satisfied the NSFR requirements during 2024.\nFunding\nNorthern Trust maintains a very liquid balance sheet, with cash and due from banks, deposits with the Federal Reserve and other central banks, short-term money market assets and investment securities in aggregate representing 62% and 59% of total assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The market value of unencumbered securities at the Bank, which include those placed at the central bank discount window, totaled $42.0 billion and $39.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Northern Trust manages its funding to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet its ongoing obligations and commitments. \nAs the Corporation’s principal subsidiary encompassing all of Northern Trust’s banking activities, the Bank centrally manages liquidity for all U.S. and international banking operations. Liquidity is provided by a variety of sources, including client deposits (institutional and personal) from the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management businesses, wholesale funding from the capital markets, maturities of short-term investments, interest earned on investment securities and money market assets, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, and unencumbered liquid assets that can be sold or pledged to secure additional funds. While management does not view central bank discount windows as primary sources of liquidity, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank had over $36.9 billion and $34.7 billion, respectively of securities and loans readily available as collateral to support discount window borrowings. The Bank also is active in the U.S. interbank funding market, providing an important source of additional liquidity and low-cost funds.\nThe liquidity of the Corporation is managed separately from that of the Bank. The primary sources of cash for the Corporation are issuances of debt or equity and dividend payments from the Bank. For further information on issuances or redemptions of debt or equity, please refer to Note 12, “Senior Notes and Long-Term Debt” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” The Corporation received $3.1 billion of dividends and $850.0 million from the Bank in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Dividends from the Bank are subject to certain restrictions, as discussed in further detail in Note 30, “Restrictions on Subsidiary Dividends and Loans or Advances,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nThe Corporation’s liquidity, defined as the amount of cash and highly marketable assets, was $2.4 billion and $795.6 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During, and at year-end, 2024 and 2023, these assets were comprised almost entirely of cash in a demand deposit account at the Bank or overnight money market placements, both of which were fully available to the Corporation to support its own cash flow requirements or those of its subsidiaries, as needed. Average liquidity during 2024 and 2023 was $1.7 billion and $797.2 million, respectively. The cash flows of the Corporation are shown in Note 33, “Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation only),” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nUses of Liquidity\nLiquidity supports a variety of activities, including client withdrawals, purchases of securities, net loan growth, and draws on commitments to extend credit.\nThe Corporation’s uses of cash consist mainly of dividend payments to the Corporation’s stockholders; the payment of principal and interest to note holders; repurchases of its common stock; and investments in, or loans to, its subsidiaries. The most significant uses of cash by the Corporation during 2024 were $602.3 million of common stock dividends and $937.8 million of common stock repurchases. The most significant uses of cash by the Corporation during 2023 were $621.5 million of common stock dividends and $347.5 million of common stock repurchases.     \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n81\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCredit Ratings\nA significant source of liquidity for both the Corporation and the Bank is the ability to draw funding from capital markets globally. The credit ratings of the Corporation and the Bank as of December 31, 2024, provided in the following table, allow Northern Trust to access capital markets on favorable terms.\nTABLE 41: NORTHERN TRUST CREDIT RATINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31,\n \n2024 \nCREDIT RATING\nSTANDARD &\nPOOR’S\nMOODY’S\nFITCH RATINGS\nNorthern Trust Corporation:\nSenior Debt\nA+\nA2\nA+\nSubordinated Debt\nA\nA2\nA+\nPreferred Stock\nBBB+\nBaa1\nBBB\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nThe Northern Trust Company:\nShort-Term Deposit\nA-1+\nP-1\nF1+\nLong-Term Deposit/Debt\nAA-\nAa2\nAA\nSubordinated Debt\nA+\nA2\nA+\nOutlook\nStable\nStable\nStable\nA significant downgrade in one or more of these ratings could limit Northern Trust’s access to capital markets and/or increase the rates paid for short-term borrowings, including deposits, and future long-term debt issuances. The size of these rate increases would depend on multiple factors, including the extent of the downgrade, Northern Trust’s relative debt rating compared to other financial institutions, current market conditions, and other factors. In addition, as discussed in Note 27, “Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” Northern Trust enters into certain master netting arrangements with derivative counterparties that contain credit-risk-related contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels. At December 31, 2024, the net maximum amount of these termination payments that Northern Trust could have been required to pay was $158.8 million. Other than these credit-risk-related contingent derivative counterparty payments, Northern Trust had no long-term debt covenants or other credit-risk-related payments at December 31, 2024, that would be triggered by a significant downgrade in its debt ratings.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nPlease refer to Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” provided in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for information on off-balance sheet arrangements and the Credit Risk discussion in the “Risk Management” section for further detail on undrawn commitments.  \nMarket Risk\nThere are two types of market risk, interest rate risk associated with the banking book and trading risk. Interest rate risk associated with the banking book is the potential for movements in interest rates to cause changes in Net Interest Income and the market value of equity, including Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) from the AFS debt securities portfolio. Trading risk is the potential for movements in market variables such as foreign exchange and interest rates to cause changes in the value of trading positions.\nMarket Risk Framework and Governance\nNorthern Trust maintains a market risk framework consisting of risk management policies and practices to keep its risk profile within the Board-approved Corporate Risk Appetite Statement. All market risk activities are overseen by the Risk Management function, which is independent of the businesses undertaking the activities.\nThe Asset and Liability Management Policy, Policy on Dealer Trading Activities, and exposure limits for market risk are set by Board-level committees, and committee structures have been established to implement and monitor adherence to corporate policies, external regulations and established procedures. Limits are monitored based on measures such as sensitivity of Net Interest Income (NII), sensitivity of market value of equity (MVE), and value-at-risk (VaR) across a range of time horizons. \nTreasury, in the first line of defense, proposes market risk management strategies and is responsible for performing market risk management activities. The ALCO provides first-line management oversight and is responsible for approving strategies and activities within the risk appetite, monitoring risk metrics, overseeing balance sheet resources, overseeing the execution of strategies, and reviewing reporting such as cash flows, the liquidity coverage ratio and stress test results.\n82\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Market and Liquidity Risk Management function, in the second line of defense, provides challenge to the first-line activities, evaluates compliance with regulatory requirements and process effectiveness, and escalates material items for corrective action. The MLRC provides second-line oversight and is responsible for reviewing market risk exposures, establishing and monitoring risk metrics, and approving key methodologies and assumptions that drive market risk measurement.\nInterest Rate Risk Overview\nInterest rate risk in the banking book is the potential for deterioration in Northern Trust's financial position (e.g., interest income, market value of equity, or capital) due to changes in interest rates. NII and MVE sensitivity are the primary metrics used for measurement and management of interest rate risk. Changes in interest rates can have a positive or negative impact on NII depending on the positioning of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments. Changes in interest rates also can impact the values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet positions, which directly impact the MVE. Higher interest rates may impact the fair value of available for sale debt securities which in turn affects Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) that can impact regulatory capital ratios. To mitigate interest rate risk, the structure of the balance sheet is managed so that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities (adjusted for hedges) are sufficiently correlated, which allows Northern Trust to manage its interest rate risk within its risk appetite.\nThere are four commonly recognized types of structural interest rate risk in the banking book:\n•\nrepricing risk, which arises from differences in the maturity and repricing terms of assets and liabilities;\n•\nyield curve risk, which arises from changes in the shape of the yield curve;\n•\nbasis risk, which arises from imperfect correlation in the adjustment of the rates earned and paid on different financial instruments with otherwise similar repricing characteristics; and\n•\nembedded optionality risk, which arises from client or counterparty behavior in response to interest rate changes.\nInterest Rate Risk Analysis, Monitoring, and Reporting\nNorthern Trust uses two primary measurement techniques to manage interest rate risk: NII and MVE sensitivity. NII sensitivity provides management with a short-term view of the impact of interest rate changes on NII. MVE sensitivity provides management with a long-term view of interest rate changes on MVE based on the period-end balance sheet.  \nNorthern Trust limits aggregate interest rate risk (as measured by the NII sensitivity and MVE sensitivity simulation techniques) to an acceptable level within the context of risk appetite. A variety of actions may be used to implement risk management strategies to modify interest rate risk including:\n•\npurchase of investment securities;\n•\nsale of investment securities that are classified as available for sale;\n•\nissuance of senior notes and subordinated notes;\n•\ncollateralized borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank; and\n•\nhedging with various types of derivative financial instruments.\nNII Sensitivity\nThe modeling of NII sensitivity incorporates on-balance sheet positions, as well as derivative financial instruments (principally interest rate swaps) that are used to manage interest rate risk. Northern Trust uses market implied forward interest rates as the base case and measures the sensitivity (i.e., change) of a static balance sheet to changes in interest rates. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).\nThe NII sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate NII sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. The following key assumptions are incorporated into the NII simulation:\n•\nthe balance sheet size and mix remains constant over the simulation horizon with maturing assets and liabilities replaced with instruments with similar terms as those that are maturing, with the exception of certain nonmaturity deposits that are considered short-term in nature and therefore receive a more conservative interest-bearing treatment;\n•\nprepayments on mortgage loans and securities collateralized by mortgages are projected under each rate scenario using a third-party mortgage analytics system that incorporates market prepayment assumptions;\n•\ncash flows for structured securities are estimated using a third-party vendor in conjunction with the prepayments provided by the third-party mortgage analytics vendor;\n•\nnonmaturity deposit pricing is projected based on Northern Trust’s actual historical patterns and management judgment, depending upon the availability of historical data and current pricing strategies/or judgment; and\n•\nnew business rates are based on current spreads to market indices.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n83\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table shows the estimated NII impact over the next twelve months of 100 and 200 basis point ramps upward and 100 and 200 basis point ramps downward in interest rates relative to forward rates as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period. \nTABLE 42: NET INTEREST INCOME SENSITIVITY\nINCREASE (DECREASE) ESTIMATED IMPACT ON NEXT TWELVE MONTHS OF NET INTEREST INCOME\n(In Millions)\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nINCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ABOVE MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points\n$\n30\n \n$\n43 \n200 Basis Points\n53\n \n82 \nDECREASE IN INTEREST RATES BELOW MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points\n$\n(34)\n$\n(63)\n200 Basis Points\n(82)\n(150)\nThe NII sensitivity analysis does not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movement. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. NII sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided.\nMVE Sensitivity\nMVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities, net of the value of financial derivatives that are used to manage the interest rate risk of balance sheet items. The MVE looks at the whole balance sheet, which includes AFS debt securities, HTM debt securities, money market accounts, deposits, loans and wholesale borrowings. The potential effect of interest rate changes on MVE is derived from the impact of such changes on projected future cash flows and the present value of these cash flows and is then compared to the established limit. Northern Trust uses current market rates (and the future rates implied by these market rates) as the base case and measures MVE sensitivity under various rate scenarios. Stress testing of interest rates is performed to include such scenarios as immediate parallel shocks to rates, nonparallel (i.e., twist) changes to yield curves that result in their becoming steeper or flatter, and changes to the relationship among the yield curves (i.e., basis risk).\nThe MVE sensitivity analysis incorporates certain critical assumptions such as interest rates and client behaviors under changing rate environments. These assumptions are based on a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior. The simulation cannot precisely estimate MVE sensitivity given uncertainty in the assumptions. Many of the assumptions that apply to NII sensitivity also apply to MVE sensitivity simulations, with the following separate key assumptions incorporated into the MVE simulation:\n•\nthe present value of nonmaturity deposits are estimated using dynamic decay methodologies or estimated remaining lives, which are based on a combination of Northern Trust’s actual historical runoff patterns and management judgment—some balances are assumed to be core and have longer lives while other balances are assumed to be temporary and have comparatively shorter lives;\n•\nthe present values of most noninterest-bearing balances (such as receivables, equipment, and payables) are the same as their carrying values; and\n•\nMonte Carlo simulation is used to generate forward interest rate paths.\nThe following table shows the estimated impact on MVE of 100 and 200 basis point shocks up and 100 and 200 basis point shocks down from current market implied forward rates at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Each rate movement is assumed to occur gradually over a one-year period. \nTABLE 43: MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY SENSITIVITY  \nINCREASE (DECREASE) ESTIMATED IMPACT ON MARKET VALUE OF EQUITY\n(In Millions)\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nINCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ABOVE MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points\n$\n(374)\n$\n(360)\n200 Basis Points\n(808)\n(817)\nDECREASE IN INTEREST RATES BELOW MARKET IMPLIED FORWARD RATES\n100 Basis Points\n$\n508\n \n$\n430 \n200 Basis Points\n951\n \n725 \n84\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe MVE simulations do not incorporate certain management actions that may be used to mitigate adverse effects of actual interest rate movements. For that reason and others, the estimated impacts do not reflect the likely actual results but serve as estimates of interest rate risk. MVE sensitivity is not comparable to actual results disclosed elsewhere or directly predictive of future values of other measures provided.\nForeign Currency Market Risk\nForeign Currency Non-Trading Risk Overview\nNorthern Trust’s balance sheet is exposed to non-trading foreign currency risk as a result of its holdings of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, investment in non-U.S. subsidiaries, and future non-U.S.-dollar-denominated revenue and expense. To manage currency exposures on the balance sheet, Northern Trust attempts to match its assets and liabilities by currency. If those currency offsets do not exist on the balance sheet, Northern Trust will use foreign exchange derivative contracts to mitigate its currency exposure. \nTrading Market Risk\nWithin Market Risk, trading risk arises from providing foreign exchange, interest rate derivatives, and securities brokerage services to clients. Securities positions are limited and their trading risks are \nde minimis\n. For regulatory capital purposes, trading risk also includes foreign currency balances from business operations.\nTrading Book Composition and Risk Drivers\nNorthern Trust’s trading book is composed of positions arising from activity in four business areas: Global Foreign Exchange (GFX), which includes Treasury foreign exchange trades; Interest rate derivative (IRD) trades; Northern Trust Securities Inc. (NTSI) inventory; and foreign currency balances (FCBs) accrued on the balance sheet.\nGFX desks execute foreign exchange transactions for client accommodation purposes and mitigate most of the exposure via offsetting trades. In addition, Northern Trust’s Treasury department executes foreign exchange transactions to manage balance sheet flows. The risk system includes these within GFX and applies FX and interest rate (IR) drivers to produce VaR for regulatory capital.\nNorthern Trust’s Treasury Department executes IRD trades for client accommodation purposes and mitigates the exposure via offsetting trades. The risk system applies IR and volatility drivers to produce VaR for regulatory capital.\nFCBs arise not from executing trades but rather in the course of regular business operations, from non-U.S.-dollar-denominated revenues and expenses accruing onto the Corporation’s balance sheet. Prior to September 1, 2023, FX risk from these positions was mitigated through hedging activity. This hedging activity was discontinued on September 1, 2023. The risk system applies FX drivers to produce VaR for regulatory capital.\nNTSI, a brokerage subsidiary of the Corporation, executes fixed-income securities trades directly for client accounts. A small inventory of securities remains held in inventory overnight. This portfolio exposure is de minimis, and VaR calculations are not required. The valuation of the securities serves as the basis for calculating regulatory capital.\nForeign Currency Trading Risk Overview\nForeign currency or foreign exchange trading positions exist when aggregate obligations to purchase and sell a currency other than the U.S. dollar do not offset each other in amount, or offset each other over different time periods. The GFX trading portfolio at Northern Trust is composed of spot, forward, non-deliverable forward, and foreign exchange rate (FX) swap transactions.\nInterest Rate Derivatives Trading Risk Overview\nIRD positions exist when aggregate interest cash inflows and outflows do not offset each other in amount or offset each other over different time periods. The IRD trading portfolio at Northern Trust is composed mostly of interest rate swaps entered into to meet clients’ interest rate risk management needs, but also including a small number of swaptions, caps, and floors. IRD risk measures during the second quarter of 2023 became temporarily inflated as a result of transitions of IRD contracts from LIBOR to SOFR referencing. The risk measures declined in the third quarter of 2023 as the bulk of transitions was completed.\nOther Non-material Trading Activities\nNorthern Trust’s broker-dealer subsidiary, NTSI, maintains a legacy portfolio of trading securities and invests excess cash balances in short-term investment vehicles. The portfolio averaged less than $0.1 million and less than $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n85\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTrading Book Risk Measurement\nFor trading book activities other than NTSI, Northern Trust measures daily the risk of loss associated with all non-U.S. currency positions using a VaR model and applying the historical simulation methodology. This statistical model provides estimates, based on high confidence levels, of the potential loss in value that might be incurred if an adverse shift in interest rates and non-U.S. currency exchange rates were to occur over a small number of days. The model incorporates foreign currency and interest rate volatilities and correlations in price movements among the currencies and interest rates. VaR is computed for each trading desk and for the global portfolio.\nVaR measures are computed daily in a vendor software application which reads positions from Northern Trust’s trading systems and foreign currency balances from the general ledger. Data vendors provide foreign exchange rates, interest rates, and volatilities for all currencies. The Risk Management function monitors on a daily basis VaR model inputs and outputs for reasonableness.\nTrading Book Risk Monitoring, Reporting and Analysis\nNorthern Trust monitors several variations of the VaR measures to meet specific regulatory and internal management needs. Variations include different methodologies (historical simulation, Monte Carlo simulation and Taylor approximation), horizons of one day and ten days, confidence levels of 95% and 99%, subcomponent VaRs using only FX drivers, only IR drivers, and only volatility drivers, and look-back periods of one year, two years, and four years. Those alternative measures provide management an array of corroborating metrics and alternative perspectives on Northern Trust’s market risks.\nAutomated daily reports are produced and distributed to business managers and risk managers. The Risk Management function also reviews and reports several variations of the VaR measures in historical time series format to provide management with a historical perspective on risk.\nThe following table presents the levels of total regulatory VaR and its subcomponents, covering GFX, foreign currency balances, and interest rate derivatives combined, in the years indicated below, based on the historical simulation methodology, a 99% confidence level, a one-day horizon and equally-weighted volatility. The total VaR is typically less than the sum of its three subcomponents due to diversification benefits derived from interactions among the three drivers.\nTABLE 44: VALUE-AT-RISK \n(In Millions)\nCombined Trading \nBook VaR\nFX VaR \n(FX DRIVERS ONLY)\nIR VaR \n(IR DRIVERS ONLY)\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nHigh\n$\n1.7\n \n$\n2.2 \n$\n1.9\n \n$\n1.9 \n$\n0.4\n \n$\n0.9 \nLow\n0.2\n \n0.1 \n0.1\n \n— \n0.1\n \n— \nAverage\n0.6\n \n0.6 \n0.5\n \n0.4 \n0.1\n \n0.2 \nAs of December 31,\n0.2\n \n0.2 \n0.2\n \n1.6 \n0.1\n \n0.1 \nDuring 2024 and 2023, Northern Trust did not incur an actual GFX trading loss in excess of the daily GFX VaR estimate.\nStrategic Risk\nStrategic risk is the vulnerability of the organization to internal or external developments that render corporate strategy ineffective or unachievable. The consequences of strategic risk can be diminished long-term earnings and capital, as well as reputational damage to the firm. Strategic risk encompasses two main areas:\n•\nMacroeconomic and geopolitical risk centers on external events or developments that would have a detrimental impact on financial markets and/or financial services firms. \n•\nBusiness risk arises from internal, secular, competitive, or regulatory trends that impact Northern Trust’s stated strategy or its achievability.\nStrategic Risk Framework and Governance\nThe Corporate Strategic Risk Framework has been developed in conjunction with the Corporation’s risk appetite and risk management policies, and defines the mission and expectations of the Strategic Risk Management function to identify and analyze the sources and consequences of strategic risk. \nThis is achieved through participation in the establishment and review of business line strategy, coordination of risk input to the evaluation of key strategic opportunities, and developing and maintaining a risk inventory and set of metrics which attempt to gauge the level of strategic risk within the organization. \nIn addition, the Strategic Risk Management function maintains the Global Event Response Program, which aims to anticipate and prepare for stress scenarios, and provide an outline for responding to them when they occur.\nBoth GERC and the Business Risk Committee are responsible for reviewing the general methods, guidelines and frameworks by which Northern Trust monitors and evaluates strategic risk.\n86\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nClimate Risk\nClimate risk continues to be an evolving strategic risk for the Corporation. Climate risk refers to the risk of loss arising from climate change and is comprised of physical risk, liability risk and transition risk. Physical risk refers to risks to banks and the financial system emanating from the increased severity of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, droughts, floods, and fires). It can also refer to longer-term shifts in precipitation and temperature and increased variability in weather patterns (e.g., sea level rise). Liability risk stems from the potential for litigation in response to institutions’ and boards’ approach to the impacts of climate change. Transition risk reflects the risks to banks and financial systems of transitioning to a lower-carbon economy that may entail extensive policy, legal, technological, and market changes. Depending on the nature, speed, and focus of these changes, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to banks and the financial system.  \nEffective management of climate risk requires coordinated governance, clearly defined roles and responsibilities and well-developed processes to identify, measure, monitor and control risks. We continue to build out and enhance our climate risk management capabilities. Our climate risk management efforts are overseen by the Chief Climate and Sustainability Risk Officer who reports directly to the CRO. The Risk Management function has created a dedicated climate and sustainability risk unit to monitor, oversee and take account of the increasing impact that climate change has, or may in the future have, on financial risk, nonfinancial risk, and regulatory compliance across the globe. The climate and sustainability risk unit works to evolve the risk management framework to ensure the Corporation meets the expectations of all stakeholders as well as all climate-related commitments made by the Corporation to external agencies.\nThe Board of Directors, and in particular its Corporate Governance Committee, engages in active oversight of ESG matters of significance to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. In addition, the Business Risk Committee provides oversight of certain financial and operational risks associated with climate change and other environmental factors through its oversight of the Corporation’s global risk management framework and risk management policies. The Business Risk Committee also engages in periodic discussions with management and members of the Risk Management function regarding strategic risks, including climate-related risk.\nThe Corporation expects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk types it manages, and the Corporation will continue to integrate climate considerations into its risk management framework as its understanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. Various regulatory agencies, investors, and other stakeholders have increased expectations and scrutiny in this area. Given the potential risks from climate change, the Corporation is committed to helping mitigate the impacts from its activities and to partner with key stakeholders to do the same.   \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n87\nMANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis report may include statements which constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Net Interest Margin is calculated by dividing annualized Net Interest Income by average interest-earning assets. Management believes this presentation provides a clearer indication of these financial measures for comparative purposes. When adjusted to an FTE basis, yields on taxable, nontaxable and partially taxable assets are comparable; however, the adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income.\nTABLE 45: RECONCILIATION TO FULLY TAXABLE EQUIVALENT \nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n($ In Millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet Interest Income\nInterest Income - GAAP\n$\n9,762.3\n \n$\n7,325.0 \n$\n2,877.7 \nAdd: FTE Adjustment\n31.8\n \n57.5 \n45.6 \nInterest Income (FTE) - Non-GAAP\n$\n9,794.1\n \n$\n7,382.5 \n$\n2,923.3 \nNet Interest Income - GAAP\n$\n2,177.1\n \n$\n1,982.0 \n$\n1,887.2 \nAdd: FTE Adjustment\n31.8\n \n57.5 \n45.6 \nNet Interest Income (FTE) - Non-GAAP\n$\n2,208.9\n \n$\n2,039.5 \n$\n1,932.8 \nNet Interest Margin - GAAP\n1.62\n \n%\n1.52 \n%\n1.36 \n%\nNet Interest Margin (FTE) - Non-GAAP\n1.64\n \n%\n1.56 \n%\n1.39 \n%\nTotal Revenue\nTotal Revenue - GAAP\n$\n8,290.4\n \n$\n6,773.5 \n$\n6,761.2 \nAdd: FTE Adjustment\n31.8\n \n57.5 \n45.6 \nTotal Revenue (FTE) - Non-GAAP\n$\n8,322.2\n \n$\n6,831.0 \n$\n6,806.8 \nITEM 7A – QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the “Risk Management” section of Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n90\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nITEM 8 – FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nNorthern Trust Corporation:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements \nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Northern Trust Corporation and subsidiaries (the Corporation) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements).

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n91\nAssessment of the allowance for credit losses for commercial loans evaluated on a collective basis\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation’s allowance for credit losses for commercial loans evaluated on a collective basis (the collective ACL) was $137.3 million of a total allowance for credit losses assigned to loans of $168.0 million as of December 31, 2024. Expected credit losses are measured on a collective basis as long as the financial assets included in the respective pool share similar risk characteristics. The allowance estimation methodology for the collective assessment is based on data representative of the Corporation’s financial asset portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan portfolio into segments based on loan and obligor specific factors, including loan type, borrower type, collateral type, loan size, and borrower credit quality. The estimation methodology applies probability of default and loss given default assumptions to the projected exposure at default on a pool basis. For each segment, the probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) are derived for each quarter of the remaining life of each instrument. For the first two years (the reasonable and supportable period), these factors are derived by applying quarterly macroeconomic projections using models developed from historical data on macroeconomic factors and loans with similar factors, including the borrower rating assigned to individual obligors, as applicable. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable period, the Corporation reverts to its own long-run historical loss experience on a straight-line basis over four quarters. The projected exposure at default for every quarter is based on contractual balance projections as of each quarter-end. Estimating expected lifetime credit losses requires the consideration of the effect of future economic conditions. The Corporation employs multiple scenarios over a reasonable and supportable period to project future conditions. The Corporation determines the probability weights assigned to each scenario at each quarter-end. The quantitative allowance is then reviewed within the qualitative adjustment framework, through which the Corporation applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology, and other factors that are not fully contemplated in the forecast to compute adjustments to the quantitative allowance that may impact individual or multiple segments of the loan portfolio. \nWe identified the assessment of the quantitative component of the collective ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the quantitative component of the collective ACL due to significant measurement uncertainty. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the quantitative component of the collective ACL methodology, including the methods and models used to estimate the PD and LGD and their significant assumptions, the multiple economic forecast scenarios and macroeconomic factors and their respective weightings, and borrower ratings for certain commercial loans. In addition, auditor judgment was required to evaluate the sufficiency of audit evidence obtained. \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Corporation’s measurement of the quantitative component of the collective ACL estimate, including controls over:\n•\ndevelopment of the quantitative component of the collective ACL methodology\n•\ndevelopment, calibration and/or performance monitoring of certain PD and LGD models\n•\ndevelopment and approval of the multiple economic forecast scenarios, macroeconomic factors and their respective weightings\n•\nidentification and determination of the significant assumptions used in certain PD and LGD models\n•\nanalysis of the allowance for credit losses for loans results.\nWe evaluated the Corporation’s process to develop the quantitative component of the collective ACL estimate by testing certain sources of data, factors, and assumptions that the Corporation used, and considered the relevance and reliability of such data, factors and assumptions. In addition, we involved credit risk professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n•\nevaluating the quantitative component of the Corporation’s collective ACL methodology for compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n•\nevaluating judgments made by the Corporation relative to the development, calibration and/or performance monitoring of certain PD and LGD models\n•\nassessing the conceptual soundness and performance testing of certain PD and LGD models by inspecting model documentation to determine whether the models were suitable for their intended use\n92\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \n•\nassessing the economic forecast scenarios, the economic input variables and their respective weightings through comparison to publicly available forecasts and the Corporation’s business environment\n•\ntesting individual borrower ratings for a selection of commercial loan relationships by evaluating the financial performance of the borrower, sources of repayment, and any relevant guarantees or underlying collateral.\nWe also assessed the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the quantitative component of the collective ACL by evaluating the:\n•\ncumulative results of the procedures\n•\nqualitative aspects of the Corporation’s accounting practices\n•\npotential bias in the accounting estimate\nWe have served as the Corporation’s auditor since 2002. \nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 24, 2025 \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n93\nCONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE

A description of the more significant accounting policies follows.\nA. \nBasis of Presentation.\n The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Northern Trust Corporation (Corporation) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Northern Trust Company (Bank), and various other wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation and Bank. Throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the term “Northern Trust” refers to the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The consolidated statements of income include results of acquired subsidiaries from the dates of acquisition. Certain prior-year balances have been reclassified consistent with the current year’s presentation.\n \nB. \nNature of Operations.\n The Corporation is a bank holding company that has elected to be a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. The Bank is an Illinois banking corporation headquartered in Chicago and the Corporation’s principal subsidiary. The Corporation conducts business in the United States (U.S.) and internationally through various U.S. and non-U.S. subsidiaries, including the Bank.\nNorthern Trust generates the majority of its revenue from its \ntwo\n client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business.\nAsset Servicing is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including but not limited to: custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking; and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.\nWealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. In supporting these targeted segments, Wealth Management provides trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; family business consulting; family financial education; brokerage services; and private and business banking. Wealth Management also includes Global Family Office, which provides customized services, including but not limited to: investment management; global custody; fiduciary; and private banking; family office consulting, and technology solutions, to meet the complex financial and reporting needs of ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices across the globe. Wealth Management services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams through a network of offices in \n19\n U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as well as offices in London, Guernsey, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi.\nC. \nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements.\n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the application of certain of our significant accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nD. \nForeign Currency Remeasurement and Translation.\n Asset and liability accounts denominated in nonfunctional currencies are remeasured into functional currencies at period-end rates of exchange, except for certain balance sheet items including but not limited to buildings and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Results from remeasurement of asset and liability accounts are reported in Other Operating Income on the consolidated statements of income. Income and expense accounts are remeasured at period-average rates of exchange.\nAsset and liability accounts of entities with functional currencies that are not the U.S. dollar are translated at period-end rates of exchange. Income and expense accounts are translated at period-average rates of exchange. Translation adjustments, net of applicable taxes, are reported directly to accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), a component of stockholders’ equity.\n98\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nE. \nSecurities.\n \nAvailable for Sale (AFS) Securities\n are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses credited or charged, net of the tax effect, to AOCI. Realized gains and losses on AFS securities are determined on a specific identification basis and are reported within Investment Security Gains (Losses), net, on the consolidated statements of income. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis, adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount.\nHeld to Maturity (HTM) Securities\n consist of debt securities that management intends to, and Northern Trust has the ability to, hold until maturity. Such securities are reported at cost, adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis adjusted for the amortization of premium and accretion of discount.\nTrading Account Securities\n are reported at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities held for trading are reported within Security Commissions and Trading Income on the consolidated statements of income.\nNonmarketable Securities\n primarily consist of Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Federal Home Loan Bank stock and community development investments, each of which are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and Federal Home Loan Bank stock are reported at cost, which represents redemption value. Community development investments are typically reported at amortized cost. Those community development investments that are designed to generate a return primarily through realization of tax credits and other tax benefits, which are discussed in further detail in Note 28, “Variable Interest Entities,” are amortized over the lives of the related tax credits and other tax benefits.\nF. \nSecurities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase.\n Securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are either directly held by, or pledged to the counterparty until the repurchase. Northern Trust nets securities sold under agreements to repurchase against those purchased under agreements to resell when the requirements to net are met.\n \nG. \nDerivative Financial Instruments.\n Northern Trust is a party to various derivative financial instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients, as part of its trading activity for its own account, and as part of its risk management activities. These instruments generally include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts, total return swap contracts and credit default swap contracts. All derivative financial instruments, whether designated as hedges or not, are recorded at fair value within Other Assets and Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Derivative asset and liability positions with the same counterparty are reflected on a net basis on the consolidated balance sheets in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist. These derivative assets and liabilities are further reduced by cash collateral received from, and deposited with, derivative counterparties. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative on the consolidated statements of income depends on whether or not the contract has been designated as a hedge and qualifies for hedge accounting under GAAP. Derivative financial instruments are recorded within the line item, Other Operating Activities, net, on the consolidated statement of cash flows, except for net investment hedges which are recorded within Other Investing Activities, net.\nChanges in the fair value of client-related and trading derivative instruments, which are not designated hedges under GAAP, are recognized currently in either Foreign Exchange Trading Income or Security Commissions and Trading Income on the consolidated statements of income. Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes but not designated as hedges are recognized currently in Other Operating Income on the consolidated statements of income. Certain derivative instruments used by Northern Trust to manage risk are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting as fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedges.\nDerivatives designated as fair value hedges are used to limit Northern Trust’s exposure to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates. Changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument and changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk are recognized currently in Interest Income or Interest Expense on the consolidated statements of income. For substantially all fair value hedges, Northern Trust applies the “shortcut” method of accounting, available under GAAP. As a result, changes recorded in the fair value of the hedged item are assumed to equal the offsetting gain or loss on the derivative. For fair value hedges that do not qualify for the “shortcut” method of accounting, Northern Trust utilizes regression analysis in assessing whether these hedging relationships are highly effective at inception and quarterly thereafter.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n99\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDerivatives designated as cash flow hedges are used to minimize the variability in cash flows of earning assets or forecasted transactions caused by movements in interest or foreign exchange rates. Changes in the fair value of such derivatives are recognized in AOCI, a component of stockholders’ equity, and there is no change to the accounting for the hedged item. Balances in AOCI are reclassified to earnings when the hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings, and are reflected in the same income statement line item. Northern Trust applies the “shortcut” method of accounting for cash flow hedges of certain AFS debt securities. For cash flow hedges of certain other AFS debt securities, foreign currency denominated securities, and forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions, Northern Trust closely matches all terms of the hedged item and hedging derivative at inception and on an ongoing basis. For cash flow hedges of AFS debt securities, to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched, effectiveness is assessed using regression analysis. For cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenditure transactions and investment securities, to the extent all terms are not perfectly matched, effectiveness is assessed using the dollar-offset method.\nForeign exchange contracts and qualifying non-derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are used to minimize Northern Trust’s exposure to variability in the foreign currency translation of net investments in non-U.S. branches and subsidiaries. Changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are recognized in AOCI consistent with the related translation gains and losses of the hedged net investment. For net investment hedges, all critical terms of the hedged item and the hedging instrument are matched at inception and on an ongoing basis. Amounts recorded in AOCI are reclassified to earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of an investment in a non-U.S. branch or subsidiary.\nFair value, cash flow, and net investment hedges are designated and formally documented as such contemporaneous with the transaction. The formal documentation describes the hedge relationship and identifies the hedging instruments and hedged items. Included in the documentation is a discussion of the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking such hedges, the nature of the risk being hedged, and a description of the method for assessing hedge effectiveness at inception and on an ongoing basis. For hedges that do not qualify for the “shortcut” or the critical terms match methods of accounting, a formal assessment is performed on a calendar quarter basis to verify that derivatives used in hedging transactions continue to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. Hedge accounting is discontinued if a derivative ceases to be highly effective, matures, is terminated or sold, if a hedged forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, or if Northern Trust removes the derivative’s hedge designation. Subsequent gains and losses on these derivatives are included in Foreign Exchange Trading Income or Security Commissions and Trading Income on the consolidated statements of income. For discontinued cash flow hedges, the accumulated gain or loss on the derivative remains in AOCI and is reclassified to earnings in the period in which the previously hedged forecasted transaction impacts earnings or is no longer probable of occurring. For discontinued fair value hedges, the previously hedged asset or liability ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value. Previous adjustments to the hedged item are amortized over the remaining life of the hedged item.\nH. \nLoans.\n Loans are recognized assets that represent a contractual right to receive money either on demand or on fixed or determinable dates. Loans are disaggregated for disclosure purposes by portfolio segment (segment) and by class. Northern Trust has defined its segments as commercial and personal. A class of loans is a subset of a segment, the components of which have similar risk characteristics, measurement attributes, or risk monitoring methods. The classes within the commercial segment have been defined as commercial and institutional, commercial real estate, non-U.S. and other. The classes within the personal segment have been defined as private client,\n \nresidential real estate, non-U.S. and other.\nLoan Classification.\n Loans that are held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income. Loans classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value. \nNonaccrual Loans and Recognition of Income.\n Interest income on loans is recorded on an accrual basis unless, in the opinion of management, there is a question as to the ability of the debtor to meet the terms of the loan agreement, or interest or principal is 90 days or more contractually past due and the loan is not well-secured and in the process of collection. Loans meeting such criteria are classified as nonaccrual, and interest income is recorded on a cash basis. Past due status is based on how long since the contractual due date a principal or interest payment has been past due. For disclosure purposes, loans that are 29 days past due or less are reported as current. At the time a loan is determined to be nonaccrual, interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income in the current period. Interest collected on nonaccrual loans is applied to principal unless, in the opinion of management, collectability of principal is not in doubt. Management’s assessment of indicators of loan collectability, and its policies relative to the recognition of interest income, including the suspension and subsequent resumption of income recognition, do not meaningfully vary between the different loan classes. Nonaccrual loans are returned to performing status when factors indicating doubtful collectability no longer exist. Factors considered in returning a loan to performing status are consistent across all classes of loans and, in accordance with regulatory guidance, relate primarily to expected payment performance. A loan is eligible to be returned to performing status when: (i) no principal or interest that is due is unpaid and repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected or (ii) the loan has otherwise become well-secured (possessing realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt, including accrued interest, in full) and is in the process of collection (through action reasonably \n100\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nexpected to result in debt repayment or restoration to a current status in the near future). A loan that has not been brought fully current may be restored to performing status provided there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally a minimum of six payment periods) by the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms, and Northern Trust is reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period of time. Additionally, a loan that has been formally restructured so as to be reasonably assured of repayment and performance according to its modified terms may be returned to accrual status, provided there was a well-documented credit evaluation of the borrower’s financial condition and prospects of repayment under the revised terms, and there has been a sustained period of repayment performance (generally a minimum of six payment periods) under the revised terms. \nLoan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty. \nFor borrowers experiencing financial difficulties, Northern Trust may provide payment relief by modifying the terms of the original loan. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty involve primarily the extensions of term, deferrals of principal and interest payments, interest rate concessions, and other modifications or a combination thereof. Northern Trust considers payment deferrals of less than 90 days as insignificant, absent any material modifications to other loan terms.  \nThe expected credit loss for modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is measured based on either the expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, or other factors that may impact the borrower’s ability to pay. When the discounted cash flow method is applied, the expected credit loss reflects the difference between the amortized cost basis and the present value of the expected cash flows and is measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the post-modification effective interest rate and contractual terms. If a loan’s contractual interest rate varies based on subsequent changes in an independent factor, such as an index or rate, the loan’s effective interest rate is calculated based on the factor as it changes over the life of the loan. Northern Trust elected not to project changes in the factor for purposes of estimating expected future cash flows. If the loan is collateral dependent, the expected loss is measured based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date. \nIf the loan valuation is less than the recorded value of the loan, either an allowance is established or a charge-off is recorded for the difference. The nature and extent of further deterioration in credit quality, including a subsequent default, is considered in the determination of an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses for all loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty.\nCollateral Dependent Financial Assets. \nA financial asset is collateral-dependent when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the sale or operation of the collateral. Most of Northern Trust’s collateral dependent credit exposure relates to its residential real estate portfolio for which the collateral is usually the underlying real estate property. For collateral dependent financial assets, it is Northern Trust’s policy to reserve or charge-off the difference between the amortized cost basis of the loan and the value of the collateral.\nPremium, Discounts, Origination Costs and Fees.\n Premiums and discounts on loans are recognized as an adjustment of yield using the interest method based on the contractual terms of the loan. Certain direct origination costs and fees are netted, deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan as an adjustment to the loan’s yield.\nI. \nAllowance for Credit Losses.\n The allowance for credit losses represents management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various financial assets subject to credit risk and off-balance sheet credit exposure. \nNorthern Trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. A financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation. \nManagement’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables, many of which are interrelated or dependent on other assumptions and estimates, and takes into consideration past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\nForecasting and Reversion. \nEstimating expected lifetime credit losses requires the consideration of the effect of future economic conditions. Northern Trust employs multiple scenarios over a reasonable and supportable period (currently two years) to project future conditions. Key variables determined to be relevant for projecting credit losses on the portfolios in scope include macroeconomic factors, such as corporate profits, GDP, unemployment rate, consumer spending, and real estate price indices, as well as financial market factors such as equity prices, volatility, and credit spreads. For periods beyond the reasonable and supportable period, Northern Trust reverts to its own historical loss experiences on a straight-line basis over four quarters. \nAllowance for Loans. \nThe allowance estimation methodology for the collective assessment is based on data representative of the Corporation’s financial asset portfolio from a historical observation period that includes both expansionary and recessionary periods. The estimation methodology and the related qualitative adjustment framework segregate the loan portfolio into segments and classes based on similar risk characteristics or risk monitoring methods.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n101\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNorthern Trust utilizes a quantitative probability of default/loss given default approach for the calculation of its credit allowance on a collective basis. For each of the different parameters, specific credit models or qualitative estimation methodologies for the individual loan classes were developed. For each class, the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the exposure at default for each projected quarter to determine the quantitative component of the allowance. The quantitative allowance is then reviewed within a comprehensive qualitative adjustment framework, through which management applies judgment by assessing internal risk factors, potential limitations in the quantitative methodology, and other factors that are not fully contemplated in the forecast to compute an adjustment to the quantitative allowance for each segment and class of the loan portfolio. \nThe allowance related to credit exposures evaluated on an individual basis is determined through individual evaluations of loans and lending-related commitments that have defaulted, generally those with Borrower Ratings of 8 and 9. These evaluations are based on expected future cash flows, the value of collateral, and other factors that may impact the borrowers’ ability to pay. For defaulted loans for which the amount of allowance, if any, is determined based on the value of the underlying collateral, third-party appraisals are typically obtained and utilized by management. These appraisals are generally less than twelve months old and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the collateral.\nNorthern Trust analyzes its exposure to credit losses from both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet activity using a consistent methodology for the quantitative as well as the qualitative framework. For purposes of estimating the allowance for credit losses for undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit, the exposure at default includes estimated draw downs of the undrawn commitments based on credit utilization factors, resulting in a proportionate amount of expected credit losses.\nAllowance for HTM Securities.\n \nHTM debt securities classified as U.S. government, government sponsored agency, and certain securities classified as obligations of states and political subdivisions are considered to be guarantees of the U.S. government or an agency of the U.S. government, and therefore an allowance for credit losses is not estimated for such investments as the expected probability of non-payment of the amortized cost basis is zero.\nHTM debt securities classified as “other asset-backed securities” represent pools of underlying receivables from which the cash flows are used to pay the bonds that vary in seniority. Utilizing a qualitative estimation approach, the allowance for other asset-backed securities is assessed by evaluating underlying pool performance based on delinquency rates and available credit support.\nHTM debt securities classified as “other” relate to investments purchased by Northern Trust to fulfill its obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). Northern Trust fulfills its obligations under the CRA by making qualified investments for purposes of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low-to-moderate income communities within Northern Trust’s market area. The allowance for CRA investments is assessed using a qualitative estimation approach primarily based on historical performance experience and default history of the underlying CRA loans to determine the quantitative allowance.\nThe allowance estimation methodology for all other HTM debt securities is developed using a combination of external and internal data. The estimation methodology groups securities with shared characteristics for which the probability of default and the loss given default are applied to the total exposure at default to determine a quantitative component of the allowance.\nAllowance for AFS Securities.\n \nAFS debt securities impairment reviews are conducted quarterly to identify and evaluate securities that have indications of possible credit losses. The determination as to whether a security’s decline in market value is related to credit impairment takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security. Factors Northern Trust considers in determining whether impairment is credit related include, but are not limited to, the severity of the impairment; the cause of the impairment; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; activity in the market of the issuer, which may indicate adverse credit conditions; Northern Trust’s intent regarding the sale of the security as of the balance sheet date; and the likelihood that Northern Trust will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. For each security meeting the requirements of Northern Trust’s internal screening process, an extensive review is conducted to determine if a credit loss has occurred that is then based on the best estimate of cash flows to be collected from the security, discounted using the security’s effective interest rate. If the present value of the expected cash flows is found to be less than the current amortized cost of the security, an allowance for credit losses is generally recorded equal to the difference between the two amounts, limited to the amount the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of the security. \nIf management intends to sell, or will more likely than not be required to sell, an AFS debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, the security is written down to fair value with unrealized losses recognized in Investment Security Gains (Losses), net on the consolidated statements of income. \n102\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAllowance for Other Financial Assets.\n The allowance for other financial assets covers assets categorized as Due from Banks, Other Central Bank Deposits, Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks, Federal Funds Sold, and Other Assets. The Other Assets category includes other miscellaneous credit exposures reported in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance estimation methodology for other financial assets primarily utilizes a similar approach as the one used for the HTM debt securities portfolio. It consists of a combination of externally and internally developed loss data, adjusted for the appropriate contractual term. Northern Trust’s portfolio is composed mostly of institutions within the “1 to 3” internal borrower rating category and is expected to exhibit minimal to modest likelihood of loss. \nThe portion of the allowance assigned to loans, HTM debt securities, and other financial assets is presented as a contra asset in Allowance for Credit Losses on the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the allowance assigned to undrawn loan commitments and standby letters of credit is reported in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for AFS securities is presented parenthetically with the amortized cost basis of AFS debt securities on the consolidated balance sheets. \nProvision for Credit Losses. \nProvision for Credit Losses on the consolidated statements of income represents the change in the Allowance for Credit Losses, after consideration of charge-offs and recoveries, on the consolidated balance sheets and is the charge to current period earnings. It represents the amount needed to maintain the Allowance for Credit Losses on the consolidated balance sheets at an appropriate level to absorb lifetime expected credit losses related to financial assets in scope. Actual losses may vary from current estimates.\nContractual Term. \nNorthern Trust estimates expected credit losses over the contractual term of the financial assets adjusted for prepayments, unless prepayments are not relevant to specific portfolios or sub-portfolios. Extension and renewal options are typically not considered since it is not Northern Trust’s practice to enter into arrangements where the borrower has the unconditional option to renew, or a conditional extension option whereby the conditions are beyond Northern Trust’s control.\nAccrued Interest.\n Northern Trust elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables related to its loan and securities portfolios as its policy is to write-off uncollectible accrued interest receivable balances in a timely manner. Accrued interest is written off by reversing interest income during the quarter the financial asset is moved from an accrual to a nonaccrual status.\n \nJ. \nStandby Letters of Credit.\n Fees on standby letters of credit are recognized in Other Operating Income on the consolidated statements of income using the straight-line method over the lives of the underlying agreements.\n \nK. \nBuildings and Equipment.\n Buildings and equipment owned are carried at original cost less accumulated depreciation. The charge for depreciation is computed using the straight-line method based on the following range of lives: buildings – up to \n30\n years; equipment – \n3\n to \n10\n years; and leasehold improvements – the shorter of the lease term or \n15\n years.\n \nL. \nOther Real Estate Owned (OREO).\n OREO is comprised of commercial and residential real estate properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of loans. OREO assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell and are recorded in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Fair value is typically based on third-party appraisals. Appraisals of OREO properties are updated on an annual basis and are subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to the realizable value of the properties. Losses identified during the 90-day period after the acquisition of such properties are charged against the Allowance for Credit Losses assigned to Loans. Subsequent write-downs to the carrying value of these assets that may be required and gains or losses realized from asset sales are recorded within Other Operating Expense on the consolidated statements of income.\nM. \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\n Goodwill is not subject to amortization. Separately identifiable acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives, primarily on a straight-line basis. Costs related to purchased software and internal-use software development projects that result in new or enhanced functionality, including compensation and other allowable internal costs, are capitalized. Software is amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from \n3\n to \n10\n years. Fees paid for the use of software services that do not convey a software license are expensed as incurred. \nGoodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.\n \nN. \nTrust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees.\n Trust, Investment and Other Servicing Fees are recorded on an accrual basis, over the period in which the service is provided. Fees are primarily a function of the market value of assets custodied, managed and serviced, transaction volumes, number of accounts, and securities lending volume and spreads, as set forth in the underlying client agreement. This revenue recognition involves the use of estimates and assumptions, including components that are calculated based on estimated asset valuations and transaction volumes.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n103\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nO. \nClient Security Settlement Receivables.\n These receivables result from custody client security sales executed under contractual settlement date accounting that have not yet settled as well as custody client withdrawals from short-term investment funds that settle on the following business day. Northern Trust advances cash to the client on the date of either trade execution or client withdrawal and awaits collection from either the settled trade or short-term investment funds.\nP. \nIncome Taxes.\n Northern Trust follows an asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. The objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. The measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates. It is Northern Trust’s policy to release income tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income on an aggregate portfolio basis. \nTax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are evaluated based on their likelihood of being sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Only tax positions that are considered more-likely-than-not to be sustained are recorded on the consolidated financial statements. A valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that all or a portion will not be realized. Northern Trust recognizes any interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the Provision for Income Taxes on the consolidated statements of income.\nQ. \nCash Flow Statements.\n Cash and cash equivalents in the cash flow statements have been defined as “Cash and Due from Banks” on the consolidated balance sheets.\nR. \nPensions.\n Northern Trust records the funded status of its defined benefit pension plans on the consolidated balance sheets. Overfunded pension benefits are reported in Other Assets and underfunded pension benefits are reported in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Plan assets and benefit obligations are measured annually at December 31, unless specific circumstances require an interim remeasurement. Plan assets are determined based on fair value generally representing observable market prices. The projected benefit obligations are determined based on the present value of projected benefit distributions at an assumed discount rate. Actuarial gains and losses accumulated in AOCI are amortized as a component of net periodic pension cost if they exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected average remaining service period of the active employees or over the expected remaining lifetime of plan participants for plans that have been previously frozen.\nS. \nShare-Based Compensation Plans.\n Northern Trust recognizes expense for share-based compensation on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period. The fair values of stock and stock unit awards, including performance stock unit awards and director awards, are based on the closing price of the Corporation’s stock on the date of grant adjusted for certain awards that do not accrue dividends while vesting. The expense for share-based compensation is included in Compensation on the consolidated statements of income. \nCompensation expense for share-based award grants with terms that provide for a graded vesting schedule, whereby portions of the award vest in increments over the requisite service period, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Compensation expense for performance stock unit awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award based on expected achievement of the performance condition. Adjustments are made for employees that meet certain retirement eligibility criteria at the grant date or during the requisite service period.\nNorthern Trust does not include an estimate of future forfeitures in its recognition of share-based compensation expense. Share-based compensation expense is adjusted based on forfeitures as they occur. Dividend equivalents are accrued for performance stock unit awards, most restricted stock unit awards, and director awards not yet vested, and are paid upon vesting. Certain restricted stock units are not entitled to dividend equivalents during the vesting period. Cash flows resulting from the realization of excess tax benefits are classified as operating cash flows on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nT. \nNet Income Per Common Share.\n Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income/loss applicable to common stock by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock and potential common shares by the aggregate of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period and common share equivalents calculated for stock options outstanding using the treasury stock method. In a period of a net loss, diluted net income per common share is calculated in the same manner as basic net income per common share.\nNorthern Trust calculates net income applicable to common stock using the two-class method, whereby net income is allocated between common stock and participating securities.\n104\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 2 – \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nOn January 1, 2024, Northern Trust adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-02, “Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Accounting for Investments in Tax Credit Structures Using the Proportional Amortization Method—a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force” (ASU 2023-02). The amendments in ASU 2023-02 allow entities to elect the proportional amortization method to account for tax equity investments if certain conditions are met regardless of the tax credit program from which the income tax credits are received. Under the proportional amortization method, an entity amortizes the initial cost of the investment in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received and recognizes the net amortization and income tax credits and other income tax benefits in the income statement as a component of income tax expense (benefit). In addition, ASU 2023-02 requires specific disclosures that must be applied to all investments that generate income tax credits and other income tax benefits for which the entity has elected to apply the proportional amortization method in accordance with Subtopic 323-740. Upon adoption of ASU 2023-02, there was no significant impact to Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income. Please refer to Note 28 - Variable Interest Entities for further information\nOn January 1, 2024, Northern Trust adopted ASU No. 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions” (ASU 2022-03). The amendments in ASU 2022-03 clarify that a contractual restriction on the sale of an equity security is not considered part of the unit of account of the equity security and, therefore, is not considered in measuring fair value. ASU 2022-03 also clarifies that an entity cannot, as a separate unit of account, recognize and measure a contractual sale restriction. Additionally, ASU 2022-03 introduces new disclosure requirements to provide investors with information about contractual sale restrictions including the nature and remaining duration of these restrictions. Upon adoption of ASU 2022-03, there was no impact to Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income.\nOn December 31, 2024, Northern Trust adopted ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (ASU 2023-07). ASU 2023-07 significantly expands disclosures about a public entity’s reportable segments, primarily through more frequent and enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. Additionally, ASU 2023-07 requires disclosure of the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) and how the CODM uses the reported measure of a segment’s profit or loss. Upon adoption of ASU 2023-07, the impact was limited to certain enhancements within the notes to the consolidated financial statements and did not impact Northern Trust’s consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of income. Please refer to Note 31 – Reporting Segments and Related Information for further information.\nNote 3 – \nFair Value Measurements\nFair value under GAAP is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.\nFair Value Hierarchy.\n The following describes the hierarchy of valuation inputs (Levels 1, 2, and 3) used to measure fair value and the primary valuation methodologies used by Northern Trust for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity; unobservable inputs reflect the entity’s own assumptions about how market participants would value an asset or liability based on the best information available. GAAP requires an entity measuring fair value to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs and establishes a fair value hierarchy of inputs. Financial instruments are categorized within the hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to their valuation. Northern Trust’s policy is to recognize transfers into and transfers out of fair value levels as of the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred. No transfers into or out of Level 3 occurred during the years ended December 31, 2024, or 2023.\nLevel 1 – Quoted, active market prices for identical assets or liabilities.\n Northern Trust’s Level 1 assets are comprised primarily of AFS investments in U.S. Treasury securities.\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.\n Northern Trust’s Level 2 assets include AFS debt securities, the fair values of which are determined predominantly by external pricing vendors. Prices received from vendors are compared to other vendor and third-party prices. If a security price obtained from a pricing vendor is determined to exceed pre-determined tolerance levels that are assigned based on an asset type’s characteristics, the exception is researched and, if the price is not able to be validated, an alternate pricing vendor is utilized, consistent with Northern Trust’s pricing source hierarchy. As of December 31, 2024, Northern Trust’s AFS debt securities portfolio included \n940\n Level 2 securities with an aggregate market value of $\n21.6\n billion. All \n940\n debt securities were valued by external pricing vendors. As of December 31, 2023, Northern Trust’s AFS debt securities portfolio included \n929\n Level 2 debt securities with an aggregate market value of $\n19.5\n billion. All \n929\n debt securities were valued by external pricing vendors. \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n105\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNorthern Trust has established processes and procedures to assess the suitability of valuation methodologies used by external pricing vendors, including reviews of valuation techniques and assumptions used for selected securities. On a daily basis, periodic quality control reviews of prices received from vendors are conducted which include comparisons to prices on similar security types received from multiple pricing vendors and to the previous day’s reported prices for each security. Predetermined tolerance level exceptions are researched and may result in additional validation through available market information or the use of an alternate pricing vendor. Quarterly, Northern Trust reviews documentation from third-party pricing vendors regarding the valuation processes and assumptions used in their valuations and assesses whether the fair value levels assigned by Northern Trust to each security classification are appropriate. Annually, third-party pricing vendor valuations are reviewed on a sample basis. The specific inputs and assumptions used by third-party pricing vendors are assessed to verify appropriate classification within the fair value level hierarchy.\nLevel 2 assets and liabilities also include derivative contracts which are valued internally using widely accepted income-based models that incorporate inputs readily observable in actively quoted markets and reflect the contractual terms of the contracts. Observable inputs include foreign exchange rates and interest rates for foreign exchange contracts; interest rates for interest rate swap contracts and forward contracts; and interest rates and volatility inputs for interest rate option contracts. Northern Trust evaluates the impact of counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk on the valuation of its derivative instruments. Factors considered include the likelihood of default by Northern Trust and its counterparties, the remaining maturities of the instruments, net exposures after giving effect to master netting arrangements or similar agreements, available collateral, and other credit enhancements in determining the appropriate fair value of derivative instruments. The resulting valuation adjustments have not been considered material.\nVisa Class C common shares are also categorized as Level 2 assets and are valued using quoted active market prices for similar securities (Visa Class A common shares). See “Visa Class B Common Shares and Makewhole Agreement” under Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” for further information.\nLevel 3 – Valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace.\n \nNorthern Trust’s Level 3 liabilities consist of swaps that Northern Trust entered into with the purchaser of \n1.1\n million and \n1.0\n million shares of Visa Class B common shares previously held by Northern Trust and sold in June 2016 and 2015, respectively. Pursuant to the swaps, Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into shares of Visa Class A common shares, such that the counterparty will be compensated for any dilutive adjustments to the conversion ratio and Northern Trust will be compensated for any anti-dilutive adjustments to the ratio. The swaps also require periodic payments from Northern Trust to the counterparty calculated by reference to the market price of Visa Class A common shares and a fixed rate of interest. The fair value of the swaps is determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement are Northern Trust’s own assumptions about estimated changes in the conversion rate of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares, the date on which such conversion is expected to occur and the estimated appreciation of the Visa Class A common share price. See “Visa Class B Common Shares and Makewhole Agreement” under Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” for further information.\nNorthern Trust believes its valuation methods for its assets and liabilities carried at fair value are appropriate; however, the use of different methodologies or assumptions, particularly as applied to Level 3 assets and liabilities, could have a material effect on the computation of their estimated fair values.\nManagement of various businesses and departments of Northern Trust (including Corporate Market Risk, Credit Risk Management, Corporate Finance, Asset Servicing and Wealth Management) reviews valuation methods and models for Level 3 assets and liabilities. Fair value measurements are performed upon acquisitions of an asset or liability. Management of the appropriate business or department reviews assumed inputs, especially when unobservable in the marketplace, in order to substantiate their use in each fair value measurement. When appropriate, management reviews forecasts used in the valuation process considering other relevant financial projections to understand any variances between current and previous fair value measurements. In certain circumstances, third-party information is used to support the fair value measurements. If certain third-party information seems inconsistent with consensus views, a review of the information is performed by management of the respective business or department to determine the appropriate fair value of the asset or liability.\n106\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the fair values of Northern Trust’s Level 3 liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as well as the valuation techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and quantitative information used to develop significant unobservable inputs for such liabilities as of such dates. \nTABLE 46: LEVEL 3 SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENT\nFAIR VALUE\nVALUATION TECHNIQUE\nUNOBSERVABLE INPUTS\nINPUT VALUES\nWEIGHTED-AVERAGE INPUT VALUES\n(1)\nSwaps Related to Sale of Certain Visa Class B Common Shares\n$\n27.2\n million\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nConversion Rate\n1.54\nx\n1.54\nx\nVisa Class A Appreciation\n8.66\n%\n8.66\n%\nExpected Duration\n10\n-\n32.5\n months\n23.5\n months\n(1) \nWeighted average of expected duration based on scenario probability.\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENT\nFAIR VALUE\nVALUATION TECHNIQUE\nUNOBSERVABLE INPUTS\nINPUT VALUES\nWEIGHTED-AVERAGE INPUT VALUES\n(1)\nSwaps Related to Sale of Certain Visa Class B Common Shares\n$\n25.4\n million\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nConversion Rate\n1.59\nx\n1.59\nx\nVisa Class A Appreciation\n10.49\n%\n10.49\n%\nExpected Duration\n9\n-\n27\n months\n13\n months\n(1) \nWeighted average of expected duration based on scenario probability.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n107\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following presents assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, segregated by fair value hierarchy level.\nTABLE 47: RECURRING BASIS HIERARCHY LEVELING \nDECEMBER 31, 2024\n(In Millions)\nLEVEL 1\nLEVEL 2\nLEVEL 3\nNETTING\nASSETS/\nLIABILITIES\nAT FAIR\nVALUE\nDebt Securities\nAvailable for Sale\nU.S. Government\n$\n7,367.5\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7,367.5\n \nObligations of States and Political Subdivisions\n—\n \n297.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n297.6\n \nGovernment Sponsored Agency\n—\n \n13,288.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \n13,288.9\n \nNon-U.S. Government\n—\n \n296.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n296.8\n \nCorporate Debt\n—\n \n163.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n163.8\n \nCovered Bonds\n—\n \n230.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \n230.9\n \nSub-Sovereign, Supranational and Non-U.S. Agency Bonds\n—\n \n4,583.1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4,583.1\n \nOther Asset-Backed\n—\n \n2,182.7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,182.7\n \nCommercial Mortgage-Backed\n—\n \n590.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n590.2\n \nTotal Available for Sale\n7,367.5\n \n21,634.0\n \n—\n \n—\n \n29,001.5\n \nOther Assets\nEquity Securities\n(1)\n85.0\n \n26.3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n111.3\n \nDerivative Assets\nForeign Exchange Contracts\n—\n \n4,997.3\n \n—\n \n(\n1,745.2\n)\n3,252.1\n \nInterest Rate Contracts\n—\n \n361.2\n \n—\n \n(\n165.2\n)\n196.0\n \nTotal Derivative Assets\n—\n \n5,358.5\n \n—\n \n(\n1,910.4\n)\n3,448.1\n \nOther Liabilities\nDerivative Liabilities\nForeign Exchange Contracts\n—\n \n4,709.8\n \n—\n \n(\n4,197.3\n)\n512.5\n \nInterest Rate Contracts\n—\n \n421.4\n \n—\n \n(\n2.3\n)\n419.1\n \nOther Financial Derivatives\n(2)\n—\n \n—\n \n27.2\n \n—\n \n27.2\n \nTotal Derivative Liabilities\n$\n—\n \n$\n5,131.2\n \n$\n27.2\n \n$\n(\n4,199.6\n)\n$\n958.8\n \nNote: Northern Trust has elected to net derivative assets and liabilities when legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist between Northern Trust and the counterparty.

Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2023, also includes other real estate owned (OREO) properties, categorized as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy. \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n109\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFair values of real estate loan collateral were estimated using a market approach typically supported by third-party valuations and property-specific fees and taxes. As of December 31, 2024, the fair values of real estate loan collateral were subject to adjustments to reflect management’s judgment as to realizable value and consisted of a discount factor of \n20.0\n% with a weighted average based on fair values of \n20.0\n%. As of December 31, 2023, the fair value of real estate loan collateral consisted of discount factors ranging from \n0.0\n% to \n20.0\n% with a weighted average based on fair values of \n2.0\n%. Other loan collateral, which typically consists of accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, is valued using a market approach adjusted for asset-specific characteristics and in limited instances third-party valuations are used. OREO assets are carried at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated costs to sell, with fair value typically based on third-party appraisals.\nCollateral-dependent nonaccrual loans that have been adjusted to fair value totaled $\n19.1\n million and $\n43.3\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe following table presents the fair values of Northern Trust’s Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, as well as the valuation technique, significant unobservable inputs, and quantitative information used to develop the significant unobservable inputs for such assets as of such dates.\nTABLE 49: LEVEL 3 NONRECURRING BASIS SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS \n \nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENT\nFAIR VALUE\n(1)\nVALUATION \nTECHNIQUE\nUNOBSERVABLE INPUTS\nINPUT VALUES\nWEIGHTED-AVERAGE INPUT VALUES\nLoans\n19.1\n million\nMarket Approach\nDiscount factor applied to real estate collateral-dependent\n \nloans to reflect realizable value\n20.0\n%\n20.0\n%\n(1)\n Includes real estate collateral-dependent loans and other collateral-dependent loans.\n \nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENT\nFAIR VALUE\n(1)\nVALUATION \nTECHNIQUE\nUNOBSERVABLE INPUTS\nINPUT VALUES\nWEIGHTED-AVERAGE INPUT VALUES\nLoans\n$\n43.3\n million\nMarket Approach\nDiscount factor applied to real estate collateral-dependent loans to reflect realizable value\n0.0\n%\n–\n20.0\n%\n2.0\n%\n(1)\n Includes real estate collateral-dependent loans and other collateral-dependent loans.\n110\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following tables presents the carrying value and estimated fair value, including the fair value hierarchy level, of Northern Trust’s financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.

STATEMENTS\nCredit Quality.\n AFS debt securities impairment reviews are conducted quarterly to identify and evaluate securities that have indications of possible credit losses. A determination as to whether a security’s decline in market value is related to credit impairment takes into consideration numerous factors and the relative significance of any single factor can vary by security. Factors Northern Trust considers in determining whether impairment is credit-related include, but are not limited to, the severity of the impairment; the cause of the impairment; the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer; activity in the market of the issuer, which may indicate adverse credit conditions; Northern Trust’s intent regarding the sale of the security as of the balance sheet date; and the likelihood that Northern Trust will not be required to sell the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of the security’s amortized cost basis. For each security meeting the requirements of Northern Trust’s internal screening process, an extensive review is conducted to determine if a credit loss has occurred.\nThere was a $\n0.2\n million allowance for credit losses for AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2024,  reflecting a $\n1.0\n million release from December 31, 2023. There was a $\n1.2\n million allowance for credit losses for AFS securities for the year ended December 31, 2023, reflecting a $\n0.1\n million release from December 31, 2022. The process for identifying credit losses for AFS securities is based on the best estimate of cash flows to be collected from the security, discounted using the security’s effective interest rate. If the present value of the expected cash flows is found to be less than the current amortized cost of the security, an allowance for credit losses is generally recorded equal to the difference between the two amounts, limited to the amount the amortized cost basis exceeds the fair value of the security.

There were \nno\n loans sold during the year ended December 31, 2024. There was a $\n2.5\n million commercial real estate loan sold during the year ended December 31, 2023.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n117\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCredit Quality Indicators.\n Credit quality indicators are statistics, measurements or other metrics that provide information regarding the relative credit risk of loans. Northern Trust uses a variety of credit quality indicators to assess the credit risk of loans at the segment, class, and individual credit exposure levels.\nAs part of its credit process, Northern Trust utilizes an internal borrower risk rating system to support identification, approval, and monitoring of credit risk. Borrower risk ratings are used in credit underwriting and management reporting. Risk ratings are used for ranking the credit risk of borrowers and their probability of default. Each borrower is rated using one of a number of ratings models or subjective assessment tools, which consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. The ratings models vary among classes of loans in order to capture the unique risk characteristics inherent within each particular type of credit exposure. Provided below are the more significant performance indicator attributes considered within Northern Trust’s borrower rating models, by loan class:\n•\nCommercial and Institutional: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels;\n•\nCommercial Real Estate: debt service coverage, loan-to-collateral value ratio, leasing status and guarantor support;\n•\nCommercial-Other: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, asset size and capital levels;\n•\nNon-U.S.: leverage, profit margin, liquidity, return on assets and capital levels;\n•\nResidential Real Estate: payment history, credit bureau scores and loan-to-collateral value ratio;\n•\nPrivate Client: cash-flow-to-debt and net worth ratios, leverage and liquidity; and\n•\nPersonal-Other: cash-flow-to-debt and net worth ratios.\nWhile the criteria vary by model, the objective is for the borrower ratings to be consistent in both the measurement and ranking of risk. Each model is calibrated to a master rating scale to support this consistency. Ratings for borrowers not in default range from “1” for the strongest credits to “7” for the weakest non-defaulted credits. Ratings of “8” or “9” are used for defaulted borrowers. Borrower risk ratings are monitored and are revised when events or circumstances indicate a change is required. Risk ratings are generally validated at least annually.\nLoans in the “1 to 3” category are expected to exhibit minimal to modest probabilities of default and are characterized by borrowers having the strongest financial qualities, including above average financial flexibility, cash flows and capital levels. Borrowers assigned these ratings are anticipated to experience very little to moderate financial pressure in adverse down-cycle scenarios. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers within this category exhibit a minimal to modest likelihood of loss. Loans in the “4 to 5” category are expected to exhibit moderate to acceptable probabilities of default and are characterized by borrowers with less financial flexibility than those in the “1 to 3” category. Cash flows and capital levels are generally sufficient to allow for borrowers to meet current requirements, but have fewer financial resources to manage through economic downturns. As a result of these characteristics, borrowers within this category exhibit a moderate likelihood of loss. Loans in the “6 to 9” category have elevated credit risk profiles that are monitored through internal watch lists. Borrowers associated with these risk profiles may have limited financial flexibility. Cash flows and capital levels range from acceptable to potentially insufficient to meet current requirements, particularly in adverse economic cycles. As a result of these characteristics, these credits, which include all nonaccrual credits, have elevated risk of default or are currently in default. \nLoan segment and class balances as of December 31, 2024 are provided in the following table, segregated by borrower ratings into “1 to 3,” “4 to 5” and “6 to 9” (watch list and nonaccrual status) categories by year of origination at amortized cost basis. Loans that are held for investment are reported at the principal amount outstanding, net of unearned income.\n118\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Northern Trust held foreclosed real estate properties with an immaterial carrying value for both years as a result of obtaining physical possession. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, Northern Trust had loans with a carrying value of $\n3.5\n million for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n121\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLoan Modifications to Borrowers Experiencing Financial Difficulty\nNorthern Trust may provide payment relief by modifying the terms of the original loans for borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty involve primarily extension of term, deferrals of principal and interest, interest rate concessions, and other modifications or a combination thereof and totaled $\n7.2\n million and $\n40.7\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Northern Trust considers payment deferrals of less than 90 days as insignificant, absent any material modifications to other loan terms. \nThe effectiveness of Northern Trust’s modification efforts is measured by the loans’ respective past-due status under the modified terms as of the end of the period. As of December 31, 2024, of loans that were modified in the previous 12 months, there were \nno\n loans 30-89 days past due and $\n1.3\n million 90 days and greater past due in accordance with their modified terms. As of December 31, 2023, of the loans that were modified in the previous 12 months, there were $\n4.7\n million 30-89 days past due and $\n16.2\n million 90 days and greater past due in accordance with their modified terms.  Northern Trust charged off $\n8.5\n million and $\n2.0\n million related to loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThere were no undrawn loan commitments or standby letters of credit issued to financially distressed borrowers for which Northern Trust had modified the payment terms of the loans as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nNote 6 – \nAllowance for Credit Losses\nAllowance and Provision for Credit Losses.\n \nThe allowance for credit losses—which represents management’s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses related to various portfolios subject to credit risk, off-balance sheet credit exposures, and specific borrower relationships—is determined by management through a disciplined credit review process. Northern Trust measures expected credit losses of financial assets with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis. A financial asset is measured individually if it does not share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets and the related allowance is determined through an individual evaluation.\nManagement’s estimates utilized in establishing an appropriate level of allowance for credit losses are not dependent on any single assumption. In determining an appropriate allowance level, management evaluates numerous variables and takes into consideration past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The primary forecast reflects an outlook of steady growth, with interest rate cuts continuing as inflation and unemployment rates stabilize. An alternative scenario is also considered, which reflects a recession that incorporates the experiences of a wider set of historical economic cycles.\nThe results of the credit reserve estimation methodology are reviewed quarterly by Northern Trust’s Credit Loss Reserve Committee, which receives input from Financial Risk Management, Treasury, Corporate Finance, the Economic Research Department, and each of Northern Trust’s reporting business units. The Credit Loss Reserve Committee determines the probability weights applied to each forecast approved by Northern Trust’s Macroeconomic Scenario Development Committee, as well as, reviews and approves qualitative adjustments to the collective allowance in line with Northern Trust’s qualitative adjustment framework. \nMaterial qualitative adjustments in 2024 relate to a higher likelihood of a recession within the CRE portfolio due to continued concerns around office occupancy rates and high interest rates, the potential impact of climate-related risks on underlying property values within the CRE and RRE portfolios, and the potential for higher-than-expected losses on large individual exposures. Relative to the quantitative reserve, the qualitative component increased slightly year-over-year, primarily due to higher adjustments related to the CRE portfolio. \nThe following table provides information regarding changes in the total allowance for credit losses.\nTABLE 60: CHANGES IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES\n2024\n(In Millions)\nLOANS\nUNDRAWN LOAN COMMITMENTS AND STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT\nHELD TO MATURITY DEBT SECURITIES\nOTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS\nTOTAL\nBalance at Beginning of Period\n$\n178.7\n \n$\n26.9\n \n$\n12.7\n \n$\n0.9\n \n$\n219.2\n \nCharge-Offs\n(\n15.5\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n15.5\n)\nRecoveries\n4.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4.2\n \nNet Recoveries (Charge-Offs)\n(\n11.3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n11.3\n)\nProvision for Credit Losses\n(1)\n0.6\n \n3.5\n \n(\n6.2\n)\n0.1\n \n(\n2.0\n)\nBalance at End of Period\n$\n168.0\n \n$\n30.4\n \n$\n6.5\n \n$\n1.0\n \n$\n205.9\n \n(1)\n \nThe table excludes a negative provision for credit losses of $\n1.0\n million for the year ended December 31, 2024 for AFS debt securities.

The negative provision in 2024 was due to decreases in both individual and collective reserves. The decrease in individual reserves was driven by one commercial loan charge-off. The decrease in collective reserves related primarily to the HTM debt securities portfolio and was driven by methodology updates and changes in portfolio quality, partially offset by an increase in the reserve for the CRE portfolio, due to changes in portfolio quality during the year.

Northern Trust’s portfolio is composed mostly of institutions within the “1 to 3” internal borrower rating category and is expected to exhibit minimal to modest likelihood of loss. The Allowance for Credit Losses related to other financial assets was $\n1.0\n million and $\n0.9\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAccrued Interest. \nAccrued interest balances are reported within Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Northern Trust elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables related to its loans and securities portfolios as its policy is to write-off uncollectible accrued interest receivable balances in a timely manner. Accrued interest is written off by reversing interest income during the period the financial asset is moved from an accrual to a nonaccrual status.\nThe following table provides the amount of accrued interest excluded from the amortized cost basis of the following portfolios.\nTABLE 64: ACCRUED INTEREST\n(In Millions)\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nLoans\n$\n211.7\n \n$\n241.7\n \nDebt Securities\nHeld to Maturity\n58.9\n \n72.0\n \nAvailable for Sale\n173.9\n \n129.2\n \nOther Financial Assets\n53.1\n \n86.0\n \nTotal\n$\n497.6\n \n$\n528.9\n \nThe amount of accrued interest reversed through interest income for loans and securities was immaterial and there was no accrued interest reversed through interest income related to any other financial assets during the years ended 2024 and 2023.\nNote 7 – \nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nConcentrations of credit risk exist if a number of borrowers or other counterparties are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic characteristics that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The fact that a credit exposure falls into one of these groups does not necessarily indicate that the credit has a higher than normal degree of credit risk. These groups are: banks and bank holding companies, residential real estate, and commercial real estate.\nBanks and Bank Holding Companies.\n At December 31, 2024, on-balance sheet credit risk to banks and bank holding companies, both U.S. and non-U.S., consisted primarily of Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks of $\n1.9\n billion, demand balances maintained at correspondent banks of $\n4.7\n billion and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell of $\n426.0\n million. At December 31, 2023, on-balance sheet credit risk to banks and bank holding companies, both U.S. and non-U.S., consisted primarily of Interest-Bearing Deposits with Banks of $\n1.9\n billion, demand balances maintained at correspondent banks of $\n4.7\n billion, and Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell of $\n784.7\n million. Credit risk associated with U.S. and non-U.S. banks and bank holding companies deemed to be counterparties by Credit Risk Management is managed by the Capital Markets Credit Committee. Credit limits are established through a review process that includes an internally-prepared financial analysis, use of an internal risk rating system, and consideration of external market indicators as well as regulatory single counterparty credit limits. Northern Trust places deposits with banks that have strong internal and external credit ratings, and the average life to maturity of deposits with banks is maintained on a short-term basis in order to respond quickly to changing credit conditions.\nResidential Real Estate. \nResidential real estate loans totaled $\n6.1\n billion at December 31, 2024 and $\n6.3\n billion at December 31, 2023, representing \n15\n% and \n14\n%, respectively, of total U.S. loans. Residential real estate loans consist of traditional first lien mortgages and equity credit lines, which generally require a loan-to-collateral value ratio of \n65\n% to \n80\n% at inception. Revaluations of supporting collateral are obtained upon refinancing or default or when otherwise considered warranted. Collateral revaluations for mortgages are performed by independent third parties. Legally binding undrawn commitments to extend residential real estate credit, which are primarily equity credit lines, totaled $\n679.5\n million and $\n804.2\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe table below provides additional detail regarding residential real estate loans by geographic region. \n126\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTABLE 65: RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS BY GEOGRAPHIC REGION\nDECEMBER 31,\n(In Millions)\n2024\n2023\nResidential Real Estate by geographic region:\nFlorida\n$\n1,636.5\n \n$\n1,648.1\n \nCalifornia\n1,371.9\n \n1,463.8\n \nIllinois\n591.3\n \n640.3\n \nNew York\n510.8\n \n505.4\n \nColorado\n309.9\n \n344.1\n \nTexas\n308.7\n \n318.7\n \nAll other\n(1)\n1,380.8\n \n1,406.7\n \nTotal Residential Real Estate\n$\n6,109.9\n \n$\n6,327.1\n \n(1) \nThe remainder is distributed throughout the other geographic regions within the U.S. served by Northern Trust.\nCommercial Real Estate.\n Commercial real estate loans totaled $\n5.3\n billion at December 31, 2024 and $\n5.1\n billion at December 31, 2023, representing \n13\n% and \n12\n%, respectively, of total U.S. loans. In managing its credit exposure, management has defined a commercial real estate loan as one where: (1) the borrower’s principal business activity is the acquisition or the development of real estate for commercial purposes; (2) the principal collateral is real estate held for commercial purposes, and loan repayment is expected to flow from the operation of the property; or (3) the loan repayment is expected to flow from the sale or refinance of real estate as a normal and ongoing part of the business. The commercial real estate portfolio consists of commercial mortgages and construction, acquisition and development loans extended primarily to experienced investors well known to Northern Trust. \nUnderwriting standards generally reflect conservative loan-to-collateral value (LTV) ratios and debt service coverage requirements. LTV ratios, calculated as the outstanding amount of the loan divided by the estimated value of the property, are a critical component of Northern Trust’s underwriting standards. Northern Trust utilizes LTV ratios in various stages of the lending and risk management process. Northern Trust’s policy related to LTV limits is more conservative than what is prescribed by current supervisory regulations. LTV ratios are monitored and updated on a quarterly basis utilizing the most recent outstanding amounts and appraisal values based on models, automated valuation services, or updated appraisals. \nAll commercial real estate transactions, regardless of size, require an independent appraisal at loan origination, unless permissible and approved regulatory exemptions can be applied. Real estate appraisals are, at a minimum, performed in accordance with generally accepted appraisal standards as applicable under local regulations. Northern Trust considers obtaining a new appraisal as part of the loan renewal process or whenever credit quality or market conditions have materially and adversely changed to the point where it is prudent to reassess the value of the real estate collateral. For defaulted loans, appraisals are updated on an, at least, annual basis. Appraisal values might be discounted based upon Northern Trust’s experience with actual  liquidation values and management’s judgement as to the realizable value of the property.\nRecourse to borrowers through guarantees is also generally required. Commercial mortgage financing is provided for the acquisition or refinancing of income-producing properties. Cash flows from the properties generally are sufficient to amortize the loan. These loans are primarily located in the California, Illinois, Florida, Texas, and New York markets. Construction, acquisition and development loans provide financing for commercial real estate prior to rental income stabilization. The intent is generally that the borrower will sell the project or refinance the loan through a commercial mortgage with Northern Trust or another financial institution upon completion. At December 31, 2024, legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled $\n376.5\n million and $\n81.9\n million, respectively. At December 31, 2023, legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit to commercial real estate borrowers totaled $\n413.0\n million and $\n82.1\n million, respectively.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n127\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe table below provides additional detail regarding commercial real estate loan types. \nTABLE 66: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS \nDECEMBER 31,\n(In Millions)\n2024\n2023\nCommercial Mortgages\nOffice\n$\n944.4\n \n$\n1,035.1\n \nApartment/ Multi-family\n1,599.9\n \n1,633.9\n \nRetail\n665.6\n \n620.9\n \nIndustrial/ Warehouse\n906.1\n \n687.1\n \nOther\n630.3\n \n575.3\n \nTotal Commercial Mortgages\n4,746.3\n \n4,552.3\n \nConstruction, Acquisition and Development Loans\n567.9\n \n581.9\n \nTotal Commercial Real Estate Loans\n$\n5,314.2\n \n$\n5,134.2\n \nNote 8 – \nBuildings and Equipment\nA summary of Buildings and Equipment is presented in the following table.\nTABLE 67: BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\n(In Millions)\nORIGINAL\nCOST\nACCUMULATED\nDEPRECIATION\nNET BOOK\nVALUE\nLand and Improvements\n$\n11.5\n \n$\n0.3\n \n$\n11.2\n \nBuildings\n226.5\n \n143.4\n \n83.1\n \nEquipment\n539.6\n \n343.4\n \n196.2\n \nLeasehold Improvements\n553.5\n \n353.7\n \n199.8\n \nTotal Buildings and Equipment\n$\n1,331.1\n \n$\n840.8\n \n$\n490.3\n \nDECEMBER 31, 2023\n(In Millions)\nORIGINAL\nCOST\nACCUMULATED\nDEPRECIATION\nNET BOOK\nVALUE\nLand and Improvements\n$\n11.5\n \n$\n0.3\n \n$\n11.2\n \nBuildings\n253.1\n \n141.4\n \n111.7\n \nEquipment\n536.5\n \n337.5\n \n199.0\n \nLeasehold Improvements\n530.0\n \n349.7\n \n180.3\n \nTotal Buildings and Equipment\n$\n1,331.1\n \n$\n828.9\n \n$\n502.2\n \nThe charge for depreciation amounted\n \nto $\n110.0\n million in 2024, $\n115.9\n million in 2023, and $\n110.1\n million in 2022 on the consolidated statements of income.\nNote 9 – \nLease Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2024, Northern Trust was obligated under a number of non-cancelable operating leases, primarily for real estate. Certain leases contain rent escalation clauses based on market indices, renewal option clauses calling for increased rentals, and rental payments based on usage. There are no restrictions imposed by any lease agreement regarding the payment of dividends, debt financing or Northern Trust entering into further lease agreements.\nThe components of lease costs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows.\nTABLE 68: LEASE COST COMPONENTS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, \n(In Millions)\n2024\n2023\nOperating Lease Cost\n$\n93.5\n \n$\n109.2\n \nVariable Lease Cost \n(1)\n49.3\n \n54.7\n \nSublease Income\n(\n3.0\n)\n(\n2.7\n)\nTotal Lease Cost\n$\n139.8\n \n$\n161.2\n \n(1) \nVariable Lease Cost includes rental payments based on usage, common-area maintenance costs and property taxes.\n128\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents a maturity analysis of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2024.\nTABLE 69: MATURITY OF LEASE LIABILITIES\n(In Millions)\nMATURITY OF LEASE LIABILITIES\n2025\n$\n105.0\n \n2026\n90.8\n \n2027\n89.1\n \n2028\n76.3\n \n2029\n61.0\n \nLater Years\n349.5\n \nTotal Lease Payments\n771.7\n \nLess: Imputed Interest\n(\n122.9\n)\nPresent Value of Lease Liabilities\n$\n648.8\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, Northern Trust had a commitment for an operating lease in addition to the above that has not yet commenced for approximately $\n5.8\n million. The operating lease is for the use of office space with a lease term of \n10\n years and is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2025.\nNorthern Trust uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of lease payments for operating leases. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities may include options to extend or terminate the lease only when it is reasonably certain that Northern Trust will exercise that option. Northern Trust elects not to separate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. \nThe location and amount of ROU assets and lease liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are presented in the following table.\nTABLE 70: LOCATION AND AMOUNT OF LEASE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\n \n(In Millions)\nLOCATION OF LEASE ASSETS AND LEASE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nAssets\nOperating Lease Right-of-Use Asset\nOther Assets\n$\n478.0\n \n$\n522.8\n \nLiabilities\nOperating Lease Liability\nOther Liabilities\n$\n648.8\n \n$\n692.8\n \nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and weighted-average discount rate applied to leases as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nTABLE 71: WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING LEASE TERM AND DISCOUNT RATE\n \nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nOperating Leases\n     Weighted-Average Remaining Lease Term\n9.7\n years\n10.1\n years\n     Weighted-Average Discount Rate\n3.4\n \n%\n3.3\n \n%\nThe following table provides supplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTABLE 72: SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION\n \nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, \n(In Millions)\n2024\n2023\nSupplemental cash flow information\n     Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities - operating cash flows\n$\n94.5\n \n$\n91.4\n \nSupplemental non-cash information\n     Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities\n$\n36.5\n \n$\n122.6\n \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n129\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 10 – \nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill.\n \nChanges by reporting segment in the carrying amount of Goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, including the effect of foreign exchange rates on non-U.S.-dollar denominated balances, were as follows.\nTABLE 73: GOODWILL \n(In Millions)\nASSET SERVICING\nWEALTH\nMANAGEMENT\nTOTAL\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n611.0\n \n$\n80.3\n \n$\n691.3\n \nForeign Exchange Rates\n10.9\n \n0.1\n \n11.0\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n621.9\n \n$\n80.4\n \n$\n702.3\n \nForeign Exchange Rates\n(\n7.3\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\n(\n7.4\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n614.6\n \n$\n80.3\n \n$\n694.9\n \nThe goodwill impairment test is performed at least annually at the reporting-unit level.

Impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. Based upon the quantitative assessments, there were no impairments to goodwill in 2024.\nOther Intangible Assets Subject to Amortization.\n \nThe gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of other intangible assets subject to amortization as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows.\nTABLE 74: OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSSETS SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION\nDECEMBER 31,\n(In Millions)\n2024\n2023\nGross Carrying Amount\n$\n127.0\n \n$\n135.0\n \nLess: Accumulated Amortization\n68.9\n \n63.4\n \nNet Book Value\n$\n58.1\n \n$\n71.6\n \nTABLE 75: CHANGES IN OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n(In Millions)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n77.6\n \nAmortization\n(\n9.3\n)\nForeign Exchange Rates\n3.3\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n71.6\n \nAmortization\n(\n9.2\n)\nForeign Exchange Rates\n(\n4.3\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n58.1\n \nOther intangible assets consist primarily of the value of acquired client relationships and are included in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.

Effective February 27, 2023, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve adopted a final rule to implement the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the “LIBOR Act”). The final rule establishes benchmark replacements for contracts governed by U.S. law that reference certain tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR after June 30, 2023. Pursuant to the final rule, three-month LIBOR will be replaced by the three-month CME Term SOFR Reference Rate, as administered by CME Group Benchmark Administration, Ltd. (“three-month CME Term SOFR”) plus the statutory spread adjustment of 0.26161% as set forth in the final rule. As a result, from, and including, May 8, 2027, the subordinated notes will bear interest at an annual rate equal to three-month CME Term SOFR plus 0.26161% plus \n1.131\n%, payable quarterly in arrears. The subordinated notes are unsecured and may be redeemed, in whole but not in part, on, and only on, May 8, 2027, at a redemption price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the subordinated notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the redemption date. \n(3) \nRedeemable within three months of maturity.\nNote 13 – \nStockholders’ Equity\nPreferred Stock.\n The Corporation is authorized to issue \n10\n million shares of preferred stock without par value.

the unrealized gains (losses) amortization on AFS debt securities that were transferred to HTM debt securities during the second quarter of 2021 and third quarter of 2022.  Upon transfer of a debt security from the AFS to HTM classification, the amortized cost is reset to fair value. Any net unrealized gain or loss at the date of transfer will remain in AOCI and be amortized into Net Interest Income over the remaining life of the securities using the effective interest method. The amortization of amounts retained in AOCI will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from transferring the securities at fair value.\n(2) \nThe net losses on AFS debt securities before-tax reclassification adjustment is recorded in Investment Security Gains (Losses), net on the consolidated statements of income.

Investment Management and Advisory income contains revenue received from providing asset management and related services to Wealth Management and Asset Servicing clients and to Northern Trust sponsored funds. Securities Lending income represents revenues generated from securities lending arrangements that Northern Trust enters into as agent, mainly with Asset Servicing clients. Other fees largely consists of revenues received from providing employee benefit, investment risk and analytic and other services to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients.\nOther Noninterest Income.\n Treasury Management income represents revenues received from providing cash and liquidity management services to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients. The portion of Security Commissions and Trading Income that relates to revenue from contracts with clients is primarily comprised of commissions earned from providing securities brokerage services to Wealth Management and Asset Servicing clients. The portion of Other Operating Income that relates to revenue from contracts with clients is mainly comprised of service fees for banking-related services provided to Wealth Management and Asset Servicing clients.\nPerformance Obligations. \nClients are typically charged monthly or quarterly in arrears based on the fee arrangement agreed to with each client; payment terms will vary depending on the client and services offered.\nSubstantially all revenues generated from contracts with clients for asset servicing, asset management, securities lending, treasury management and banking-related services are recognized on an accrual basis, over the period in which services are provided. The nature of Northern Trust’s performance obligations is to provide a series of distinct services in which the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the promised services as they are performed. Fee arrangements are mainly comprised of variable amounts based on market value of client assets managed and serviced, transaction volumes, number of accounts, and securities lending volume and spreads. Revenue is recognized using the output method in an amount that reflects the consideration to which Northern Trust expects to be entitled in exchange for providing each month or quarter of service. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, revenue is allocated to each performance obligation based on the price agreed to with the client, representing its relative standalone selling price.\nSecurity brokerage revenue is primarily represented by securities commissions received in exchange for providing trade execution related services. Control is transferred at a point in time, on the trade date of the transaction, and fees are typically variable based on transaction volumes and security types.\n136\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNorthern Trust’s contracts with its clients are typically open-ended arrangements and are therefore considered to have an original duration of less than one year.

A cumulative valuation allowance related to the credit carryforward of $\n157.5\n million and $\n120.7\n million was recorded at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as management believes the foreign tax credit carryforwards will not be fully realized.\nNorthern Trust had various state net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The income tax benefits associated with these loss carryforwards were approximately $\n0.4\n million as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023. A valuation allowance related to the loss carryforwards of $\n0.4\n million was recorded at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, as management believes the net operating losses will not be fully realized.\n \nNote 21 – \nEmployee Benefits\nThe Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries provide various benefit programs, including defined benefit pension and defined contribution plans. A description of each major plan and related disclosures are provided below.\nPension.\n A noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan covers substantially all U.S. employees of Northern Trust. Employees of certain European subsidiaries retain benefits in local defined benefit plans, although those plans are closed to new participants and to future benefit accruals. Employees continue to accrue benefits under the Swiss pension plan, which is accounted for as a defined benefit plan under U.S. GAAP.\nNorthern Trust also maintains a noncontributory supplemental pension plan for participants whose retirement benefits under the U.S. Qualified Plan are expected to exceed the limits imposed by federal tax law. Northern Trust has a nonqualified trust, referred to as a “Rabbi” Trust, used to hold assets designated for the funding of benefits in excess of those permitted in certain of its qualified retirement plans. This arrangement offers participants a degree of assurance for payment of benefits in excess of those permitted in the related qualified plans. As the “Rabbi” Trust assets remain subject to the claims of creditors and are not the property of the employees, they are accounted for as corporate assets and are included in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Total assets in the “Rabbi” Trust related to the nonqualified pension plan at December 31, 2024 and 2023 amounted to $\n83.3\n million and $\n90.3\n million, respectively.

In the second quarter of 2022, it became probable that total lump-sum payments during the year would exceed the settlement threshold of the sum of annual service and interest cost. Therefore, Northern Trust recognized settlement charges related to its U.S. Qualified Plan in the second, third, and fourth quarter of 2022, which required interim remeasurements of the U.S. Qualified Plan as of each respective quarter-end. The settlement charge represents the pro rata amount of the net loss in AOCI that is charged to income based on the proportion of the Projected Benefit Obligation settled to the total Projected Benefit Obligation and amounted to a total of $\n44.1\n million.\nThe components of net periodic pension expense are included in Employee Benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income.\nTABLE 97: CHANGE IN PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION\nU.S. QUALIFIED PLAN\nNON-U.S. PENSION PLANS\nU.S. NON-QUALIFIED PLAN\n(In Millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nBeginning Balance\n$\n1,151.7\n \n$\n1,077.7\n \n$\n148.6\n \n$\n129.0\n \n$\n109.2\n \n$\n113.6\n \nService Cost\n53.6\n \n46.0\n \n1.9\n \n1.6\n \n4.7\n \n4.8\n \nInterest Cost\n55.6\n \n53.9\n \n4.5\n \n4.8\n \n5.0\n \n5.3\n \nEmployee Contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n0.8\n \n0.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPlan Amendment\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.4\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nActuarial Loss (Gain) \n(\n60.9\n)\n36.8\n \n(\n11.9\n)\n8.1\n \n(\n0.8\n)\n8.4\n \nSettlements\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1.7\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nBenefits Paid\n(\n61.0\n)\n(\n62.7\n)\n(\n4.3\n)\n(\n4.1\n)\n(\n14.3\n)\n(\n22.9\n)\nForeign Exchange Rate Changes\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n6.8\n)\n8.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEnding Balance\n$\n1,139.0\n \n$\n1,151.7\n \n$\n130.7\n \n$\n148.6\n \n$\n103.8\n \n$\n109.2\n \nActuarial gains of $\n73.6\n million in 2024 were primarily caused by increases in discount rates, while actuarial losses of $\n53.3\n million in 2023 were primarily caused by decreases in discount rates.\nTABLE 98: ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS\n(In Millions)\nU.S. QUALIFIED PLAN\nNON-U.S.PENSION PLANS\nU.S. NON-QUALIFIED PLAN\n2025\n$\n101.2\n \n$\n4.7\n \n$\n16.2\n \n2026\n102.6\n \n5.0\n \n13.8\n \n2027\n104.0\n \n6.1\n \n11.7\n \n2028\n102.4\n \n6.6\n \n11.2\n \n2029\n101.7\n \n5.7\n \n11.8\n \n2030-2034\n509.2\n \n35.3\n \n50.6\n \nTABLE 99: CHANGE IN PLAN ASSETS \nU.S. QUALIFIED PLAN\nNON-U.S PENSION PLANS\n(In Millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nFair Value of Assets at Beginning of Period\n$\n1,200.8\n \n$\n1,176.8\n \n$\n148.7\n \n$\n134.5\n \nActual Return on Assets\n(\n1.7\n)\n86.8\n \n(\n1.2\n)\n5.0\n \nEmployer Contributions\n200.0\n \n—\n \n4.0\n \n3.9\n \nEmployee Contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n0.8\n \n0.8\n \nSettlements\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1.7\n)\n—\n \nBenefits Paid\n(\n61.0\n)\n(\n62.8\n)\n(\n4.3\n)\n(\n4.1\n)\nForeign Exchange Rate Changes\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n6.5\n)\n8.6\n \nFair Value of Assets at End of Period\n$\n1,338.1\n \n$\n1,200.8\n \n$\n139.8\n \n$\n148.7\n \nThe minimum required and remaining maximum deductible contributions for the U.S. Qualified Plan in 2025 are estimated to be \nzero\n and $\n380.0\n million, respectively. The remaining 2025 maximum deductible contribution, after considering a cash contribution of $\n125.0\n million made to the U.S. Qualified Plan during January 2025, is estimated at $\n255.0\n million. A cash contribution of $\n200.0\n million for the 2024 plan year was made to the U.S. Qualified Plan during January 2024.  \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n143\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe investment strategy employed for Northern Trust’s U.S. Qualified Plan utilizes a dynamic glide path based on a set of pre-approved asset allocations to return-seeking and liability-hedging assets that vary in accordance with the U.S. Qualified Plan’s projected benefit obligation funded ratio. In general, as the U.S. Qualified Plan’s projected benefit obligation funded ratio increases beyond an established threshold, the U.S. Qualified Plan’s allocation to liability-hedging assets will increase while the allocation to return-seeking assets will decrease. Conversely, a decrease in the U.S. Qualified Plan’s projected benefit obligation funded ratio beyond an established threshold will generally result in a decrease in the U.S. Qualified Plan’s allocation to liability-hedging assets and increase in the allocation to return-seeking assets. Liability-hedging assets include U.S. long credit bonds, U.S. long government bonds, and a custom completion strategy used to hedge more closely the liability duration of projected plan benefits with bond duration across all durations. Return-seeking assets include: U.S. equity, international developed equity, emerging markets equity, real estate, high yield bonds, global listed infrastructure, emerging market debt, private\n equity and hedge funds. In early 2023 the asset allocation of the U.S. Qualified Plan was adjusted to a stage of the glide path that allowed for a greater component of return-seeking assets, and was kept consistent throughout 2023 and 2024.\nNorthern Trust utilizes an asset/liability methodology to determine the investment policies that will best meet its short and long-term objectives. The process is performed by modeling current and alternative strategies for asset allocation, funding policy and actuarial methods and assumptions. The financial modeling uses projections of expected capital market returns and expected volatility of those returns to determine alternative asset mixes having the greatest probability of meeting the U.S. Qualified Plan’s investment objectives. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of the U.S. Qualified Plan liabilities, funded status, and corporate financial condition. The intent of this strategy is to protect the U.S. Qualified Plan’s funded status and generate returns, which in combination with voluntary contributions are expected to outpace the U.S. Qualified Plan’s liability growth over the long run.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the target allocation of the U.S. Qualified Plan assets consisted of \n45\n% U.S. long credit bonds, \n20\n% global equities (developed and emerging markets), \n10\n% custom completion, \n5\n% private equity, \n5\n% high yield bonds, \n4\n% emerging market debt, \n4\n% global listed infrastructure, \n4\n% private real estate, and \n3\n% hedge funds. \nGlobal equity investments include common stocks that are listed on an exchange and investments in commingled funds that invest primarily in publicly traded equities. Equity investments are diversified across country, region, investment style and market capitalization. Fixed income securities held include U.S. treasury securities, corporate bonds, and investments in commingled funds that invest in a diversified blend of longer duration fixed income securities; the custom completion strategy uses U.S. treasury securities and interest rate futures (or similar instruments) to align more closely with the target hedge ratio across maturities. Diversifying investments, including private equity, hedge funds, private real estate, emerging market debt, high yield bonds, and global listed infrastructure, are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. Private equity assets consist primarily of investments in limited partnerships that invest in individual companies in the form of non-public equity or non-public debt positions. Direct or co-investment in non-public stock by the U.S. Qualified Plan is prohibited. The U.S. Qualified Plan’s private equity investments are limited to \n20\n% of each of the total limited partnership or fund of funds and the maximum allowable loss cannot exceed the commitment amount. The U.S. Qualified Plan invests in a hedge fund of funds, which invests, either directly or indirectly, in diversified portfolios of funds or other pooled investment vehicles. Investments in private real estate, high yield bonds, emerging market debt, and global listed infrastructure are designed to provide income and added diversification.\nDerivatives may be used, depending on the nature of the asset class to which they relate, to gain market exposure in an efficient and timely manner, to hedge foreign currency exposure or interest rate risk, or to alter the duration of a portfolio. There were \nfour\n fixed income derivatives held by the U.S. Qualified Plan at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nInvestment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through monthly liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies, and quarterly investment portfolio reviews. Standards used to evaluate the U.S. Qualified Plan’s investment manager performance include, but are not limited to, the achievement of objectives, operation within guidelines and policy, and comparison against a benchmark. In addition, each manager of the investment funds held by the U.S. Qualified Plan is ranked against a universe of peers and compared to a benchmark. Total U.S. Qualified Plan performance analysis includes an analysis of the market environment, asset allocation impact on performance, risk and return relative to other ERISA plans, and manager impacts upon U.S. Qualified Plan performance.\nThe following describes the hierarchy of inputs used to measure fair value and the primary valuation methodologies used by Northern Trust for the U.S. Qualified Plan assets measured at fair value.\nLevel 1 – Quoted, active market prices for identical assets or liabilities. \nThe U.S. Qualified Plan’s Level 1 assets are comprised primarily of U.S. treasury securities, mutual funds, and common stocks. The U.S. Qualified Plan’s Level 1 investments that are exchange traded are valued at the closing price reported by the respective exchanges on the day of valuation.\n144\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLevel 2 – Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted active market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets in inactive markets, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets. \nThe U.S. Qualified Plan’s Level 2 assets are comprised of collective trust funds, corporate bonds, non-U.S. government obligations, and municipal and provincial bonds. The investments in collective trust funds fair values are calculated on a scheduled basis using the closing market prices and accruals of securities in the funds (total value of the funds) divided by the number of fund shares currently issued and outstanding. Redemptions of the collective trust funds occur by contract at the respective fund’s redemption date net asset value (NAV). \nLevel 3 – Valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable in the marketplace. \nThe U.S. Qualified Plan did not hold Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nAssets valued at fair value using NAV per share - \nThe U.S. Qualified Plan’s assets valued at fair value using NAV per share include investments in private equity funds and a hedge fund, which invest in underlying groups of investment funds or other pooled investment vehicles that are selected by the respective funds’ investment managers. The investment funds and the underlying investments held by these investment funds are valued at fair value. In determining the fair value of the underlying investments of each fund, the fund’s investment manager or general partner takes into account the estimated value reported by the underlying funds as well as any other considerations that may, in their judgment, increase or decrease such estimated value. The investments in the private equity funds and a hedge fund are considered to be long-term investments. There are no capital withdrawal options related to the investments in the private equity funds. However, capital is periodically distributed as underlying investments are sold. It is estimated that the current private equity investments would be liquidated over \n1\n year to \n15\n years, depending on the vintage year of a particular fund. With \nsixty days\n advance notice, the Plan’s investment in the hedge fund can be withdrawn at the next calendar quarter end.\n \nThe U.S. Qualified Plan’s assets valued at fair value using NAV per share also include investments in real estate funds, which invest in real estate assets. The investment in properties by the real estate funds are carried at fair value, which is estimated based on the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between marketplace participants at the measurement date. The valuation plan for each real estate investment is subject to review on an annual basis which is based on either an external appraisal from appraisal firms or internal valuations prepared by the real estate fund’s investment advisor. The Plan’s investment in real estate funds are considered to be long-term investments and, with \nforty-five days\n advance notice, can be withdrawn at the next calendar quarter end to the extent the real estate funds have liquid assets, as determined at the sole discretion of the fund manager.\nAs investments in the private equity funds, hedge fund, and real estate fund are valued at fair value using NAV per share, they are not required to be categorized within the fair value hierarchy. \nWhile Northern Trust believes its valuation methods for U.S. Qualified Plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could have a material effect on the computation of the estimated fair values.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n145\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the fair values of Northern Trust’s U.S. Qualified Plan assets, by major asset category, and their level within the fair value hierarchy defined by GAAP as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTABLE 100: FAIR VALUE OF U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN ASSETS \nDECEMBER 31, 2024\n(In Millions)\nLEVEL 1\nLEVEL 2\nLEVEL 3\nTOTAL\nDomestic Common Stock\n$\n17.6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n17.6\n \nForeign Common Stock\n0.3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n0.3\n \nDomestic Corporate Bonds\n—\n \n244.9\n \n—\n \n244.9\n \nForeign Corporate Bonds\n—\n \n30.1\n \n—\n \n30.1\n \nU.S. Government Obligations\n58.3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n58.3\n \nNon-U.S. Government Obligations\n—\n \n17.0\n \n—\n \n17.0\n \nDomestic Municipal and Provincial Bonds\n—\n \n14.3\n \n—\n \n14.3\n \nForeign Municipal and Provincial Bonds\n—\n \n0.2\n \n—\n \n0.2\n \nCollective Trust Funds\n—\n \n734.9\n \n—\n \n734.9\n \nMutual Funds\n56.3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n56.3\n \nCash and Other\n(1)\n(\n1.2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1.2\n)\nTotal Assets at Fair Value in the Fair Value Hierarchy\n$\n131.3\n \n$\n1,041.4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,172.7\n \nAssets Valued at NAV per share\nNorthern Trust Private Equity Funds\n53.2\n \nNorthern Trust Hedge Fund\n39.2\n \nReal Estate Funds\n73.0\n \nTotal Assets at Fair Value\n$\n1,338.1\n \n(1)\n Negative balance in Cash and Other as of December 31, 2024 primarily relates to due to broker for securities purchased.\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\n(In Millions)\nLEVEL 1\nLEVEL 2\nLEVEL 3\nTOTAL\nDomestic Common Stock\n$\n16.6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n16.6\n \nForeign Common Stock\n0.3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n0.3\n \nDomestic Corporate Bonds\n—\n \n218.2\n \n—\n \n218.2\n \nForeign Corporate Bonds\n—\n \n33.6\n \n—\n \n33.6\n \nU.S. Government Obligations\n(1)\n87.5\n \n—\n \n—\n \n87.5\n \nNon-U.S. Government Obligations\n—\n \n14.0\n \n—\n \n14.0\n \nDomestic Municipal and Provincial Bonds\n—\n \n17.2\n \n—\n \n17.2\n \nForeign Municipal and Provincial Bonds\n—\n \n0.3\n \n—\n \n0.3\n \nCollective Trust Funds\n—\n \n571.5\n \n—\n \n571.5\n \nMutual Funds\n80.3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n80.3\n \nCash and Other\n(2)\n(\n3.4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n3.4\n)\nTotal Assets at Fair Value in the Fair Value Hierarchy\n$\n181.3\n \n$\n854.8\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,036.1\n \nAssets Valued at NAV per share\nNorthern Trust Private Equity Funds\n45.6\n \nNorthern Trust Hedge Fund\n36.2\n \nReal Estate Funds\n82.9\n \nTotal Assets at Fair Value\n$\n1,200.8\n \n(1)\n Northern Trust reclassified its leveling interpretation for U.S. Government Obligations from Level 2 to Level 1 during 2024 and adjusted 2023 disclosures accordingly.\n(2)\n Negative balance in Cash and Other as of December 31, 2023 primarily relates to the timing of transfers between cash accounts and short-term investment funds presented in Collective Trust Funds.\n146\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA building block approach is employed for Northern Trust’s U.S. Qualified Plan in determining the long-term rate of return for plan assets. Historical markets and long-term historical relationships between equities, fixed income and other asset classes are studied using the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long-run. Current market factors such as inflation expectations and interest rates are evaluated before long-term capital market assumptions are determined. The long-term portfolio rate of return is established with consideration given to diversification and rebalancing. The rate is reviewed against peer data and historical returns to verify the return is reasonable and appropriate. Based on this approach and the U.S. Qualified Plan’s target asset allocation, the expected long-term rate of return on assets as of the U.S. Qualified Plan’s December 31, 2024 measurement date was set at \n7.25\n%.\nDefined Contribution Plans.\n The Corporation and its subsidiaries maintain various defined contribution plans covering substantially all employees. The Corporation’s contribution to the U.S. plan and to certain European-based plans includes a matching component. The expense associated with defined contribution plans is charged to Employee Benefits expense on the consolidated statements of income and totaled $\n78.8\n million in 2024, $\n72.4\n million in 2023, and $\n67.2\n million in 2022.\nNote 22 – \nShare-Based Compensation Plans\nNorthern Trust recognizes as expense the grant-date fair value of share-based compensation granted to employees and non-employee directors as Compensation on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nTotal Compensation expense for share-based compensation arrangements to employees and the associated tax impacts were as follows for the periods presented.\nTABLE 101: TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS TO EMPLOYEES \nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n(In Millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards\n$\n91.4\n \n$\n95.7\n \n$\n96.4\n \nPerformance Stock Units\n28.0\n \n22.5\n \n28.8\n \nTotal Share-Based Compensation Expense\n$\n119.4\n \n$\n118.2\n \n$\n125.2\n \nTax Benefits Recognized\n$\n29.3\n \n$\n29.9\n \n$\n31.4\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $\n93.7\n million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the Corporation’s share-based compensation plans. That cost is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted-average period of approximately \n3\n years.\nThe Northern Trust Corporation 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2017 Plan) is administered by the Human Capital and Compensation Committee (Committee) of the Board of Directors. All employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries and all directors of the Corporation are eligible to receive awards under the 2017 Plan. The 2017 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options; tandem and free-standing stock appreciation rights; stock awards in the form of restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock awards; and performance awards.\nRestricted stock unit and performance stock unit grants continue to vest in accordance with the original terms of the award if the applicable employee retires after satisfying applicable age and service requirements.\nGrants are outstanding under the 2017 Plan, the Northern Trust Corporation 2012 Stock Plan (2012 Plan), and the Amended and Restated Northern Trust Corporation 2002 Stock Plan (2002 Plan). The 2017 Plan was approved by stockholders in April 2017. Upon approval of the 2017 Plan, no additional shares have been or will be granted under the 2012 Plan or 2002 Plan. The total number of shares of the Corporation’s common stock authorized for issuance under the 2017 Plan is \n20,000,000\n plus shares forfeited under the 2012 Plan and 2002 Plan. As of December 31, 2024, shares available for future grant under the 2017 Plan, including shares forfeited under the 2012 Plan and 2002 Plan, totaled \n12,297,075\n.\nThe following describes Northern Trust’s share-based payment arrangements and applies to awards under the 2017 Plan, 2012 Plan and the 2002 Plan, as applicable.\nStock Options.\n Stock options consist of options to purchase common stock of the Corporation at prices not less than \n100\n% of the fair value thereof on the date the options are granted. Options have a maximum \n10\n year life and generally vest and become exercisable in \n1\n year to \n4\n years after the date of grant. All options terminate at such time as determined by the Committee and as provided in the terms and conditions of the respective option grants.

The restricted stock units granted in 2024 predominately vest at a rate equal to \n25\n% per year for \nfour years\n on the first day of the month following the month in which the grant date falls. Restricted stock unit grants totaled \n1,182,007\n, \n1,166,376\n, and \n1,061,573\n, with weighted average grant-date fair values of $\n79.96\n, $\n91.56\n, and $\n110.99\n per share, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

The number of units that will vest are subject to the attainment of specified performance targets that are a function of average return on equity goals and average return on equity performance relative to that of a performance peer group, each measured over a \nthree-year\n period. For performance stock units outstanding as of December 31, 2024, the number of performance stock units that will vest ranges from \n0\n% to \n150\n% of the original award granted based on the achievement of both absolute and relative return on equity goals over a \nthree-year\n period compared to performance targets. Distribution of the shares is then made after vesting. \nPerformance stock unit grants totaled \n262,557\n, \n219,314\n, and \n211,906\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, with weighted average grant-date fair values of $\n79.89\n, $\n93.97\n, and $\n113.64\n. Performance stock units outstanding at target level performance totaled \n675,690\n, \n613,450\n, and \n607,892\n at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Performance stock units had aggregate intrinsic values of $\n69.3\n million, $\n51.8\n million, and $\n53.8\n million, and weighted average remaining vesting terms of \n1.1\n years at December 31, 2024, and \n1.0\n year at December 31, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nNon-employee Director Stock Awards.\n Director stock units with total values of $\n1.5\n million (\n18,220\n units), $\n1.6\n million (\n20,405\n units), and $\n1.6\n million (\n14,773\n units) were granted to non-employee directors in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, which vest or vested on the date of the annual meeting of the Corporation’s stockholders in the following years. Total Compensation expense recognized on these grants was $\n1.6\n million, $\n1.7\n million, and $\n1.7\n million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Stock units granted to non-employee directors do not have voting rights. Each stock unit entitles a director to \none\n share of common stock at vesting, unless a director elects to defer receipt of the shares. Directors may elect to defer the payment of their annual stock unit grant and cash-based compensation until termination of services as director. Deferred cash compensation is converted into stock units representing shares of common stock of the Corporation. Distributions of deferred stock units are made in common stock. For compensation deferred prior to January 1, 2018, distributions of the stock unit accounts that relate to cash-based compensation are made in cash based on the fair value of the stock units at the time of distribution. For compensation deferred on or after January 1, 2018, distributions of the stock unit accounts that relate to cash-based compensation are made in common stock.\nNote 23 – \nCash-Based Compensation Plans\nVarious incentive plans provide for cash incentives and bonuses to selected employees based upon accomplishment of corporate net income objectives, goals of the reporting segments and support functions, and individual performance. The provision for awards under these plans is charged to Compensation expense and totaled $\n381.7\n million in 2024, $\n358.7\n million in 2023, and $\n392.7\n million in 2022.\nNote 24 – \nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\nOff-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments, Guarantees and Other Commitments. \nNorthern Trust, in the normal course of business, enters into various types of commitments and issues letters of credit to meet the liquidity and credit enhancement needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these instruments represent the maximum potential credit exposure should the instrument be fully drawn upon and the client default. To control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit, Northern Trust subjects such activities to the same credit quality and monitoring controls as its lending activities. Northern Trust does not believe the total contractual amount of these instruments to be representative of its future credit exposure or funding requirements.  \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n149\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides details of Northern Trust's off-balance sheet financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nTABLE 106: SUMMARY OF OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nDECEMBER 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In Millions)\nONE YEAR AND LESS\nOVER ONE YEAR\nTOTAL\nONE YEAR AND LESS\nOVER ONE YEAR\nTOTAL\nUndrawn Commitments\n(1)\n$\n10,849.6\n \n$\n17,293.2\n \n$\n28,142.8\n \n$\n11,849.5\n \n$\n18,909.6\n \n$\n30,759.1\n \nStandby Letters of Credit and Financial Guarantees\n(2)(3)\n112,256.3\n \n490.1\n \n112,746.4\n \n85,752.0\n \n639.0\n \n86,391.0\n \nCommercial Letters of Credit\n20.3\n \n0.2\n \n20.5\n \n29.2\n \n1.3\n \n30.5\n \nSecurities Lent with Indemnification\n144,543.7\n \n—\n \n144,543.7\n \n140,539.1\n \n—\n \n140,539.1\n \nUnsettled Reverse Repurchase Agreements\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n27,667.7\n \n—\n \n27,667.7\n \nTotal Off-Balance Sheet Financial Instruments\n$\n267,669.9\n \n$\n17,783.5\n \n$\n285,453.4\n \n$\n265,837.5\n \n$\n19,549.9\n \n$\n285,387.4\n \n(1)\n These amounts exclude $\n268.5\n million and $\n222.2\n million of commitments participated to others at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(2) \nThese amounts include $\n109.4\n million and $\n39.1\n million of standby letters of credit secured by cash deposits or participated to others as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(3) \nThis amount includes a $\n110.8\n billion guarantee to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) under the sponsored member program, without taking into consideration the related collateral, as of December 31, 2024. As of December 31, 2023, there was a $\n84.6\n billion guarantee to the FICC.\n \nUndrawn Commitments\n generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. Since commitments can expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements.\nStandby Letters of Credit\n obligate Northern Trust to meet certain financial obligations of its clients, if, under the contractual terms of the agreement, the clients are unable to do so. These instruments are primarily issued to support public and private financial commitments, including commercial paper, bond financing, initial margin requirements on futures exchanges, and similar transactions. Northern Trust is obligated to meet the entire financial obligation of these agreements and in certain cases is able to recover the amounts paid through recourse against collateral received or other participants. Since the vast majority of the standby letters of credit are never drawn, the total standby letters of credit amount does not necessarily represent future loans or liquidity requirements.\nFinancial Guarantees\n are issued by Northern Trust to guarantee the performance of a client to a third party under certain arrangements.\nCommercial Letters of Credit\n are instruments issued by Northern Trust on behalf of its clients that authorize a third party (the beneficiary) to draw drafts up to a stipulated amount under the specified terms and conditions of the agreement and other similar instruments. Commercial letters of credit are issued primarily to facilitate international trade.\nSecurities Lent with Indemnification\n involves Northern Trust lending securities owned by clients to borrowers who are reviewed and approved by the Northern Trust Capital Markets Credit Committee, as part of its securities custody activities and at the direction of its clients. In connection with these activities, Northern Trust has issued indemnifications to certain clients against certain losses that are a direct result of a borrower’s failure to return securities when due, should the value of such securities exceed the value of the collateral required to be posted. Borrowers are required to fully collateralize securities received with cash or marketable securities. As securities are loaned, collateral is maintained at a minimum of \n100\n% of the fair value of the securities plus accrued interest. The collateral is revalued on a daily basis. The amount of securities loaned subject to indemnification as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, was $\n144.5\n billion and $\n140.5\n billion, respectively. Because of the credit quality of the borrowers and the requirement to fully collateralize securities borrowed, management believes that the exposure to credit loss from this activity is not significant and \nno\n liability was recorded at December 31, 2024, or 2023 related to these indemnifications.\nUnsettled Repurchase and Reverse Repurchase Agreements\n.\n Northern Trust enters into repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements which may settle at a future date. In repurchase agreements, Northern Trust receives cash from and provides securities as collateral to a counterparty. In reverse repurchase agreements, Northern Trust advances cash to and receives securities as collateral from a counterparty. These transactions are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets on the settlement date. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, there were \nno\n unsettled reverse repurchase agreements and $\n27.7\n billion of unsettled reverse repurchase agreements, respectively. As of December 31, 2024, and 2023, there were \nno\n unsettled repurchase agreements.\n150\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSponsored Member Program. \nNorthern Trust is an approved Government Securities Division (GSD) netting and sponsoring member in the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (FICC) sponsored member program, through which Northern Trust submits eligible repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions in U.S. government securities between Northern Trust and its sponsored member clients for novation and clearing. Northern Trust may sponsor clients to clear their eligible repurchase transactions with the FICC. As a sponsoring member, Northern Trust guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC GSD’s rules. To mitigate Northern Trust’s credit exposure under this guarantee, Northern Trust obtains a security interest in its sponsored member clients’ collateral. Please refer to Note 27, “Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities” for additional information on Northern Trust’s repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.\nClearing and Settlement Organizations.\n The Bank is a participating member of various cash, securities and foreign exchange clearing and settlement organizations. It participates in these organizations on behalf of its clients and on its own behalf as a result of its own activities. A wide variety of cash and securities transactions are settled through these organizations, including those involving U.S. Treasuries, obligations of states and political subdivisions, asset-backed securities, commercial paper, dollar placements, and securities issued by the Government National Mortgage Association. \nCertain of these industry clearing and settlement exchanges require their members to guarantee their obligations and liabilities and/or to provide liquidity support in the event other members do not honor their obligations as stipulated in each clearing organization’s membership agreement. Exposure related to these agreements varies, primarily as a result of fluctuations in the volume of transactions cleared through the organizations. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Northern Trust has not recorded any material liabilities under these arrangements as Northern Trust believes the likelihood that a clearing or settlement exchange (of which Northern Trust is a member) would become insolvent is remote. Controls related to these clearing transactions are closely monitored by management to protect the assets of Northern Trust and its clients.\nFDIC Special Assessment\n. \nIn November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the deposit insurance fund associated with bank failures in the first half of 2023. In conjunction with the special assessment, $\n84.6\n million was recorded to Other Operating Expense in 2023. During the first half of 2024, the FDIC published revised estimated losses as well as estimated recoveries from the related bank failures. As a result, Northern Trust recognized additional expense of $\n14.7\n million in 2024, recorded to Other Operating Expense. As of December 31, 2024, Northern Trust estimates its total liability related to the special assessment to be $\n99.3\n million. \nLegal Proceedings.\n In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to pending and threatened legal actions, and are subject to regulatory examinations, information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings, both formal and informal. In certain legal actions, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted. In regulatory matters, claims for disgorgement, restitution, penalties and/or other remedial actions or sanctions may be sought. \nBased on current knowledge, after consultation with legal counsel and after taking into account current accruals, management does not believe that losses, fines or penalties, if any, arising from pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters either individually or in the aggregate, after giving effect to applicable reserves and insurance coverage will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation, although such matters could have a material adverse effect on the Corporation’s operating results for a particular period.\nUnder GAAP, (i) an event is “probable” if the “future event or events are likely to occur”; (ii) an event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely”; and (iii) an event is “remote” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.”\nThe outcome of litigation and regulatory matters is inherently difficult to predict and/or the range of loss often cannot be reasonably estimated, particularly for matters that (i) will be decided by a jury, (ii) are in early stages, (iii) involve uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of the class, (iv) are subject to appeals or motions, (v) involve significant factual issues to be resolved, including with respect to the amount of damages, (vi) do not specify the amount of damages sought or (vii) seek very large damages based on novel and complex damage and liability legal theories. Accordingly, the Corporation cannot reasonably estimate the eventual outcome of these pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties, if any, related to each pending matter will be.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation records accruals for litigation and regulatory matters when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and reasonably estimable. When loss contingencies are not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Corporation does not record accruals. \nNo\n material accruals have been recorded for pending litigation or threatened legal actions or regulatory matters. \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n151\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor a limited number of matters for which a loss is reasonably possible in future periods, whether in excess of an accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. As of December 31, 2024, the Corporation has estimated the range of reasonably possible loss for these matters to be from \nzero\n to approximately $\n25\n million in the aggregate. The Corporation’s estimate with respect to the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. \nIn certain other pending matters, there may be a range of reasonably possible loss (including reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued) that cannot be reasonably estimated for the reasons described above. Such matters are not included in the estimated range of reasonably possible loss discussed above. \nIn 2015, Northern Trust Fiduciary Services (Guernsey) Limited (NTFS), an indirect subsidiary of the Corporation, was charged by a French investigating magistrate judge with complicity in estate tax fraud in connection with the administration of \ntwo\n trusts for which it serves as trustee. Charges also were brought against a number of other persons and entities related to this matter. In 2017, a French court found no estate tax fraud had occurred and NTFS and all other persons and entities charged were acquitted. The Public Prosecutor’s Office of France appealed the court decision and in June 2018 a French appellate court issued its opinion on the matter, acquitting all persons and entities charged, including NTFS. In January 2021, the Cour de Cassation, the highest court in France, reversed the June 2018 appellate court ruling, requiring a re-trial at the appellate court level. This re-trial concluded in October 2023. On March 5, 2024 the appellate court rendered a judgment against all defendants, including NTFS. NTFS was ordered to pay a fine of €\n187,500\n in conjunction with the judgment. In addition, the court ordered that certain of those convicted in relation to tax fraud or aiding and abetting tax fraud, including NTFS, are jointly and severally liable for any allegedly unpaid estate taxes owing, plus penalties and interest. NTFS provided no tax advice and was not involved in the preparation or filing of the challenged estate tax filings in this case. Further, NTFS believes it acted in accordance with all applicable laws and fully complied with its fiduciary duties. Accordingly, NTFS filed an appeal of the judgment on March 5, 2024. Under applicable law, upon the filing by NTFS of its appeal, the judgment, as well as its effects (including the fine and joint and several liability) will be stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.\nVisa Class B Common Shares and Makewhole Agreement.\n Northern Trust, as a member of Visa U.S.A. Inc. (Visa U.S.A.) and in connection with the 2007 restructuring of Visa U.S.A. and its affiliates and the 2008 initial public offering of Visa Inc. (Visa), received certain Visa Class B common shares. The Visa Class B common shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions until the final resolution of certain litigation related to interchange fees involving Visa (the covered litigation), at which time the shares are convertible into Visa Class A common shares based on a conversion rate dependent upon the ultimate cost of resolving the covered litigation. Since 2018, Visa has deposited an additional $\n4.3\n billion into an escrow account previously established with respect to the covered litigation. As a result of the additional contributions to the escrow account, the rate at which Visa Class B common shares will convert into Visa Class A common shares is \n1.5430\n as of December 31, 2024. \nIn September 2018, Visa reached a proposed class settlement agreement covering damage claims but not injunctive relief claims regarding the covered litigation. In December 2019, the district court granted final approval for the proposed class settlement agreement. In March 2023, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s approval of the class settlement agreement. Certain merchants have opted out of the class settlement and are pursuing claims separately. The ultimate resolution of the covered litigation, the timing for removal of the selling restrictions on the Visa Class B common shares and the rate at which such shares will ultimately convert into Visa Class A common shares are uncertain.\nIn May 2024, Northern Trust received \n2.1\n million Visa Class B-2 common shares and \n819.5\n thousand Visa Class C common shares via its full participation in an offer to exchange outstanding shares of Visa’s Class B common stock (Exchange Offer). The newly issued series of Visa Class B common shares are subject to the same transfer and convertibility restrictions as the previously outstanding Visa Class B common shares. The Visa Class C common shares will automatically be converted at the then-applicable conversion rate into shares of Visa Class A common stock if transferred to a person other than a Visa member or an affiliate of a Visa member. After the initial exchange offer, Visa can, at its discretion, conduct up to \nthree\n successive potential exchange offers, in each case, if more than \n12\n months have passed since the previous exchange offer and after a further \n50\n% reduction of interchange fees at issue in the unresolved claims for damages in the covered litigation.\nNorthern Trust holds the Visa Class B-2 common shares received in the Exchange Offer at their carryover basis of \nzero\n as of December 31, 2024. Based upon the December 31, 2024, closing price of $\n316.04\n for a Visa Class A common share, the estimated value of Northern Trust’s Visa Class B-2 common shares was approximately $\n1.0\n billion at the current conversion rate of Visa Class B to Visa Class A common shares. The estimated value does not represent fair value given the shares’ limited transferability.\n152\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2024, Northern Trust had sold \n798.7\n thousand Visa Class C common shares of the \n819.5\n thousand it had received in the Exchange Offer and recorded a realized gain of $\n870.4\n million on the sales through Other Operating Income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2024. The remaining Visa Class C common shares are recorded at their fair value of $\n26.3\n million in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets with changes in fair value recorded in Other Operating Income on the consolidated statement of income.\nIn conjunction with Northern Trust’s participation in the Exchange Offer, Northern Trust was required to enter into the Makewhole Agreement whereby if all the Visa Class B-2 common share value is exhausted via additional escrow contributions, the Visa Class B-2 shareholders have to step in and make whole what the original Visa Class B common shares would have been obligated to cover absent the Exchange Offer. At December 31, 2024, Northern Trust has not recorded a liability under this agreement as Northern Trust believes the likelihood that a payment under the Makewhole Agreement will have to be made is remote.\nNote 25 – \nDerivative Financial Instruments\nNorthern Trust is a party to various derivative financial instruments that are used in the normal course of business to meet the needs of its clients, as part of its trading activity for its own account; and as part of its risk management activities. These instruments may include foreign exchange contracts, interest rate contracts, total return swap contracts, and swaps related to the sale of certain Visa Class B common shares. Please refer to Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” for the significant accounting policies for derivative financial instruments. \nForeign exchange contracts\n are agreements to exchange specific amounts of currencies at a future date, at a specified rate of exchange. Foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily to meet the foreign exchange needs of clients. Foreign exchange contracts are also used for trading and risk management purposes. For risk management purposes, Northern Trust uses foreign exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates relating to certain forecasted non-functional-currency-denominated revenue and expenditure transactions and foreign-currency- denominated assets and liabilities, including debt securities and net investments in non-U.S. affiliates.\nInterest rate contracts\n include swap and option contracts. Interest rate swap contracts involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts. Northern Trust enters into interest rate swap contracts with its clients and also may utilize such contracts to reduce or eliminate the exposure to changes in the cash flows or fair value of hedged assets or liabilities due to changes in interest rates. Interest rate option contracts may include caps, floors, collars and swaptions, and provide for the transfer or reduction of interest rate risk, typically in exchange for a fee. Northern Trust enters into option contracts primarily as a seller of interest rate protection to clients. Northern Trust receives a fee at the outset of the agreement for the assumption of the risk of an unfavorable change in interest rates. This assumed interest rate risk is then mitigated by entering into an offsetting position with an outside counterparty. Northern Trust may also purchase or enter into option contracts for risk management purposes including to reduce the exposure to changes in the cash flows of hedged assets due to changes in interest rates.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n153\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table shows the notional and fair values of all derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2024\nand 2023. \nTABLE 107: NOTIONAL AND FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS \nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nFAIR VALUE\nFAIR VALUE\n(In Millions)\nNOTIONAL\nVALUE\nASSET\n(1)\nLIABILITY\n(2)\nNOTIONAL\nVALUE\nASSET\n(1)\nLIABILITY\n(2)\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging under GAAP\nInterest Rate Contracts\nFair Value Hedges\n$\n9,706.3\n \n$\n189.4\n \n$\n159.3\n \n$\n7,042.7\n \n$\n94.7\n \n$\n71.0\n \nForeign Exchange Contracts\nCash Flow Hedges\n872.8\n \n40.8\n \n—\n \n1,453.6\n \n15.0\n \n42.2\n \nNet Investment Hedges\n4,558.6\n \n196.5\n \n24.3\n \n4,077.4\n \n13.3\n \n31.9\n \nTotal Derivatives Designated as Hedging under GAAP\n$\n15,137.7\n \n$\n426.7\n \n$\n183.6\n \n$\n12,573.7\n \n$\n123.0\n \n$\n145.1\n \nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging under GAAP\nNon-Designated Risk Management Derivatives\nForeign Exchange Contracts\n$\n1.7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n20.7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n0.1\n \nOther Financial Derivatives\n(3)\n512.0\n \n—\n \n27.2\n \n867.9\n \n—\n \n25.4\n \nTotal Non-Designated Risk Management Derivatives\n$\n513.7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n27.2\n \n$\n888.6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n25.5\n \nClient-Related and Trading Derivatives\nForeign Exchange Contracts\n$\n362,658.7\n \n$\n4,760.0\n \n$\n4,685.5\n \n$\n313,336.9\n \n$\n3,238.4\n \n$\n3,181.0\n \nInterest Rate Contracts\n15,081.7\n \n171.8\n \n262.1\n \n13,584.1\n \n206.8\n \n298.2\n \nTotal Client-Related and Trading Derivatives\n$\n377,740.4\n \n$\n4,931.8\n \n$\n4,947.6\n \n$\n326,921.0\n \n$\n3,445.2\n \n$\n3,479.2\n \nTotal Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging under GAAP\n$\n378,254.1\n \n$\n4,931.8\n \n$\n4,974.8\n \n$\n327,809.6\n \n$\n3,445.2\n \n$\n3,504.7\n \nTotal Gross Derivatives\n$\n393,391.8\n \n$\n5,358.5\n \n$\n5,158.4\n \n$\n340,383.3\n \n$\n3,568.2\n \n$\n3,649.8\n \nLess: Netting\n(4)\n1,910.4\n \n4,199.6\n \n3,126.7\n \n2,205.4\n \nTotal Derivative Financial Instruments\n$\n3,448.1\n \n$\n958.8\n \n$\n441.5\n \n$\n1,444.4\n \n(1)\n \nDerivative assets\n are reported in Other Assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2) \nDerivative liabilities\n are reported in Other Liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(3)\n This line includes swaps related to sales of certain Visa Class B common shares and total return swap contracts.\n(4) \nSee further detail in Note 27, \"Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities.\"\nNotional amounts of derivative financial instruments do not represent credit risk, and are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. They are used merely to express the volume of this activity. Northern Trust’s credit-related risk of loss is limited to the positive fair value of the derivative instrument, net of any collateral received, which is significantly less than the notional amount.\nHedging Derivative Instruments Designated under GAAP.\n Northern Trust uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk. Certain hedging relationships are formally designated and qualify for hedge accounting under GAAP as fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges.\nFair Value Hedges.\n Derivatives are designated as fair value hedges to limit Northern Trust’s exposure to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities due to movements in interest rates.\nCash Flow Hedges.\n Derivatives are also d\nesignated as cash flow hedges in order to minimize the variability in cash flows of earning assets or forecasted transactions caused by movements in interest or foreign exchange rates. \nThere were \nno\n material gains or losses reclassified into earnings during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions that were no longer probable of occurring. It is estimated that net gains of $\n8.3\n million will be reclassified into Net Income within the next twelve months relating to cash flow hedges of foreign-currency-denominated debt securities. As of December 31, 2024, \n6\n months was the maximum length of time over which the exposure to variability in future cash flows of forecasted foreign-currency-denominated debt securities was being hedged.\n154\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table provides fair value and cash flow hedge derivative gains and losses recognized in income during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nTABLE 108: LOCATION AND AMOUNT OF FAIR VALUE AND CASH FLOW HEDGE DERIVATIVE GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED IN INCOME \n(In Millions)\nINTEREST INCOME\nINTEREST EXPENSE\nOTHER OPERATING INCOME\nFor the Year Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal amounts on the consolidated statements of income\n$\n9,762.3\n \n$\n7,325.0\n \n$\n2,877.7\n \n$\n7,585.2\n \n$\n5,343.0\n \n$\n990.5\n \n$\n1,157.4\n \n$\n228.7\n \n$\n191.3\n \nGains (Losses) on fair value hedges recognized on\nInterest Rate Contracts\nRecognized on derivatives\n126.6\n \n(\n132.6\n)\n82.8\n \n(\n5.1\n)\n74.9\n \n(\n373.4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nRecognized on hedged items\n(\n126.6\n)\n132.6\n \n(\n82.8\n)\n5.1\n \n(\n74.9\n)\n373.4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAmounts related to interest settlements on derivatives\n96.6\n \n47.1\n \n(\n4.4\n)\n(\n76.9\n)\n(\n86.5\n)\n24.1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal gains (losses) recognized on fair value hedges\n$\n96.6\n \n$\n47.1\n \n$\n(\n4.4\n)\n$\n(\n76.9\n)\n$\n(\n86.5\n)\n$\n24.1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nGains (Losses) on cash flow hedges recognized on\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nNet gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI to net income\n$\n13.4\n \n$\n34.9\n \n$\n0.6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1.9\n \n$\n(\n4.3\n)\nTotal gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI to net income on cash flow hedges\n$\n13.4\n \n$\n34.9\n \n$\n0.6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1.9\n \n$\n(\n4.3\n)\nThe following table provides the impact of fair value hedge accounting on the carrying value of the designated hedged items, which includes hedged items no longer designated.\nTABLE 109: HEDGED ITEMS IN FAIR VALUE HEDGES \nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\n(In Millions)\nCARRYING VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEMS\nCUMULATIVE HEDGE ACCOUNTING BASIS ADJUSTMENT\n(1)(3)\nCARRYING VALUE OF THE HEDGED ITEMS\nCUMULATIVE HEDGE ACCOUNTING BASIS ADJUSTMENT\n(2)(3)\nAvailable for Sale Debt Securities\n(4)\n$\n7,567.3\n \n$\n(\n48.7\n)\n$\n5,048.8\n \n$\n77.5\n \nSenior Notes and Long-Term Subordinated Debt\n2,507.5\n \n(\n238.0\n)\n2,495.9\n \n(\n248.7\n)\n(1) \nThe cumulative hedge accounting basis adjustment includes $\n1.8\n million related to discontinued hedging relationships of AFS debt securities and $\n13.8\n million related to discontinued hedging relationships in the cumulative hedge accounting basis adjustment of senior notes and long-term debt as of December 31, 2024.\n(2) \nThe cumulative hedge accounting basis adjustment includes $\n2.2\n million related to discontinued hedging relationships of AFS debt securities and $\n29.6\n million related to discontinued hedging relationships in the cumulative hedge accounting basis adjustment of senior notes and long-term debt as of December 31, 2023.\n(3) \nPositive (negative) amounts related to AFS securities represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods.

Net investment hedge gains of $\n233.1\n million and net investment hedge losses of $\n77.4\n million were recognized in AOCI related to foreign exchange contracts for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDerivative Instruments Not Designated as Hedging under GAAP.\n Northern Trust’s derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging under GAAP include derivatives for purposes of client-related and trading activities, as well as other risk management purposes. These activities consist principally of providing foreign exchange services to clients in connection with Northern Trust’s global custody business. However, in the normal course of business, Northern Trust also engages in trading of currencies for its own account.\nNon-designated risk management derivatives include foreign exchange contracts entered into to manage the foreign currency risk of non-U.S.-dollar-denominated assets and liabilities, the net investment in certain non-U.S. affiliates, commercial loans, and forecasted foreign-currency-denominated transactions. Swaps related to sales of certain Visa Class B common shares were entered into pursuant to which Northern Trust retains the risks associated with the ultimate conversion of the Visa Class B common shares into Visa Class A common shares. Total return swaps are entered into to manage the equity price risk associated with certain investments. \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n155\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nChanges in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedges under GAAP are recognized currently in income. \nThe following table provides the location and amount of gains and losses recorded on the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 for derivative instruments not designated as hedges under GAAP.\nTABLE 110: LOCATION AND AMOUNT OF GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED IN INCOME FOR DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING UNDER GAAP\n(In Millions)\nDERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) LOCATION RECOGNIZED IN INCOME\nAMOUNT OF DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) RECOGNIZED IN INCOME\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNon-designated risk management derivatives\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nOther Operating Income\n$\n(\n0.2\n)\n$\n1.8\n \n$\n(\n3.1\n)\nOther Financial Derivatives\n(1)\nOther Operating Income\n(\n33.5\n)\n(\n21.2\n)\n(\n22.2\n)\nGains (Losses) from non-designated risk management derivatives\n$\n(\n33.7\n)\n$\n(\n19.4\n)\n$\n(\n25.3\n)\nClient-related and trading derivatives\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nForeign Exchange Trading Income\n$\n231.2\n \n$\n203.9\n \n$\n288.6\n \nInterest Rate Contracts\nSecurity Commissions and Trading Income\n4.0\n \n8.9\n \n9.6\n \nGains (Losses) from client-related and trading derivatives\n$\n235.2\n \n$\n212.8\n \n$\n298.2\n \nTotal gains (losses) from derivatives not designated as hedging under GAAP\n$\n201.5\n \n$\n193.4\n \n$\n272.9\n \n(1) \nThis line includes swaps related to the sale of certain Visa Class B common shares and total return swap contracts.\nNote 26 – \nSecurities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase\nSecurities purchased under agreements to resell and securities sold under agreements to repurchase are accounted for as collateralized financings and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were acquired or sold plus accrued interest. To minimize any potential credit risk associated with these transactions, the fair value of the securities purchased or sold is monitored, limits are set on exposure with counterparties, and the financial condition of counterparties is regularly assessed. It is Northern Trust’s policy to take possession, either directly or via third-party custodians, of securities purchased under agreements to resell. Securities sold under agreements to repurchase are either directly held by, or pledged to the counterparty until the repurchase. Northern Trust nets securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements when there is a legally enforceable master netting arrangement and the other conditions to net are met. \nThe following tables summarize information related to Securities Purchased under Agreements to Resell and Securities Sold under Agreements to Repurchase.\nTABLE 111: SECURITIES PURCHASED UNDER AGREEMENTS TO RESELL \n($ In Millions)\n2024\n2023\nBalance at December 31\n$\n426.0\n \n$\n784.7\n \nAverage Balance During the Year\n727.5\n \n950.9\n \nAverage Interest Rate Earned During the Year\n459.13\n \n%\n166.71\n \n%\nMaximum Month-End Balance During the Year\n$\n1,034.6\n \n$\n1,326.2\n \nNote: The table above includes the impact of balance sheet netting of approximately $\n62.4\n billion and $\n29.1\n billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively.

could have been used to offset the net amounts presented on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nAll of Northern Trust’s securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements) and securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) involve the transfer of financial assets in exchange for cash subject to a right and obligation to repurchase those assets for an agreed upon amount. In the event of a repurchase failure, the cash or financial assets are available for offset. All of Northern Trust’s repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase agreements are subject to a master netting arrangement, which sets forth the rights and obligations for repurchase and offset. Under the master netting arrangement, Northern Trust is entitled to set off receivables from and collateral placed with a single counterparty against obligations owed to that counterparty. In addition, collateral held by Northern Trust can be offset against receivables from that counterparty. Northern Trust has elected to net securities sold under repurchase agreements against those purchased under resale agreements when the GAAP requirements to net are met. \nDerivative asset and liability positions with a single counterparty can be offset against each other in cases where legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist. Derivative assets and liabilities can be further offset by cash collateral received from, and deposited with, the transacting counterparty. The basis for this view is that, upon termination of transactions subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement, the individual derivative receivables do not represent resources to which general creditors have rights and individual derivative payables do not represent claims that are equivalent to the claims of general creditors. Northern Trust has elected to net derivative assets \n158\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nand liabilities when legally enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements exist between Northern Trust and the counterparty. \nCredit risk associated with derivative instruments relates to the failure of the counterparty and the failure of Northern Trust to pay based on the contractual terms of the agreement, and is generally limited to the unrealized fair value gains and losses on these instruments, net of any collateral received or deposited. The amount of credit risk will increase or decrease during the lives of the instruments as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, or equity prices fluctuate. Northern Trust’s risk is controlled by limiting such activity to an approved list of counterparties and by subjecting such activity to the same credit and quality controls as are followed in lending and investment activities. Credit support annexes and other similar agreements are currently in place with a number of Northern Trust’s counterparties which mitigate the aforementioned credit risk associated with derivative activity conducted with those counterparties by requiring that significant net unrealized fair value gains be supported by collateral placed with Northern Trust.\nAdditional cash collateral received from and deposited with derivative counterparties totaling $\n140.6\n million and $\n36.4\n million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024, and $\n373.1\n million and $\n21.3\n million, respectively, as of December 31, 2023, was not offset against derivative assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as the amounts exceeded the net derivative positions with those counterparties. \nCertain master netting arrangements Northern Trust enters into with derivative counterparties contain credit risk-related contingent features in which the counterparty has the option to declare Northern Trust in default and accelerate cash settlement of net derivative liabilities with the counterparty in the event Northern Trust’s credit rating falls below specified levels. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position was $\n1.6\n billion and $\n1.2\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Cash collateral amounts deposited with derivative counterparties on those dates included $\n1.4\n billion and $\n1.1\n billion, respectively, posted against these liabilities, resulting in a net maximum amount of termination payments that could have been required at December 31, 2024 and 2023 of $\n158.8\n million and $\n52.2\n million, respectively. Accelerated settlement of these liabilities would not have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of Northern Trust.\nNote 28 – \nVariable Interest Entities\nNorthern Trust is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that are deemed to be variable interest entities (VIEs). VIEs are defined within GAAP as entities which either (1) lack sufficient equity at risk to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) have equity investors that lack attributes typical of an equity investor, such as the ability to make significant decisions through voting rights affecting the entity’s operations, or the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive residual returns of the entity, or (3) are structured with voting rights that are disproportionate to the equity investor’s obligation to absorb losses or right to receive returns, and substantially all of the activities are conducted on behalf of the holder of the equity investment at risk with disproportionately few voting rights. Investors that finance a VIE through debt or equity interests are variable interest holders in the entity and the variable interest holder, if any, that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and, through its variable interest, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns that could potentially be significant to the entity is deemed to be the VIE’s primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate the VIE.\nCommunity Reinvestment Act (CRA) Investments. \nNorthern Trust fulfills its obligations under the CRA by making a variety of qualified investments for purposes of supporting institutions and programs that benefit low-to-moderate income communities within Northern Trust’s market area. These investments are made in legal entities that are primarily VIEs and consist of equity in limited partnerships and beneficial interests in securitized debt. Based on its analysis, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under GAAP and therefore they are not consolidated.\nNorthern Trust’s investments in these unconsolidated entities are reported in Other Assets or Held to Maturity Debt Securities, depending on the structure of the investment. \nTax credit structures.\n Northern Trust holds tax-advantaged investments in unconsolidated entities that own and operate affordable housing and projects through the new markets tax credit program. These entities, which are limited partnerships and similar entities, are primarily VIEs and are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of tax credits and other tax benefits, such as tax deductions from operating losses of the investments. Northern Trust invests as a limited partner/investor member and lacks both the power to direct the entities’ most significant activities and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the entities. Northern Trust is not required to consolidate these entities as it does not have a controlling financial interest and thus is not the primary beneficiary.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n159\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNorthern Trust’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with tax credit structures and other CRA investments is limited to the carrying amounts of its investments, including any undrawn commitments. Northern Trust’s funding requirements are limited to its invested capital and undrawn commitments for future equity contributions. Northern Trust has no exposure to loss from liquidity arrangements and no obligation to purchase assets of these entities.\nNorthern Trust’s investments in these unconsolidated tax credit structures and related unfunded commitments are reported in \nOther Assets\n and Other Liabilities, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets.\nTABLE 116: SUMMARY OF UNCONSOLIDATED TAX CREDIT STRUCTURES\n(In Millions)\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\nInvestment Carrying Amount\nAffordable Housing\n$\n657.0\n \n$\n622.8\n \nNew Markets\n219.7\n \n266.3\n \nTotal Investment Carrying Amount\n(1)\n$\n876.7\n \n$\n889.1\n \nUnfunded Commitments\n     Affordable Housing\n$\n227.1\n \n$\n178.8\n \nNew Markets\n—\n \n—\n \nTotal Unfunded Commitments\n(2)\n$\n227.1\n \n$\n178.8\n \n(1)\n    As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $\n849.3\n million and $\n857.0\n million are VIEs, respectively.\n(2)\n As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, $\n221.0\n million and $\n172.0\n million relate to undrawn commitments on VIEs, respectively.\nUpon adoption of ASU 2023-02 on January 1, 2024, Northern Trust elected to account for qualifying new markets tax credit investments under the proportional amortization method. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2023-02, Northern Trust accounted for qualifying affordable housing investments under the proportional amortization method and continues to do so subsequent to the adoption of ASU 2023-02. Under the proportional amortization method, the carrying amount of the investment is amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received in the current period as compared to the total income tax credits and income tax benefits expected to be received over the life of the investment. \nIncome tax credits and other income tax benefits\n and \namortization expense\n associated with unconsolidated tax credit structures are primarily reported in the \nProvision for Income Tax\n on the consolidated statement of income.\nNorthern Trust adopted ASU 2023-02 on a modified retrospective basis. As a result, amortization expense related to new markets tax credit investments is reported in the Provision for Income Tax beginning January 1, 2024. Prior to January 1, 2024, amortization expense related to new markets tax credit investments was reported in \nOther Operating Expense\n. Refer to Note 2—Recent Accounting Pronouncements for additional information. \nTABLE 117: INCOME TAX CREDITS AND OTHER TAX BENEFITS AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH TAX CREDIT STRUCTURES\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n(In Millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome Tax Credits and Other Income Tax Benefits\nAffordable Housing\n$\n87.0\n \n$\n89.3\n \n$\n76.4\n \n     New Markets\n20.1\n \n24.6\n \n22.7\n \nTotal Income Tax Credits and Other Income Tax Benefits\n$\n107.1\n \n$\n113.9\n \n$\n99.1\n \nAmortization Expense\n     Affordable Housing\n$\n71.8\n \n$\n76.8\n \n$\n60.0\n \n     New Markets\n17.5\n \n19.7\n \n21.4\n \nTotal Amortization Expense\n$\n89.3\n \n$\n96.5\n \n$\n81.4\n \nInvestment funds.\n Northern Trust acts as asset manager for various funds in which clients of Northern Trust are investors. As an asset manager of funds, Northern Trust earns a competitively priced fee that is based on assets managed and varies with each fund’s investment objective. Based on its analysis, Northern Trust has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs under GAAP and therefore, the funds are not consolidated. Northern Trust’s maximum exposure to loss is limited to the carrying amount of its investments, including any undrawn commitments. \n160\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCertain funds for which Northern Trust acts as asset manager comply or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds and, therefore, the funds are exempt from the consolidation requirements in ASC 810-10. Northern Trust does \nno\nt have any contractual obligations to provide financial support to the funds. Any potential future support of the funds will be at the discretion of Northern Trust after an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances.\nPeriodically, Northern Trust makes seed capital investments to certain funds. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, Northern Trust had no seed capital investments and no unfunded commitments related to seed capital investments.\n \nNote 29 – \nPledged Assets, Accepted Collateral and Restricted Assets\nPledged Assets. \nAs part of its liquidity management strategy, Northern Trust may pledge loans and/or securities to various financial market utilities to allow for client payment, clearing and settlement processing as part of our custody services. Northern Trust may also pledge loans or securities to Central Banks, Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Chicago and third parties for various purposes, for example: securing public and trust deposits, repurchase agreements, borrowings and derivative contracts. \nThe following table presents the carrying value of Northern Trust's pledged assets by type.\nTABLE 118: TYPE OF PLEDGED ASSETS\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n(In Billions)\n2024\n2023\nDebt Securities\n(1)\n$\n29.3\n \n$\n33.0\n \nLoans\n(2)\n9.5\n \n10.3\n \nTotal Pledged Assets\n$\n38.8\n \n$\n43.3\n \n(1)\n Debt securities are comprised of held to maturity and available for sale securities. \n(2)\n Loans pledged at the FHLB of Chicago and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $\n1.2\n billion and $\n1.1\n billion, respectively, of collateral pledged related to loans and/or securities, is eligible to be repledged or sold by the secured party.\nAccepted Collateral. \nNorthern Trust accepts financial assets as collateral that it may, in some instances, be permitted to repledge or sell. The collateral is generally obtained under certain reverse repurchase agreements and derivative contracts.\nThe following table presents the fair value of securities accepted as collateral.\nTABLE 119: ACCEPTED COLLATERAL\n \nFOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,\n(In Millions)\n2024\n2023\nCollateral that may be repledged or sold\nReverse repurchase agreements\n(1)\n$\n65,311.1\n \n$\n62,767.8\n \nDerivative contracts\n23.6\n \n12.2\n \nTotal Collateral Accepted\n$\n65,334.7\n \n$\n62,780.0\n \n(1)\n The fair value of securities collateral that was repledged or sold totaled $\n64.8\n billion and $\n62.0\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. This primarily includes collateral accepted as related to the FICC sponsored member program. Refer to Note 24, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” and Note 27, “Offsetting of Assets and Liabilities” for further information.\nRestricted Assets. \nCertain cash may be restricted in terms of usage or withdrawal. As a result of the continuing military conflict involving Ukraine and the Russian Federation and related sanctions and legal restrictions in place, cash balances denominated in Russian rubles received for the benefit of certain clients in our Asset Servicing business are subject to distribution restrictions. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, these balances totaled $\n1.1\n billion and $\n722.2\n million respectively, and are reported in Cash and Due from Banks on the consolidated balance sheet. \nAt\n \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023, Northern Trust held cash of $\n491.2\n million and $\n575.2\n million, respectively, to meet non-U.S. reserve requirements. The Federal Reserve’s U.S. reserve requirement is zero percent. There were \nno\n average deposits required to meet Federal Reserve Bank reserve requirements at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n161\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 30 – \nRestrictions on Subsidiary Dividends and Loans or Advances\nVarious federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends the Bank can pay to the Corporation without regulatory approval. Approval of the Federal Reserve Board is required for payment of any dividend by a state-chartered bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its retained net income (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. In addition, a state member bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its “undivided profits,” as defined, without regulatory and stockholder approval.\nUnder Illinois law, an Illinois state bank, prior to paying a dividend, must carry over to surplus at least one-tenth of its net profits since the date of the declaration of the last preceding dividend, until the bank’s surplus is equal to its capital. In addition, an Illinois state bank may not pay any dividend in an amount greater than its net profits then on hand, after deduction of losses and bad debts (defined as debts due to a state bank on which interest is past due and unpaid for a period of six months or more, unless the same are well secured and in the process of collection).\nThe Bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividends if the Bank is undercapitalized or if the payment of the dividends would cause the Bank to become undercapitalized. In addition, the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The payment of dividends could, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III impose additional restrictions on the ability of banking institutions to pay dividends (e.g., the Corporation may pay dividends only in accordance with the capital plan rules and capital adequacy standards of the Federal Reserve). Subsequent to December 31, 2024, our Bank subsidiary could declare dividends to the Corporation of approximately $\n260\n million, without obtaining prior regulatory approval.   \nUnder federal law, financial transactions by the Bank, the Corporation’s insured banking subsidiary, with the Corporation and its affiliates that are in the form of loans or extensions of credit, investments, guarantees, derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, securities lending transactions or purchases of assets, are restricted. These transactions must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered to non-affiliated companies (i.e. on terms not less favorable to the Bank than market terms). Further, extensions of credit must be secured fully with qualifying collateral and are limited to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus for transactions with a single affiliate and to 20% of the Bank’s capital and surplus with all affiliates. Other state and federal laws may limit the transfer of funds by the Corporation’s banking subsidiaries to the Corporation and certain of its affiliates.\nNote 31 – \nReporting Segments and Related Information\nSegment Information.\n Northern Trust is organized around its \ntwo\n client-focused reporting segments: Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. Asset management and related services are provided to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management clients primarily by the Asset Management business. The revenue and expenses of Asset Management and certain other support functions are allocated fully to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management. \nReporting segment financial information, presented on an internal management-reporting basis, is determined by accounting systems used to allocate revenue and expense to each segment, and incorporates processes for allocating assets, liabilities, equity and the applicable interest income and expense utilizing a funds transfer pricing (FTP) methodology. Under the methodology, assets and liabilities receive a funding charge or credit that considers interest rate risk, liquidity risk, and other product characteristics on an instrument level. Additionally, segment information is presented on an FTE basis as management believes an FTE presentation provides a clearer indication of net interest income. The adjustment to an FTE basis has no impact on Net Income.\nEquity is allocated to the reporting segments based on a variety of factors including, but not limited to, risk, regulatory considerations, and internal metrics. Allocations of equity and certain corporate expense may not be representative of levels that would be required if the segments were independent entities. The accounting policies used for management reporting are consistent with those described in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Transfers of income and expense items are recorded at cost; there is no consolidated profit or loss on sales or transfers between reporting segments. Northern Trust’s presentations are not necessarily consistent with similar information for other financial institutions.\nRevenues, expenses and average assets are allocated to Asset Servicing and Wealth Management, with the exception of non-recurring activities such as certain corporate transactions and costs incurred associated with acquisitions, divestitures, litigation, restructuring, and tax adjustments not directly attributable to a specific reporting segment, which are reported within the Other segment.\nReporting segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made. The results are also subject to refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies, which are typically reflected on a prospective basis. \n162\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nEffective January 2024, Northern Trust implemented certain enhancements to its FTP methodology, impacting the allocation of Net Interest Income to the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments. As a result, the approximate impact on the Asset Servicing and Wealth Management segments was a $\n132.0\n million decrease and a $\n132.0\n million increase in Net Interest Income, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2024. Prior-year segment results have not been revised to reflect this methodology change.\nNorthern Trust’s Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Operating Decision Maker uses growth and profitability metrics to assess segments’ performance including segment revenue and income before income taxes. Those same measures are used by the Chief Operating Decision Maker as primary inputs into the allocation of resources in the annual planning process. Allocation of capital to each segment takes into consideration a variety of factors including average loans, average deposits and applicable regulatory capital requirements.\nAsset Servicing. \nAsset Servicing is a leading global provider of asset servicing and related services to corporate and public retirement funds, foundations, endowments, fund managers, insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investors around the globe. Asset servicing and related services encompass a full range of capabilities including but not limited to: custody; fund administration; investment operations outsourcing; investment management; investment risk and analytical services; employee benefit services; securities lending; foreign exchange; treasury management; brokerage services; transition management services; banking; and cash management. Client relationships are managed through the Bank and the Bank’s and the Corporation’s other subsidiaries, including support from locations in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and the Asia-Pacific region.\nWealth Management.\n \nWealth Management focuses on high-net-worth individuals and families, business owners, executives, professionals, retirees, and established privately-held businesses in its target markets. In supporting these targeted segments, Wealth Management provides trust, investment management, custody, and philanthropic services; financial consulting; guardianship and estate administration; family business consulting; family financial education; brokerage services; and private and business banking. Wealth Management also includes Global Family Office, which provides customized services, including but not limited to: investment management; global custody; fiduciary; and private banking; family office consulting, and technology solutions, to meet the complex financial and reporting needs of ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices across the globe. Wealth Management services are delivered by multidisciplinary teams through a network of offices in \n19\n U.S. states and Washington, D.C., as well as offices in London, Guernsey, Singapore, and Abu Dhabi.\nOther\n. \nOther includes expenses for Asset Management, corporate and support functions not directly incurred by, but ultimately allocated back to, our \ntwo\n client-focused reporting segments.

The operations of Northern Trust are managed on a reporting segment basis and include components of both U.S and non-U.S. source income and assets. Non-U.S. source income and assets are not separately identified in Northern Trust’s internal management reporting system. However, Northern Trust is required to disclose non-U.S. activities based on the domicile of the customer. Due to the complex and integrated nature of Northern Trust’s activities, it is difficult to segregate with precision revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S.-domiciled customers. Therefore, certain subjective estimates and assumptions have been made to allocate revenues, expenses and assets between U.S. and non-U.S. operations.\nFor purposes of this disclosure, all foreign exchange trading income has been allocated to non-U.S. operations. Interest expense is allocated to non-U.S. operations based on specifically matched or pooled funding. Allocations of indirect noninterest expenses, when made, are based on various methods such as time, space, and number of employees.\nThe following table summarizes Northern Trust’s performance based on the allocation process described above without regard to guarantors or the location of collateral.\nTABLE 121: DISTRIBUTION OF TOTAL ASSETS AND OPERATING PERFORMANCE \n($ In Millions)\nTOTAL ASSETS\n% OF TOTAL\nTOTAL\nREVENUE\n(1)\n% OF TOTAL\nINCOME BEFORE\nINCOME TAXES\n% OF TOTAL\nNET INCOME\n% OF TOTAL\n2024\nNon-U.S.\n$\n43,173.2\n \n28\n \n%\n$\n2,244.5\n \n27\n \n%\n$\n569.2\n \n21\n \n%\n$\n429.9\n \n21\n \n%\nU.S.\n112,335.2\n \n72\n \n%\n6,045.9\n \n73\n \n%\n2,090.3\n \n79\n \n%\n1,601.2\n \n79\n \n%\nTotal\n$\n155,508.4\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n8,290.4\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n2,659.5\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n2,031.1\n \n100\n \n%\n2023\nNon-U.S.\n$\n39,661.5\n \n26\n \n%\n$\n2,156.1\n \n32\n \n%\n$\n473.7\n \n32\n \n%\n$\n354.0\n \n32\n \n%\nU.S.\n111,121.6\n \n74\n \n%\n4,617.4\n \n68\n \n%\n991.1\n \n68\n \n%\n753.3\n \n68\n \n%\nTotal\n$\n150,783.1\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n6,773.5\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n1,464.8\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n1,107.3\n \n100\n \n%\n2022\nNon-U.S.\n$\n35,991.3\n \n23\n \n%\n$\n2,273.3\n \n34\n \n%\n$\n560.9\n \n32\n \n%\n$\n420.2\n \n31\n \n%\nU.S.\n119,045.4\n \n77\n \n%\n4,487.9\n \n66\n \n%\n1,205.4\n \n68\n \n%\n915.8\n \n69\n \n%\nTotal\n$\n155,036.7\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n6,761.2\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n1,766.3\n \n100\n \n%\n$\n1,336.0\n \n100\n \n%\n(1) \nTotal revenue is comprised of net interest income and noninterest income.\nNote 32 – \nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nThe Corporation and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal bank regulatory authorities. Under these requirements, banks must maintain specific risk-based capital and leverage ratios in order to be classified as “well-capitalized.” The regulatory capital requirements impose certain restrictions upon banks that meet minimum capital requirements but are not “well-capitalized” and obligate the federal bank regulatory authorities to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not maintain such minimum ratios. Such prompt corrective action could have a direct material effect on a bank’s financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Bank had capital ratios above the levels required for classification as a “well-capitalized” institution and had not received any regulatory notification of a lower classification. The results of the 2024 DFAST, published by the Federal Reserve Board on June 26, 2024, resulted in Northern Trust’s stress capital buffer and effective Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio minimum requirement remaining constant at 2.5% and 7.0%, respectively, for the annual capital plan cycle, which began on October 1, 2024 and continues through September 30, 2025. \nAdditionally, Northern Trust’s subsidiary banks located outside the U.S. are subject to regulatory capital requirements in the jurisdictions in which they operate. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Northern Trust’s non-U.S. banking subsidiaries had capital ratios above their specified minimum requirements. There were no conditions or events since December 31, 2024, that management believes have adversely affected the capital categorization of any Northern Trust subsidiary bank. \nThe following table provides capital ratios for the Corporation and the Bank determined by Basel III phased in requirements.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n165\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTABLE 122: RISK-BASED AND LEVERAGE CAPITAL AMOUNTS AND RATIOS \nDECEMBER 31, 2024\nDECEMBER 31, 2023\n($ In Millions)\nSTANDARDIZED APPROACH\nADVANCED APPROACH\nSTANDARDIZED APPROACH\nADVANCED \nAPPROACH\nBALANCE\nRATIO\nBALANCE\nRATIO\nBALANCE\nRATIO\nBALANCE\nRATIO\nCommon Equity Tier 1 Capital\nNorthern Trust Corporation\n$\n11,038.2\n \n12.4\n \n%\n$\n11,038.2\n \n14.5\n \n%\n$\n10,179.4\n \n11.4\n \n%\n$\n10,179.4\n \n13.4\n \n%\nThe Northern Trust Company\n9,983.8\n \n11.4\n \n9,983.8\n \n13.6\n \n10,806.2\n \n12.2\n \n10,806.2\n \n14.6\n \nMinimum to qualify as well-capitalized:\nNorthern Trust Corporation\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nThe Northern Trust Company\n5,703.2\n \n6.5\n \n4,789.1\n \n6.5\n \n5,768.4\n \n6.5\n \n4,808.6\n \n6.5\n \nTier 1 Capital\nNorthern Trust Corporation\n11,870.2\n \n13.3\n \n11,870.2\n \n15.6\n \n11,023.9\n \n12.3\n \n11,023.9\n \n14.5\n \nThe Northern Trust Company\n9,983.8\n \n11.4\n \n9,983.8\n \n13.6\n \n10,806.2\n \n12.2\n \n10,806.2\n \n14.6\n \nMinimum to qualify as well-capitalized:\nNorthern Trust Corporation\n5,336.4\n \n6.0\n \n4,555.3\n \n6.0\n \n5,371.6\n \n6.0\n \n4,558.8\n \n6.0\n \nThe Northern Trust Company\n7,019.4\n \n8.0\n \n5,894.2\n \n8.0\n \n7,099.5\n \n8.0\n \n5,918.3\n \n8.0\n \nTotal Capital\nNorthern Trust Corporation\n13,423.2\n \n15.1\n \n13,217.3\n \n17.4\n \n12,733.9\n \n14.2\n \n12,514.7\n \n16.5\n \nThe Northern Trust Company\n11,241.7\n \n12.8\n \n11,035.8\n \n15.0\n \n12,279.3\n \n13.8\n \n12,060.2\n \n16.3\n \nMinimum to qualify as well-capitalized:\nNorthern Trust Corporation\n8,894.0\n \n10.0\n \n7,592.1\n \n10.0\n \n8,952.7\n \n10.0\n \n7,598.0\n \n10.0\n \nThe Northern Trust Company\n8,774.2\n \n10.0\n \n7,367.8\n \n10.0\n \n8,874.4\n \n10.0\n \n7,397.9\n \n10.0\n \nTier 1 Leverage\nNorthern Trust Corporation\n11,870.2\n \n8.1\n \n11,870.2\n \n8.1\n \n11,023.9\n \n8.1\n \n11,023.9\n \n8.1\n \nThe Northern Trust Company\n9,983.8\n \n6.9\n \n9,983.8\n \n6.9\n \n10,806.2\n \n8.0\n \n10,806.2\n \n8.0\n \nMinimum to qualify as well-capitalized:\nNorthern Trust Corporation\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nThe Northern Trust Company\n7,262.3\n \n5.0\n \n7,262.3\n \n5.0\n \n6,764.0\n \n5.0\n \n6,764.0\n \n5.0\n \nSupplementary Leverage\nNorthern Trust Corporation\nN/A\nN/A\n11,870.2\n \n8.9\n \nN/A\nN/A\n11,023.9\n \n8.6\n \nThe Northern Trust Company\nN/A\nN/A\n9,983.8\n \n7.5\n \nN/A\nN/A\n10,806.2\n \n8.5\n \nMinimum to qualify as well-capitalized:\nNorthern Trust Corporation\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nThe Northern Trust Company\nN/A\nN/A\n3,974.3\n \n3.0\n \nN/A\nN/A\n3,825.6\n \n3.0\n \nUnder the final Basel III rules, the Corporation and the Bank are required to calculate and publicly disclose risk-based capital ratios using two methodologies: an advanced approach and a standardized approach. Under the advanced approach, credit RWA are based on internal credit models and parameters. Additionally, the advanced approach incorporates operational risk RWA. Under the standardized approach, RWA are based on supervisory prescribed risk weights that are primarily dependent on counterparty type and asset class.\nPursuant to the Federal Reserve Board's implementation in the final Basel III rules of a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act, the capital adequacy of the Corporation and the Bank is assessed based on the lower of the advanced approach or standardized approach capital ratios.\n166\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 33 – \nNorthern Trust Corporation (Corporation only)\nCondensed financial information is presented in the following tables.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A – CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Corporation’s management, with the participation of the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Based on such evaluation, such officers have concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective. \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) to provide reasonable assurance to the Corporation’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation of reliable published financial statements. This internal control includes monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified.\nManagement assessed the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, the Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Corporation’s consolidated financial statements as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2024, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n169\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nNorthern Trust Corporation:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited Northern Trust Corporation and subsidiaries’ (the Corporation) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in\n Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 24, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 24, 2025\n170\n   2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION \nITEM 9B – OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) \nadopted\n, \nterminated\n or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).\nITEM 9C – DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS\nNot applicable.\nPART III\nITEM 10 – DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated by reference to “Supplemental Item – Information About Our Executive Officers” in Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the following sections of the Corporation’s definitive Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders: “Item 1 – Election of Directors,” “Information about the Nominees for Director,” “Security Ownership by Directors and Executive Officers,” “Corporate Governance – Code of Business Conduct and Ethics,” “Corporate Governance – Director Nominations and Qualifications and Proxy Access,” “Corporate Governance – Securities Transaction Policy and Policy Against Hedging,” “Board and Board Committee Information – Audit Committee” and “Board and Board Committee Information – Board Committees.”\nITEM 11 – EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” “Human Capital and Compensation Committee Report,” “Executive Compensation,” and “Director Compensation” sections of the Corporation’s definitive Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nITEM 12 – SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the “Security Ownership by Directors and Executive Officers,” “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners,” and “Equity Compensation Plan Information” sections of the Corporation’s definitive Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nITEM 13 – CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the “Board and Board Committee Information,” “Corporate Governance – Director Independence” and the “Corporate Governance – Related Person Transactions Policy” sections of the Corporation’s definitive Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\nITEM 14 – PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES\nThe information called for by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the “Audit Matters” section of the Corporation’s definitive Proxy Statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.\n2024 ANNUAL REPORT | NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION   \n171\nPART IV\nITEM 15 – EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES\nITEM 15(a)(1) AND (2) – NORTHERN TRUST CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES LIST OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES\nThe following financial statements of the Corporation and its Subsidiaries included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K are incorporated herein by reference.\nFor Northern Trust Corporation and Subsidiaries:\nConsolidated Balance Sheets -
