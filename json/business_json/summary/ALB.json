  "item1_summary": " Our significant manufacturing presence and sales activities in the E.U. require significant compliance costs and may result in increases in the costs of raw materials we purchase and the products we sell . The U.S. Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) requires chemicals to be assessed against a risk-based safety standard and calls for the elimination of unreasonable risks identified during risk evaluation .\n Our business is subject to hazards common to chemical and natural resource extraction businesses . Failure to comply with specifications could result in claims or legal action against us . A successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations . We sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees .\n The nature of our business exposes us to risks of liability under environmental laws and regulations due to the production, storage, use, use and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment . We currently use, and in the past have used, hazardous substances . The company's business could be adversely affected by environmental, health and safety laws, including those governing discharge of pollutants into the air and water .\n Some of the world's largest private companies may be subject to liability related to the release of hazardous materials . The company is concerned about how to handle such materials and how to deal with them . Some of these issues may be a result of a lack of proper permits for the company's use of certain materials . Such things may be difficult to identify or quantify, such as how long they are required .\n Compliance with environmental laws generally increases the costs of manufacturing, registration/approval requirements, transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products . We may incur substantial costs, including fines, damages, criminal or civil sanctions and remediation costs . We expect this trend to continue and to require materially increased capital expenditures and compliance costs .\n There is an increasing level of public concern relating to the perceived effect of mining activities on the environment . Publicity adverse to our operations, or the mining industry generally, could have an adverse effect on our development plans or future operations . Our relationships with the communities near our sites and other stakeholders are critical to the future success of our sites, as well as at any future development .\n In connection with the sale of certain properties and businesses, we have agreed to indemnify the purchasers of such properties for certain types of matters, such as certain breaches of representations and warranties, taxes and certain environmental matters . Discovery of contamination arising from properties that we have divested may expose us to indemnity obligations .\n We could be adversely affected by violations of U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws . We operate in some parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree, and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices . We cannot assure you that our employees or other agents will not engage in such conduct .\n In September 2023, following an internal investigation and voluntary self-reporting of potential violations of the FCPA, we finalized agreements with the U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC . In connection with this resolution, we entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the DOJ and an administrative resolution with the SEC, pursuant to which we paid a total of $218.5 million in aggregate fines, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest .\n Some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and, even if a patent application has been filed, it may not result in an issued patent . We cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable . Failure to protect our  proprietary technologies may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies .\n We could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies . Even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit, the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits . We may not prevail in intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products .\n Our lithium reserves will, without acquiring or developing additional reserves, decline as we continue to extract raw materials . Future profitability depends upon our ability to operate in a way that optimizes extraction of raw materials from the reserves we have and acquire additional lithium reserves that are economically viable . Exploration and development of lithium resources are highly speculative in nature . There is no assurance that current or future exploration programs will be successful .\n For our existing operations, we utilize geological, hydrogeological and metallurgical assumptions, financial projections and price estimates . These estimates are periodically updated to reflect changes in our operations, including modifications to our proven and probable reserves and mineralized material . There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of lithium and costs to extract recoverable recoverable ."
