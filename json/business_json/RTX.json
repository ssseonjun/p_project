See “Results of Operations” below for our definition of the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit, which are non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (non-GAAP) measures that are not defined measures under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may be calculated differently by other companies.\nWe also focus on backlog as a key financial performance measure of our forward-looking sales growth. Total backlog was $218 billion and $196 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Backlog, which is equivalent to our remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts. \nIn addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash. We focus on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital, such as free cash flow, both of which are non-GAAP measures that are not defined measures under U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies.\nConsidered together, we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value. We also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes.\nA discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in “Results of Operations”, “Segment Review”, and “Liquidity and Financial Condition”.\n39\nTable of Contents\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAs described in our “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results and Risk Factor Summar\ny\n” of this Form 10-K, our period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results among periods, including the discussion of segment results, should be viewed in this context. \nWe provide the organic change in Net sales and Cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit for our segments. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. The organic change in Net sales, Cost of sales, and Operating profit excludes acquisitions and divestitures, net, and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations and other significant non-operational items and/or significant operational items that may occur at irregular intervals (Other). Additionally, the organic change in Cost of sales and Operating profit excludes restructuring costs, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, and costs related to certain acquisition accounting adjustments. Restructuring costs generally arise from severance related to workforce reductions and facility exit costs. We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), primarily related to our Raytheon segment. Acquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss making or below market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable.\nNet Sales\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal net sales\n$\n80,738\n \n$\n68,920 \n$\n67,074 \nThe factors contributing to the total change year-over-year in Total net sales are as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nOrganic \n(1)\n$\n7,816\n \n$\n7,343 \nAcquisitions and divestitures, net\n(1,291)\n(143)\nOther\n5,293\n \n(5,354)\nTotal change\n$\n11,818\n \n$\n1,846 \n(1)    See “Results of Operations” for definition of organic. A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\nNet sales increased $7.8 billion organically in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to higher organic sales of $4.4 billion at Pratt & Whitney, $2.1 billion at Collins, and $1.7 billion at Raytheon. The $1.3 billion decrease in net sales related to Acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2024 compared to 2023, was primarily driven by the sale of our Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within our Raytheon segment completed in the first quarter of 2024. The increase in Other net sales of $5.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, was primarily driven by the absence of the net sales charge of $5.4 billion associated with the Powder Metal Matter recognized in the third quarter of 2023.\nNet sales increased $7.3 billion organically in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to higher organic sales of $3.2 billion at Collins, $3.1 billion at Pratt & Whitney, and $1.3 billion at Raytheon. The $0.1 billion decrease in net sales related to Acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily driven by the divestiture of a small non-core naval power business in the fourth quarter of 2022. The decrease in Other net sales of $5.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily driven by the net sales charge of $5.4 billion associated with the Powder Metal Matter recognized in the third quarter of 2023.\nSee “Segment Review” below for further information by segment.\n40\nTable of Contents\n% of Total Net Sales\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet sales\nProducts\n$\n59,612\n \n$\n49,571 \n$\n50,773 \n74\n \n%\n72 \n%\n76 \n%\nServices\n21,126\n \n19,349 \n16,301 \n26\n \n%\n28 \n%\n24 \n%\nTotal net sales\n$\n80,738\n \n$\n68,920 \n$\n67,074 \n100\n \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\nRefer to “Note 20: Segment Financial Data” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for the composition of external net sales by products and services by segment.\nNet products sales increased $10.0 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by the absence of the net sales charge of $5.3 billion associated with the Powder Metal Matter, and increases in external products sales of $2.4 billion at Pratt & Whitney, $1.2 billion at Collins, and $1.0 billion at Raytheon. Net services sales increased $1.8 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in external services sales of $2.0 billion at Pratt & Whitney, including the absence of a services sales charge of $0.1 billion associated with the Powder Metal Matter, and a $0.4 billion increase at Collins, partially offset by a decrease in external services sales of $0.7 billion at Raytheon, primarily driven by the sale of our CIS business completed in the first quarter of 2024.\nNet products sales decreased $1.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by a $3.8 billion decrease at Pratt & Whitney due to a net sales charge of $5.3 billion associated with the Powder Metal Matter, partially offset by increases of $2.1 billion at Collins and $0.6 billion at Raytheon. Net services sales increased $3.0 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in external services sales of $1.7 billion at Pratt & Whitney, $0.8 billion at Collins, and $0.6 billion at Raytheon, partially offset by a services sales charge of $0.1 billion associated with the Powder Metal Matter.\nOur sales to major customers were as follows:\n% of Total Net Sales\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSales to the U.S. government \n(1)\n$\n32,246\n \n$\n31,628 \n$\n30,317 \n40\n \n%\n46 \n%\n45 \n%\nForeign military sales through the U.S. government\n5,765\n \n4,974 \n5,042 \n7\n \n%\n7 \n%\n8 \n%\nForeign government direct commercial sales\n5,317\n \n4,249 \n4,327 \n7\n \n%\n6 \n%\n6 \n%\nCommercial aerospace and other commercial sales \n(2)\n37,410\n \n28,069 \n27,388 \n46\n \n%\n41 \n%\n41 \n%\nTotal net sales\n$\n80,738\n \n$\n68,920 \n$\n67,074 \n100\n \n%\n100 \n%\n100 \n%\n(1)    Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government.\n(2)    2023 includes the reduction in sales from the Powder Metal Matter.\nCost of Sales\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal cost of sales\n$\n65,328\n \n$\n56,831 \n$\n53,406 \nPercentage of net sales\n81\n \n%\n82 \n%\n80 \n%\nThe factors contributing to the change year-over-year in Total cost of sales are as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nOrganic \n(1)\n$\n6,188\n \n$\n5,721 \nAcquisitions and divestitures, net\n(1,210)\n(133)\nRestructuring\n(9)\n107 \nFAS/CAS operating adjustment\n246\n \n238 \nAcquisition accounting adjustments\n61\n \n107 \nOther\n3,222\n \n(2,615)\nTotal change\n$\n8,498\n \n$\n3,425 \n(1)    See “Results of Operations” for definition of organic. A reconciliation of this measure to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\nThe organic increase in Total cost of sales in 2024 compared to 2023 of $6.2 billion was primarily due to the organic net sales increases at Pratt & Whitney, Collins, and Raytheon noted above. The $1.2 billion decrease in cost of sales related to \n41\nTable of Contents\nAcquisitions and divestitures, net in 2024 compared to 2023, was primarily driven by the sale of our CIS business within our Raytheon segment completed in the first quarter of 2024. The increase in Other cost of sales of $3.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by the absence of the Powder Metal Matter charge recorded in the third quarter of 2023, which resulted in a $2.5 billion net reduction in cost of sales primarily reflecting our partners’ 49% share of the impact. In addition, the increase in Other cost of sales includes a $0.5 billion charge at Raytheon related to the termination of a fixed price development contract with a foreign customer, herein referred to as “Raytheon Contract Termination,” in the second quarter of 2024, and $0.2 billion of charges recorded in the first quarter of 2024 at Collins related to the recognition of unfavorable purchase commitments and an impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources.\nThe organic increase in Total cost of sales in 2023 compared to 2022 of $5.7 billion was primarily due to the organic net sales increases at Pratt & Whitney, Collins, and Raytheon noted above. The $0.1 billion decrease in cost of sales related to Acquisitions and divestitures, net in 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily driven by the divestiture of a small non-core naval power business in the fourth quarter of 2022\n.\n The decrease in Other cost of sales of $2.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by a net reduction in cost of sales of $2.5 billion primarily reflecting our partners’ 49% share of the Powder Metal Matter.\nRestructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts including workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities.\nFor discussion on FAS/CAS operating adjustment, see the “FAS/CAS operating adjustment” subsection under the “Segment Review” section below.

In addition, net product cost of sales includes increases in external products cost of sales at Pratt & Whitney, Collins, and Raytheon all driven by the products sales changes noted above, a $0.5 billion charge related to the Raytheon Contract Termination in the second quarter of 2024, and $0.2 billion of charges at Collins as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources recorded in the first quarter of 2024. Net services cost of sales increased $1.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to increases in external services cost of sales at Pratt & Whitney and Collins, partially offset by a decrease in external services cost of sales at Raytheon, all driven by the services sales changes noted above.\nNet products cost of sales increased $1.5 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in external products cost of sales at Pratt & Whitney, Collins, and Raytheon, all driven by the products sales changes noted above, partially offset by a net reduction in cost of sales of $2.5 billion primarily reflecting our partners’ 49% share of the Powder Metal Matter. Net services cost of sales increased $1.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily due to increases in external services cost of sales at Pratt & Whitney, Collins, and Raytheon, all driven by the services sales changes noted above.\nResearch and Development\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCompany-funded\n$\n2,934\n \n$\n2,805 \n$\n2,711 \nPercentage of net sales\n3.6\n \n%\n4.1 \n%\n4.0 \n%\nCustomer-funded\n (1)\n$\n4,723\n \n$\n4,456 \n$\n4,376 \nPercentage of net sales\n5.8\n \n%\n6.5 \n%\n6.5 \n%\n(1)    Included in Cost of sales in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nResearch and development spending is subject to the variable nature of program development schedules and, therefore, year-over-year fluctuations in spending levels are expected.\nThe increase in company-funded research and development of $0.1 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, was primarily driven by increased spending on commercial program development at Collins and Pratt & Whitney, partially offset by lower expenses on development programs at Raytheon. The increase in company-funded research and development of $0.1 billion in 2023 \n42\nTable of Contents\ncompared to 2022, was primarily driven by increased spending on commercial program development at Pratt & Whitney and higher program expenses at Collins, partially offset by decreased spend on other development programs.\nThe increase in customer-funded research and development of $0.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, was primarily driven by higher expenses on various military and commercial programs at Collins and increased spending at Pratt & Whitney on military programs primarily driven by the F135 Engine Core Upgrade (ECU), partially offset by lower expenses at Raytheon primarily related to the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) program. The increase in customer-funded research and development of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, was primarily driven by higher expenses on various commercial and military programs at Collins and increased spending at Pratt & Whitney on military programs, partially offset by lower expenses on various programs at Raytheon.\nSelling, General, and Administrative\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSelling, general, and administrative\n$\n5,806\n \n$\n5,809 \n$\n5,573 \nPercentage of net sales\n7.2\n \n%\n8.4 \n%\n8.3 \n%\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses in 2024 were relatively consistent with 2023, as a $0.1 billion customer bankruptcy charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2024 was offset by the absence of a $0.1 billion customer insolvency charge recorded in the second quarter of 2023, both at Pratt & Whitney.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased $0.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, primarily driven by a $0.1 billion charge at Pratt & Whitney related to a customer insolvency in the second quarter of 2023, costs related to our segment realignment and divestitures in 2023, and increased employee-related costs, partially offset by the absence of $0.1 billion of charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022 related to increased estimates for credit losses due to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on Russia sanctions.\nWe are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. Therefore, the amounts reflected above include the beneficial impact of previous restructuring actions on Selling, general, and administrative expenses.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOther income (expense), net\n$\n(132)\n$\n86 \n$\n120 \nOther income (expense), net includes equity earnings in unconsolidated entities, royalty income, foreign exchange gains and losses, and other ongoing and non-recurring items. \nThe decrease in Other income (expense), net of $0.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to a $0.9 billion charge during the second quarter of 2024 related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters. This was partially offset by a $0.4 billion gain on the sale of Raytheon’s CIS business in the first quarter of 2024, a $0.2 billion benefit from a tax related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024, a $0.1 billion gain on the sale of Collins’ Goodrich Hoist & Winch business in the fourth quarter of 2024, and an insurance recovery at Pratt & Whitney of approximately $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024. See “Note 12: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the indemnity receivable and the offsetting impacts to Income tax expense.\nOther income (expense), net in 2023 was relatively consistent with 2022, as the net unfavorable year-over-year impact of foreign exchange gains and losses of $0.1 billion, was more than offset by the absence of $0.1 billion of charges associated with the disposition of three businesses in 2022 and a $0.1 billion gain on sale of land during the first quarter of 2023. The remaining decrease was spread across individually less significant items.\nOperating Profit\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating profit\n$\n6,538\n$\n3,561\n$\n5,504\nOperating profit margin\n8.1\n \n%\n5.2 \n%\n8.2 \n%\nThe increase in Operating profit of $3.0 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by the absence of the $2.9 billion of charges associated with the Powder Metal Matter recorded in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, the increase in Operating profit was driven by the increased operating performance of our segments of approximately $1.5 billion, a $0.4 \n43\nTable of Contents\nbillion gain on sale of the CIS business recorded in the first quarter of 2024, and a $0.2 billion benefit from a tax related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024. The above items were partially offset by a $0.9 billion charge in the second quarter of 2024 related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters, a $0.6 billion charge in the second quarter of 2024 related to the Raytheon Contract Termination, and the $0.3 billion change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment which is described below in “Segment Review.” See “Note 12: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the indemnity receivable and the offsetting impacts to Income tax expense.\nThe decrease in Operating profit of $1.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by a decrease at Pratt & Whitney primarily driven by the $2.9 billion charge associated with the Powder Metal Matter and a decrease in the change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment, partially offset by an increase in Operating profit at Collins and Raytheon, all of which are described below in “Segment Review.”\nNon-service Pension Income\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNon-service pension income\n$\n(1,518)\n$\n(1,780)\n$\n(1,889)\nThe change in Non-service pension income of $0.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by the decrease in the recognized actuarial net (gain) loss as a result of the merger of the remaining Raytheon Company qualified pension plans into the RTX Consolidated Pension Plan at December 31, 2023.\nThe change in Non-service pension income of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by an increase in interest rates during 2022 and prior years’ pension asset returns performing below our expected return on plan assets (EROA) assumption, partially offset by an increase in our 2023 EROA assumption.\nInterest Expense, Net\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest expense\n$\n1,970\n \n$\n1,653 \n$\n1,300 \nInterest income\n(102)\n(100)\n(70)\nOther non-operating expense (income) \n(1)\n(6)\n(48)\n46 \nInterest expense, net\n$\n1,862\n \n$\n1,505 \n$\n1,276 \nTotal average interest expense rate - average outstanding borrowings during the year:\n4.6\n \n%\n4.3 \n%\n4.0 \n%\nTotal average interest expense rate - outstanding borrowings as of December 31:\n4.5\n \n%\n4.6 \n%\n4.0 \n%\n(1)    Primarily consists of the gains or losses on assets associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation and employee benefit plans, the gains or losses on liabilities associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation plans, and non-operating dividend income.\nInterest expense, net increased $0.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in Interest expense of $0.3 billion was primarily due to long-term debt issuances and term loan borrowings in 2023, partially offset by the reversal of interest accruals as a result of the conclusion of the examination phases of certain RTX and Rockwell Collins tax audits in the first quarter of 2024.\nInterest expense, net increased $0.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The increase in Interest expense of $0.4 billion was primarily due to the long-term debt issuances in the first and the fourth quarters of 2023, interest and fees on short-term loans related to an accelerated share repurchase (ASR), and the increase in commercial paper activity in 2023. The change in Other non-operating expense (income) of $0.1 billion was primarily driven by a change in the mark-to-market fair value of marketable securities held in trusts associated with certain of our nonqualified deferred compensation and employee benefit plans and an increase in dividend income.\nIncome Taxes\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEffective income tax rate\n19.1\n \n%\n11.9 \n%\n12.9 \n%\nThe higher 2024 effective tax rate compared to 2023 is primarily driven by the $2.9 billion Powder Metal Matter pre-tax charge and the associated tax benefit of $663 million recorded in 2023. \nThe 2024 effective tax rate includes $224 million of tax expense associated with the 2024 dispositions. Also included in the 2024 effective tax rate is a $212 million tax charge related to U.S. federal income taxes now owed by the Company resulting from a favorable non-U.S. tax ruling Otis received in 2024. The ruling reduces U.S. foreign tax credits previously claimed by the Company in pre-separation tax years. The Company also recognized a $56 million tax benefit in response to favorable U.S. \n44\nTable of Contents\nTax Court rulings issued to unrelated taxpayers, but with similar facts as ours. Both of these items are subject to a tax matters agreement entered into with Carrier and Otis in connection with the separations of those businesses in 2020. Accordingly, the Company recorded a pre-tax benefit of $212 million for a portion of the indemnity owed by Otis to the Company for the reduction in foreign taxes in the pre-separation years and a pre-tax charge of $32 million for the indemnified amounts payable to Carrier and Otis associated with the $56 million tax benefit. The Company will record the remaining amounts owed by Otis to the Company related to Otis’ non-U.S. ruling upon receipt of the amounts from Otis. Additionally, the Company is indemnified by Otis for the associated interest related to the Otis non-U.S. ruling.\nThe items above are partially offset by a $275 million tax benefit resulting from the conclusion of the examination phases of the U.S. federal income tax audits for RTX 2017 and 2018 tax years and Rockwell Collins 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years, as well as, a $138 million deferred tax benefit associated with legal entity reorganizations. \nThe lower 2023 effective tax rate compared to 2022 is primarily driven by a favorable impact related to the $2.9 billion charge for the Powder Metal Matter and the associated tax benefit of $663 million, and the absence of a $207 million tax benefit recorded in 2022 related to legal entity and operational reorganizations.\nFor additional discussion of income taxes and the effective income tax rate, see “Income Taxes” within Critical Accounting Estimates below, and “Note 12: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nNet Income from Continuing Operations Attributable to Common Shareowners\n(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners \n$\n4,774\n \n$\n3,195 \n$\n5,216 \nDiluted earnings per share from continuing operations\n$\n3.55\n \n$\n2.23 \n$\n3.51 \nNet income from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners for 2024 includes the following:\n•\nacquisition accounting adjustments of $1.6 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $1.20;\n•\na charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters of $0.9 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.65;\n•\na charge of $0.4 billion, net of tax, related to the Raytheon Contract Termination, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.33;\n•\nbenefit recognized as a result of the conclusion of the examination phases of the RTX and Rockwell Collins tax audits of $0.3 billion, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.21;\n•\na gain on sale of the CIS business, net of transaction and other related costs, of $0.2 billion, net of tax, which had a favorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.18;\n•\ncharges related to initiating alternative titanium sources at our Collins segment of $0.2 billion, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.13;\n•\nrestructuring charges of $0.2 billion, net of tax, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.12;\n•\na charge of $0.1 billion, net of tax, related to a customer bankruptcy, which had an unfavorable impact on diluted EPS from continuing operations of $0.09;

Segment Total net sales and Operating profit (loss) include intercompany sales and profit, which are ultimately eliminated within Eliminations and other, which also includes certain smaller non-reportable segments. Segment results exclude certain acquisition accounting adjustments, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, and certain corporate expenses, as further discussed below.\nWe present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our Raytheon segment. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally expect to recover the related Raytheon pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt & Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis.\nGiven the nature of our business, we believe that Total net sales and Operating profit (loss) (and the related operating profit (loss) margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management’s view of our segment performance, as described below.\nWe provide the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments as discussed above in “Results of Operations.” We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability. For Pratt & Whitney only, Other also includes the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging at Pratt & Whitney Canada due to its significance to Pratt & Whitney’s overall operating results.\nTotal Net Sales. \nTotal net sales by segment were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCollins Aerospace\n$\n28,284\n \n$\n26,253 \n$\n23,052 \nPratt & Whitney \n(1)\n28,066\n \n18,296 \n20,530 \nRaytheon\n26,713\n \n26,350 \n25,176 \nTotal segment\n83,063\n \n70,899 \n68,758 \nEliminations and other\n(2,325)\n(1,979)\n(1,684)\nConsolidated\n$\n80,738\n \n$\n68,920 \n$\n67,074 \n(1)    2023 includes the reduction in sales from the Powder Metal Matter.\n46\nTable of Contents\nOperating Profit (Loss). \nOperating profit (loss) by segment was as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCollins Aerospace\n$\n4,135\n \n$\n3,825 \n$\n2,816 \nPratt & Whitney \n(1)\n2,015\n \n(1,455)\n1,075 \nRaytheon\n2,594\n \n2,379 \n2,448 \nTotal segment\n8,744\n \n4,749 \n6,339 \nEliminations and other\n(48)\n(42)\n(23)\nCorporate expenses and other unallocated items \n(2) (3)\n(933)\n(275)\n(318)\nFAS/CAS operating adjustment\n833\n \n1,127 \n1,399 \nAcquisition accounting adjustments\n(2,058)\n(1,998)\n(1,893)\nConsolidated\n$\n6,538\n \n$\n3,561 \n$\n5,504 \n(1)    2023 includes the impacts from the Powder Metal Matter.\n(2)    2022 includes the net expenses related to the U.S. Army’s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) program. Beginning in 2023, LTAMDS results are included in the Raytheon segment. \n(3)    Includes a $0.9 billion charge in the second quarter of 2024 related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nIncluded in segment Operating profit (loss) are Estimate at Completion (EAC) adjustments, which relate to changes in Operating profit and margin due to revisions to total estimated revenues and costs at completion. These changes may reflect improved or deteriorated operating performance, as well as changes in facts and assumptions related to contract options, contract modifications, incentive and award fees associated with program performance, customer activity levels, and other customer-directed changes. For a full description of our EAC process, refer to “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Given that we have thousands of individual contracts, and given the types and complexity of the assumptions and estimates we must make on an on-going basis and the nature of the work required to be performed under our contracts, we have both favorable and unfavorable EAC adjustments in the ordinary course.\nWe had the following net EAC adjustments for the periods presented:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet EAC adjustments\n$\n(473)\n$\n(648)\n$\n(37)\nThe change in net EAC adjustments of $0.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to favorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon, partially offset by unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Collins. The change at Pratt was primarily driven by the absence of a $0.1 billion unfavorable impact recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the Powder Metal Matter. The change at Collins was spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver. The change at Raytheon was primarily due to improvement in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts.\nIn addition to the amounts included in the table above, during the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of obtaining critical licenses and further regulatory approvals, we restarted work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer and began recognizing revenue on these contracts. As a result, Raytheon recognized a net operating profit benefit of $0.1 billion primarily related to reserve and contract loss provision adjustments. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2024, Raytheon initiated the termination of a fixed price development contract with a foreign customer (Raytheon Contract Termination) and recognized a $0.6 billion charge related to the impact of the termination. The charge included the write-off of remaining contract assets and the estimated settlement with the customer. The contract termination was completed and customer settlement occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024, in line with previously accrued amounts.  \nThe change in net EAC adjustments of $0.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Pratt & Whitney and to a lesser extent at Collins and Raytheon. Included in the change at Pratt & Whitney was the unfavorable impact of $0.1 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the Powder Metal Matter and an unfavorable impact of approximately $60 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost on a military program. The change in net EAC adjustments at Pratt & Whitney also includes the absence of a $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket program in the second quarter of 2022. The change at Collins was spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver. The change at Raytheon was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts and $51 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments related to significant contract options exercised in 2023. \n47\nTable of Contents\nSignificant EAC adjustments, when they occur, are discussed in each business segment’s discussion below.\nBacklog and Bookings. \nTotal backlog was approximately $218 billion and $196 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our backlog by segment, which excludes intercompany backlog, was as follows at December 31:\n(dollars in billions)\n2024\n2023\nCollins Aerospace\n$\n36\n \n$\n30 \nPratt & Whitney\n119\n \n114 \nRaytheon\n63\n \n52 \nTotal backlog\n$\n218\n \n$\n196 \nTotal backlog includes commercial backlog of $125 billion and $118 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and defense backlog of $93 billion and $78 billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nBacklog, which is equivalent to our RPO for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not been provided or service has not been performed and excludes unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts as discussed further below. \nWe believe bookings are an important measure of future performance for our defense businesses. Our defense operations consist primarily of our Raytheon business and operations in the defense businesses within our Collins and Pratt & Whitney segments. Defense bookings were approximately $61 billion, $51 billion, and $47 billion for 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively. \nDefense bookings generally represent the dollar value of new external defense contracts awarded to us during the reporting period and include firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated. Defense bookings exclude unexercised contract options and potential orders under ordering-type contracts (e.g., IDIQ type contracts). We reflect contract cancellations and terminations, as well as the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, directly as an adjustment to backlog in the period in which the cancellation or termination occurs and the impact is determinable. Contract cancellations and terminations also include contract underruns on cost-type programs.\nCollins Aerospace\n% Change\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 compared with 2023\n2023 compared with 2022\nNet sales\n$\n28,284\n \n$\n26,253 \n$\n23,052 \n8\n \n%\n14 \n%\nOperating profit\n4,135\n \n3,825 \n2,816 \n8\n \n%\n36 \n%\nOperating profit margins\n14.6\n \n%\n14.6 \n%\n12.2 \n%\n2024 Compared with 2023\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n2,096 \n$\n(18)\n$\n— \n$\n(47)\n$\n2,031 \nOperating profit\n618 \n(3)\n24 \n(329)\n310 \n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n2023 Compared with 2022\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n3,173 \n$\n(48)\n$\n— \n$\n76 \n$\n3,201 \nOperating profit\n889 \n(2)\n(50)\n172 \n1,009 \n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n48\nTable of Contents\n2024 Compared with 2023\nThe organic net sales increase of $2.1 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily relates to higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $1.2 billion, higher defense sales of $0.8 billion, and higher commercial aerospace OEM sales of $0.1 billion. The increase in commercial aerospace sales was principally driven by continued growth in commercial air traffic, which has resulted in an increase in flight hours and increased OEM volume primarily within wide-body and regional aircraft, partially offset by decreased OEM volume in narrow-body aircraft. The defense sales increase was primarily due to higher volume across multiple programs and platforms.\nThe organic operating profit increase of $0.6 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.4 billion, principally driven by the higher aftermarket sales volume discussed above, partially offset by unfavorable OEM mix. Defense operating profit increased $0.3 billion 2024 compared to 2023 due to the higher volume discussed above, partially offset by higher space program costs. The above increases were partially offset by $0.1 billion of higher research and development costs.\nThe decrease in Other operating profit of $0.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by $0.2 billion of charges in the first quarter of 2024, related to the recognition of unfavorable purchase commitments and an impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources, $0.2 billion impairment of contract fulfillment costs in the fourth quarter of 2024 due to a contract cancellation, and the absence of net favorable customer settlements recorded in 2023. These decreases in Other operating profit were partially offset by a $0.1 billion net gain on the sale of the Goodrich Hoist & Winch business in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nRestructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts driven by various workforce reductions.\n2023 Compared with 2022\nThe organic net sales increase of $3.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily relates to higher commercial aerospace aftermarket sales of $2.1 billion, including increases across all aftermarket sales channels. These increases were principally driven by the continued recovery of commercial air traffic which resulted in an increase in flight hours. Commercial aerospace OEM sales increased $1.1 billion due to increased production rates in narrow-body, wide-body, and business jets. Military sales were relatively consistent in 2023 compared to 2022.\nThe increase in Other net sales of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to net favorable customer settlements in 2023, including a $0.1 billion favorable customer settlement recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023, partially offset by a $0.1 billion charge related to a customer litigation matter recorded in the third quarter 2023.\nThe organic operating profit increase of $0.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher commercial aftermarket volume and favorable mix, partially offset by lower commercial aerospace OEM as drop through on volume was more than offset by higher production costs. This increase in commercial aerospace operating profit was partially offset by $0.2 billion of higher selling, general, and administrative expenses and research and developments costs primarily due to increased employee-related costs. Military operating profit decreased $0.1 billion primarily due to unfavorable mix and higher production costs.\nThe increase in Other operating profit of $0.2 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the absence of $0.1 billion of pre-tax charges related to global sanctions and export controls with respect to Russia recorded in 2022, the absence of $0.1 billion of charges associated with the disposition of two non-core businesses in 2022, and the net favorable customer settlements discussed above. The above items were partially offset by $0.1 billion of divestiture costs related to the pending sale of our actuation and flight control business. \nSee “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on Russia sanctions. See “Note 2: Acquisitions and Dispositions” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion on business dispositions.\nDefense Bookings \n– In addition to a number of smaller bookings in 2024, Collins booked $2.2 billion to support the U.S. Air Force’s next-generation Survivable Airborne Operations Center, $470 million for Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) air traffic control automation system sustainment, and $391 million for F-35 landing gear Lots 18, 19, and 20.\n49\nTable of Contents\nPratt & Whitney\n% Change\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 compared with 2023\n2023 compared with 2022\nNet sales\n$\n28,066\n$\n18,296\n$\n20,530\n53\n \n%\n(11)\n%\nOperating profit (loss)\n2,015\n(1,455)\n1,075\nNM\n(235)\n%\nOperating profit (loss) margins\n7.2\n \n%\n(8.0)\n%\n5.2 \n%\nNM = Not meaningful\n2024 Compared with 2023\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n4,386 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n5,384 \n$\n9,770 \nOperating profit (loss)\n559 \n— \n(28)\n2,939 \n3,470 \n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n2023 Compared with 2022\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n3,133 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n(5,367)\n$\n(2,234)\nOperating profit (loss)\n410 \n— \n(54)\n(2,886)\n(2,530)\n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n2024 Compared with 2023\n \nThe organic net sales increase of $4.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily reflects higher commercial OEM sales of $1.7 billion primarily driven by favorable mix on higher volume and higher commercial aftermarket sales of $1.6 billion primarily driven by higher volume. Military sales increased $1.1 billion, primarily due to higher sustainment and production volume across multiple platforms.\nThe Other net sales increase of $5.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily relates to the absence of a charge recognized in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Powder Metal Matter.\nThe organic operating profit increase of $0.6 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 reflects higher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.4 billion driven by favorable mix on higher large commercial OEM volume which was partially offset by higher OEM production costs. Commercial aerospace operating profit also benefited from higher commercial aftermarket volume, which was partially offset by the impact of a shift in aftermarket mix towards higher GTF volume as well as two favorable contract matters in 2023 totaling $0.1 billion that did not repeat in 2024. The increase in military operating profit of $0.2 billion was driven by the increases from the sales volume discussed above, as well as favorable sustainment mix, partially offset by higher production costs. Military operating profit also benefited from the absence of an unfavorable EAC adjustment of approximately $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, which was partially offset by an unfavorable EAC adjustment of approximately $50 million in the fourth quarter of 2024. \nHigher research and development expenses and selling, general, and administrative expenses were partially offset by an insurance recovery of approximately $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nThe change in Other operating profit (loss) of $2.9 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 reflects the absence of a charge recognized in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Powder Metal Matter of $2.9 billion and a $0.2 billion charge related to a customer insolvency in the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by a $0.2 billion charge related to a customer bankruptcy in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nRestructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts including workforce reductions and the consolidation of facilities.\n2023 Compared with 2022\nThe organic net sales increase of $3.1 billion in \n2023 compared to 2022\n primarily reflects \nhigher commercial aftermarket sales of $1.9 billion, primarily due to an increase in volume, content, and favorable mix. The increase also includes higher commercial OEM sales of $0.9 billion, primarily driven by higher volume and favorable mix. Military sales increased $0.3 billion, primarily due to higher F135 sustainment volume.\n50\nTable of Contents\nThe Other net sales decrease of $5.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the charge recognized in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Powder Metal Matter.\nThe organic operating profit increase of $0.4 billion in \n2023 compared to 2022\n was primarily driven by \nhigher commercial aerospace operating profit of $0.6 billion, principally due to the aftermarket sales increase discussed above, partially offset by lower commercial OEM operating profit as the OEM volume increase combined with higher production costs more than offset the benefit from favorable mix. Commercial aerospace operating profit in 2023 also benefited from two favorable contract matters totaling $0.1 billion, which was partially offset by the absence of a prior year $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket contract. Military operating profit was relatively consistent compared to 2022. The increase from the military sales volume was more than offset by higher production costs and an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Higher research and development expenses were partially offset by lower selling, general, and administrative expenses.\n \nThe change in Other operating profit (loss) of $2.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the charge recognized in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Powder Metal Matter of $2.9 billion and a $0.2 billion charge related to a customer insolvency during the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by the absence of $0.2 billion of pre-tax charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022 related to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on Russia sanctions.\nDefense Bookings \n– In addition to a number of smaller bookings, in 2024 Pratt & Whitney booked $2.3 billion for F117 sustainment, $2.2 billion for F135 sustainment, $1.5 billion for F135 ECU development, $729 million for F135 production, and $475 million for F119 sustainment.\nRaytheon\n% Change\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 compared with 2023\n2023 compared with 2022\nNet sales\n$\n26,713\n$\n26,350 \n$\n25,176 \n1\n \n%\n5 \n%\nOperating profit\n2,594\n2,379 \n2,448 \n9\n \n%\n(3)\n%\nOperating profit margins\n9.7\n \n%\n9.0 \n%\n9.7 \n%\nDefense Bookings\n$\n39,235\n$\n31,889 \n$\n30,479 \n23\n \n%\n5 \n%\n2024 Compared with 2023\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n1,691 \n$\n(1,274)\n$\n— \n$\n(54)\n$\n363 \nOperating Profit\n352 \n(74)\n6 \n(69)\n215 \n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n2023 Compared with 2022\n \nFactors Contributing to Total Change\n(dollars in millions)\nOrganic \n(1)\nAcquisitions /\nDivestitures, net\nRestructuring\nCosts\nOther\nTotal Change\nNet sales\n$\n1,292 \n$\n(95)\n$\n— \n$\n(23)\n$\n1,174 \nOperating Profit\n(58)\n— \n(34)\n23 \n(69)\n(1)    See “Segment Review” above for definition of organic.\n A reconciliation of these measures to reported U.S. GAAP amounts is provided in the table above.\n2024 Compared with 2023\nThe organic net sales increase of $1.7 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher net sales of $1.4 billion from land and air defense systems programs driven by higher net sales on certain international Patriot programs, certain international National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) programs, and Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) programs. Also contributing to the increase was higher net sales of $0.4 billion from advanced technology programs primarily driven by higher volume on classified programs and on a development program. Additionally, the organic net sales increase includes $0.3 billion of sales associated with the restart of certain contracts with a Middle East customer. \n51\nTable of Contents\nThese increases were partially offset by lower net sales of $0.5 billion from air and space defense systems programs primarily due to the completion of certain programs, and the timing of a prior year program award.\nThe decrease in Other net sales in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by $0.1 billion related to the Raytheon Contract Termination initiated in the second quarter of 2024.\nThe organic operating profit increase of $0.4 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher volume of $0.2 billion primarily driven by the net sales increases noted above and an improvement in net EAC adjustments of $0.2 billion. The change in net EAC adjustments was primarily due to improvement in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts. Included in the change in net EAC adjustments was a benefit from the absence of a $51 million unfavorable adjustment in 2023 related to significant contract options exercised, which was offset by a $53 million unfavorable EAC adjustment in the third quarter of 2024 related to cost increases on a classified program.\nThe decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily relates to the sale of the CIS business completed in the first quarter of 2024.\nThe decrease in Other operating profit in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by $0.6 billion related to the Raytheon Contract Termination initiated in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $0.4 billion gain on the sale of the CIS business in the first quarter of 2024, and a $0.1 billion net benefit primarily related to reserve and contract loss provision adjustments recognized in the fourth quarter of 2024 as a result of restarting work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer.\n2023 Compared with 2022\nThe organic net sales increase of $1.3 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher net sales of $0.5 billion from advanced technology programs, $0.3 billion from air and space defense systems programs, $0.2 billion from cybersecurity, intelligence and services programs, and $0.2 billion from naval power programs. The increase in advanced technology programs includes higher net sales on an advanced development program awarded in the third quarter of 2022, and higher net sales on certain classified programs awarded in 2022. The increase in air and space defense systems programs includes higher net sales on the StormBreaker program, driven by awards in the first and fourth quarters of 2023 and higher net sales on the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) program, driven by an award in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in cybersecurity, intelligence and services programs was driven by certain classified programs as well as federal and civil programs. The increase in naval power programs was due to higher volumes on Naval Strike Missile and AIM-9X programs.\nThe organic operating profit decrease of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an unfavorable change in mix and other performance of $0.1 billion, and an unfavorable net change in EAC adjustments of $0.1 billion, partially offset by higher volume of $0.2 billion. The unfavorable change in mix and other performance was primarily driven by an expected decline in certain higher margin international programs and higher volume on various lower margin programs including early production phase programs. The net change in EAC adjustments was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts and approximately $50 million of unfavorable EAC adjustments related to significant contract options exercised in 2023. The increase in volume was principally driven by the higher net sales discussed above.\nThe increase in Other operating profit in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by the absence of a $42 million charge in 2022 associated with a divestiture of a small non-core naval power business, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.\nThe decrease in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily relates to the divestiture of a small non-core naval power business in the first quarter of 2023.\nRestructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts including workforce reductions.\nDefense Backlog and Bookings\n– Backlog was $63 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $52 billion at December 31, 2023. Included in the change in backlog was a $1.1 billion reduction related to the sale of the CIS business and a $0.9 billion increase related to restarting work on certain contracts with a Middle East customer, as discussed above. In addition to a number of smaller bookings, in 2024, Raytheon booked $2.4 billion to provide Patriot Air Defense systems to Germany, $1.9 billion for low-rate initial production of LTAMDS for the U.S. Army and Poland, $1.6 billion to provide Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) to the U.S. Navy and international customers, $1.4 billion to provide Guidance Enhanced Missiles (GEM-T) for NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), $1.2 billion to provide AMRAAM to the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and international customers, $1.0 billion to provide Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) for the U.S. Navy and international consortium partners, $848 million to provide Patriot Air Defense systems, including GEM-T missiles, to Romania, $763 million to provide Stinger missiles to NSPA and Poland, $737 million to provide AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles for the U.S. Navy, \n52\nTable of Contents\nU.S. Air Force, and international customers, $639 million to produce AN/SPY-6(V) radars for the U.S. Navy, $623 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer, $591 million for Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band (NGJ-MB) for the U.S. Navy and the Royal Australian Air Force, $538 million to provide Javelin for the U.S. Army and international customers, $530 million to provide Patriot launchers for Poland, $479 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer, $473 million for an Advanced Tactical Electro-Optical Infrared (EO/IR) system for the U.S. Air Force, $453 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer, $393 million to design and build the Landsat Next Instrument Suite (LandIS) for NASA, $333 million to provide Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) for the U.S. Navy, $301 million to provide Tomahawk to the U.S. Navy and international customers, $282 million to provide Stormbreaker to the U.S. Air Force, $282 million to provide NASAMS for Ukraine, $272 million for Standard Missile II (SM-2) provisioned items and ordered spares for the U.S. Navy, $251 million to provide GEM-T for an international customer, and $5.7 billion on a number of classified contracts.\nCorporate and Eliminations and other\nEliminations and other reflects the elimination of sales, other income, and operating profit transacted between segments, as well as the operating results of certain smaller operations. \nCorporate expenses and other unallocated items consists of costs not considered part of management’s evaluation of reportable segment operating performance, including certain unallowable costs and reserves. In addition, in 2022, net costs associated with corporate research and development related to the LTAMDS program were included in Corporate expenses and other unallocated items. Beginning in 2023, the remaining net costs associated with the LTAMDS program are reflected within the Raytheon segment.\nNet Sales\nOperating Profit\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEliminations and other\n$\n(2,325)\n$\n(1,979)\n$\n(1,684)\n$\n(48)\n$\n(42)\n$\n(23)\nCorporate expenses and other unallocated items\n—\n \n— \n— \n(933)\n(275)\n(318)\nThe increase in eliminations and other net sales of $0.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by Collins. Eliminations and other operating profit in 2024 was relatively consistent with 2023.\nThe increase in eliminations and other net sales of $0.3 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an increase in intersegment eliminations, principally driven by Collins. Eliminations and other operating profit in 2023 was relatively consistent with 2022.\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $0.7 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to a $0.9 billion charge related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters recorded in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $0.2 billion benefit from a tax related indemnity receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2024.\nThe change in corporate expenses and other unallocated items of $43 million in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to a decrease in expenses related to the LTAMDS program, which are included in the Raytheon segment beginning in 2023, partially offset by an increase in costs related to our segment realignment in 2023, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.\nFAS/CAS operating adjustment\nThe segment results of Raytheon include pension and PRB expense as determined under U.S. government CAS, which we generally recover through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. The difference between our CAS expense and the FAS service cost attributable to these segments under U.S. GAAP is the FAS/CAS operating adjustment. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment results in consolidated pension expense in operating profit equal to the service cost component of FAS expense under U.S. GAAP. The segment results of Collins and Pratt & Whitney generally include FAS service cost.\nThe CAS expense calculation is different from the FAS requirements and calculation methodology. While the ultimate liability for pension costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Our CAS pension expense is comprised primarily of CAS service cost and amortization amounts resulting from demographic or economic experience different than expected, changes in assumptions, or changes in plan provisions. Unlike FAS, CAS expense is only recognized for plans that are not fully funded on a CAS basis. Consequently, if plans become or cease to be fully funded under CAS due to our asset or liability experience, our CAS expense will change accordingly.\n53\nTable of Contents\nThe components of the FAS/CAS operating adjustment were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFAS service cost (expense)\n$\n(138)\n$\n(145)\n$\n(336)\nCAS expense\n971\n \n1,272 \n1,735 \nFAS/CAS operating adjustment\n$\n833\n \n$\n1,127 \n$\n1,399 \nThe change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $0.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 was driven by a decrease in CAS expense, primarily due to the recognition of historical CAS gain/loss experience. \nThe change in our FAS/CAS operating adjustment of $0.3 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was driven by a $0.5 billion decrease in CAS expense, partially offset by a $0.2 billion decrease in FAS service cost. The decrease in CAS expense was primarily due to changes to the Raytheon Company domestic pension plans announced in December 2020 that were effective December 31, 2022, and the recognition of historical CAS gain/loss experience. Similarly, the decrease in FAS service cost was primarily due to changes to the Raytheon Company domestic pension plans announced in December 2020 that were effective December 31, 2022. Refer to “Note 10: Employee Benefit Plans” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on the Raytheon Company domestic pension plan change.\nAcquisition accounting adjustments\nAcquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss-making or below-market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable. These adjustments are not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment results.\nThe components of Acquisition accounting adjustments were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAmortization of acquired intangibles \n$\n(2,095)\n$\n(2,021)\n$\n(1,912)\nAmortization of property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment\n(44)\n(60)\n(89)\nAmortization of customer contractual obligations related to acquired loss-making and below-market contracts\n81\n \n83 \n108 \nAcquisition accounting adjustments\n$\n(2,058)\n$\n(1,998)\n$\n(1,893)\nAcquisition accounting adjustments related to acquisitions in each segment were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCollins Aerospace\n$\n(833)\n$\n(854)\n$\n(865)\nPratt & Whitney\n(312)\n(287)\n(243)\nRaytheon\n(913)\n(857)\n(785)\nAcquisition accounting adjustments\n$\n(2,058)\n$\n(1,998)\n$\n(1,893)\nAcquisition accounting adjustments in 2024 and 2023 were relatively consistent with 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n5,578\n \n$\n6,587 \nTotal debt\n41,261\n \n43,827 \nTotal equity\n61,923\n \n61,410 \nTotal capitalization (total debt plus total equity)\n103,184\n \n105,237 \nTotal debt to total capitalization\n40\n \n%\n42 \n%\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing, and financing activities and the timing of such activities. Our principal source of liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. In addition to operating cash flows, other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include: capital expenditures, customer financing requirements, investments in and divestitures of businesses, dividends, common stock repurchases, pension funding, access to \n54\nTable of Contents\nthe commercial paper markets, adequacy of available bank lines of credit, redemptions of debt, and the ability to attract long-term capital at satisfactory terms. \nAt December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.6 billion, of which 41% was held by RTX’s foreign subsidiaries. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. The Company intends to repatriate certain undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries that have been previously taxed in the U.S. Taxes associated with the future remittance of these earnings have been recorded. For the remainder of the Company’s undistributed international earnings, unless tax effective to repatriate, RTX will continue to permanently reinvest these earnings. \nOur ability to access global debt markets and the related cost of these borrowings depends on the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our S&P Global credit rating remains at BBB+/negative, and our Moody’s Investors Service outlook is Baa1/negative. Though the Company expects to continue having adequate access to funds, declines in our credit ratings or Company outlook could result in higher borrowing costs.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a revolving credit agreement with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $5.0 billion, which expires in August 2028. As of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement. In addition, at December 31, 2024, approximately $0.7 billion was available under short-term lines of credit primarily with global banks at our international subsidiaries.\nFrom time to time, we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments, and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2024, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $5.0 billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $5.0 billion revolving credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2024.\nThere were no issuances of long-term debt during 2024. During 2024, we made the following repayments of long-term debt:\nDate\nDescription of Notes\nAggregate Principal Balance (in millions)\nDecember 24, 2024\n3 Month Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 1.225% Term Loan due 2025\n$\n500\n \nDecember 15, 2024\n3.150% notes due 2024\n300\n \nMay 7, 2024\n3 Month SOFR plus 1.225% term loan due 2025\n250\n \nApril 17, 2024\n3 Month SOFR plus 1.225% term loan due 2025\n250\n \nApril 4, 2024\n3 Month SOFR plus 1.225% term loan due 2025\n250\n \nMarch 15, 2024\n3.200% notes due 2024\n950\n \nWe have an existing universal shelf registration statement, which we filed with the \nSEC\n on September 22, 2022, for an indeterminate amount of debt and equity securities for future issuance, subject to our internal limitations on the amount of debt to be issued under this shelf registration statement. \nThe Company offers voluntary supply chain finance (SCF) programs with global financial institutions which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to the financial institutions at a rate that leverages our credit rating, which might be beneficial to them. Our suppliers’ participation in the SCF programs does not impact or change our terms and conditions with those suppliers, and therefore, we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the programs. In addition, we do not pay for any of the costs of the programs incurred by those suppliers that choose to participate, and have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to sales of receivables made by those suppliers. As such, the SCF programs do not impact our working capital, cash flows, or overall liquidity.\nWe believe our cash on hand and future operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Further, we continue to have access to the commercial paper markets and our existing credit facilities, and our ability to obtain debt or equity financing, as well as the availability under committed credit lines, provides additional potential sources of liquidity should they be required.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCash Flow - Operating Activities\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations\n$\n7,159\n \n$\n7,883 \n$\n7,168 \n2024 Compared with 2023 Operating Activities \nNet income from continuing operations in 2024 included charges of $0.9 billion related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and $0.4 billion related to the Raytheon Contract Termination, net of tax. Net income from continuing operations in 2023 included a $2.2 billion charge related to the Powder Metal Matter, net of tax. The Powder Metal Matter also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by $2.8 billion in 2023. Utilization of Other accrued liabilities in 2024 related to this matter were $1.0 billion and represent cash paid and credits issued to customers. During 2024, we also paid a combined $1.5 billion related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters and the Raytheon Contract Termination.\nAdditionally, a favorable impact from accounts receivable collections, including the related impact of factoring as discussed below, and a favorable change in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities driven by timing of payments and an increase in material purchases, partially offset by the net change in contract assets and contract liabilities, primarily at Pratt & Whitney, due to sales in excess of billings, contributed to an increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2024 compared to 2023. Excluding the charges discussed above, higher net income from continuing operations after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax benefit, stock compensation cost, net periodic pension and other postretirement income, and gain on sale of business also contributed to an increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by the operating performance of our segments.\nThe Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. Factoring activity resulted in an increase of $0.1 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during \n2024\n, compared to a decrease of $0.8 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during \n2023\n.\n2023 Compared with 2022 Operating Activities \nNet income from continuing operations in \n2023 included a \n$2.2 billion charge related to the Powder Metal Matter, net of tax, which had no effect on cash flow in the period. This charge also had the effect of increasing Other accrued liabilities by $2.8 billion in \n2023\n. Excluding the impact of this charge, the favorable change in cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations in \n2023\n compared to \n2022\n, is primarily driven by higher net income from continuing operations after adjustments for depreciation and amortization, deferred income tax benefit, stock compensation cost, and net periodic pension and other postretirement income. Also contributing to the change in cash flows is a net favorable impact of net contract assets and liabilities due to the timing of collections, a net decrease in tax payments further discussed below, and lower inventory receipts compared to 2022. These favorable changes were partially offset by higher accounts receivable as a result of increased sales volume and timing of collections and a decrease in factoring.\n \nThe Company enters into various factoring agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its receivables. Factoring activity resulted in a decrease of $0.8 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during 2023, compared to an increase of $2.3 billion in cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations during 2022. Factoring activity included amounts factored on certain aerospace receivables at the customers’ request for which we may be compensated by the customer\nOperating Activities\nWe made pension and PRB contributions to trusts of $0.1 billion, $0.2 billion, and $0.1 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Included in the 2023 contributions is a discretionary noncash contribution of $50 million made in RTX common stock to our U.S. qualified pension plans. \nWe make both required and discretionary contributions to our pension plans. Required contributions are primarily determined by \nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)\n funding rules, which require us to fully fund our U.S qualified pension plans over a rolling fifteen-year period as determined annually based on the calculated funded status at the beginning of each year per the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and subsequent amendments. The funding requirements are primarily based on the year’s expected service cost and amortization of other previously unfunded liabilities, which are dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets, the level of market interest rates, and actuarial assumptions. \n56\nTable of Contents\nGlobal pension and PRB cash funding requirements are expected to be approximately $0.3 billion in 2025, which includes benefit payments to be paid directly by the Company. We can contribute cash or RTX shares to our plans at our discretion, subject to applicable regulations. As of December 31, 2024, the total investment by the U.S. qualified pension plans in RTX shares was less than 1% of total plan assets.\nOur domestic defined contribution plan uses an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) for certain employer matching contributions. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we expanded the use of ESOP shares to fund our matching contributions to additional participants who had previously received matching contributions in cash.\nWe made net income tax payments of $1.2 billion, $1.5 billion, and $2.4 billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. A provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 related to the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes became effective on January 1, 2022. As such, we made incremental income tax payments of $1.6 billion in 2022. In September and December 2023, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued interim guidance, retroactive to 2022, clarifying the capitalization requirements for certain types of research and experimental expenditures. The Company’s analysis indicates the guidance provided in the notices will result in fewer costs being subject to capitalization, and as such, costs previously required to be capitalized are now deductible in the year incurred. These notices resulted in the Company making lower income tax payments in 2023 compared to 2022.\nIncluded in cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations are payments related to our operating lease obligations. See “Note 11: Leases” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for actual and expected payments on operating lease obligations.\nIn addition, the majority of our cash flows for purchase obligations are classified as cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations. We expect future payments related to our purchase obligations to be $40.1 billion, of which $25.5 billion is payable in 2025. Purchase obligations include current amounts committed for the purchase of goods and services under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders, and do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future. Approximately 50% of our purchase obligations described above represent purchase orders for products to be delivered under firm contracts with the U.S. government for which we have full recourse under customary contract termination clauses.\nWhile the timing of cash flows are subject to a number of variables, for the Powder Metal Matter we estimate the accrual for expected customer compensation to be utilized consistent with the timing of execution of the fleet management plan, the period of increased aircraft on ground levels, and contractual terms with customers. We currently estimate a full year 2025 cash impact related to the Powder Metal Matter of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion, which includes the impact of cash paid, customer credits applied and the timing of partner recovery.\nCash Flow - Investing Activities\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations\n$\n(1,534)\n$\n(3,039)\n$\n(2,829)\nOur investing activities primarily include capital expenditures, cash investments in customer financing assets, investments in and dispositions of businesses, payments related to our collaboration intangible assets and contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms, and settlements of derivative contracts not designated as hedging instruments.\n2024 Compared with 2023 Investing Activities\nThe $1.5 billion change in cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily related to the cash proceeds from the sale of our CIS business within our Raytheon segment and the sale of our Goodrich Hoist & Winch business within our Collins segment of approximately $1.3 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively.\n2023 Compared with 2022 Investing Activities\nThe $0.2 billion change in cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily related to an increase in payments for intangible assets discussed below and capital expenditures primarily due to investments in production facilities at Pratt & Whitney and Raytheon, partially offset by the timing of our derivative contract settlements.\nInvesting Activities\nThere were no significant acquisitions in 2024, 2023, or 2022. For information on dispositions of businesses in 2024, 2023, or 2022, see above or “Note 2: Acquisitions and Dispositions” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n57\nTable of Contents\nIn 2024, 2023, and 2022 our intangible assets increased by $0.6 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.5 billion, respectively, primarily related to collaboration payment commitments made under our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE) and exclusivity payments made on contractual commitments included within intangible assets. At December 31, 2024, we had commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments, including exclusivity and collaboration payment commitments, of approximately $14.1 billion, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners’ share. Refer to “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details on our commercial aerospace financing and other contractual commitments.\nAs discussed in “Note 13: Financial Instruments” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing, and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts, and options, to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate, and commodity price exposures. During 2024 and 2022, we had net cash payments of $142 million and $205 million, respectively and had net cash receipts of $14 million during 2023, from the settlement of these derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. \nCash Flow - Financing Activities\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations\n$\n(6,617)\n$\n(4,527)\n$\n(5,859)\nOur financing activities primarily include the issuance and repayment of commercial paper and other short-term and long-term debt, payment of dividends, and share repurchases.\n2024 Compared with 2023 Financing Activities\nThe $2.1 billion increase in cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2024 compared to the 2023 was primarily driven by higher year-over-year long-term debt repayments of $1.9 billion. Prior year long-term debt proceeds of $12.9 billion were partially offset by lower year-over-year share repurchases of $12.4 billion, primarily related to the prior year ASR.\n2023 Compared with 2022 Financing Activities\nThe $1.3 billion decrease in cash flows used in financing activities from continuing operations in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by long-term debt proceeds of $12.9 billion, partially offset by higher share repurchases of $10.1 billion primarily related to the ASR, an increase in repayment of commercial paper borrowings, net of $1.0 billion, and repayments of long-term debt of $0.6 billion.\nFinancing Activities\nIncluded in cash flows from financing activities from continuing operations are principal payments related to our long-term debt. A summary of our long-term debt commitments, including interest payments which are included in cash flows provided by operating activities from continuing operations, as of December 31, 2024 was as follows:\n \nPayments Due by Period\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2026\n2027\nThereafter\nLong-term debt—principal\n$\n2,343 \n$\n4,505 \n$\n2,937 \n$\n31,361 \nLong-term debt—future interest\n$\n1,848 \n$\n1,741 \n$\n1,491 \n$\n18,238 \nAt December 31, 2024, management had remaining authority to repurchase approximately $0.7 billion of our common stock under the October 21, 2023 share repurchase program.

Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. The most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates.\nLong-Term Contract Accounting. \nWe recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace aftermarket contracts. We measure progress toward completion of these contracts on a percentage-of-completion basis, generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion. Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management’s judgment. We review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant contracts, we review our EACs more frequently. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs, and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenues and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials including any impact from changing costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant management judgment, as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost changes. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage-of-completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also \n59\nTable of Contents\ninclude the establishment of, and changes to, loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis. \nNet EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results:\n(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal net sales\n$\n(144)\n$\n(452)\n$\n152 \nOperating profit (loss)\n(473)\n(648)\n(37)\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners \n(1)\n(374)\n(512)\n(29)\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners \n(1)\n$\n(0.28)\n$\n(0.36)\n$\n(0.02)\n(1)    Amounts reflect a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our EAC adjustments.\nIn addition to the amounts included in the table above, during the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of obtaining critical licenses and further regulatory approvals, we restarted work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer and began recognizing revenue on these contracts. As a result, Raytheon recognized a net operating profit benefit of $0.1 billion primarily related to reserve and contract loss provision adjustments. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2024, Raytheon initiated the termination of a fixed price development contract with a foreign customer (Raytheon Contract Termination) and recognized a $0.6 billion charge related to the impact of the termination. The charge included the write-off of remaining contract assets and the estimated settlement with the customer. The contract termination was completed and customer settlement occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024, in line with previously accrued amounts.  \nCosts incurred for engineering and development of certain aerospace products under contracts with customers are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs, to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortized as the products are delivered to the customer. The estimation of contract costs, and margin, considered as part of this recoverability assessment requires significant judgment. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment. In 2024, we recognized impairment charges of $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion at Collins due to a contract cancellation and as a result of the impact of initiating alternative titanium sources, respectively. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. \nIncome Taxes. \nManagement believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider available positive and negative evidence including past operating results, projections of future taxable income, the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies, and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards. Our projections of future taxable income include estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing, and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates, and future taxable income levels. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made. \nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. Significant judgment is required when assessing our income tax positions and in determining our tax expense and benefits. Management assesses our tax positions based on an evaluation of the facts, circumstances, applicable tax laws, including regulations, case law, and other interpretive guidance, as well as any other relevant information. Adjustments to our tax positions are made as new information becomes available or when our assessments change. In addition, we have entered into certain internal legal entity restructuring transactions necessary to effectuate the separation of Carrier Global Corporation (Carrier) and Otis Worldwide Corporation (Otis). We have accrued tax on these transactions based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and our determination of appropriate entity valuations. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” and “Note 12: Income Taxes” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nManagement has determined that the distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, \n60\nTable of Contents\nand/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity in future reporting periods.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. \nThe assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets. The fair value for acquired customer relationship intangibles is determined as of the acquisition date based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the future after-tax cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that existed on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of expected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. See “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.\nAlso included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets, which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. At December 31, 2024, our exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $3.3 billion, and our remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, were approximately $5.5 billion. We assess the recoverability of these intangibles, which is dependent upon our assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms, including the associated aftermarket revenue streams, and the related future cash flows.\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In testing our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. For the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill, we primarily utilize a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologies. For the quantitative assessments of indefinite-lived intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on the relief from royalty method. These quantitative assessments incorporate significant assumptions that include sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions. \nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. We assessed all of our reporting units using qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that any individual reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value (step 0) and determined that no further testing was required. \nThe Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact our significant assumptions used in testing goodwill, including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company’s market capitalization, and general industry, market, and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances, or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge. \nWe also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing using a qualitative approach as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary. As noted above, our indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis involves significant assumptions that are subject to variability. Material changes in these assumptions could occur and result in impairments in future periods.\nContingent Liabilities. \nAs described in “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, contractual, regulatory, and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation, including with respect to matters relating to technical issues on programs, government contracts, performance and operating cost guarantees, employee benefit plans, legal, and environmental, health, and safety matters. In particular, the design, development, production, and support of aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these technolog\nies may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance e\nstimates. These impacts could be \n61\nTable of Contents\nmaterial to the Company’s results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, we have significant contracts with the U.S. government, subject to government oversight and audit, which may require significant adjustment of contract prices. We accrue for liabilities associated with these matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Estimating our liability based on both the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes, and the costs associated with these matters, requires significant judgment. The inherent uncertainty related to the outcome of these matters could result in amounts materially different from any provisions made with respect to their resolution. \nIn 2023, Pratt & Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100 GTF fleet, which powers the A320neo. This determination was made pursuant to Pratt & Whitney’s safety management system. \nOn August 4, 2023, Pratt & Whitney issued a special instruction (SI) to operators of PW1100 GTF powered A320neo aircraft, which required accelerated inspections and engine removals covering an initial subset of operational engines, no later than September 15, 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, through its safety management system, Pratt & Whitney continued its engineering and industrial assessment, which resulted in an updated fleet management plan for the remaining PW1100 fleet. This updated plan requires a combination of part inspections and retirements for some high pressure turbine and high pressure compressor parts made from affected raw material. Guidance to affected operators was released via service bulletins (SB) and SI in November 2023, and this guidance has been reflected in airworthiness directives issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Consistent with previous information, the actions are resulting in significant incremental shop visits. \nAs a result of this matter, Pratt & Whitney expects aircraft on ground levels for the PW1100 powered A320neo fleet to remain elevated through 2026. As a result of anticipated increased aircraft on ground levels and expected compensation to customers for this disruption, as well as incremental maintenance costs resulting from increased inspections and shop visits, Pratt & Whitney recorded a pre-tax operating profit charge in the third quarter of 2023 of $2.9 billion, reflecting Pratt & Whitney’s net 51% program share of the PW1100 program. This amount reflected our best estimate of expected customer compensation for the estimated duration of the disruption as well as the EAC adjustment impact of this matter to Pratt & Whitney’s long-term maintenance contracts. The incremental costs to the business’s long-term maintenance contracts include the estimated cost of additional inspections, replacement of parts, and other related impacts.\nThe charge recorded in the third quarter of 2023 resulted in a net increase in Other accrued liabilities of $2.8 billion, which principally related to our 51% share of an accrual for expected customer compensation. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had other accrued liabilities of $1.7 billion and $2.8 billion, respectively, primarily related to expected compensation to customers. The decrease in the accrual during 2024 was primarily due to customer compensation in the form of credits issued and cash paid to customers during the period.\nOther engine models within Pratt & Whitney’s fleet contain parts manufactured with affected powder metal, but we do not currently believe there will be any resultant significant financial impact with respect to these other engine models at this time. The financial impact of the powder metal issue is based on historical experience and is subject to various assumptions and judgments, most notably, the number and expected timing of shop visits, inspection results and scope of work to be performed, turnaround time, availability of parts, available capacity at overhaul facilities, and outcomes of negotiations with impacted customers. While these assumptions reflect our best estimates at this time, they are subject to variability. Potential changes to these assumptions and actual incurred costs could significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements and could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations for the periods in which they are recognized.\nEmployee Benefit Plans.\n We sponsor domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and PRB plans. Assumptions used to calculate our funded status are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators. They are evaluated annually at December 31 and when significant events require a mid-year remeasurement. A change in any of these assumptions or actual experience that differs from these assumptions are subject to recognition in pension and postretirement net periodic benefit (income) expense reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAssumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans require judgement. Major assumptions include the discount rate and EROA. Other assumptions include mortality rates, demographic assumptions (such as retirement age), rate of increase in employee compensation levels, and health care cost increase projections.\nThe weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension and PRB liabilities are generally based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds which are subject to macroeconomic factors, as well as plan specific expected cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows. \n62\nTable of Contents\nThe following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and PRB plan liabilities and net periodic benefit income to a 25 basis point change in the discount rates for benefit obligations, interest cost, and service cost as of December 31, 2024:\n(dollars in millions)\nIncrease in Discount \nRate of 25 bps\nDecrease in Discount \nRate of 25 bps\nProjected benefit obligation increase (decrease)\n$\n(1,024)\n$\n1,066\n \nNet periodic benefit income increase (decrease)\n(42)\n45\n \nThe discount rate sensitivities assume no change in the shape of the yield curve that will be applied to the projected cash outflows for future benefit payments in order to calculate interest and service cost. A flattening of the yield curve results in a narrowing of the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would decrease our net periodic benefit income. Conversely, a steepening of the yield curve would result in an increase in the spread between interest and obligation discount rates and would increase our net periodic benefit income.\nThe EROA is the average rate of earnings expected over the long-term on assets invested to fund anticipated future benefit payment obligations. In determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads, and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns. Differences between actual asset returns in a given year and the EROA do not necessarily indicate a change in the assumption is required, as the EROA represents the expected average returns over a long-term horizon.\nNet periodic benefit income is also sensitive to changes in the EROA. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the EROA would have increased or decreased our 2024 Net periodic benefit income by approximately $131 million.\nRefer to “Note 10: Employee Benefit Plans” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion of current and prior year discount rate and EROA assumptions.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nFor a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements, see the Accounting Pronouncements section in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nRefer to “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for discussion on contractual commitments and contingencies.\nGOVERNMENT MATTERS\nAs described above in “Critical Accounting Estimates—Contingent Liabilities,” our contracts with the U.S. government are subject to audits. Such audits may recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced to comply with various government regulations, or that certain payments be delayed or withheld. We are also the subject of one or more investigations and legal proceedings initiated by the U.S. government with respect to government contract matters. In addition, as described in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, in 2024, the Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the DOJ and the Company settled an administrative proceeding with the SEC (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS) since 2012, in connection with certain Middle East contracts. The Company also entered into a DPA and a FCA settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017. Under these DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain, among other things, an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged) and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure obligations (for a term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company’s and the Company’s compliance with their respective obligations under the DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order. In 2024, the Company also resolved certain voluntarily disclosed export controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser extent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS. The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company’s ITAR compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external, independent Special Compliance \n63\nTable of Contents\nOfficer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. See “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these and other government matters.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nOur primary market exposures are to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates as it relates to our market risk sensitive instruments, which are primarily cash, debt, and derivative instruments.\n To quantify our market risk exposure, we perform a sensitivity analysis based on hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Refer to “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles,” “Note 9: Borrowings and Lines of Credit,” and “Note 13: Financial Instruments” within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of foreign currency exchange, interest rates, and financial instruments.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk.\n \nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies and to various internal or external financing arrangements. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and financing. We actively manage foreign currency exposures that are associated with commi\ntted foreign currency purchases and sales, and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business at the operating unit level. More than insignificant exposures that cannot be naturally offset within an operating unit are hedged with foreign currency derivatives. Foreign exchange exposures arising from intercompany loan and deposit transactions are also hedged regularly. \nThe present value of aggregate notional principal of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was $17 billion \nand\n $16 billion\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses of \n$1.0 billion\n at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Such losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. We believe these foreign currency forward exchange contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments, when taken together, do not create material market risk.\nOur sales are typically denominated in U.S. Dollars. However, for our non-U.S. based entities, including Pratt & Whitney Canada, a substantial portion of their costs are incurred in local currencies. Consequently, there is a foreign currency exchange impact and risk to operational results as U.S. Dollars must be converted to local currencies such as the Canadian Dollar in order to meet local currency cost obligations. Additionally, we transact business in various foreign currencies which exposes our cash flows and earnings to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to minimize the exposure that exists from changes in the exchange rate of the U.S. Dollar against these other currencies, we hedge a certain portion of sales to secure the rates at which U.S. Dollars will be converted. At Pratt & Whitney Canada and Collins Aerospace, firm and forecasted sales for both original equipment and spare parts are hedged at varying amounts on the U.S. Dollar sales exposure as represented by the excess of U.S. Dollar sales over U.S. Dollar denominated purchases. At Raytheon, portions of the cost to deliver a program may be denominated in a currency other than the currency of sale, and forecasts of such costs are frequently hedged to reduce foreign exchange exposures that can impact the cost of delivery of such programs. Where sales of a Raytheon program are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the contracting affiliate, forecasted sales for that program may be hedged to minimize the resulting foreign exchange exposure for that affiliate. Hedging gains and losses resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the foreign currency translation impacts that are generated on the translation of local currency operating results into U.S. Dollars for reporting purposes. While the objective of the hedging program is to minimize the foreign curren\ncy exchange impact on operating results, there are typically variances between the hedging gains or losses and the translational impact due to the length of hedging contracts, changes in the sales profile, volatility in the exchange rates, and other such operational considerations.\nInterest Rate Risk.\n \nWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations. A 100 basis point unfavorable interest rate movement would have had an approximate \n$3 billion i\nmpact on the fair value of our fixed-rate debt at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations generally do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, we believe our exposure to interest rate risk on our fixed-rate debt is not material. We also have variable-rate debt, including $2.75 billion of term loans outstanding, which is affected by changes in market interest rates. A 100 basis point unfavorable interest rate movement on variable debt would not be expected to have a material effect on our operations or cash flows. \nFrom time to time, we may hedge to floating rates using interest rate swaps. Currently, we do not hold any derivative contracts that hedge our interest exposures, but may consider such strategies in the future.\n64\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of RTX Corporation (RTX) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. \nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of RTX’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n, released in 2013\n.\n Management concluded that based on its assessment, RTX’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of RTX’s internal control over financial reporting, as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\n/s/ CHRISTOPHER T. CALIO\nChristopher T. Calio\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n/s/ NEIL G. MITCHILL, JR.\nNeil G. Mitchill, Jr.\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n/s/ AMY L. JOHNSON\nAmy L. Johnson\nCorporate Vice President and Controller\n65\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the\n \nShareowners and Board of Directors of RTX Corporation\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of RTX Corporation and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of changes in equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and\n \ndispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n66\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\n \nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Contract Estimates at Completion\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the majority of the Company’s revenues of $80.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024, are from long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related services. The Collins and Pratt & Whitney segments primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment manufacturer and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry, while the Raytheon segment primarily provides products and services to government customers in the defense industry. For certain long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period, and the Company generally accounts for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance and aftermarket services. Substantially all of the defense business revenue is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Management reviews the estimated costs at completion at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs and requires significant judgment by management on a contract-by-contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management makes assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenue and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, including any impact from rising costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by its subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from the customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. Changes in estimates of net sales, cost of sales and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of the performance obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition - contract estimates at completion is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in developing the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion, including significant judgments and assumptions on a contract-by-contract basis, and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion for contracts.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion. These procedures also included, among others, testing management’s process for developing the estimated total revenue and total costs at completion, including evaluating on a test basis the reasonableness of certain significant judgments and inputs considered by management specific to each contract or performance obligation. Evaluating the significant judgments and assumptions related to the estimates of total revenue and total costs at completion on a contract-by-contract basis involved evaluating whether the significant judgments and assumptions used were reasonable considering: (i) management’s historical \n67\nTable of Contents\nforecasting accuracy, (ii) evidence to support the aforementioned inputs relevant to an individual contract, (iii) the consistent application of accounting policies, and (iv) the timely identification of circumstances which may warrant a modification to a previous estimate. \n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 3, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1947.\n68\nTable of Contents\nRTX CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS\n(dollars in millions, except per share amounts;

Actual results could differ from those estimates. \nUnless the context otherwise requires, the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” and “RTX” mean RTX Corporation and its subsidiaries. \nReferences to “Raytheon Company” mean Raytheon Company, which became a wholly owned subsidiary of RTX on April 3, 2020 during an all-stock merger transaction between United Technologies Corporation and Raytheon Company (the surviving company of which is RTX Corporation).\nWe reclassified certain immaterial prior period amounts within the Income Taxes footnote to conform to our current period presentation.\nLegal Matters.\n \nAs previously announced, in 2024 the Company resolved several outstanding legal matters, herein referred to as “Resolution of Certain Legal Matters.” The Company entered into a deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) (DPA-1) with the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Company settled an administrative proceeding with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), in connection with certain Middle East contracts since 2012 (Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters). The Company also entered into a DPA and a False Claims Act (FCA) settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017 (DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes). Under these DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain, among other things, an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged) and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure obligations (for a term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company’s and the Company’s compliance with their respective obligations under the DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order. The DPAs further provide that, in the event the DOJ, in its sole discretion, determines during the period of deferral of prosecution that Raytheon Company or the Company have violated any provision of either DPA, Raytheon Company or the Company may be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation, including the charges against Raytheon Company in the relevant DPA. The SEC Administrative Order further provides that, in the event of a breach of the SEC Administrative Order, the SEC may vacate the SEC Administrative Order and institute proceedings against the Company. In the event of any such determination or breach, the Company may face additional adverse impacts. In addition, the Company resolved certain voluntarily disclosed export controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser extent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a Consent Agreement (CA) with the Department of State (DOS) (Trade Compliance Matters). The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external, independent Special Compliance Officer (SCO). The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. As a result of the DPAs, SEC Administrative Order, FCA settlement agreement and CA, we recorded a combined pre-tax charge of $\n918\n million during the second quarter of 2024, which included $\n269\n million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes (in addition to amounts previously accrued), $\n364\n million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters (in addition to amounts previously accrued), and $\n285\n million related to Trade Compliance Matters. In the fourth quarter we made payments of $\n580\n million related to the DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Dispute and $\n384\n million related to Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters. See “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” for additional information.\nRussia Sanctions.\n In response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government and the governments of various jurisdictions in which we operate, have imposed broad economic sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in Russia. The Russian government has implemented similar counter-sanctions and export controls targeting specific industries, entities, and individuals in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate, including certain members of the Company’s management team and Board of Directors. These government measures, among other limitations, restrict transactions involving various Russian banks and financial institutions and impose enhanced export controls limiting transfers of various goods, software, and technologies to and from Russia, including broadened export controls specifically targeting the aerospace sector. These measures have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers. As a result of the Canadian government’s imposition of sanctions in February 2024, including those imposed on U.S.- and German-based Russian-owned entities from which we source titanium for use in our Canadian operations, we recorded charges of $\n175\n million in the first quarter of 2024 within our Collins Aerospace \n74\nTable of Contents\n(Collins) segment. These charges are primarily related to the recognition of unfavorable purchase commitments and an impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable as a result of initiating alternative titanium sources. Additionally, as a result of the sanctions on Russia and export controls, in the first quarter of 2022, we recorded pre-tax charges of $\n290\n million, $\n210\n million net of tax and the impact of noncontrolling interest, within our Collins and Pratt & Whitney businesses primarily related to increased estimates for credit losses on both our accounts receivable and contract assets, inventory reserves and purchase order obligations, impairment of customer financing assets for products under lease, impairment of contract fulfillment costs that are no longer recoverable, and a loss on the exit of our investment in a Russia-based joint venture. We continue to monitor developments, including additional sanctions and other measures, that could adversely affect the Company and/or our supply chain, business partners, or customers. \nPratt & Whitney Powder Metal Matter.\n \nIn 2023, Pratt & Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100G-JM (PW1100) Geared Turbofan (GTF) fleet, which powers the A320neo family of aircraft (A320neo) (herein referred to as the “Powder Metal Matter”). See “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” for additional information.\nSummary of Accounting Principles.\n \nThe following represents the significant accounting principles of RTX Corporation. \nConsolidation and Classification.\n \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of RTX Corporation, and all wholly owned, majority-owned, and otherwise controlled domestic and foreign subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. For our consolidated non-wholly owned subsidiaries, a noncontrolling interest is recognized to reflect the portion of income and equity that is not attributable to us. For classification of certain current assets and liabilities, the duration of our contracts or programs is utilized to define our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. Included within our current assets and liabilities are Contract assets and Contract liabilities related to our development and aftermarket arrangements, which can generally span up to twenty years.\n \nUse of Estimates.\n \nOur Consolidated Financial Statements are based on the application of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements in the period they are determined.\nCash and Cash Equivalents.\n Cash and cash equivalents includes cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term cash investments that are highly liquid in nature and have original maturities of three months or less. The estimated fair value of Cash and cash equivalents approximates the carrying value due to their short maturities.\n \nAccounts Receivable.\n Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. Accounts receivable related to the commercial aerospace industry was approximately \n79\n% and \n80\n% of Accounts receivable, net at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We are exposed to credit losses primarily on our accounts receivable and contract assets related to our sales of products and services to commercial customers. The allowance for expected credit losses is established to provide for the expected lifetime credit losses by evaluating factors such as customer creditworthiness, historical payment and loss experiences, current economic conditions, including geographic and political risk, and the age and status of outstanding receivables. In certain circumstances, we may be able to develop reasonable and supportable forecasts over the contractual term of the financial asset. For periods beyond which we are able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts, we revert to historical loss experience and information. \nWe determine credit ratings for each customer in our portfolio based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers. We conduct a review of customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for expected credit losses on a quarterly basis, or when events and circumstances warrant. A credit limit is established for each customer based on the outcome of this review and consideration of the other factors discussed above. In certain cases, we may require collateral or prepayment to mitigate credit risk.\nExpected credit losses are written off in the period in which the financial asset is no longer collectible. \nUnbilled receivables represent revenues that are not currently billable to the customer under the terms of the contract and include unbilled amounts under commercial contracts where payment is solely subject to the passage of time. These items are expected to be billed and collected in the normal course of business. Accounts receivable, net as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 includes unbilled receivables of $\n374\n million and $\n427\n million, respectively, which primarily includes unbilled receivables with commercial aerospace customers. Other unbilled receivables where payment is subject to factors beyond just the passage of time are included in Contract assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n75\nTable of Contents\nContract Assets and Liabilities.\n Contract assets and liabilities represent the difference in the timing of revenue recognition from receipt of cash from our\n \ncustomers. Contract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in advance of customer billing.\nContract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of the satisfaction of performance under the contract. We receive payments from customers based on the terms established in our contracts. \nContract assets and Contract liabilities are generally classified as current as our operating cycle is generally longer than one year. See “Note 6: Contract Assets and Liabilities” for further discussion of Contract assets and liabilities. \nAs described in more detail above in “Accounts Receivable,” we are exposed to credit losses on our Contract assets related to our sales of products and services to commercial customers and regularly assess our allowance for expected credit losses as it relates to our Contract assets.\nInventory.\n Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value and is primarily based on first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost methods.\nValuation reserves for excess, obsolete, and slow-moving inventory are estimated by comparing the inventory levels of individual parts to both future sales forecasts or production requirements and historical usage rates in order to identify inventory where the resale value or replacement value is less than inventoriable cost. Other factors that management considers in determining the adequacy of these reserves include whether individual inventory parts meet current specifications and can be substituted for a part currently being sold or used as a service part, overall market conditions, and other inventory management initiatives. Manufacturing costs are allocated to current production contracts.\nEquity Investments.\n Investments in entities we do not control are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For investments where we have significant influence, we apply the equity method of accounting, and as such, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is recorded. For investments where we do not have significant influence, we record them at cost under the measurement alternative and record adjustments for observable price changes. Equity investment income and losses are included in Other income (expense), net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with our operations. We evaluate our equity investments whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period. Our sales to and purchases from unconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, which are considered related parties, are not material.\nCustomer Financing Assets.\n Customer financing assets (CFA) relate to our commercial aerospace businesses in which we provide financing to airline\n \ncustomers. Our financing predominantly relates to leased engines, often provided through the customers’ aftermarket maintenance coverage, and to a lesser extent, notes and lease receivables. In certain limited circumstances, we pay deposits on behalf of our airline customers to secure production slots with the airframers, and such pre-delivery payments are included in Accounts receivable, net, if current, and Customer financing assets, if non-current, in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Any unfunded pre-delivery payments are included within our commercial aerospace financing commitments as further discussed in “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies.” Interest income from notes and financing leases and rental income from operating lease assets is generally included in Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, while gains or losses on sales of operating lease assets are included in Products sales and Cost of sales. The current portion of these financing arrangements are aggregated in Accounts receivable, net and the non-current portion of these financing arrangements are aggregated in Customer financing assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The increases and decreases in CFA from funding, receipts, and certain other activity, are generally reflected as Investing Activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Leased assets are valued at cost and reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Notes and lease receivables are valued at the net amount expected to be collected. For notes and lease receivables, we determine a specific reserve for exposure based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral in connection with the evaluation of credit risk and collectability. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the reserves related to CFA were not material. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we did not have any material balances that are considered to be delinquent, on non-accrual status, past due 90 days or more, or considered to be impaired.\nFixed Assets, Net.\n Fixed assets, net, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements are capitalized while expenditures for maintenance, repairs, and minor improvements are expensed. For asset sales or retirements, the assets and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are eliminated from the accounts. Gains and losses on sales of our Fixed assets, net, are generally recorded in Other income (expense), net.\n76\nTable of Contents\nBusiness Combinations.\n Once a business is acquired, the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is determined with the excess cost recorded to goodwill. A preliminary fair value is determined once a business is acquired, with the final determination of the fair value being completed no later than one year from the date of acquisition.\nIn connection with the acquisitions of Rockwell Collins in 2018 and Goodrich in 2012, and to a lesser extent the acquisition of Raytheon Company in 2020, we recorded assumed liabilities related to customer contractual obligations on certain contracts with economic returns that were lower than what could be realized in market transactions as of the acquisition date. We measured these assumed liabilities based on the estimated cash flows of the programs plus a reasonable contracting profit margin required to transfer the contracts to market participants. These liabilities are being amortized in accordance with the underlying pattern of obligations, as reflected by the expenses incurred on the contracts. The balance of the contractual obligations was $\n654\n million and $\n735\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Total consumption of the contractual obligations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $\n81\n million, $\n83\n million, and $\n111\n million, respectively, with future consumption expected to be as follows: $\n71\n million in 2025, $\n82\n million in 2026, $\n85\n million in 2027, $\n83\n million in 2028, $\n70\n million in 2029, and $\n263\n million thereafter.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets.\n Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill\n \nand intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The goodwill impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In evaluating our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. For the quantitative assessments that are performed, fair value is primarily based on market-based valuation methods, income-based methods using a discounted cash flow model, relief from royalty methods, or a combination of such. These assessments utilize significant assumptions including sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly-traded companies in our industry. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions. Finite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment when events occur that indicate that the net book value will not be recovered over future cash flows.\nIntangible assets consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, customer relationships, exclusivity assets, developed technology, and other intangible assets, including collaboration assets. Acquired intangible assets are recognized at fair value in purchase accounting. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized primarily to Cost of sales over the applicable useful lives. Exclusivity assets are commercial aerospace payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms. We classify amortization of such payments as a reduction of sales. Such payments are capitalized when there are distinct rights obtained and there are sufficient incremental cash flows to support the recoverability of the assets established. Otherwise, the applicable portion of the payments are expensed. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s ownership and collaboration interests in International Aero Engines AG (IAE), additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments are being capitalized as collaboration assets and amortized to cost of sales. \nUseful lives of finite-lived intangible assets are estimated based upon the nature of the intangible asset and how the intangible asset is used. These intangible assets are amortized based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed, as represented by the underlying cash flows, which may result in an amortization method other than straight-line. For both our commercial aerospace collaboration assets and exclusivity arrangements, the pattern of economic benefit generally results in no amortization during the development period with amortization beginning as programs enter full rate production and aftermarket cycles. If a pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined or if straight-line amortization approximates the pattern of economic benefit, a straight-line amortization method may be used. \nThe range of estimated useful lives is as follows:\nYears\nCollaboration assets\n9\n to \n30\nCustomer relationships and related programs\n3\n to \n30\nDeveloped technology\n3\n to \n25\nPatents and trademarks\n5\n to \n30\nExclusivity assets\n5\n to \n25\nLeases.\n \nAs a lessee, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n77\nTable of Contents\nWe enter into lease agreements for the use of real estate space, vehicles, information technology (IT) equipment, and certain other\n \nequipment under both operating and finance leases. We determine if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. Operating leases are included in Operating lease right-of-use assets and Operating lease liabilities, non-current on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The current portion of our operating lease liabilities is included in Other accrued liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance leases are not considered significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRight-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Lease right-of-use assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, and use the implicit rate when readily determinable. We determine our incremental borrowing rate through market sources including relevant industry rates. Our lease right-of-use assets also include any initial direct costs and lease pre-payments made at or before the commencement date and are reduced for any lease incentives received at or before the commencement date. Certain of our leases include variable payments, which may vary based upon changes in facts or circumstances after the start of the lease. We exclude variable payments from lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, to the extent such payments are not considered fixed, and instead, expense variable payments as incurred. Variable lease expense and lease expense for short duration contracts are not a material component of lease expense. Some of our leases include the option to extend or terminate the lease. We include these options in the recognition of our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option. Lease expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIn limited instances we act as a lessor, primarily for commercial aerospace engines for a short term during maintenance events. The majority of these leases are classified as operating leases. These leases are not significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet or Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nOther Long-Lived Assets.\n We evaluate the potential impairment of other long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of other long-lived assets held and used exceeds the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows, the carrying value is written down to fair value. In order for long-lived assets to be considered held for disposal, we must have committed to a plan to dispose of the assets. Once deemed held for disposal, the assets are stated at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value.\nIncome Taxes.\n \nFuture income taxes represent the tax effects of transactions which are reported in different periods for tax and financial reporting purposes. These amounts consist of the tax effects of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting balance sheets and tax carryforwards. Future income tax benefits and payables within the same tax-paying component of a particular jurisdiction are offset for presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. I\nn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. Where applicable, associated interest expense has also been recognized. We recognize accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as a component of income tax expense. State income tax amounts are included in income tax expense.\nWe have elected to account for \ntax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\nGILTI) as a period cost, as incurred.\nRevenue Recognition.\n \nA majority of our revenues are from long-term contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or defense equipment or related services. Collins and Pratt & Whitney primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry, while Raytheon primarily provides products and services to government customers in the defense industry.\nWe account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily contracts that are directly with a foreign government, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when obtaining regulatory approvals is considered probable based on all known facts and circumstances. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer. Some of our contracts with customers contain a single performance obligation, while others contain multiple performance obligations, most commonly when a contract contains multiple distinct \n78\nTable of Contents\nunits (such as engines or certain aerospace components), or spans multiple phases of the product life-cycle such as production, maintenance, and support. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost-plus-a-margin approach.\nWe consider the contractual consideration payable by the customer and assess variable consideration that may affect the total transaction price, including contractual discounts, contract incentive payments, estimates of award fees, flight hours, aircraft landings or other customer usage activities on long-term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract. We account for consideration payable to a customer as a reduction of revenue. Consideration payable to a customer may include cash amounts we are obligated to pay or expect to pay a customer, as well as credits or other items that can be applied against amounts owed to us. In our Collins and Pratt & Whitney businesses, we may offer customer incentives to purchase our products, which may result in payments made to those customers.\nWhen reasonably able to estimate, we include variable consideration in the transaction price at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not.\nTiming of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms.\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point-in-time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point-in-time sales.\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts.\nSubstantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our Raytheon segment, and to a lesser extent Pratt & Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors’ costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance, and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Revenue is primarily recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis using costs incurred to date \n79\nTable of Contents\nrelative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress, as sufficient historical evidence indicates that the cost of performing services under the contract is incurred on an other-than-straight-line basis. For some of our long-term aftermarket contracts, we receive payment prior to delivery of products and services, resulting in a contract liability balance, while for others, we deliver products or services in advance of payment, resulting in a contract asset balance.\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new or changes existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services that are not distinct are accounted for as part of the existing contract either on a cumulative catch-up basis or prospective basis depending on the nature of the modification.\nLoss provisions on contracts are recognized to the extent that estimated contract costs exceed the estimated consideration from the products or services contemplated under the contractual arrangement. For new commitments, we generally record loss provisions at contract signing except for certain contracts under which losses are recorded upon receipt of the purchase order that obligates us to perform. For existing commitments, anticipated losses on contractual arrangements are recognized in the period in which losses become evident. In estimating losses, products contemplated under contractual arrangements include firm quantities of product sold under contract and, in the commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, future highly-probable sales of replacement parts required by regulation that are expected to be sold subsequently for incorporation into the original equipment. In our commercial engine and wheels and brakes businesses, when the OEM product is sold for a loss, but the combined OEM and aftermarket arrangement for each individual sales campaign is profitable, we record OEM product losses at the time of product delivery.\nWe review our Estimates at Completion (EACs) at least annually or when a change in circumstances warrants a modification to a previous estimate. For significant contracts, we review our EACs more frequently. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the Company’s performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many inputs, and requires significant judgment by management on a contract by contract basis. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related program schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. The risks and opportunities relate to management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the schedule, consideration of customer-directed delays or reductions in scheduled deliveries, technical requirements, customer activity levels, such as flight hours or aircraft landings, and related variable consideration. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding contract revenues and costs, including estimates of labor productivity and availability, the complexity and scope of the work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials including any impact from changing costs or inflation, the length of time to complete the performance obligation, execution by our subcontractors, the availability and timing of funding from our customer, overhead cost rates, and current and past maintenance cost and frequency driven by estimated aircraft and engine utilization and estimated useful lives of components, among others. In particular, fixed-price development programs involve significant management judgment, as development contracts by nature have elements that have not been done before and thus, are highly subject to future unexpected cost changes. Cost estimates may also include the estimated cost of satisfying our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset obligations or in-country industrial participation (ICIP) agreements, required under certain contracts. These obligations may or may not be distinct depending on their nature. If cash is paid to a customer to satisfy our offset obligations it is recorded as a reduction in the transaction price. \nChanges in estimates of net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating profit on contracts recognized over time are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes the cumulative effect of the profit changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage-of-completion in the current period. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our performance obligations. Our EAC adjustments also include the establishment of, and changes to, loss provisions for our contracts accounted for on a percentage-of-completion basis. \nNet EAC adjustments had the following impact on our operating results:\n(dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal net sales\n$\n(\n144\n)\n$\n(\n452\n)\n$\n152\n \nOperating profit (loss)\n(\n473\n)\n(\n648\n)\n(\n37\n)\nIncome (loss) from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners \n(1)\n(\n374\n)\n(\n512\n)\n(\n29\n)\nDiluted earnings (loss) per share from continuing operations attributable to common shareowners \n(1)\n$\n(\n0.28\n)\n$\n(\n0.36\n)\n$\n(\n0.02\n)\n(1)    Amounts reflect a U.S. statutory tax rate of 21%, which approximates our tax rate on our EAC adjustments.\n80\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to the amounts included in the table above, during the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of obtaining critical licenses and further regulatory approvals, we restarted work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer and began recognizing revenue on these contracts. As a result, Raytheon recognized a net operating profit benefit of $\n102\n million primarily related to reserve and contract loss provision adjustments. In addition to the amounts included in the table above, during the second quarter of 2024, Raytheon initiated the termination of a fixed price development contract with a foreign customer, herein referred to as “Raytheon Contract Termination,” and recognized a $\n575\n million charge related to the impact of the termination. The charge included the write-off of remaining contract assets and the estimated settlement with the customer. The contract termination was completed and customer settlement occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024, in line with previously accrued amounts. \nIn our Collins and Pratt & Whitney businesses, we incur contract fulfillment costs for engineering and development of aerospace products directly related to existing or anticipated contracts with customers. Such costs generate or enhance our ability to satisfy our performance obligations under these contracts. We capitalize these costs as contract fulfillment costs to the extent the costs are recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortize the costs to Cost of sales as the related performance obligations are satisfied. In instances where intellectual property does not transfer to the customer, we generally defer the customer funding of product engineering and development and recognize revenue when the related performance obligations are satisfied. Capitalized contract fulfillment costs were $\n2.5\n billion and $\n2.6\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are classified in Other assets, current in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and are included in Other current assets in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment. In 2024, we recognized impairment charges of approximately $\n0.2\n billion and $\n0.1\n billion at Collins due to a contract cancellation and as a result of the impact of initiating alternative titanium sources, respectively. See “Russia Sanctions” above for further information regarding initiating alternative titanium sources.\nIn view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines and the large up-front investments required that often require returns generated over the full estimated life of the engine, Pratt & Whitney has entered into certain collaboration arrangements in which sales, costs, and risks are shared. Sales generated from engine programs, spare parts sales, and aftermarket business under these collaboration arrangements are recorded consistent with our revenue recognition policies in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts attributable to our collaborators for their share of sales are recorded as cost of sales in our Consolidated Financial Statements based upon the terms and nature of the arrangement. Costs associated with engine programs under collaborative arrangements are expensed as incurred. Under these arrangements, collaborators contribute their program share of engine parts, incur their own production costs, and make certain payments for shared or joint program costs. The reimbursement from collaborators of their share of program costs is recorded as a reduction of the related expense item at that time. As of December 31, 2024, the collaborators’ interests in all commercial engine programs ranged from \n13\n% to \n49\n%, inclusive of a portion of Pratt & Whitney’s interests held by other participants. Pratt & Whitney is the principal participant in all existing collaborative arrangements, with the exception of the Engine Alliance (EA), a joint venture with GE Aviation, which provides aftermarket support, spare parts, and service for the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. There are no individually significant collaborative arrangements, and none of the collaborators individually have more than a \n25\n% share in an individual program where Pratt & Whitney is the principal participant. \nThe following table illustrates the Consolidated Statement of Operations classification and amounts attributable to transactions arising from the collaborative arrangements between participants for each period presented. \n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCollaborator share of sales \n(1)\n:\nCost of sales - products \n$\n3,348\n \n$\n(\n181\n)\n$\n2,058\n \nCost of sales - services\n2,659\n \n2,151\n \n1,808\n \nCollaborator share of program costs (reimbursement of expenses incurred):\nCost of sales - products\n(\n194\n)\n(\n205\n)\n(\n154\n)\nResearch and development\n(\n213\n)\n(\n208\n)\n(\n182\n)\nSelling, general, and administrative\n(\n110\n)\n(\n114\n)\n(\n105\n)\n(1)    2023 total cost of sales includes a net reduction of $\n2.6\n billion related to our collaborators’ share of the Powder Metal Matter.\nRemaining Performance Obligations (RPO).\n RPO represents the aggregate amount of total contract transaction price that is unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied. Total RPO was $\n218\n billion as of December 31, 2024. Of the total RPO as of December 31, 2024, we expect approximately \n25\n% will be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Approximately \n45\n% of our RPO relates to long-term commercial aerospace maintenance contracts at Pratt & Whitney, which are generally expected to be realized over a span of up to \n20\n years.\n \n81\nTable of Contents\nResearch and Development.\n Company-sponsored research and development costs, including those costs related to the Company’s portion in connection with cost-sharing arrangements, are charged to expense as incurred and recovery on these cost-sharing arrangements is recorded as a reduction to research and development expense as earned. Customer-sponsored research and development projects performed under contracts with customers are accounted for as contract costs and reported as cost of sales on the related revenue-generating contracts.\nForeign Exchange.\n We conduct business in many different currencies and, accordingly, are subject to the inherent risks associated with foreign exchange rate movements. The financial position and results of operations of many of our foreign subsidiaries are often measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates, and income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates during the respective periods. The aggregate effects of translating the balance sheets of these subsidiaries are deferred as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Shareowners’ equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses are recorded in Other income (expense), net on our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nDerivatives and Hedging Activity.\n \nWe use derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts, and options, to help manage certain foreign currency, and from time to time to help manage interest rate and commodity price exposures. Derivative instruments are viewed as risk management tools by us and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. By their nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative and other financial instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. We limit counterparty exposure and concentration of risk by diversifying counterparties. While there can be no assurance, we do not anticipate any material non-performance by any of these counterparties. We enter into transactions that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements with various counterparties. While we have rights to offset multiple contracts with a single counterparty in an event of default, those obligations remain separate and distinct otherwise, and, as a result, the fair value of the derivative instruments in a loss position is not offset against the fair value of derivative instruments in a gain position in our financial statements. \nDerivatives used for hedging purposes may be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Derivatives used to hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet items are reported directly in earnings along with offsetting transaction gains and losses on the items being hedged. Derivatives used to hedge forecasted cash flows associated with foreign currency commitments or forecasted commodity purchases may be accounted for as cash flow hedges, as deemed appropriate. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to earnings as a component of products sales or expenses, as applicable, when the hedged transaction occurs. Cash payments or receipts on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Other operating activities, net within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. To the extent that a previously-designated hedging transa\nction is no longer an effective hedge, any ineffectiveness measured in the hedging relationship is recorded currently in earnings in the period it occurs. \nTo the extent the hedge accounting criteria are not met, the foreign currency forward contracts are utilized as economic hedges and changes in the fair value of these contracts are recorded currently in earnings in the period in which they occur. Cash receipts or payments related to the settlement of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded as investing cash flows within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Additional information pertaining to foreign currency forward contracts and net investment hedging is included in “Note 13: Financial Instruments.”\nEnvironmental. \nEnvironmental investigatory, remediation, operating, and maintenance costs are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred\n \nand the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently-available facts with respect to each individual site, including existing technology, current laws and regulations, and prior remediation experience. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued. For sites with multiple responsible parties, we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs. Liabilities with fixed or reliably determinable future cash payments are discounted. A portion of these costs is eligible for future recovery through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs, which requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity with the U.S. government. We consider such recovery probable based on government contracting regulations and our history of receiving reimbursement for such costs, and accordingly have recorded the future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government within Other assets, current in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Accrued environmental liabilities are not reduced by potential insurance reimbursements or potential recoveries from pursuing other parties. We also lease certain government-owned properties and generally are not liable for remediation of preexisting environmental contamination at these sites. As a result, we generally do not provide for these costs in our Consolidated \n82\nTable of Contents\nFinancial Statements. See “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies” for additional details on the environmental remediation activities.\nPension and Postretirement Obligations.\n \nU.S. GAAP requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) plans. Funded status is measured at least annually in the fourth quarter and represents the difference between the plans’ projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair market value of the plans’ assets.\nChanges to our pension and PRB plans’ funded status can result from company actions, such as contributions, changes in plan provisions, or by gains and losses. Gains and losses are primarily a result of changes in assumptions and actual experience that differs from these assumptions. Major assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets (EROA). These gains or losses are recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit (income) expense. \nA calculated “market-related value” of our plan assets is generally used to develop the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. The market-related value of assets is generally equal to the fair value of assets adjusted to reflect the recognition, and subsequent amortization, of the difference between actual and expected asset returns over a five-year period. The market-related value of assets is used to calculate the expected return on assets included in the net periodic benefit (income) expense. \nThe Company has elected to use the “corridor” approach in the amortization of gains and losses, which limits the expense recognition to the net outstanding gains and losses in excess of the greater of 10% of the PBO or 10% of the market-related value of assets. Gains and losses exceeding the corridor are amortized in net periodic benefit (income) expense over either the projected average remaining employee service period or the projected average remaining lifetime of inactive participants depending on the plan. \nNet periodic benefit (income) expense is classified between operating and non-operating, whereby only the service cost component is included in operating profit and the remaining components are included in Non-service pension income.\nProduct Performance Obligations.\n \nWe extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies for extended periods on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines. Liability under such guarantees is based upon future product performance and durability. We accrue for such costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with product performance issues. The costs associated with these product performance and operating cost guarantees require estimates over the full terms of the agreements, and require management to consider factors such as the extent of future maintenance requirements, interval between flight and repair time, and the future cost of material and labor to perform the services. These cost estimates are largely based upon historical experience. See “Note 16: Guarantees” for further discussion.\nGovernment Grants.\n \nWe may receive grants from various federal, state, local, and foreign governments in exchange for compliance with certain conditions relating to our activities in a specific jurisdiction. Grants are often structured to encourage investment, job creation, job retention, employee training, and other related activities. We recognize government grants when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions of the grant and the grant is received or is probable of receipt and the amount is determinable. Government grants are recorded as a reduction to the related expense or asset to which the grant relates or recorded in Other income (expense), net in our Consolidated Statement of Operations. Government grant transactions are not material to our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nAccounting Pronouncements. \nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses, which requires a tabular disclosure of the amounts of specified natural expense categories included in each relevant expense caption. Additionally, the amendments require the disclosure of the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, on a prospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our disclosures of adopting this new pronouncement.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, to enhance income tax reporting disclosures and require disclosure of specific categories in the tabular rate reconciliation. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, on a prospective basis. Early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact on our disclosures of adopting this new pronouncement.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which expands the segment reporting disclosures and requires disclosure of segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, \n83\nTable of Contents\namounts and description of its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosure of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets. Additionally, the amendments require the disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing performance and deciding how to allocate resources. We adopted this standard for the annual period ending December 31, 2024 on a retrospective basis. We updated our segment disclosures to comply with the requirements. See “Note 20: Segment Financial Data.” The adoption of the standard did not have an impact on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.\nOther new pronouncements issued but not effective until after \nDecember 31, 2024\n are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nNOTE 2: ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\nAcquisitions.\n Our investments in businesses, net of cash acquired, in 2022 totaled $\n66\n million and consisted of insignificant acquisitions.\nDispositions.\n In 2024, 2023, and 2022 cash inflows related to dispositions of businesses were $\n1,795\n million, $\n6\n million, and $\n94\n million, respectively. Our dispositions of businesses in 2024 primarily consisted of the dispositions discussed below. Our dispositions of businesses in 2023 and 2022 were insignificant. \nOn March 29, 2024, we completed the sale of our Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services (CIS) business within our Raytheon segment for proceeds of approximately $\n1.3\n billion in cash, resulting in an aggregate pre-tax gain, net of transaction and other related costs, of $\n0.4\n billion ($\n0.2\n billion after tax), primarily recognized in Other income (expense), net within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nOn October 31, 2024, we completed the sale of our Goodrich Hoist & Winch business within our Collins segment for proceeds of approximately $\n0.5\n billion in cash, resulting in a pre-tax gain, net of transaction and other related costs, of $\n0.1\n billion, primarily recognized in Other income (expense), net within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nOn July 20, 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the actuation and flight control business within our Collins segment to Safran S.A. for gross proceeds of approximately $\n1.8\n billion. During the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of progress towards regulatory approvals, held for sale criteria was met. As such, at December 31, 2024, the related assets of approximately $\n1.5\n billion and liabilities of approximately $\n0.6\n billion have been accounted for as held for sale at fair value less cost to sell. Held for sale assets primarily include $\n0.7\n billion of goodwill and intangible assets presented in Other assets and $\n0.3\n billion of inventory presented in Other assets, current. Held for sale liabilities primarily include $\n0.4\n billion of contract liabilities and other accrued liabilities presented in Other accrued liabilities. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. This disposition does not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.\nNOTE 3: GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill.\n \nChanges in our goodwill balances for the year ended December 31, 2024 were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nForeign Currency Translation and Other\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\nCollins Aerospace \n(1)\n$\n33,135\n \n$\n(\n676\n)\n$\n(\n236\n)\n$\n32,223\n \nPratt & Whitney\n1,563\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,563\n \nRaytheon\n18,984\n \n—\n \n2\n \n18,986\n \nTotal Segments\n53,682\n \n(\n676\n)\n(\n234\n)\n52,772\n \nEliminations and other\n17\n \n—\n \n—\n \n17\n \nTotal\n$\n53,699\n \n$\n(\n676\n)\n$\n(\n234\n)\n$\n52,789\n \n(1)    The reduction in Acquisitions and Divestitures includes the reclassification of goodwill to held for sale assets.\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired.\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. We assessed all of our reporting units using qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that any individual reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying value (step 0) and determined that no further testing was required. \n84\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets.\n \nIdentifiable intangible assets are comprised of the following:\n \n2024\n2023\n(dollars in millions)\nGross Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\nGross Amount\nAccumulated Amortization \nAmortized:\nCollaboration assets\n$\n6,159\n \n$\n(\n1,996\n)\n$\n5,810\n \n$\n(\n1,688\n)\nExclusivity assets\n3,692\n \n(\n361\n)\n3,460\n \n(\n352\n)\nDeveloped technology and other\n1,197\n \n(\n698\n)\n1,219\n \n(\n635\n)\nCustomer relationships\n29,388\n \n(\n12,401\n)\n29,605\n \n(\n10,683\n)\n \n40,436\n \n(\n15,456\n)\n40,094\n \n(\n13,358\n)\nIndefinite-lived:\nTrademarks and other\n8,463\n \n—\n \n8,663\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n48,899\n \n$\n(\n15,456\n)\n$\n48,757\n \n$\n(\n13,358\n)\nWe also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing using a qualitative approach as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary. \nAmortization of intangible assets was $\n2.2\n billion, $\n2.1\n billion, and $\n2.0\n billion in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. \nThe following is the expected amortization of intangible assets for 2025 through 2029:\n(dollars in millions)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nAmortization expense\n$\n2,104\n$\n2,028\n$\n1,914\n$\n1,838\n$\n1,701\nNOTE 4: EARNINGS PER SHARE\n(dollars in millions, except per share amounts; shares in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income (loss) attributable to common shareowners:\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n4,774\n \n$\n3,195\n \n$\n5,216\n \nLoss from discontinued operations\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n19\n)\nNet income attributable to common shareowners\n$\n4,774\n \n$\n3,195\n \n$\n5,197\n \nBasic weighted average number of shares outstanding\n1,332.1\n \n1,426.0\n \n1,475.5\n \nStock awards and equity units (share equivalent)\n11.5\n \n9.4\n \n10.4\n \nDiluted weighted average number of shares outstanding\n1,343.6\n \n1,435.4\n \n1,485.9\n \nEarnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareowners - basic\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n3.58\n \n$\n2.24\n \n$\n3.54\n \nLoss from discontinued operations\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.02\n)\nNet income attributable to common shareowners\n$\n3.58\n \n$\n2.24\n \n$\n3.52\n \nEarnings (loss) per share attributable to common shareowners - diluted\nIncome from continuing operations\n$\n3.55\n \n$\n2.23\n \n$\n3.51\n \nLoss from discontinued operations\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n0.01\n)\nNet income attributable to common shareowners\n$\n3.55\n \n$\n2.23\n \n$\n3.50\n \nThe computation of diluted earnings per share (EPS) excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock awards, including stock appreciation rights and stock options, when the average market price of the common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related stock awards during the period because the effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, the computation of diluted EPS excludes the effect of the potential release or exercise of stock awards when the awards’ assumed proceeds exceed the average market price of the common shares during the period. For 2024, 2023, and 2022, there were \n4.8\n million, \n9.6\n million, and \n6.2\n million stock awards excluded from the computation, respectively.\n \n85\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 5: ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET\nAccounts receivable, net consisted of the following:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nU.S. government contracts (including foreign military sales)\n$\n1,132\n \n$\n1,147\n \nOther customers\n10,133\n \n10,007\n \nAllowance for expected credit losses\n(\n289\n)\n(\n316\n)\nTotal accounts receivable, net\n$\n10,976\n \n$\n10,838\n \nThe changes in the allowance for expected credit losses related to accounts receivable were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance as of January 1\n$\n316\n \n$\n452\n \n$\n475\n \nCurrent period (recoveries) provision for expected credit losses, net\n(\n14\n)\n(\n92\n)\n26\n \nWrite-offs charged against the allowance for expected credit losses\n(\n7\n)\n(\n42\n)\n(\n42\n)\nOther, net\n(\n6\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n7\n)\nBalance as of December 31\n$\n289\n \n$\n316\n \n$\n452\n \nNOTE 6: CONTRACT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nContract assets reflect revenue recognized and performance obligations satisfied in advance of customer billings.

Contract liabilities increased $\n1.4\n billion during 2024 primarily due to billings in excess of sales on certain contracts at Raytheon.\nIn 2024, 2023, and 2022, we recognized revenue of $\n7.2\n billion, $\n5.3\n billion, and $\n4.8\n billion related to our Contract liabilities at January 1, 2024, January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2022, respectively.\nContract assets consisted of the following at December 31:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nRevenue recognized in advance of customer billings\n$\n30,226\n \n$\n26,481\n \nProgress payments\n(\n15,656\n)\n(\n14,342\n)\nTotal contract assets\n$\n14,570\n \n$\n12,139\n \nFor U.S. government contracts that provide progress payments, the U.S. government has title to the asset related to unbilled amounts.\nContract assets are net of an allowance for expected credit losses of $\n491\n million, $\n197\n million, and $\n318\n million as of December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The increase in allowance for expected credit losses in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily related to an increase in reserves as a result of a customer bankruptcy recorded at Pratt & Whitney in the fourth quarter of 2024.

As of December 31, 2024, there were \nno\n borrowings outstanding under this agreement. In addition, at December 31, 2024, approximately $\n0.7\n billion was available under short-term lines of credit primarily with global banks at our international subsidiaries.\nFrom time to time, we use commercial paper borrowings for general corporate purposes, including the funding of potential acquisitions, pension contributions, debt refinancing, dividend payments, and repurchases of our common stock. The commercial paper notes have original maturities of not more than 364 days from the date of issuance. As of December 31, 2024, our maximum commercial paper borrowing limit was $\n5.0\n billion as the commercial paper is backed by our $\n5.0\n billion revolving credit agreement. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had \nno\n commercial paper borrowings outstanding. During 2024, we had \nno\n new borrowings or repayments of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days. During 2023, we had \nno\n new borrowings and had $\n200\n million in repayments of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days. During 2022, we had $\n1.4\n billion of proceeds from issuance, and $\n1.2\n billion of repayments, of commercial paper with maturities greater than 90 days. \nOn October 24, 2023, we entered into a senior unsecured bridge credit agreement (Bridge Loan) with various banks permitting aggregate borrowings of up to $\n10.0\n billion, to fund an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) and pay related fees and expenses. The $\n10.0\n billion Bridge Loan was paid in full and terminated in the fourth quarter of 2023 upon receipt of proceeds from the $\n4.0\n billion term loan facilities and the $\n6.0\n billion of

foreign employee benefit plans, which are discussed below.\nEmployee Savings Plans.\n We sponsor various employee savings plans. Our contributions to employer sponsored defined contribution plans were $\n1.4\n billion, $\n1.3\n billion, and $\n1.0\n billion for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nOur domestic employee savings plan uses an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) for certain employer matching contributions. Prior to the third quarter of 2024, the ESOP held stock that was purchased using external borrowings. As ESOP debt service payments were made, common stock was released from an unallocated ESOP account. ESOP debt was either prepaid or re-amortized to either increase or decrease the number of shares released so that the value of released shares equaled the value of plan benefit. It was also the Company’s option to contribute additional common stock or cash to the ESOP. Shares of common stock were allocated to participants’ ESOP accounts at fair value on the date earned. Cash dividends on unallocated common stock held by the ESOP were used for debt service payments. Cash dividends on allocated shares are either reinvested or paid directly in cash to the participant, according to the participant’s election. Participants chose to have their ESOP dividends reinvested or distributed to their accounts in cash. Common stock allocated to ESOP participants was included in the average number of common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted EPS. At December 31, 2024, all \n23\n million common shares related to this leveraged ESOP have been allocated to employees.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, remaining unallocated ESOP shares were fully allocated to participant accounts through matching contributions, and we began funding the ESOP match in shares on a non-leveraged basis. Under the new non-leveraged basis, treasury shares are utilized to fund the matching contributions, and participants receive units from the ESOP in the amount of their matching contribution at fair value on the date earned. Once shares are contributed to the participants’ ESOP accounts, they have a right to dividend payments and are included in the average number of common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted EPS. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we expanded the funding of our matching contributions in shares under the ESOP to additional participants who previously received matching contributions in cash. \nIn 2024, we used the ESOP to make matching contributions of $\n353\n million, which was equivalent to \n3\n million shares.\nPension and Postretirement Plans.\n We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension plans that cover a large number of our employees. Our largest plans are generally closed to new participants. We also sponsor both funded and unfunded PRB plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retirees. Our plans use a December 31 measurement date consistent with our fiscal year.\nIn December 2020, we approved a change to the Raytheon Company domestic defined benefit pension plans for non-union participants to cease future benefit accruals based on an employee’s years of service and compensation under the historical formula effective December 31, 2022. The plan change does not impact participants’ historical benefit accruals. Benefits for service after December 31, 2022 are based on a cash balance formula. This plan change resulted in lower pension service cost beginning January 1, 2023. At December 31, 2023, we merged our remaining Raytheon Company domestic defined benefit pension plans into the RTX Consolidated Pension Plan. This plan merger does not impact participants’ benefit formulas.\n90\nTable of Contents\nWe made the following contributions to our pension and PRB plans’ trusts during the years ended December 31:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nU.S. qualified defined benefit plans \n(1)\n$\n—\n \n$\n69\n \n$\n—\n \nInternational defined benefit plans\n31\n \n60\n \n69\n \nPRB plans\n30\n \n28\n \n25\n \n(1)     2023 includes $\n50\n million of RTX common stock contributions.\nPension\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nChange in Benefit Obligation:\nBeginning balance\n$\n49,592\n \n$\n49,028\n \nService cost attributable to continuing operations\n189\n \n222\n \nInterest cost\n2,385\n \n2,507\n \nActuarial (gain) loss\n(\n2,013\n)\n1,909\n \nTotal benefits paid \n(1)\n(\n3,633\n)\n(\n4,258\n)\nNet settlement, curtailment, and special termination benefits\n9\n \n5\n \nPlan amendments\n36\n \n19\n \nBusiness combinations and divestitures\n(\n23\n)\n—\n \nOther \n(2)\n(\n220\n)\n160\n \nEnding balance\n$\n46,322\n \n$\n49,592\n \nChange in Plan Assets:\nBeginning balance\n$\n48,945\n \n$\n47,960\n \nActual return on plan assets\n1,092\n \n4,730\n \nEmployer contributions \n(1)\n235\n \n363\n \nTotal benefits paid \n(1)\n(\n3,633\n)\n(\n4,258\n)\nSettlements\n(\n3\n)\n(\n2\n)\nBusiness combinations and divestitures\n—\n \n—\n \nOther \n(2)\n(\n222\n)\n152\n \nEnding balance\n$\n46,414\n \n$\n48,945\n \n(1)    Includes benefit payments paid directly by the company.\n(2)    The amount included in Other primarily reflects the impact of foreign exchange translation, primarily for plans in the United Kingdom and Canada, and participant contributions.\nPension\nPRB\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nFunded Status:\nFair value of plan assets\n$\n46,414\n \n$\n48,945\n \n$\n314\n \n$\n316\n \nBenefit obligations\n(\n46,322\n)\n(\n49,592\n)\n(\n898\n)\n(\n962\n)\nFunded status of plan\n$\n92\n \n$\n(\n647\n)\n$\n(\n584\n)\n$\n(\n646\n)\nAmounts Recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet Consist of:\nNon-current assets\n$\n1,819\n \n$\n1,296\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nCurrent liability\n(\n195\n)\n(\n206\n)\n(\n61\n)\n(\n64\n)\nNon-current liability\n(\n1,532\n)\n(\n1,737\n)\n(\n523\n)\n(\n582\n)\nNet amount recognized\n$\n92\n \n$\n(\n647\n)\n$\n(\n584\n)\n$\n(\n646\n)\nAmounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Consist of:\nNet actuarial loss (gain)\n$\n4,926\n \n$\n4,311\n \n$\n(\n296\n)\n$\n(\n325\n)\nPrior service credit\n(\n1,044\n)\n(\n1,246\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n3\n)\nNet amount recognized\n$\n3,882\n \n$\n3,065\n \n$\n(\n297\n)\n$\n(\n328\n)\n91\nTable of Contents\nThe majority of our pension obligations relate to our U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) qualified pension plans, which comprise \n86\n% of our pension PBO as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.

The PBO discount rate is used for the service cost and interest cost measurements for non-significant plans.\n \nThe weighted-average discount rates used to measure pension liabilities are generally based on yield curves developed using high-quality corporate bonds as well as plan specific expected cash flows. For our significant plans, we utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit expense by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant discounted projected cash flows. \nIn determining the EROA assumption, we consider the target asset allocation of plan assets, as well as economic and other indicators of future performance. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in determining the appropriate capital market assumptions. Return projections are validated using a simulation model that incorporates yield curves, credit spreads, and risk premiums to project long-term prospective returns.\nPlan Assets.\n The plans’ investment management objectives include providing the liquidity and asset levels needed to meet current and future benefit payments, while maintaining a prudent degree of portfolio diversification considering interest rate risk and market volatility. Globally, on average, investment strategies generally target a mix o\nf \n26\n% to \n46\n% \nof growth seeking assets and \n54\n% to \n74\n% of \nincome generating and hedging assets using a wide set of diversified asset types, fund strategies, and investment managers. The growth seeking allocation consists of global public equities in developed and emerging countries, private equity, and real estate. Growth assets include an enhanced alpha strategy that invests in publicly traded equity and fixed income securities, derivatives, and foreign currency. Investments in private equity are primarily via limited partnership interests in buy-out strategies with smaller allocations to distressed debt funds. The real estate strategy is principally concentrated in directly held U.S. core investments with some smaller investments in international, value-added, and opportunistic strategies. Within the income generating assets, the fixed income portfolio consists of mainly government and broadly diversified high quality corporate bonds.\nThe plans have continued their pension risk management techniques designed to reduce their interest rate risk. Specifically, the plans have incorporated liability hedging programs that include the adoption of a risk reduction objective as part of the long-term investment strategy. Under this objective the interest rate hedge is intended to increase as funded status improves. The \n93\nTable of Contents\nhedging programs incorporate a range of assets and investment tools, each with varying interest rate sensitivities. The investment portfolios are currently hedging approximatel\ny \n80\n%\n of the interest rate sensitivity of the pension plan liabilities, depending on the funded status of the plan.\nThe fair values of pension plan assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 by asset category are as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\nQuoted Prices in Active Markets For Identical Assets\n(Level 1)\nSignificant Observable Inputs\n(Level 2) \nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\n(Level 3)\nNot Subject to Leveling \n(7)\nTotal\nAsset Category:\nPublic Equities\nGlobal Equities\n$\n6,195\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n6,208\n \nGlobal Equity Commingled Funds \n(1)\n—\n \n624\n \n—\n \n—\n \n624\n \nOther Public Equities\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,431\n \n2,431\n \nPrivate Equities\n (2)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4,985\n \n4,985\n \nFixed Income Securities\nGovernments\n4,462\n \n801\n \n—\n \n—\n \n5,263\n \nCorporate Bonds\n1\n \n11,343\n \n—\n \n—\n \n11,344\n \nStructured Products\n \n—\n \n27\n \n—\n \n—\n \n27\n \nOther Fixed Income\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n11,259\n \n11,259\n \nReal Estate\n (3)\n—\n \n—\n \n1,481\n \n1,557\n \n3,038\n \nOther\n (4)\n—\n \n513\n \n—\n \n113\n \n626\n \nCash & Cash Equivalents\n (5)\n—\n \n341\n \n—\n \n79\n \n420\n \nSubtotal\n$\n10,658\n \n$\n13,662\n \n$\n1,481\n \n$\n20,424\n \n$\n46,225\n \nOther Assets & Liabilities \n(6)\n \n \n \n189\n \nTotal at December 31, 2024\n$\n46,414\n \nPublic Equities\nGlobal Equities\n$\n6,156\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n6,160\n \nGlobal Equity Commingled Funds \n(1)\n—\n \n1,012\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,012\n \nOther Public Equities\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,308\n \n2,308\n \nPrivate Equities\n (2)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4,936\n \n4,936\n \nFixed Income Securities\nGovernments\n3,507\n \n1,560\n \n—\n \n—\n \n5,067\n \nCorporate Bonds\n—\n \n13,185\n \n—\n \n—\n \n13,185\n \nStructured Products\n \n—\n \n57\n \n—\n \n—\n \n57\n \nOther Fixed Income\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n9,669\n \n9,669\n \nReal Estate\n (3)\n—\n \n—\n \n1,467\n \n1,632\n \n3,099\n \nOther\n (4)\n—\n \n560\n \n—\n \n2,415\n \n2,975\n \nCash & Cash Equivalents\n (5)\n—\n \n383\n \n—\n \n128\n \n511\n \nSubtotal\n$\n9,663\n \n$\n16,761\n \n$\n1,467\n \n$\n21,088\n \n$\n48,979\n \nOther Assets & Liabilities \n(6)\n \n \n \n(\n34\n)\nTotal at December 31, 2023\n$\n48,945\n \n(1)    Represents commingled funds that invest primarily in common stocks.\n(2)    Represents limited partnership investments with general partners that primarily invest in equity and debt.\n(3)    Represents investments in real estate including commingled funds and directly held properties.\n(4)    Represents global balanced risk commingled funds that invest in multiple asset classes including equity, fixed income, and some commodities. “Other” also includes insurance contracts.\n(5)    Represents short-term commercial paper, bonds, and other cash or cash-like instruments.\n(6)    Represents receivables, payables, and certain individually immaterial international plan assets that are not leveled.\n(7)    Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Derivative instruments mainly consist of equity futures, interest rate futures, interest rate swaps, and currency forward contracts. The fair market value of the plans’ derivatives through direct or separate account investments was approximately ($\n120\n million) and $\n345\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe review our assets at least quarterly to ensure we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. We employ a broadly diversified investment manager structure that includes diversification by active and passive management, style, capitalization, country, sector, industry, and number of investment managers. No individual investment represented more than \n5\n% of the plan assets as of December 31, 2024.\nThe fair value measurement of plan assets using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) changed due to the following:\n(dollars in millions)\nBalance, December 31, 2022\n$\n1,650\n \nRealized losses\n(\n69\n)\nUnrealized losses relating to instruments still held in the reporting period\n(\n134\n)\nPurchases, sales, and settlements, net\n20\n \nBalance, December 31, 2023\n1,467\n \nRealized losses \n(\n136\n)\nUnrealized gains relating to instruments still held in the reporting period\n27\n \nPurchases, sales, and settlements, net\n123\n \nBalance, December 31, 2024\n$\n1,481\n \nQuoted market prices are used to value investments when available. Investments in securities traded on exchanges, including listed futures and options, are valued at the last reported sale prices on the last business day of the year or, if not available, the last reported bid prices. Fixed income securities are primarily measured using a market approach pricing methodology, where observable prices are obtained by market transactions involving identical or comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. Mortgages have been valued on the basis of their future principal and interest payments discounted at prevailing interest rates for similar investments. Investment contracts are valued at fair value by discounting the related cash flows based on current yields of similar instruments with comparable durations. Real estate investments are valued on a quarterly basis using discounted cash flow models which consider long-term lease estimates, future rental receipts, and estimated residual values. Valuation estimates are supplemented by third-party appraisals on an annual basis.\nThe fair market value of assets related to our PRB benefits was $\n314\n million and $\n316\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These assets include $\n73\n million and $\n93\n million of which are invested in our domestic qualified pension plan trust at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The remaining PRB investments are held within Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts. The VEBA assets are generally invested in mutual funds and are valued primarily using quoted prices in active markets (Level 1). There were \nno\n Level 3 investments in the VEBA trusts as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nWe have set aside assets in separate trusts, which we expect to be used to pay for certain nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution plan obligations in excess of qualified plan limits. These assets are included in Other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. \nThe fair value of marketable securities held in trusts as of December 31 was as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nMarketable securities held in trusts\n$\n786\n \n$\n745\n \nNOTE 11: LEASES\nWe enter into lease agreements for the use of real estate space, vehicles, IT equipment, and certain other equipment, including engines, under both operating and finance leases. The majority of our lease agreements are accounted for as operating leases. Operating lease expense was $\n422\n million, $\n463\n million, and $\n475\n million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Finance leases are not considered significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Operations, or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nLeases under which we are the lessor are generally short-term leases that support our commercial aerospace customers during maintenance events. Our commercial aerospace customers have varying forms of aftermarket maintenance coverage that often provide a level of support for leased engines as part of the revenue arrangement. As such, leases where we are the lessor are not \n95\nTable of Contents\nconsidered significant to our Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Operations, or Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nIn 2024 and 2023, we entered into sale and leaseback transactions for the sale of new engines and related maintenance.

A provision enacted in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 related to the capitalization of research and experimental expenditures for tax purposes became effective on January 1, 2022. In September and December 2023, the IRS issued interim guidance, retroactive to 2022, clarifying the capitalization requirements for certain types of research and experimental expenditures. The IRS notices also provide that the Department of the Treasury and the IRS intend to issue proposed regulations consistent with the guidance set forth in the notices and that taxpayers may rely on the guidance in the notices prior to the issuance of the proposed regulations. The Company’s analysis determined the guidance provided in the notices results in fewer costs being subject to capitalization, and as such, costs previously required to be capitalized are now deductible in the year incurred. The Company will review the proposed regulations when issued and adjust the estimates as necessary.\nReconciliation of Effective Income Tax Rate. \nDifferences between effective income tax rates and the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate are as follows:\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(dollars in millions)\nAmount\nRate\nAmount\nRate\nAmount\nRate\nStatutory U.S. federal income tax rate\n$\n1,301\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n805\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n1,285\n \n21.0\n \n%\nTax on international activities\n6\n \n0.1\n \n(\n27\n)\n(\n0.7\n)\n(\n186\n)\n(\n3.1\n)\nDisposals of businesses\n126\n \n2.0\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nU.S. research and development credit\n(\n188\n)\n(\n3.0\n)\n(\n168\n)\n(\n4.4\n)\n(\n164\n)\n(\n2.7\n)\nU.S. federal audit settlements and statute lapse\n(\n277\n)\n(\n4.5\n)\n(\n59\n)\n(\n1.5\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nState income tax, net\n187\n \n3.0\n \n17\n \n0.4\n \n59\n \n1.0\n \nForeign Derived Intangible Income (FDII)\n(\n126\n)\n(\n2.0\n)\n(\n142\n)\n(\n3.7\n)\n(\n214\n)\n(\n3.5\n)\nNon-deductible legal charges \n(1)\n148\n2.4\n \n5\n \n0.1\n \n—\n \n—\n \nOther\n4\n \n0.1\n \n25\n \n0.7\n \n10\n \n0.2\n \nEffective income tax rate\n$\n1,181\n \n19.1\n \n%\n$\n456\n \n11.9\n \n%\n$\n790\n \n12.9\n \n%\n(1)    2024 includes the impact of certain non-deductible legal charges related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters.

In addition, the effective tax rate includes $\n224\n million of tax expense associated with the 2024 dispositions.\nAlso included in the effective tax rate is a $\n212\n million tax charge related to U.S. federal income taxes now owed by the Company resulting from a favorable non-U.S. tax ruling Otis received in 2024. The ruling Otis received reduces U.S. foreign tax credits previously claimed by the Company in pre-separation tax years. The Company also recognized a $\n56\n million tax \n97\nTable of Contents\nbenefit in response to favorable U.S. Tax Court rulings issued to unrelated taxpayers, but with similar facts as ours. Both of these items are subject to a tax matters agreement entered into with Carrier and Otis in connection with the separations of those businesses in 2020. Accordingly, the Company recorded a pre-tax benefit of $\n212\n million for a portion of the indemnity owed by Otis to the Company for the reduction in foreign taxes in the pre-separation years and a pre-tax charge of $\n32\n million for the indemnified amounts payable to Carrier and Otis associated with the $\n56\n million tax benefit. Additionally, the Company is indemnified by Otis for the associated interest related to the Otis non-US ruling.\nThe 2023 effective tax rate includes a benefit of $\n168\n million associated with U.S. research and development credits, $\n142\n million related to the FDII benefit, and a federal tax benefit of $\n59\n million associated with the expiration of the U.S. federal income tax statute of limitations for RTX’s 2019 tax year. \nThe 2022 effective tax rate includes a benefit of $\n214\n million related to the FDII benefit, $\n207\n million associated with legal entity and operational reorganizations implemented in 2022, and $\n164\n million associated with U.S. research and development credits.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities. \nThe tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which gave rise to future income tax benefits and payables at December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nFuture income tax benefits:\nInsurance and employee benefits\n$\n897\n \n$\n994\n \nInventory and contract balances\n—\n \n571\n \nWarranty provisions\n221\n \n240\n \nCapitalization of research and experimental expenditures\n2,208\n \n1,631\n \nOther basis differences\n1,060\n \n779\n \nPowder Metal Matter\n455\n \n644\n \nTax loss carryforwards\n1,055\n \n905\n \nTax credit carryforwards\n800\n \n891\n \nValuation allowances\n(\n1,439\n)\n(\n1,465\n)\nTotal future income tax benefits\n$\n5,257\n \n$\n5,190\n \nFuture income taxes payable:\nGoodwill and Intangible assets\n$\n5,675\n \n$\n6,228\n \nFixed assets\n1,614\n \n1,739\n \nInventory and contract balances\n193\n \n—\n \nOther basis differences\n627\n \n238\n \nTotal future income tax payable\n$\n8,109\n \n$\n8,205\n \nValuation allowances have been established primarily for tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards, and certain temporary differences to reduce the future income tax benefits to expected realizable amounts. \nChanges to valuation allowances consisted of the following:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at January 1\n$\n1,465\n \n$\n842\n \n$\n825\n \nAdditions charged to income tax expense\n228\n \n170\n \n54\n \nReductions credited to income tax expense\n(\n239\n)\n(\n58\n)\n(\n82\n)\nOther adjustments \n(1)\n(\n15\n)\n511\n \n45\n \nBalance at December 31\n$\n1,439\n \n$\n1,465\n \n$\n842\n \n(1)     2023 includes the addition of the indefinite-lived tax loss carryforwards now disclosed in connection with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two.\n98\nTable of Contents\nTax Credit and Loss Carryforwards. \nAt December 31, 2024, tax credit carryforwards, principally state and foreign, and tax loss carryforwards, principally state and foreign, were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\nTax Credit Carryforwards\nTax Loss Carryforwards\nExpiration period:\n2025-2029\n$\n56\n \n$\n327\n \n2030-2034\n37\n \n137\n \n2035-2044\n201\n \n1,255\n \nIndefinite\n506\n \n3,823\n \nTotal\n$\n800\n \n$\n5,542\n \nUnrecognized Tax Benefits. \nAt December 31, 2024, we had gross tax-effected unrecognized tax benefits of $\n1,263\n million, of which $\n1,254\n million, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. \nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits and interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 is as follows: \n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at January 1\n$\n1,442\n \n$\n1,515\n \n$\n1,458\n \nAdditions for tax positions related to the current year\n84\n \n89\n \n106\n \nAdditions for tax positions of prior years\n164\n \n5\n \n23\n \nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n(\n13\n)\n(\n141\n)\n(\n56\n)\nSettlements\n(\n414\n)\n(\n26\n)\n(\n16\n)\nBalance at December 31\n$\n1,263\n \n$\n1,442\n \n$\n1,515\n \nGross interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits\n$\n127\n \n$\n62\n \n$\n34\n \nTotal accrued interest balance at December 31\n255\n \n233\n \n190\n \nWe conduct business globally and, as a result, RTX or one or more of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations for years before 2014.\nThe Company filed protests with respect to certain IRS proposed adjustments for RTX (formerly United Technologies Corporation) tax years 2017 and 2018, pre-acquisition Rockwell Collins tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018, and pre-merger Raytheon Company tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019 as well as certain refund claims of Raytheon Company for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016 filed prior to the Raytheon merger. The Company will dispute these adjustments at the Appeals Division of the IRS. The timing of any resolution at the Appeals Division is uncertain. On January 15, 2025, the IRS notified the Company of its intent to close the examination of RTX’s 2020 tax year.\nOn January 7, 2025, the Appeals Committee of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) General Services Tax Committee (GSTC) issued an unfavorable decision to Raytheon Middle East Systems Company, Saudi Arabia branch (RAYMES Branch) with respect to income tax and withholding tax assessments for the years ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2019. As a result of the unfavorable decision, RAYMES Branch has been assessed tax and delay fines of approximately $\n230\n million due in 2025, with an estimated Net income charge of $\n30\n million to $\n50\n million. The Company and RAYMES Branch continue to believe the position of the KSA tax authority is not supported by the facts in question or KSA tax law, and plan to pursue available options to seek reversal of GSTC’s decision.\nIn the ordinary course of business, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. It is reasonably possible that over the next 12 months the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change within a range of a net reduction of $\n200\n million to a net increase of $\n25\n million as a result of the revaluation of uncertain tax positions arising from developments in examinations, in appeals, or in the courts, or the closure of tax statutes.\n \n99\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 13: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nWe enter into derivative instruments primarily for risk management purposes, including derivatives designated as hedging instruments and those utilized as economic hedges. We operate internationally and in the normal course of business, are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity prices. These fluctuations can increase the costs of financing, investing, and operating the business. We have used derivative instruments, including swaps, forward contracts, and options, to manage certain foreign currency, interest rate, and commodity price exposures.\nThe present value of the aggregate notional principal of our outstanding foreign currency hedges was \n$\n17\n billion \nand\n $\n16\n billion\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. At December 31, 2024, all derivative contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges will mature b\ny May 2036.\n Additional information pertaining to foreign exchange and hedging activities is included in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.”\nThe following table summarizes the fair value and presentation in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for derivative instruments as of December 31:\n(dollars in millions)\nBalance Sheet Location\n2024\n2023\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\nOther assets, current\n$\n177\n \n$\n225\n \nOther accrued liabilities\n350\n \n143\n \nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\nOther assets, current\n$\n10\n \n$\n83\n \nOther accrued liabilities\n101\n \n37\n \nThe effect of cash flow hedging relationships on Accumulated other comprehensive loss and on the Consolidated Statement of Operations in 2024 and 2023 are presented in “Note 18: Equity.” The amounts of gain or loss are attributable to foreign exchange contract activity and are primarily recorded as a component of Products sales when reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nThe Company utilizes the critical terms match method in assessing derivatives for hedge effectiveness. Accordingly, the hedged items and derivatives designated as hedging instruments are highly effective.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had €\n320\n million and €\n500\n million, respectively, of our €\n500\n million principal value of euro-denominated long-term debt designated as a net investment hedge against our investments in European businesses, which is deemed to be effective. These hedging gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and will be reclassified to earnings when the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we de-designated €\n180\n million of our euro-denominated debt and recorded the effects within Other income (expense), net. \nThe effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included within Other income (expense), net, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and is not significant.\nNOTE 14: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following tables provide the valuation hierarchy classification of assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value and measured on a recurring basis in our Consolidated Balance Sheet:\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n(dollars in millions)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nRecurring fair value measurements:\nMarketable securities held in trusts\n$\n786\n \n$\n721\n \n$\n65\n \n$\n—\n \nDerivative assets\n187\n \n—\n \n187\n \n—\n \nDerivative liabilities\n451\n \n—\n \n451\n \n—\n \n100\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\n \n(dollars in millions)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nRecurring fair value measurements:\nMarketable securities held in trusts\n$\n745\n \n$\n682\n \n$\n63\n \n$\n—\n \nDerivative assets\n308\n \n—\n \n308\n \n—\n \nDerivative liabilities\n180\n \n—\n \n180\n \n—\n \nValuation Techniques.\n Our derivative assets and liabilities include foreign exchange contracts that are measured at fair value using internal models based on observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk, and our counterparties’ credit risks. \nAs of December 31, 2024, there has not been any significant impact to the fair value of our derivative liabilities due to our own credit risk.

IAE’s business purpose is to coordinate the design, development, manufacturing, and product support of the V2500 engine program through involvement with the collaborators. Additionally, Pratt & Whitney, JAEC, and MTU are participants in the International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) collaboration, whose business purpose is to coordinate the design, development, manufacturing, and product support for the PW1100G-JM engine for the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. Pratt & Whitney holds a \n59\n% program share interest and a \n59\n% ownership interest in IAE LLC. IAE and IAE LLC retain limited equity with the primary economics of the programs passed to the participants. As such, we have determined that IAE and IAE LLC are variable interest entities with Pratt & Whitney as the primary beneficiary. IAE and IAE LLC have, therefore, been consolidated. Other collaborators participate in Pratt & Whitney’s program share interest in IAE and IAE LLC. Pratt & Whitney’s net program share interest in IAE and IAE LLC, after considering its sub-collaborator share, is \n57\n% and \n51\n%, respectively. \nThe carrying amounts and \n101\nTable of Contents\nclassification of assets and liabilities for variable interest entities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\nCurrent assets\n$\n10,315\n \n$\n9,309\n \nNon-current assets\n1,060\n \n860\n \nTotal assets\n$\n11,375\n \n$\n10,169\n \nCurrent liabilities\n$\n13,595\n \n$\n13,020\n \nNon-current liabilities\n140\n \n31\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n13,735\n \n$\n13,051\n \nNOTE 16: GUARANTEES\nWe extend a variety of financial, market value, and product performance guarantees to third parties. These instruments expire on various dates through 2026. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding. A portion of our third party guarantees are subject to indemnification for our benefit for any liabilities that could arise. \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the following financial guarantees were outstanding:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(dollars in millions)\nMaximum Potential Payment\nCarrying Amount of Liability\nMaximum Potential Payment\nCarrying Amount of Liability\nCommercial aerospace financing arrangements\n$\n274\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n288\n \n$\n—\n \nThird party guarantees\n79\n \n1\n \n386\n \n1\n \nWe have made residual value and other guarantees related to various commercial aerospace customer financing arrangements.

Collaboration partners’ share of these financing guarantees is $\n131\n million and $\n135\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe also have obligations arising from sales of certain businesses and assets, including those from representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental, health and safety, tax, and employment matters. The maximum potential payment related to these obligations is not a specified amount, as a number of the obligations do not contain financial caps. The carrying amount of liabilities related to these obligations were $\n101\n million and $\n97\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These primarily relate to environmental liabilities, which are included in our total environmental liabilities as further discussed in “Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies.”\nWe accrue for costs associated with guarantees when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued.\nWe also provide service and warranty policies on our products and extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal service and warranty policies on some of our products, particularly commercial aircraft engines. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with specific product performance issues. Liabilities for performance and operating cost guarantees are based upon future product performance and durability, and are largely estimated based upon historical experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claims data and historical experience warrant. \nThe changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties and product performance guarantees for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance as of January 1\n$\n1,091\n \n$\n1,109\n \n$\n1,157\n \nWarranties and performance guarantees issued\n216\n \n305\n \n264\n \nSettlements\n(\n247\n)\n(\n308\n)\n(\n284\n)\nOther\n(\n67\n)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n28\n)\nBalance as of December 31\n$\n993\n \n$\n1,091\n \n$\n1,109\n \n102\nTable of Contents\nProduct and service guarantees incurred in connection with long-term production contracts and certain aftermarket arrangements are generally accounted for within the contract estimates at completion.\nNOTE 17: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nExcept as otherwise noted, while we are unable to predict the final outcome, based on information currently available, we do not believe that resolution of any of the following matters will have a material adverse effect upon our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nEnvironmental.\n Our operations are subject to environmental regulation by federal, state, and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have accrued for the costs of environmental remediation activities, including but not limited to investigatory, remediation, operating and maintenance costs, and performance guarantees, and periodically reassess these amounts. We do not expect any additional liability to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $\n0.8\n billion reserved for environmental remediation. Additional information pertaining to environmental matters is included in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles.”\nCommercial Aerospace Financing and Other Commitments. \nWe had commercial aerospace financing commitments and other contractual commitments of approximately $\n14.1\n billion and $\n14.6\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, on a gross basis before reduction for our collaboration partners’ share. Aircraft financing commitments, in the form of debt or lease financing, are provided to certain commercial aerospace customers. The extent to which the financing commitments will be utilized is not currently known, since customers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from other financing sources. We may also arrange for third-party investors to assume a portion of these commitments. The majority of financing commitments are collateralized arrangements. We may also lease aircraft and subsequently sublease the aircraft to customers under long-term non-cancelable operating leases, or pay deposits on behalf of our customers to secure production slots with the airframers (pre-delivery payments). Our financing commitments with customers are contingent upon maintenance of certain levels of financial condition by our customers. Associated risks on these commitments are mitigated due to the fact that interest rates are variable during the commitment term and are set at the date of funding based on current market conditions, the fair value of the underlying collateral, and the credit worthiness of our customers. As a result, the fair value of these financing commitments is expected to equal the amounts funded.\nWe also have other contractual commitments to make payments to secure certain contractual rights to provide product on new aircraft platforms. The estimated amount and timing of these payments, which are generally based on future sales or engine flight hours, are reflected in “Other commercial aerospace commitments” in the table below. Payments made on these contractual commitments are included within intangible assets as exclusivity assets and are amortized over the term of underlying economic benefit. We have entered into certain collaboration arrangements, which may include participation by our collaboration partners in these commitments. In addition, in connection with our 2012 agreement to acquire Rolls-Royce’s ownership and collaboration interests in IAE, additional payments are due to Rolls-Royce contingent upon each hour flown through June 2027 by the V2500-powered aircraft in service as of the acquisition date. These flight hour payments, which are considered in “Other commercial aerospace commitments” below, will be capitalized as collaboration intangible assets as payments are made. \nThe following is the expected maturity of our commercial aerospace industry commitments as of December 31, 2024:\n(dollars in millions)\nCommitted\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nCommercial aerospace financing commitments\n$\n4,650\n \n$\n1,603\n \n$\n1,633\n \n$\n861\n \n$\n181\n \n$\n161\n \n$\n211\n \nOther commercial aerospace commitments\n9,463\n \n846\n \n770\n \n704\n \n690\n \n532\n \n5,921\n \nCollaboration partners’ share\n(\n5,786\n)\n(\n971\n)\n(\n1,020\n)\n(\n680\n)\n(\n377\n)\n(\n291\n)\n(\n2,447\n)\nTotal commercial aerospace commitments\n$\n8,327\n \n$\n1,478\n \n$\n1,383\n \n$\n885\n \n$\n494\n \n$\n402\n \n$\n3,685\n \nOther Financing Arrangements. \nWe have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention, and advance payment obligations for us or our affiliates. We enter into these agreements to assist certain affiliates in obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. The stated values of these letters of credit agreements and surety bonds totaled $\n3.1\n billion as of December 31, 2024.\nOffset / Industrial Participation Obligations. \nWe have entered into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes in the form of either offset agreements or ICIP agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain \n103\nTable of Contents\ncustomers in foreign countries. At December 31, 2024, the aggregate amount of these agreements, both agreed to and anticipated to be agreed to, had an outstanding notional value of approximately $\n12.6\n billion. These agreements are designed to return economic value to the foreign country by requiring us to engage in activities supporting local defense or commercial industries, promoting a balance of trade, developing in-country technology capabilities, or addressing other local development priorities. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require a direct cash payment, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing, training, and other consulting support to in-country projects, and the purchase by third parties (e.g., our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements may also be satisfied through our use of cash for activities such as subcontracting with local partners, purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, and making investments in local ventures. Such activities may also vary by country depending upon requirements as dictated by their governments. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customers and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the notional value in the offset agreements. Offset programs usually extend over several or more years and may provide for penalties in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. Historically, we have not been required to pay any penalties of significance.\nGovernment Oversight.\n In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries and our properties are subject to regulatory and governmental examinations, information gathering requests, inquiries, investigations, and threatened legal actions and proceedings. For example, we are now, and believe that, in light of the current U.S. government contracting and overall enforcement environment, we will continue to be the subject of one or more U.S. government investigations. Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to audits. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), the Inspectors General of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the DOJ, and Congressional Committees. Other areas of our business operations may also be subject to audit and investigation by these and other agencies. From time to time, agencies investigate or conduct audits to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable requirements. Such investigations and audits may be initiated due to a number of reasons, including as a result of a whistleblower complaint. Such investigations and audits could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including the imposition of repayment obligations, fines, treble or other damages, forfeitures, disgorgement, restitution, or penalties, the suspension of government export licenses, and/or suspension or debarment from future U.S. government contracting. They could also result in deferred prosecution agreements, administrative orders, consent agreements, guilty plea agreements, and/or imposition of an independent compliance monitor. U.S. government investigations often take years to complete. In particular, as described above in “Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles”, in 2024, the Company entered into a DPA with the DOJ and the Company settled an administrative proceeding with the SEC (the SEC Administrative Order) to resolve the previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into payments made by Raytheon Company and its joint venture, TRS, since 2012 in connection with certain Middle East contracts. The Company also entered into a DPA and an FCA settlement agreement with the DOJ to resolve previously disclosed criminal and civil government investigations into defective pricing claims for certain legacy Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013 and in 2017. \nUnder these DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order, Raytheon Company and the Company are required to retain, among other things, an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged) and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure obligations (for a term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company’s and the Company’s compliance with their respective obligations under the DPAs and the SEC Administrative Order. In 2024, the Company also resolved certain voluntarily disclosed export controls violations primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser extent, Raytheon Company, including certain violations that were resolved pursuant to a CA with the DOS. The CA, which has a three-year term, requires the Company to implement remedial compliance measures and to conduct an external audit of the Company’s ITAR compliance program. The CA also requires appointment of an external, independent SCO. The Company appointed its SCO on September 27, 2024. As noted above, the U.S. government reserves the right to suspend or debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal, or other seriously improper conduct. The U.S. government could also void any contracts found to be tainted by fraud. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices because, for example, cost or pricing data or cost accounting practices used to price and negotiate those contracts may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports recommend that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate and/or litigate. The Company may be, and in some cases has been, required to make payments into escrow of disputed liabilities while the related litigation is pending. If the litigation is resolved in the Company’s favor, any such payments will be returned to the Company with interest. Our final allowable incurred costs for each year are \n104\nTable of Contents\nalso subject to audit and have, from time to time, resulted in disputes between us and the U.S. government, with litigation resulting at the Court of Federal Claims (COFC) or the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA), or their related courts of appeals. In addition, the DOJ has, from time to time, convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the U.S., and those sales are subject to local government laws, regulations, and procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with such local government regulations or any applicable U.S. government regulations (e.g., Arms Export Control Act (AECA), Export Administration Regulations (EAR), Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), and ITAR) may also be investigated or audited. In addition, we accrue for liabilities associated with those matters that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The most likely liability amount to be incurred is accrued based upon a range of estimates. Where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, then we accrue the minimum amount. Other than as specifically disclosed in this Form 10-K, we do not expect these audits, investigations or disputes to have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity, either individually or in the aggregate.\nTax Treatment of Carrier and Otis Dispositions. \nManagement has determined that the distributions of Carrier and Otis on April 3, 2020, and certain related internal business separation transactions, qualified as tax-free under applicable law. In making these determinations, we applied the tax law in the relevant jurisdictions to our facts and circumstances and obtained tax rulings from the relevant taxing authorities, tax opinions, and/or other external tax advice related to the concluded tax treatment. If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis or certain internal business separation transactions were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future reporting periods.\nPratt & Whitney Powder Metal Matter.\n In 2023, Pratt & Whitney determined that a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain engine parts requires accelerated inspection of the PW1100 GTF fleet, which powers the A320neo. This determination was made pursuant to Pratt & Whitney’s safety management system. \nOn August 4, 2023, Pratt & Whitney issued a special instruction (SI) to operators of PW1100 GTF powered A320neo aircraft, which required accelerated inspections and engine removals covering an initial subset of operational engines, no later than September 15, 2023. During the third quarter of 2023, through its safety management system, Pratt & Whitney continued its engineering and industrial assessment, which resulted in an updated fleet management plan for the remaining PW1100 fleet. This updated plan requires a combination of part inspections and retirements for some high pressure turbine and high pressure compressor parts made from affected raw material. Guidance to affected operators was released via service bulletins (SB) and SI in November 2023, and this guidance has been reflected in airworthiness directives issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Consistent with previous information, the actions are resulting in significant incremental shop visits. \nAs a result of this matter, Pratt & Whitney expects aircraft on ground levels for the PW1100 powered A320neo fleet to remain elevated through 2026. As a result of anticipated increased aircraft on ground levels and expected compensation to customers for this disruption, as well as incremental maintenance costs resulting from increased inspections and shop visits, Pratt & Whitney recorded a pre-tax operating profit charge in the third quarter of 2023 of $\n2.9\n billion, reflecting Pratt & Whitney’s net \n51\n% program share of the PW1100 program. This amount reflected our best estimate of expected customer compensation for the estimated duration of the disruption as well as the EAC adjustment impact of this matter to Pratt & Whitney’s long-term maintenance contracts. The incremental costs to the business’s long-term maintenance contracts include the estimated cost of additional inspections, replacement of parts, and other related impacts.\nThe charge recorded in the third quarter of 2023 resulted in a net increase in Other accrued liabilities of $\n2.8\n billion, which principally related to our \n51\n% share of an accrual for expected customer compensation. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had other accrued liabilities of $\n1.7\n billion and $\n2.8\n billion, respectively, primarily related to expected compensation to customers. The decrease in the accrual during 2024 was primarily due to customer compensation in the form of credits issued and cash paid to customers during the period.\nOther engine models within Pratt & Whitney’s fleet contain parts manufactured with affected powder metal, but we do not currently believe there will be any resultant significant financial impact with respect to these other engine models at this time. The financial impact of the powder metal issue is based on historical experience and is subject to various assumptions and judgments, most notably, the number and expected timing of shop visits, inspection results and scope of work to be performed, turnaround time, availability of parts, available capacity at overhaul facilities, and outcomes of negotiations with impacted customers. While these assumptions reflect our best estimates at this time, they are subject to variability. Potential changes to these assumptions and actual incurred costs could significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements and could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations for the periods in which they are recognized.\nLegal Proceedings. \nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to various contract pricing disputes, government investigations, and litigation matters across jurisdictions, updates to certain of which are set forth below.\n105\nTable of Contents\nCost Accounting Standards Claims\nAs previously disclosed, in April 2019, a Divisional Administrative Contracting Officer (DACO) of the United States DCMA asserted a claim against Pratt & Whitney to recover alleged overpayments of approximately $\n1.7\n billion plus interest ($\n1.3\n billion at December 31, 2024). The claim is based on Pratt & Whitney’s alleged noncompliance with Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) from January 1, 2007 to March 31, 2019, due to its method of allocating independent research and development costs to government contracts. Pratt & Whitney believes that the claim is without merit and filed an appeal to the ASBCA on June 7, 2019. \nOn September 30, 2024, a DCMA DACO issued a second claim against Pratt & Whitney that similarly alleges that Pratt & Whitney was noncompliant with CAS due to its method of allocating independent research and development costs to government contracts from April 1, 2019 to December 31, 2023. The second claim demands payment of $\n1.1\n billion plus interest ($\n305\n million at \nDecember 31, 2024\n)\n.\n \nPratt & Whitney believes the second claim is without merit and filed an appeal to the ASBCA on October 15, 2024.\nAs previously disclosed, in December 2013, a DCMA DACO asserted a claim against Pratt & Whitney to recover alleged overpayments of approximately $\n177\n million plus interest ($\n183\n million at December 31, 2024). The claim is based on Pratt & Whitney’s alleged noncompliance with CAS from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2012, due to its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts used in the calculation of material overhead costs for government contracts. In 2014, Pratt & Whitney filed an appeal to the ASBCA. An evidentiary hearing was held and completed in June 2019. On November 22, 2021, the ASBCA issued its written decision sustaining in part and denying in part Pratt & Whitney’s appeal. The ASBCA rejected the DCMA’s asserted measure of the cost of collaborator parts, and ruled substantially in Pratt & Whitney’s favor on other liability issues. The ASBCA remanded the appeal to the parties for resolution of damages issues, which could require further proceedings at the ASBCA. On December 23, 2021, the DCMA filed a motion with the ASBCA seeking partial reconsideration of the November 22, 2021 decision. The motion for reconsideration was denied on August 29, 2022. On December 23, 2022, the DCMA filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. We continue to believe that the ASBCA’s rejection of the DCMA’s asserted measure of the cost of collaborator parts is well supported in fact and law and likely will be sustained. In December 2018, a DCMA DACO issued a second claim against Pratt & Whitney that similarly alleges that its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts does not comply with the CAS for calendar years 2013 through 2017. This second claim, which asserts the same measure of the cost of collaborator parts rejected by the ASBCA’s November 22, 2021 decision, demands payment of $\n269\n million plus interest ($\n156\n million at December 31, 2024). Pratt & Whitney appealed this second claim to the ASBCA in January 2019. In December 2023, a DCMA DACO issued a third claim against Pratt & Whitney that similarly alleges that its method of determining the cost of collaborator parts does not comply with the CAS for calendar years 2018 through 2022. This third claim, which asserts the same measure of the cost of collaborator parts rejected by the ASBCA’s prior decision, demands payment of $\n277\n million plus interest ($\n80\n million at December 31, 2024). Pratt & Whitney appealed this third claim to the ASBCA at the end of December 2023. Although subject to further litigation at the ASBCA and potentially further appellate proceedings, we continue to believe that the November 22, 2021 decision in the first claim will apply with equal legal effect to the second and third claims. Accordingly, we believe that the amounts demanded by the DCMA as set forth in the three claims are without legal basis and that any damages owed to the U.S. government for the three claims will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. \nThales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters\nAs previously disclosed, in 2019, Raytheon Company received a subpoena from the SEC seeking information in connection with an investigation into whether there were improper payments made by Raytheon Company, our joint venture known as Thales-Raytheon Systems (TRS), or anyone acting on their behalf, in connection with TRS or Raytheon Company contracts in certain Middle East countries since 2014. In the first quarter of 2020, the DOJ advised Raytheon Company it had opened a parallel criminal investigation. In the third quarter of 2020, Raytheon Company received an additional subpoena from the SEC, seeking information and documents as part of its investigation. Following the government’s and the Company’s own internal investigations, the Company engaged in resolution discussions with the DOJ and the SEC, and during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the Company reached agreements in principle with the DOJ and the SEC as to the principal elements of such resolutions, as previously disclosed on July 25, 2024. On October 15, 2024, Raytheon Company entered into DPA-1 with the DOJ and on October 16, 2024, the Company settled an administrative proceeding with the SEC to resolve these matters. Pursuant to DPA-1, the DOJ will defer, for a period of three years, criminal prosecution of Raytheon Company related to Raytheon Company’s conspiracy to violate the anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA and conspiracy to violate the AECA by failing to make related disclosures of certain payments that qualified as fees, commissions and/or political contributions under Part 130 of the ITAR. If Raytheon Company and the Company fully comply with all of their respective obligations under DPA-1 during its three-year term (commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged), the DOJ will move for dismissal with prejudice of the deferred charges against Raytheon Company. DPA-1 provides for a criminal monetary penalty and forfeiture of $\n282\n million. In addition, the SEC’s Administrative Order \n106\nTable of Contents\nissued in connection with the administrative proceeding settlement alleged that Raytheon Company violated the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA. The order provides for a $\n102\n million payment to the SEC that includes disgorgement, prejudgment interest on disgorgement, and a civil penalty. Under DPA-1, the SEC’s Administrative Order, and DPA-2 discussed in “DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes” below, Raytheon Company and the Company are required, among other things, to retain an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged) and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure obligations (for a term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC’s Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company’s and the Company’s compliance with their respective obligations under DPA-1, the SEC’s Administrative Order, and DPA-2 discussed in “DOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes” below. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company paid $\n384\n million in the aggregate for DPA-1 and the SEC's Administrative Order which was consistent with amounts accrued. The Company does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nDOJ Investigation and Contract Pricing Disputes\nAs previously disclosed, on October 8, 2020, the Company\n received a criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking information and documents in connection with an investigation relating to financial accounting, internal controls over financial reporting, and cost reporting regarding Raytheon Company since 2009. The investigation involved multi-year contracts subject to governmental regulation, including defective pricing claims for certain Raytheon Company contracts entered into between 2011 and 2013. As part of the same investigation, on March 24, 2021, the Company received a second criminal subpoena from the DOJ seeking documents relating to a certain \ncontract entered into in 2017 by Raytheon Company. As previously disclosed on July 25, 2024, following the government’s and the Company’s own internal investigations, the Company engaged in resolution discussions with the DOJ, and during the second quarter of 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the DOJ as to the principal elements of such resolution. In addition, the Company cooperated with the DOJ with respect to a related civil defective pricing investigation under the FCA. On October 16, 2024, Raytheon Company entered into DPA-2 and the FCA Settlement Agreement with the DOJ to resolve these matters. Pursuant to DPA-2, the DOJ will defer, for a period of three years, criminal prosecution of Raytheon Company related to two counts of major fraud against the United States by Raytheon Company involving two legacy contracts. If Raytheon Company and the Company fully comply with all of their respective obligations in DPA-2 during its three-year term (commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged), the DOJ will move for dismissal with prejudice of the deferred charges against Raytheon Company. DPA-2 provides for a criminal penalty in the amount of $\n147\n million, plus restitution, and the FCA Settlement Agreement provides for an FCA settlement payment in the amount of $\n433\n million, which includes restitution that will satisfy the criminal restitution obligation when paid. Under DPA-2 as well as DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order discussed in “Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters” above, Raytheon Company and the Company are required, among other things, to retain an independent compliance monitor satisfactory to the DOJ and the SEC (for a term ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged) and are required to undertake certain cooperation and disclosure obligations (for a term commencing on the effective date of DPA-1 and the SEC’s Administrative Order, as applicable, and ending three years from the date on which the monitor is engaged). The compliance monitor will oversee Raytheon Company’s and the Company’s compliance with their respective obligations under DPA-2 as well as DPA-1 and the SEC Administrative Order discussed in “Thales-Raytheon Systems and Related Matters” above. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company paid $\n580\n million in the aggregate for DPA-2 and the FCA Settlement Agreement which was consistent with amounts accrued plus interest. The Company does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nTrade Compliance Matters\nFrom time to time, we identify, investigate, remediate, and voluntarily disclose violations or potential violations of the ITAR and EAR to the relevant regulators. In May 2024, the U.S. Department of State’s (DOS) Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (DTCC) informed the Company of its intent to seek administrative penalties for alleged violations of the AECA and the ITAR. The DTCC informed us that it considers certain of our voluntary disclosures, primarily identified in connection with the integration of Rockwell Collins and, to a lesser extent, Raytheon Company, filed since 2019 to reflect deficiencies warranting a civil penalty. On August 29, 2024, the Company entered into a Consent Agreement (CA) with the DOS to resolve these matters. The CA settles certain AECA and ITAR compliance matters with the DTCC and the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The CA has a three-year term and provides for: (i) a civil penalty of $\n200\n million, $\n100\n million of which is suspended on the condition that such amount is applied to DTCC-approved remedial compliance measures; (ii) the appointment of an external Special Compliance Officer (SCO) to oversee compliance with the CA, the AECA, and the ITAR; (iii) an external audit of the Company’s AECA and ITAR compliance program; and (iv) implementation of additional remedial compliance measures related to AECA and ITAR compliance. The $\n100\n million portion of the settlement that is not subject to \n107\nTable of Contents\nsuspension, which was accrued by the Company in the second quarter of 2024, will be paid in installments, with $\n34\n million paid in September 2024, $\n33\n million due by August 29, 2025, and $\n33\n million due by August 29, 2026. As previously disclosed, the Company has determined that there is a probable risk of liability for potential penalties related to other export compliance matters which have been voluntarily disclosed to the cognizant regulators, but which are not subject to the CA. We have accrued $\n251\n million in the aggregate as of December 31, 2024 for these matters and the matters being resolved pursuant to the CA. We are currently unable to estimate the timing or outcome of the other voluntarily disclosed export compliance matters that are not subject to the CA. However, the Company does not believe these matters will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nUTC Equity Conversion Litigation\nAs previously disclosed, on December 6, 2022, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain current and former members of its Board of Directors, alleging that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in May 2020 by amending the method by which United Technologies Corporation (UTC) equity awards were converted to certain Company equity awards following the separation of UTC into three independent, publicly traded companies. On July 23, 2024, in response to a motion to dismiss filed by defendants, the Court dismissed the shareholder derivative lawsuit in its entirety with prejudice. On August 22, 2024, the Plaintiff filed an appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court. We continue to believe that the lawsuit lacks merit. We also continue to believe that this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nCivil Litigation Related to Employee Hiring Practices \nPratt & Whitney is one of multiple defendants in a class action lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut alleging that Pratt & Whitney and the other defendants agreed to restrict the hiring and recruiting of certain engineers and skilled laborers in a manner that violated federal antitrust laws. As of December 2024, all defendants, including Pratt & Whitney, reached a settlement with class counsel. The Court has preliminarily approved the settlement, and we expect the Court will grant final approval of the settlement in 2025. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nIn April 2024, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors of the Company alleging that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to implement and enforce a reasonable oversight mechanism for compliance with antitrust laws. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nPowder Metal Disclosure Litigation and SEC Investigation\nFollowing the Company’s disclosures of a rare condition in powder metal used to manufacture certain Pratt & Whitney engine parts, two sets of civil actions were filed against RTX. First, two putative federal securities class action lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut against the Company and certain current and former executives of the Company. The lawsuits allege that defendants violated federal securities laws by making material misstatements and omitting material facts relating to Pratt & Whitney’s GTF engine fleet, including the impact of the powder metal issue on the fleet, in various regulatory filings. The lawsuits were consolidated and remain pending. Second, multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against current and former officers and directors of the Company, all of which have now been consolidated into a single action which is pending in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The operative complaint in the consolidated action alleges that the defendants caused the Company to make materially false and misleading statements relating to Pratt & Whitney’s GTF engines, and failed to maintain an adequate system of oversight, disclosure controls and procedures, and internal controls over financial reporting. Based on the information available to date, we do not believe that either matter will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nOn November 7, 2023, January 30, 2024, and May 21, 2024, the Company received subpoenas from the SEC seeking engineering, operational, organizational, accounting, and financial documents in connection with an investigation relating to the Company’s disclosures in 2023 of issues arising from Pratt & Whitney’s use of powder metal in manufacturing various engine parts, its identification of certain risks associated with those manufacturing processes, and corrective actions identified by Pratt & Whitney to mitigate those risks. The Company is cooperating with the SEC and is responding to the subpoenas. At this time, we are unable to predict the timing or outcome of this SEC investigation. \nWhere appropriate, we have recorded loss contingency accruals for the above-referenced matters. Unless noted above, loss contingency accruals are immaterial individually or in the aggregate. \n108\nTable of Contents\nOther.\n As described in “Note 16: Guarantees,” we extend performance and operating cost guarantees beyond our normal warranty and service policies for extended periods on some of our products. We have accrued our estimate of the liability that may result under these guarantees and for service costs that are probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nWe also have other commitments and contingent liabilities related to legal proceedings, self-insurance programs, and matters arising out of the normal course of business. We accrue contingencies based upon a range of possible outcomes. If no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other, then we accrue the minimum amount. \nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are also routinely defendants in, parties to, or otherwise subject to many pending and threatened legal actions, claims, disputes, and proceedings. These matters are often based on alleged violations of contract, product liability, warranty, regulatory, environmental, health and safety, employment, intellectual property, tax, and other laws. In some instances, claims for substantial monetary damages are asserted against the Company and its subsidiaries and could result in fines, penalties, compensatory or treble damages, or non-monetary relief. We do not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nNOTE 18: EQUITY\nCommon Stock - Share Repurchases. \nOn October 24, 2023, we entered into accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements with certain financial institution counterparties to repurchase shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $\n10\n billion. The ASR agreements provided for the repurchase of our common stock based on the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices of our common stock during the term of such ASR agreements, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms and conditions of the ASR agreements. Pursuant to the ASR agreements, we made aggregate payments of $\n10\n billion on October 26, 2023, and received initial deliveries of approximately \n108.4\n million shares of our common stock at a price of $\n78.38\n per share, which, on that date, represented approximately 85% of the shares expected to be repurchased. The aggregate purchase price was recorded as a reduction to Shareowners’ equity, consisting of an $\n8.5\n billion increase in Treasury stock and a $\n1.5\n billion decrease in Common stock. We funded the payments with borrowings under a bridge credit agreement, which was repaid with the proceeds from term loan facilities, proceeds from issuances of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2023, and cash on hand. See “Note 9: Borrowings and Lines of Credit” for additional information.\nThe shares associated with the remaining portion of the aggregate purchase price have been settled over two tranches. In July 2024, the first tranche was settled upon final delivery to us of \n0.4\n million shares of common stock. In September 2024, with respect to the second tranche, we owed \n2.2\n million shares of common stock that we elected to cash settle for $\n261\n million. The cash payment required as a result of the second tranche settlement was due to the significant increase in the price of our common stock during the ASR term. The final average price under the ASR was $\n94.28\n per share.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss. \nA\n \nsummary of the changes in each component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax is provided below:\n(dollars in millions)\nForeign Currency Translation\nDefined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Plans\nUnrealized Hedging (Losses) Gains\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n$\n49\n \n$\n(\n1,828\n)\n$\n(\n136\n)\n$\n(\n1,915\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net\n(\n1,050\n)\n1,225\n \n(\n246\n)\n(\n71\n)\nAmounts reclassified, pre-tax\n2\n \n129\n \n103\n \n234\n \nTax benefit (expense)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n308\n)\n48\n \n(\n266\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n(\n1,005\n)\n$\n(\n782\n)\n$\n(\n231\n)\n$\n(\n2,018\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net\n562\n \n(\n1,041\n)\n278\n \n(\n201\n)\nAmounts reclassified, pre-tax\n—\n \n(\n568\n)\n80\n \n(\n488\n)\nTax benefit (expense)\n3\n \n365\n \n(\n80\n)\n288\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n$\n(\n440\n)\n$\n(\n2,026\n)\n$\n47\n \n$\n(\n2,419\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net\n(\n506\n)\n(\n674\n)\n(\n291\n)\n(\n1,471\n)\nAmounts reclassified, pre-tax\n—\n \n(\n173\n)\n63\n \n(\n110\n)\nTax benefit (expense)\n(\n3\n)\n194\n \n54\n \n245\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n(\n949\n)\n$\n(\n2,679\n)\n$\n(\n127\n)\n$\n(\n3,755\n)\nAmounts reclassified that relate to our defined benefit pension and postretirement plans include the amortization of prior service costs and actuarial net gains or losses recognized during each period presented.

The RTX Corporation Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended and restated (LTIP), was approved by shareowners on May 2, 2024. A total of \n231\n million shares have been authorized for issuance pursuant to awards under the LTIP including shares assumed from predecessor plans and adjustments associated with the separation of Carrier and Otis. As of December 31, 2024, approximately \n116\n million shares remain available for awards under the LTIP. The LTIP does not contain aggregate annual award limits, however, it sets an annual award limit per participant. The LTIP will expire after all authorized shares have been awarded or on May 2, 2034, whichever is sooner.\nUnder the LTIP, the exercise price of awards is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share on that date. Generally, stock appreciation rights and stock options have a term of ten years and a three-year vesting period, subject to limited exceptions. In the event of retirement, annual stock appreciation rights, stock options, and restricted stock units (RSUs) held for more than one year may become vested and exercisable, subject to certain terms and conditions. LTIP awards with performance-based vesting generally have a minimum three-year vesting period and vest based on actual performance against pre-established metrics. In the event of retirement, performance-based awards held for more than one year, remain eligible to vest based on actual performance relative to performance goals. We have historically repurchased shares of our common stock in an amount at least equal to the number of shares issued under our equity compensation arrangements and will continue to evaluate this policy in conjunction with our overall share repurchase program.\nWe measure the cost of all share-based payments, including stock options and stock appreciation rights, at fair value on the grant date and recognize this cost in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, net of expected forfeitures, as follows:\n(dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal compensation cost recognized\n$\n437\n \n$\n425\n \n$\n420\n \nThe associated future income tax benefit recognized was $\n85\n million, $\n80\n million, and $\n91\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the amount of cash received from the exercise of stock options was $\n26\n million, $\n22\n million, and $\n20\n million, respectively, with an associated tax benefit realized of $\n63\n million, $\n27\n million, and $\n32\n million, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the associated tax benefit realized from the vesting of performance share units (PSUs), restricted stock awards, and RSUs was $\n106\n million, $\n57\n million, and $\n80\n million, respectively. \nAt December 31, 2024, there was $\n300\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested equity awards granted under long-term incentive plans. This cost is expected to be recognized ratably over a weighted-average period of \n2.3\n years.\nA summary of the transactions under our long-term incentive plans for the year ended December 31, 2024 follows. \n \nStock Options\nStock Appreciation Rights\nPerformance Share Units\nRestricted Stock and RSUs\n(shares and units in thousands)\nShares\nAverage Price \n(1)\nShares\nAverage Price \n(1)\nUnits\nAverage Price \n(2)\nUnits\nAverage Price \n(2)\nOutstanding at:\nDecember 31, 2023\n1,461\n \n$\n81.72\n \n31,155\n \n$\n82.36\n \n3,001\n \n$\n87.33\n \n9,730\n \n$\n86.53\n \nGranted \n(3)\n117\n \n91.04\n \n2,993\n \n91.03\n \n1,535\n \n83.67\n \n3,761\n \n91.95\n \nExercised / earned \n(3)\n(\n322\n)\n79.37\n \n(\n8,089\n)\n79.62\n \n(\n1,762\n)\n71.69\n \n(\n4,166\n)\n74.18\n \nCancelled\n(\n1\n)\n83.58\n \n(\n313\n)\n90.12\n \n(\n73\n)\n94.58\n \n(\n422\n)\n90.08\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n1,255\n \n$\n83.18\n \n25,746\n \n$\n84.13\n \n2,701\n \n$\n95.26\n \n8,903\n \n$\n94.32\n \n(1)    Weighted-average exercise price per share.\n(2)    Weighted-average grant date fair value per share.\n(3)    Performance Share Units includes an adjustment for actual performance achieved on the 2021 award of \n513\n thousand units.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted during 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $\n21.72\n, $\n24.66\n, and $\n21.80\n, respectively.

We use historical data to estimate equity award exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model. The expected term represents an estimate of the period of time equity awards are expected to remain outstanding. The risk-free rate is based on the term structure of interest rates at the time of equity award grant.\nNOTE 20: SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA\nOur operations, for the periods presented herein, are classified into three principal segments: Collins Aerospace (Collins), Pratt & Whitney, and Raytheon.

The CODM uses segment operating profit as a profitability measure to assess actual and forecasted segment performance to make decisions regarding incentive compensation and the allocation of capital and other investments. Total net sales and operating profit (loss) by segment include inter-segment sales which are generally recorded at cost-plus a specified fee or at a negotiated fixed price. These pricing arrangements may result in margins different than what the purchasing segment realizes on the ultimate third-party sales. \nWe present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and PRB expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our Raytheon segment. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally expect to recover the related Raytheon pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt & Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis.\nAcquisition accounting adjustments include the amortization of acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions, the amortization of the property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment acquired through acquisitions, the amortization of customer contractual obligations related to loss-making or below-market contracts acquired, and goodwill impairment, if applicable. These adjustments are not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment results.\n112\nTable of Contents\nSegment information for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\n2024\n(dollars in millions)\nNet Sales\nResearch and Development\nOther Segment Items \n(1)\nOperating Profit (Loss)\nOperating Profit (Loss) Margins\nCollins Aerospace\n$\n28,284\n \n$\n(\n1,408\n)\n$\n(\n22,741\n)\n$\n4,135\n \n14.6\n \n%\nPratt & Whitney\n28,066\n \n(\n1,086\n)\n(\n24,965\n)\n2,015\n \n7.2\n \n%\nRaytheon\n26,713\n \n(\n452\n)\n(\n23,667\n)\n2,594\n \n9.7\n \n%\nTotal segment\n83,063\n \n(\n2,946\n)\n(\n71,373\n)\n8,744\n \n10.5\n \n%\nEliminations and other \n(2)\n(\n2,325\n)\n(\n48\n)\nCorporate expenses and other unallocated items \n(3)\n—\n \n(\n933\n)\nFAS/CAS operating adjustment\n—\n \n833\n \nAcquisition accounting adjustments\n—\n \n(\n2,058\n)\nConsolidated\n$\n80,738\n \n$\n6,538\n \n8.1\n \n%\n(1)    Includes Cost of sales, Selling, General, and Administrative expenses, and Other income (expense), net.\n(2)    Includes the operating results of certain smaller operations. \n(3)    Includes a $\n0.9\n billion charge in the second quarter of 2024 related to the Resolution of Certain Legal Matters.

Our geographic region based on customer location uses end user customer location where known or practical to determine, or in instances where the end user customer is not known or not practical to determine, uses “ship to” location as the customer location. In addition, for our Raytheon segment, we disaggregate our contracts from customers by contract type. We believe these categories best depict how the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nSegment sales disaggregated by geographic region based on customer location for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\n2024\n(dollars in millions)\nCollins Aerospace\nPratt & Whitney\nRaytheon\nOther\nTotal\nUnited States\n$\n13,668\n \n$\n13,025\n \n$\n19,224\n \n$\n170\n \n$\n46,087\n \nEurope\n6,634\n \n6,376\n \n2,962\n \n3\n \n15,975\n \nAsia Pacific\n3,185\n \n5,461\n \n2,245\n \n2\n \n10,893\n \nMiddle East and North Africa\n840\n \n650\n \n1,968\n \n—\n \n3,458\n \nOther regions\n1,602\n \n2,552\n \n171\n \n—\n \n4,325\n \nConsolidated net sales\n25,929\n \n28,064\n \n26,570\n \n175\n \n80,738\n \nInter-segment sales\n2,355\n \n2\n \n143\n \n(\n2,500\n)\n—\n \nBusiness segment sales\n$\n28,284\n \n$\n28,066\n \n$\n26,713\n \n$\n(\n2,325\n)\n$\n80,738\n \n114\nTable of Contents\n2023\n(dollars in millions)\nCollins Aerospace\nPratt & Whitney\nRaytheon\nOther\nTotal\nUnited States\n$\n13,185\n \n$\n11,403\n \n$\n20,187\n \n$\n106\n \n$\n44,881\n \nEurope\n6,423\n \n5,433\n \n1,642\n \n3\n \n13,501\n \nAsia Pacific\n2,625\n \n4,227\n \n2,196\n \n1\n \n9,049\n \nMiddle East and North Africa\n684\n \n539\n \n2,014\n \n—\n \n3,237\n \nOther regions\n1,377\n \n2,095\n \n181\n \n—\n \n3,653\n \nPowder Metal Matter\n—\n \n(\n5,401\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n5,401\n)\nConsolidated net sales\n24,294\n \n18,296\n \n26,220\n \n110\n \n68,920\n \nInter-segment sales\n1,959\n \n—\n \n130\n \n(\n2,089\n)\n—\n \nBusiness segment sales\n$\n26,253\n \n$\n18,296\n \n$\n26,350\n \n$\n(\n1,979\n)\n$\n68,920\n \n2022\n(dollars in millions)\nCollins Aerospace\nPratt & Whitney\nRaytheon\nOther\nTotal\nUnited States\n$\n11,944\n \n$\n10,433\n \n$\n18,643\n \n$\n170\n \n$\n41,190\n \nEurope\n5,455\n \n4,211\n \n1,442\n \n3\n \n11,111\n \nAsia Pacific\n2,165\n \n3,775\n \n2,116\n \n1\n \n8,057\n \nMiddle East and North Africa\n510\n \n450\n \n2,639\n \n—\n \n3,599\n \nOther regions\n1,256\n \n1,658\n \n203\n \n—\n \n3,117\n \nConsolidated net sales\n21,330\n \n20,527\n \n25,043\n \n174\n \n67,074\n \nInter-segment sales\n1,722\n \n3\n \n133\n \n(\n1,858\n)\n—\n \nBusiness segment sales\n$\n23,052\n \n$\n20,530\n \n$\n25,176\n \n$\n(\n1,684\n)\n$\n67,074\n \nSegment sales disaggregated by type of customer for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\n2024\n(dollars in millions)\nCollins Aerospace\nPratt & Whitney\nRaytheon\nOther\nTotal\nSales to the U.S. government\n (1)\n$\n6,850\n \n$\n6,086\n \n$\n19,142\n \n$\n168\n \n$\n32,246\n \nForeign military sales through the U.S. government\n384\n \n1,528\n \n3,853\n \n—\n \n5,765\n \nForeign government direct commercial sales\n1,242\n \n712\n \n3,361\n \n2\n \n5,317\n \nCommercial aerospace and other commercial sales\n17,453\n \n19,738\n \n214\n \n5\n \n37,410\n \nConsolidated net sales\n25,929\n \n28,064\n \n26,570\n \n175\n \n80,738\n \nInter-segment sales\n2,355\n \n2\n \n143\n \n(\n2,500\n)\n—\n \nBusiness segment sales\n$\n28,284\n \n$\n28,066\n \n$\n26,713\n \n$\n(\n2,325\n)\n$\n80,738\n \n(1)    Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. \n2023\n(dollars in millions)\nCollins Aerospace\nPratt & Whitney \n(2)\nRaytheon\nOther\nTotal\nSales to the U.S. government\n (1)\n$\n6,357\n \n$\n5,206\n \n$\n19,965\n \n$\n100\n \n$\n31,628\n \nForeign military sales through the U.S. government\n304\n \n1,442\n \n3,228\n \n—\n \n4,974\n \nForeign government direct commercial sales\n1,110\n \n515\n \n2,620\n \n4\n \n4,249\n \nCommercial aerospace and other commercial sales \n(2)\n16,523\n \n11,133\n \n407\n \n6\n \n28,069\n \nConsolidated net sales\n24,294\n \n18,296\n \n26,220\n \n110\n \n68,920\n \nInter-segment sales\n1,959\n \n—\n \n130\n \n(\n2,089\n)\n—\n \nBusiness segment sales\n$\n26,253\n \n$\n18,296\n \n$\n26,350\n \n$\n(\n1,979\n)\n$\n68,920\n \n(1)    Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. \n(2)    Includes the reduction in sales from the Powder Metal Matter.\n115\nTable of Contents\n2022\n(dollars in millions)\nCollins Aerospace\nPratt & Whitney\nRaytheon\nOther\nTotal\nSales to the U.S. government\n (1)\n$\n6,484\n \n$\n5,272\n \n$\n18,394\n \n$\n167\n \n$\n30,317\n \nForeign military sales through the U.S. government\n372\n \n1,115\n \n3,555\n \n—\n \n5,042\n \nForeign government direct commercial sales\n1,063\n \n474\n \n2,786\n \n4\n \n4,327\n \nCommercial aerospace and other commercial sales\n13,411\n \n13,666\n \n308\n \n3\n \n27,388\n \nConsolidated net sales\n21,330\n \n20,527\n \n25,043\n \n174\n \n67,074\n \nInter-segment sales\n1,722\n \n3\n \n133\n \n(\n1,858\n)\n—\n \nBusiness segment sales\n$\n23,052\n \n$\n20,530\n \n$\n25,176\n \n$\n(\n1,684\n)\n$\n67,074\n \n(1)    Excludes foreign military sales through the U.S. government. \nThe largest contributor to our Commercial aerospace and other commercial sales is Airbus.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nAs required by Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), and the Corporate Vice President and Controller (Controller), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based upon our evaluation, our CEO, CFO, and Controller concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO, CFO, and Controller, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Our management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in its 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework. Our management has concluded that based on its assessment, our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report \nwhich is set forth within Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K\n. There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, \nno\n director or “officer” (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f)) of the Company adopted or terminated a “Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement” or “non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,” as each term is defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K.\nITEM 9C.
