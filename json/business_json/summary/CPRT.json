  "item1_summary": " Copart is a leading global provider of online auctions and vehicle remarketing services . The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K . Copart, Inc. and CrashedToys.com are trademarks of Copart and of other companies . We provide free of charge access to our annual and quarterly reports on our website, as soon as reasonably practical after the reports are electronically filed with the SEC .\n Each vehicle that enters our business operations already exists, with whatever fuel technology and efficiency it was designed and built to have, and the substantial carbon emissions associated with the vehicle’s manufacture have already occurred . However, upon our receipt of an existing vehicle, we help facilitate the decrease of its total environmental impact by extending its useful life . Many of our cars are purchased by dismantlers who recycle and refurbish parts for vehicle repairs .\n We sell vehicles primarily over the internet through our Virtual Bidding Third Generation internet auction-style sales technology, which we refer to as VB3 . Vehicle sellers consist primarily of insurance companies, but also include dealers, individuals, charities, rental car companies, banks, finance companies, and fleet operators . We obtained 81%, 81%, and 83% of the total number of vehicles processed during fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, from insurance company sellers .\n VB3 operates both as an agent and on a principal basis, in some cases purchasing salvage vehicles outright and reselling the vehicles for our own account . In Germany we also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value and/or to facilitate a sale for the insured .\n When bidding stops, a countdown is initiated . If no bids are received during the countdown, the vehicle sells to the highest bidder . For fiscal 2025, sales of U.S. vehicles, on a unit basis, to members registered outside the state where the vehicle was located accounted for 69.8% of total vehicles sold .\n For fiscal 2025, our revenues were $4.6 billion, and our operating income was $1.7 billion . Our service revenues consist of auction-related sales transaction fees charged for vehicle remarketing services . In fiscal 2023, we opened one new operational facility in Brazil, one new facility in Germany, and eight new facilities in the U.S.\n Purchased vehicle revenue includes the gross sales price of the vehicles which we have purchased or are otherwise considered to own . We have certain contracts with insurance companies, primarily in the U.K., in which we act as a principal, purchasing vehicles and reselling them for our own account . We also purchase vehicles in the open market, primarily from individuals, and resell them for ourselves .\n Most of our vehicles are sold on behalf of insurance companies and are usually vehicles involved in an accident or a natural disaster . Vehicle dismantlers, rebuilders, repair licensees, used vehicle dealers, exporters, and the general public are the primary buyers of vehicles at our auctions . We sell virtually all our vehicles on our virtual marketplace platform VB3, thus eliminating the requirement for buyers to travel to an auction location .\n If the cost of repair is greater than the PAV less than the estimated salvage value, the insurance company generally will classify the vehicle as a total loss . The insurance company will thereafter assign the vehicle to a vehicle auction and remarketing services company, settle with the insured and receive title to the vehicle . We believe that newer vehicles involved in accidents are more costly to repair .\n In the U.K., some insurance companies tender periodic contracts for the purchase of salvaged vehicles . The salvage vehicle is stored at one of our facilities until ownership documents are transferred from the insured vehicle owner and the title to the vehicle is cleared through the appropriate state’s motor vehicle regulatory agency (“DMV”)\n Our growth strategy is to increase revenues and profitability by, among other things, (i) acquiring and developing additional vehicle storage facilities in key markets, including foreign markets . (ii) pursuing global, national, and regional vehicle seller agreements; (iii) increasing our service offerings; and (iv) expanding the application of VB3 into new markets .\n Global presence enhances our ability to enter into global, national, or regional supply agreements . We actively seek to establish supply agreements with insurance companies . The primary focus of these new service offerings is to maximize returns to our sellers and maximize product value to our members . We plan to continue to refine and expand our services, including offering software that can assist sellers in expediting claims and salvage management tools .\n We offer integrated services to our vehicle sellers, which allow us to respond to the needs of our sellers and members with maximum efficiency . Our coverage provides our sellers with key advantages, including: attractiveness and efficiency to buyers, leading to enhanced selling prices for vehicles . We also derive revenue from listing vehicles on behalf of insurance companies and insurance experts to determine the vehicle’s residual value .\n The company has a proven track record of successfully acquiring and integrating facilities and companies . Since becoming a public company in 1994, we have completed acquisitions of facilities in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Germany, Finland, Finland and Spain . As part of our acquisition and integration strategy, we seek to: expand our global presence; strengthen our networks .\n We strive to integrate all new facilities and companies, when appropriate, into our existing network without disruption of service to vehicle sellers . We typically retain existing employees at acquired facilities in order to retain knowledge about, and respond to, the local market . We believe that our integrated technology systems generate improved capacity and financial returns for our clients, resulting in high client retention .\n We offer vehicle sellers a full range of vehicle services, which expedite each stage of the vehicle sales process, helping to maximize proceeds and minimize costs . Not all service offerings are available in all markets; some may be applicable only to a particular subsidiary or operating segment .

Under the Purchase Program, we purchase vehicles from a . vehicle seller at a . price, based on a percentage of the vehicle’s estimated . price . We provide the vehicle seller, at our expense, with the vehicle .\n The VB3 technology and model employs a two-step bidding process . Members enter the maximum price they are willing to pay for a vehicle and BID4U will incrementally bid the vehicle on their behalf during all steps of the auction . Bidding begins at a specified time prior to a second bidding step, an internet-only virtual auction .\n BluCar provides financial institutions, fleet and rental car companies with an efficient method to sell their vehicles .

In some cases, we may acquire land with existing environmental issues, including landfills as an example .\n Environmental laws and regulations could become more stringent over time . Increased focus by the U.S. and other governmental authorities on climate change and other environmental matters may lead to enhanced regulation in these areas . The extent of these costs and risks is difficult to predict and will depend in large part on the extent of new regulations and the ways in which those regulations are enforced .\n In 2008, we obtained a patent issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office that covers certain aspects of our virtual bidding auction platform, VB3 . At various  times, we may be involved in disputes with governmental officials regarding the development and/or operation of our business facilities . We believe that we are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements .\n During the winter months, we tend to have higher demand for our services because there are more weather-related accidents . Severe weather events, including but not limited to tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, and hailstorms, can also impact our volumes . The primary influence is the seasonal change in weather patterns ."
