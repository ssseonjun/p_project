For any given reporting period, the mix of projects that Boardwalk Pipelines undertakes will affect the amounts it records as property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets or recognizes as expenses, which impact earnings. Boardwalk Pipelines began incurring costs to implement the Mega Rule’s requirements in 2021, and based on its current projections, it believes that these costs have stabilized. In 2025, Boardwalk Pipelines expects to spend approximately $504 million to maintain its pipeline systems, \ncomply with regulations and monitor, control and reduce its GHG emissions, of \nwhich approximately $203 million is expected to be maintenance capital. In \n2024\n, Boardwalk Pipelines spent $513 million on these matters, of which $202 million was recorded as maintenance capital.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for Boardwalk Pipelines for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 as presented in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. Boardwalk Pipelines also utilizes a non-GAAP measure, earnings before interest, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) as a financial measure to assess its operating and financial performance and return on invested capital. Management believes some investors may find this measure useful in evaluating Boardwalk Pipelines’ performance as EBITDA is a commonly used metric within the midstream industry.\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \nRevenues:\n \n \nOperating revenues and other\n$\n2,034\n \n$\n1,625 \nInterest income\n31\n \n11 \nTotal\n2,065\n \n1,636 \nExpenses:\n \n \nOperating and other:\nOperating costs and expenses\n948\n \n696 \nDepreciation and amortization\n429\n \n412 \nInterest\n183\n \n155 \nTotal\n1,560\n \n1,263 \nIncome before income tax\n505\n \n373 \nIncome tax expense\n(92)\n(90)\nNet income attributable to Loews Corporation\n$\n413\n \n$\n283 \nEBITDA\n$\n1,086\n \n$\n929 \n2024 Compared with 2023\nNet income attributable to Loews Corporation and EBITDA increased \n$130 million\n and \n$157 million\n in 2024 as compared with \n2023\n, primarily due to the reasons discussed below. \nTotal revenues increased $429 million in \n2024\n as compared with 2023. Boardwalk Pipelines’\n transportation revenues increased $93 million, primarily due to re-contracting at higher rates and recently completed growth projects; storage, parking and lending revenues increased $31 million due to favorable market conditions which allowed for contracting at higher rates; product sales revenues from the sale of natural gas, ethylene and propane increased by $23 million due to opportunistic market conditions; and the Bayou Ethane acquisition contributed $262 million of incremental operating revenues, primarily resulting from ethane product sales.\nOperating costs and expenses increased $252 million in \n2024\n as compared with 2023 primarily reflecting operations of \nthe Bayou Ethane acquisition. Additionally, Boardwalk Pipelines’ operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to higher maintenance projects associated with compliance activities and administrative and general costs increased from higher employee-related costs.  \nDepreciation and amortization expenses increased $17 million in \n2024\n as compared with 2023 due to an increased asset base from recently completed growth projects and the Bayou Ethane acquisition\n.\n \n57\nTable of Contents\nInterest expenses increased $28 million in \n2024\n as compared with 2023, primarily due to the pre-financing of Boardwalk Pipeline’s $600 million of debt that matured on December 15, 2024.\nIncome tax expense increased $2 million in 2024 as compared with 2023, and includes a $36 million income tax benefit from an adjustment to deferred state income taxes for a rate reduction effective in 2025.  \nNon-GAAP Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to Loews Corporation to EBITDA \nThe following table reconciles net income attributable to Loews Corporation to EBITDA for the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n:\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nNet income attributable to Loews Corporation\n$\n413\n \n$\n283 \nInterest, net\n152\n \n144 \nIncome tax expense\n92\n \n90 \nDepreciation and amortization\n429\n \n412 \nEBITDA\n$\n1,086\n \n$\n929 \nLoews Hotels & Co\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for Loews Hotels & Co for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 as presented in Note\n \n20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8:\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \nRevenues:\n \n \nOperating revenue\n$\n806\n \n$\n678 \nGain on acquisition of a joint venture\n \n46 \nRevenues related to reimbursable expenses\n127\n \n128 \nTotal\n933\n \n852 \nExpenses:\nOperating and other\n653\n \n558 \nAsset impairments\n12 \nReimbursable expenses\n127\n \n128 \nDepreciation and amortization expense\n93\n \n69 \nEquity income from joint ventures\n(86)\n(129)\nInterest\n51\n \n14 \nTotal\n838\n \n652 \nIncome before income tax\n95\n \n200 \nIncome tax expense\n(25)\n(53)\nNet income attributable to Loews Corporation\n$\n70\n \n$\n147 \n58\nTable of Contents\n2024 Compared with 2023\nNet income attributable to Loews Corporation\n \ndecreased\n by $77 million in \n2024\n as compared with 2023. Results for 2023 include a gain of $46 million ($36 million after tax) related to the acquisition of an additional equity interest in, and the consolidation of, a previously unconsolidated joint venture property. \nOperating revenues improved by $128 million and operating expenses increased by $95 million in \n2024\n as compared with 2023. The increas\ne in operating revenues and operating expenses was primarily driven by the opening of the Loews Arlington Hotel and Convention Center in the first quarter of 2024. Operating revenues also improved due to higher occupancy levels at many city center hotels as a result of the continued recovery in group travel in 2024 as compared to 2023 and an increase in food and beverage revenues. Operating expenses also increased due to increased staffing costs as well as higher insurance expenses and property taxes.\nEquity income from joint ventures decreased $43 million in \n2024\n as compared to 2023. The decrease was driven by a reduction in overall occupancy levels at many joint venture hotels, particularly at the Universal Orlando Resort, in 2024 compared to 2023. Additionally, an impairment charge recorded at a joint venture property reduced Loews Hotels & Co’s equity income by $19 million in 2024. In addition, expenses at joint venture properties in 2024 increased as compared to 2023, largely due to increased staffing costs, as well as higher insurance expenses and property taxes.\nIn\n \n2023, Loews Hotels & Co recorded impairment charges of $12 million to reduce the carrying value of certain assets to their estimated fair value.\nDepreciation and amortization expense \nincreased \n$24 million in\n 2024 \nas compared with 2023, \nmainly due to the opening of the Loews Arlington Hotel and Convention Center in the first quarter of 2024.\nInterest expense for \n2024\n increased $37 million as compared with 2023 \nprimarily due to placing the \nLoews Arlington Hotel and Convention Center into service during the first quarter of 2024, after which Loews Hotels & Co no longer capitalized interest on that project\n.\nCorporate\nCorporate operations consist primarily of investment income, interest expense and administrative costs at the Parent Company. Investment income includes earnings on cash and short-term investments held at the Parent Company to meet current and future liquidity needs, as well as results of the trading portfolio held at the Parent Company. Corporate also includes the equity method of accounting for Altium Packaging.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for Corporate for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 as presented in Note\n \n20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8:\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \nRevenues:\n \n \nNet investment income\n$\n242\n \n$\n114 \nExpenses:\n \n \nOperating and other\n77\n \n120 \nEquity method loss\n28\n \n9 \nInterest\n74\n \n80 \nTotal\n179\n \n209 \nIncome (loss) before income tax\n63\n \n(95)\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n(11)\n5 \nNet income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation\n$\n52\n \n$\n(90)\n59\nTable of Contents\n2024 Compared with 2023\nNet income attributable to Loews Corporation\n \nincreased\n $142 million in \n2024\n as compared with 2023 primarily due to the reasons discussed below.\nNet investment income for the Parent Company \nincreased\n \n$128 million\n in \n2024\n as compared with 2023 primarily due to higher returns on equity-based investments.\nOperating and other expenses decreased \n$43 million\n in 2024 as compared with \n2023, primarily due to a settlement expense of $47 million in 2023 to recognize unrealized losses, which were included in AOCI, due to the termination of a defined benefit pension plan. For additional information see Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nParent Company\nParent Company cash and investments, net of receivables and payables, totaled $3.3 billion at December 31, 2024 as compared to $2.6 billion at December 31, 2023. In \n2024\n, \nwe received $1.3 \nbillion\n in cash dividends from our subsidiaries, including a special cash dividend of $497 million from CNA and distributions of $400 million from Boardwalk Pipelines. \nCash outflows in \n2024\n included the payment of $608 million to fund treasury stock purchases and $55 million of cash dividends to our shareholders. In the first quarter of 2025, we expect to receive cash dividends of $611 million from CNA and $75 million from Boardwalk Pipelines. As a holding company we depend on dividends from our subsidiaries and returns on our investment portfolio to fund our obligations. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under which we may publicly issue an unspecified amount of our debt, equity or hybrid securities from time to time. We are not responsible for the liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries and there are no Parent Company guarantees.\nDepending on market and other conditions, we may purchase shares of our and our subsidiaries outstanding common stock in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. In \n2024\n, we purchased 7.7 million shares of Loews Corporation com\nmon stock. As of February 7, 2025, we had purchased an additional \n1.9\n million shares of Loews Corporation common stock in \n2025\n at an additional aggregate cost of $164 million. As of February 7, 2025\n, there were 212,861,300 shares of Loews Corporation common stock outstanding.\nLoews Corporation has a corporate credit and senior debt rating of A with a stable outlook from S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) and a senior debt rating of A3 with a stable outlook from Moody’s Investors Service (“Moody’s”).\nFuture uses of our cash may include investing in our subsidiaries, new acquisitions, dividends and/or purchases of our and our subsidiaries’ outstanding common stock. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our earnings, financial condition and business needs.\nSubsidiaries\nCNA’s cash provided by operating activities was $2.6 billion in \n2024\n as compared with and $2.3 billion in 2023. \nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities was driven by an increase in premiums collected and higher earnings from fixed income securities, partially offset by an increase in net claim payments and higher operating expenses.\nCNA paid cash dividends of $3.76 per share on its common stock, including a special cash dividend of $2.00 per share, in \n2024\n. On February 7, 2025, CNA’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.46 per share and a special cash dividend of $2.00 per share payable March 13, 2025 to shareholders of record on February 24, 2025. CNA’s declaration and payment of future dividends is at the discretion of its Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including CNA’s earnings, financial condition, business needs and regulatory constraints. CNA believes that its present cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are sufficient to fund its current and expected working capital and debt obligation needs and does not expect this to change in the near term.\nDividends to CNA from Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), a subsidiary of CNA, are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance (the “Department”), are determined based on the greater of the prior year’s statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding 12 months. Additionally, ordinary dividends may only be \n60\nTable of Contents\npaid from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2024, CCC was in a positive earned surplus position. The maximum allowable dividend CCC could pay during 2025 that would not be subject to the Department’s prior approval is \n$1.1 billion\n, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. CCC paid dividends of \n$995 million\n in \n2024\n. The actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company.\nIn \nFebruary of 2024\n, CNA completed a public offering of \n$500 million\n aggregate principal amount of its \n5.1%\n senior notes due \nFebruary 15, 2034 and in May of 2024, CNA repaid at maturity the outstanding $550 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.0% senior notes.\nCNA has an insurer financial strength rating of A and senior debt rating of bbb+ from A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”), an insurer financial strength rating of A2 and senior debt rating of Baa2 from Moody’s, an insurer financial strength rating of A+ and senior debt rating of A- from S&P and an insurer financial strength rating of A+ and senior debt rating of BBB+ from Fitch. A.M. Best and Moody’s maintain positive outlooks across CNA’s insurer financial strength and senior debt ratings. A.M. Best revised its outlook on CNA’s ratings to positive from stable in December 2024. Moody’s revised its outlook on CNA’s ratings to positive from stable in November 2024. S&P and Fitch maintain stable outlooks across CNA’s insurer financial strength and senior debt ratings.\nCNA has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it may publicly issue an unspecified amount of debt, equity or hybrid securities from time to time.\nBoardwalk Pipelines’ cash provided by operating activities increased $83 million in \n2024\n compared to 2023, primarily due to changes in net income adjusted for depreciation and amortization.\nFor \n2024\n and 2023, Boardwalk Pipelines’ capital expenditures were $392 million and $382 million, consisting of growth capital expenditures of $190 million and $218 million and maintenance capital expenditures of $202 million and $164 million. During \n2023, Boardwalk Pipelines acquired Bayou Ethane for $355 million. See Boardwalk Pipelines: Pipeline System Maintenance and GHGs Emission Reduction Initiatives in this MD&A for further information about factors impacting Boardwalk Pipelines’ maintenance capital spending.\nBoardwalk Pipelines expects total capital expenditures to be approximately $269 million in 2025, including approximately $203 million for maintenance capital and $66 million related to growth projects. Boardwalk Pipelines \n expects to spend a total of approximately $1.6 billion on its ongoing and announced growth projects, with expected in-service dates for these projects ranging from 2025 to 2029. Refer to Boardwalk Pipelines in Part I, Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on Boardwalk Pipelines’ growth projects.\nBoardwalk Pipelines anticipates that its existing capital resources, including its cash and cash equivalents, revolving credit facility and cash flows from operating activities, will be adequate to fund its operations and capital expenditures for \n2025\n. Boardwalk Pipelines may seek to access the debt markets to fund some or all capital expenditures for growth projects or acquisitions, to refinance maturing debt or for general partnership purposes. As of February 7, 2025, \nBoardwalk Pipelines also has an effective shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which it may publicly issue up to $900 million of debt securities, warrants or rights from time to time.\n \nIn \nFebruary of 2024\n, Boardwalk Pipelines completed a public offering of \n$600 million\n aggregate principal amount of its \n5.6%\n senior notes due \nAugust 1, 2034\n. \nThe net proceeds from this offering were used to retire $600 million of its 5.0% senior notes at maturity in December 2024. \nAs of December 31, 2024, \nBoardwalk Pipelines\n had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility and the full borrowing capacity of $1.0 billion available to it. \nIn \n2024\n, Boardwalk Pipelines paid distributions of $400 million to the Company.\nBoardwalk Pipelines has a senior debt rating of BBB with a stable outlook from S&P, a senior debt rating of Baa2 with a stable outlook from Moody’s and a senior debt rating of BBB with a stable outlook from Fitch.\nLoews Hotels & Co, through its subsidiaries, has \nmortgage loans maturing beyond twelve months as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, which it may refinance before they mature. Refinancing any indebtedness, including loans of unconsolidated joint venture partnerships, may require Loews Hotels & Co to make principal pay downs, establish restricted cash reserves or provide guaranties of the subsidiary’s debt. Through the date of this Report, all Loews Hotels & Co’s subsidiaries are in compliance with their debt covenants.\n61\nTable of Contents\nLoews Hotels & Co refinanced $532 million in mortgage loans in 2024, all of which mature beyond twelve months as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n.\nIn 2024, Loews Hotels & Co acquired all the remaining outstanding noncontrolling equity interests of two owned and consolidated hotels for a total of \n$44 million. In addition, \nLoews Hotels & Co received aggregate proceeds of \n$23 million\n for the sale of an owned hotel.\n62\nTable of Contents\n \nCont\nractual Obligations\nWe and our subsidiaries have contractual obligations which arise in the ordinary course of business.

Additional information on future policy benefit reserves is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nFurther information on our commitments, contingencies and guarantees is provided in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nINVESTMENTS\nInvestment activities of our non-insurance subsidiaries primarily consist of investments in fixed income securities, including short-term investments. The Parent Company portfolio also includes equity securities, including short sales and derivative instruments. Certain of these types of Parent Company investments generally have greater volatility, less liquidity and greater risk than fixed income investments and are included within Results of Operations – Corporate.\nThe Parent Company enters into short sales and invests in certain derivative instruments that are used for asset and liability management activities, income enhancements to its portfolio management strategy and to benefit from anticipated future movements in the underlying markets. If such movements do not occur as anticipated, significant losses may occur. Monitoring procedures include senior management review of daily reports of existing positions and valuation fluctuations to seek to ensure that open positions are consistent with the portfolio strategy.\nCredit exposure associated with non-performance by counterparties to derivative instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized change in fair value of the derivative instruments recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The risk of non-performance is mitigated by monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties and diversifying derivatives by using multiple counterparties. Collateral is occasionally required from derivative investment counterparties depending on the amount of the exposure and the credit rating of the counterparty.\nInsurance\nCNA maintains a large portfolio of fixed maturity and equity securities, including large amounts of corporate and government issued debt securities, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, other asset-backed securities and investments in limited partnerships which pursue a variety of long and short investment strategies across a broad array of asset classes. CNA’s investment portfolio supports its obligation to pay future insurance claims and provides investment returns which are an important part of CNA’s overall profitability.\n63\nTable of Contents\nNet Investment Income\nThe significant components of CNA’s net investment income are presented in the following table.

The performance of these assets is dependent on a number of factors, including the performance of the underlying collateral (which is influenced by cash flows from underlying property leases), changes in the fair value of collateral, refinancing risk, and the creditworthiness of tenants of credit tenant loan properties (where lease payments directly service the loan).\nWithin CNA’s fixed maturity securities portfolio, its exposure is primarily through the commercial mortgage-backed securities portfolio and the corporate and other bonds portfolio, which contains obligations of real estate investment trust (“REIT”) issuers. Commercial mortgage-backed securities include both single asset, single borrower collateral that is securitized independently and conduit collateral that is securitized in diversified pools. \nThe following tables present the estimated fair value and net unrealized gains (losses) of CNA’s commercial mortgage-backed securities by property type and by ratings distribution:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nEstimated \nFair Value\nNet \nUnrealized Gains (Losses)\nEstimated \nFair Value\nNet \nUnrealized Gains\n(Losses)\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \nCommercial mortgage-backed:\nSingle asset, single borrower:\nOffice\n$\n339\n \n$\n(43)\n$\n306 \n$\n(70)\nLodging\n271\n \n(8)\n227 \n(23)\nRetail\n268\n \n(10)\n283 \n(28)\nMultifamily\n50\n \n(1)\n59 \n(3)\nIndustrial\n42\n \n(3)\n93 \n(4)\nTotal single asset, single borrower\n970\n \n(65)\n968 \n(128)\nConduits (multi property, multi borrower pools)\n711\n \n(66)\n663 \n(95)\nTotal commercial mortgage-backed\n$\n1,681\n \n$\n(131)\n$\n1,631 \n$\n(223)\n66\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nEstimated \nFair Value\nNet \nUnrealized Gains (Losses)\nEstimated \nFair Value\nNet \nUnrealized Gains\n(Losses)\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \nCommercial mortgage backed:\nAAA\n$\n736\n \n$\n(14)\n$\n570 \n$\n(27)\nAA\n609\n \n(60)\n594 \n(95)\nA\n163\n \n(20)\n202 \n(30)\nBBB\n139\n \n(20)\n216 \n(45)\nNon-investment grade\n34\n \n(17)\n49 \n(26)\nTotal commercial mortgage-backed\n$\n1,681\n \n$\n(131)\n$\n1,631 \n$\n(223)\nThe following tables present the estimated fair value and net unrealized gains (losses) of the REIT issuer exposure within CNA’s corporate and other bonds portfolio by property type and by ratings distribution: \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nEstimated \nFair Value\nNet \nUnrealized Gains (Losses)\nEstimated \nFair Value\nNet \nUnrealized Gains\n(Losses)\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \nCorporate and other bonds - REITs:\nRetail\n$\n478\n \n$\n(18)\n$\n515 \n$\n(25)\nOffice\n239\n \n(12)\n250 \n(20)\nSelf-Storage\n98\n \n(5)\n85 \n(6)\nIndustrial\n93\n \n(3)\n99 \n(1)\nOther (a) \n387\n \n(10)\n367 \n(16)\nTotal corporate and other bonds - REITs\n$\n1,295\n \n$\n(48)\n$\n1,316 \n$\n(68)\n(a)\nOther includes a diversified mix of property type strategies including healthcare and apartments.\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nEstimated \nFair Value\nNet \nUnrealized Gains (Losses)\nEstimated \nFair Value\nNet \nUnrealized Gains\n(Losses)\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \nCorporate and other bonds - REITs:\nAA\n$\n6\n \n$\n10 \nA\n310\n \n$\n(6)\n285 \n$\n(3)\nBBB\n942\n \n(40)\n994 \n(64)\nNon-investment grade\n37\n \n(2)\n27 \n(1)\nTotal corporate and other bonds - REITs\n$\n1,295\n \n$\n(48)\n$\n1,316 \n$\n(68)\n67\nTable of Contents\nMortgage loans are commercial in nature and are carried at unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized fees and an allowance for expected credit losses. The allowance for expected credit losses is developed by assessing the credit quality of pools of mortgage loans in good standing using debt service coverage ratios (“DSCR”) and loan-to-value ratios (“LTV”). This assessment utilizes historical credit loss experience adjusted to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. As of December 31, 2024 \nand 2023,\n the allowance for expected credit losses on CNA’s mortgage portfolio was $35 million, or 3.3% of its amortized cost basis. \nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of mortgage loans by property type:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAmortized Cost\nPercentage of Total\nAmortized Cost\nPercentage of Total\n(In millions, except %)\n \n \n \n \n \nMortgage loans:\nRetail\n$\n527\n \n50\n \n%\n$\n520 \n48 \n%\nOffice\n239\n \n22\n \n245 \n23 \nIndustrial\n123\n \n12\n \n124 \n12 \nOther\n165\n \n16\n \n181 \n17 \nTotal mortgage loans\n1,054\n \n100\n \n%\n1,070 \n100 \n%\nLess: Allowance for expected credit losses\n(35)\n(35)\nTotal mortgage loans - net of allowance\n$\n1,019\n \n$\n1,035 \nIn addition to the mortgage loan portfolio, CNA invests in securitized credit tenant loans and ground lease financings that are classified as fixed maturity securities and are largely investment grade quality. As of December 31, 2024 \nand 2023\n, these holdings had an estimated fair value of $471 million and $479 million, and net unrealized losses of $118 million and $87 million.\nCNA owns other fixed maturity securities which have exposure to cell towers, data centers and other collateral types that could be viewed as having real estate characteristics. CNA views these securities to have risks more similar to operating enterprises that do not share the same risks as the broader commercial real estate market. \nAdditionally, CNA does not have significant real estate exposure through its limited partnership portfolio. \nDuration\nA primary objective in the management of CNA’s investment portfolio is to optimize return relative to the corresponding liabilities and respective liquidity needs. CNA’s views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions as well as domestic and global economic conditions, are some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. CNA also continually monitors exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on its views of a specific issuer or industry sector.\nA further consideration in the management of CNA’s investment portfolio is the characteristics of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance liabilities. For portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long-term in nature, CNA segregates investments for asset/liability management purposes. The segregated investments support the long-term care and structured settlement liabilities in Other Insurance Operations. \nThe effective durations of CNA’s fixed income securities and short-term investments are presented in the following table. Amounts presented are net of payable and receivable amounts for securities purchased and sold, but not yet settled.\n68\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nEstimated \nFair Value\nEffective Duration (Years)\nEstimated\nFair Value\nEffective Duration (Years)\n(In millions of dollars)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLife & Group\n$\n14,915\n \n9.8\n$\n15,137 \n10.2\nProperty & Casualty and other\n28,779\n \n4.3\n27,981 \n4.5\nTotal\n$\n43,694\n \n6.2\n$\n43,118 \n6.5\nCNA’s investment portfolio is periodically analyzed for changes in duration and related price risk. Certain securities have duration characteristics that are variable based on market interest rates, credit spreads and other factors that may drive variability in the amount and timing of cash flows. Additionally, CNA periodically reviews the sensitivity of the portfolio to the level of foreign exchange rates and other factors that contribute to market price changes. A summary of these risks and specific analysis on changes is included in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk included under Item 7A.\nINSURANCE RESERVES\nThe level of reserves CNA maintains represents its best estimate, as of a particular point in time, of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on CNA’s assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time. Reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that CNA derives, generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain. As noted below, CNA reviews its reserves for each segment of its business periodically, and any such review could result in the need to increase reserves in amounts which could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations and equity and CNA’s equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. Further information on reserves is provided in Notes 8 and \n9\n of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nProperty and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\nCNA maintains loss reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled (case reserves) and claims that have been incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). IBNR includes a provision for development on known cases as well as a provision for late reported incurred claims. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities and are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the heading “Insurance Reserves.” Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. The carried case and IBNR reserves as of each balance sheet date are provided in the discussion that follows and in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThere is a risk that CNA’s recorded reserves are insufficient to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses. Unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues are also difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of CNA’s claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve increases.\nIn addition, CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have actual and potential exposures related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses. To mitigate the risks posed by CNA’s exposure to A&EP claims and claim adjustment expenses, CNA completed a transaction with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), under which substantially all of CNA’s legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO effective January 1, 2010. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further discussion about the transaction with NICO, its impact on CNA’s results of operations and the deferred retroactive reinsurance gains and the amount of remaining reinsurance limit.\n69\nTable of Contents\nEstablishing Property & Casualty Reserve Estimates\nIn developing claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates, CNA’s actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. The data is organized at a reserve group level. A reserve group typically can be a line of business covering a subset of insureds such as commercial automobile liability for small or middle market customers, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect. Every reserve group is reviewed at least once during the year, but most are reviewed more frequently. The analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. In addition to the detailed analyses, CNA reviews actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.\nMost of CNA’s business can be characterized as long-tail. For long-tail business, it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled. CNA’s long-tail exposures include commercial automobile liability, workers’ compensation, general liability, medical professional liability, other professional liability and management liability coverages, assumed reinsurance run-off and products liability. Short-tail exposures include property, commercial automobile physical damage, marine, surety and warranty. Property & Casualty Operations contain both long-tail and short-tail exposures. Other Insurance Operations contain long-tail exposures.\nVarious methods are used to project ultimate losses for both long-tail and short-tail exposures.\nThe paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident or policy years with further expected changes in paid losses. Selection of the paid loss pattern may require consideration of several factors including the impact of economic, social and medical inflation on claim costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. Claim cost inflation itself may require evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can affect the results. Since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in their adequacy.\nFor many reserve groups, paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions. This situation often exists for long-tail exposures. In addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. Finally, estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail products such as workers’ compensation.\nThe incurred development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. Since the method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the paid development method, the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns. However, selection of the incurred loss pattern typically requires analysis of all of the same factors described above. In addition, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place, and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available.\nThe loss ratio method multiplies earned premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident or policy year. This method may be useful for immature accident or policy periods or if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. The selection of the expected loss ratio typically requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident or policy years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes and other applicable factors.\nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss is a combination of the paid development method and the loss ratio method. This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method and typically requires analysis of the same factors described above. This method assumes that future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level. The percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid. The use of the pattern from the paid development method typically requires consideration of the same factors listed in the description of the paid development method. The estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year. For long-tail lines, this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation.\nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using incurred loss is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss except that it uses case incurred losses. The use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns. However, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes \n70\nTable of Contents\nin case reserving have taken place, and the method typically requires analysis of the same factors that need to be reviewed for the loss ratio and incurred development methods.\nThe frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident or policy year to produce ultimate loss estimates. Since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for reserve groups where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively. In addition, this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that affect the number and size of claims. However, this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. Projecting the ultimate number of claims may require analysis of several factors, including the rate at which policyholders report claims to CNA, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. Estimating the ultimate average loss may require analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.\nStochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying assumptions related to the particular reserve group being modeled. For some reserve groups, CNA uses models which rely on historical development patterns at an aggregate level, while other reserve groups are modeled using individual claim variability assumptions supplied by the claims department. In either case, multiple simulations using varying assumptions are run and the results are analyzed to produce a range of potential outcomes. The results will typically include a mean and percentiles of the possible reserve distribution which aid in the selection of a point estimate.\nFor many exposures, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a case, CNA’s actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development method. As claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. For most of CNA’s products, even the incurred losses for accident or policy years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, CNA may not assign much, if any, weight to the paid and incurred development methods. CNA may use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods. For short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner primarily because CNA’s history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, CNA may also use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods for short-tail exposures.\nFor other more complex reserve groups where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, CNA uses additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation.\nPeriodic Reserve Reviews\nThe reserve analyses performed by CNA’s actuaries result in point estimates. Each quarter, the results of the detailed reserve reviews are summarized and discussed with CNA’s senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. CNA’s senior management considers many factors in making this decision. CNA’s recorded reserves reflect its best estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts and circumstances, consideration of the factors cited above and its judgment. The carried reserve differs from the actuarial point estimate as discussed further below.\nCurrently, CNA’s recorded reserves are modestly higher than the actuarial point estimate. For Property & Casualty Operations, the difference between CNA’s reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by uncertainty with respect to immature accident years, claim cost inflation, changes in claims handling, changes to the tort environment which may adversely affect claim costs and the effects from the economy. For CNA’s legacy A&EP liabilities, the difference between CNA’s reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by the potential tail volatility of run-off exposures.\nThe key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various reserve groups and accident or policy years. Some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method, but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified. An example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method. However, the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims. As a result, the effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions typically cannot be specifically quantified, and changes in these assumptions cannot be tracked over time.\n71\nTable of Contents\nCNA’s recorded reserves are management’s best estimate. In order to provide an indication of the variability associated with CNA’s net reserves, the following discussion provides a sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated impact of variations in significant factors affecting CNA’s reserve estimates for particular types of business. These significant factors are the ones that CNA believes could most likely materially affect the reserves. This discussion covers the major types of business for which CNA believes a material deviation to its reserves is reasonably possible. There can be no assurance that actual experience will be consistent with the current assumptions or with the variation indicated by the discussion. In addition, there can be no assurance that other factors and assumptions will not have a material impact on CNA’s reserves.\nThe areas for which CNA believes a significant deviation to its net reserves is reasonably possible are (i) professional liability, management liability (including medical professional liability) and surety products (ii) workers’ compensation (iii) general liability and (iv) commercial auto liability.\nProfessional liability, management liability and surety products include U.S. professional liability coverages provided to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. They also include D&O, E&O, employment practices, fiduciary, fidelity, cyber and surety coverages and medical liability. The most significant factor affecting reserve estimates for these liability coverages is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, legal fees, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Underwriting and claim handling decisions such as the classes of business written and individual claim settlement decisions can also affect claim severity. If the estimated claim severity increases by 9%, CNA estimates that net reserves would increase by approximately $500 million. If the estimated claim severity decreases by 3%, CNA estimates that net reserves would decrease by approximately $150 million. CNA’s net reserves for these products were approximately $5.8 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nFor workers’ compensation, since many years will pass from the time the business is written until all claim payments have been made, the most significant factor affecting workers’ compensation reserve estimates is claim cost inflation on claim payments. Workers’ compensation claim cost inflation is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected claimant lifetimes, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. If estimated workers’ compensation claim cost inflation increases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, CNA estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $250 million. If estimated workers’ compensation claim cost inflation decreases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, CNA estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $250 million. Net reserves for workers’ compensation were approximately $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nFor general liability, the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors. If the estimated claim severity for general liability increases by 6%, CNA estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $300 million. If the estimated claim severity for general liability decreases by 3%, CNA estimates that its net reserves would decrease by approximately $150 million. Net reserves for general liability were approximately $4.9 billion as of December 31, 2024.\nCommercial auto liability is also considered long-tail; however, both the frequency of claims and severity of loss assumptions for the latest few accident years are significantly influenced by social inflation, economic inflation, driving habits and attorney involvement. If these trends accelerate beyond expectations, there may be significant deviation in CNA’s net reserves.  If the estimated auto liability claim severity were to increase 5% and frequency were to increase 1% on the three most recent accident years, CNA estimates that its net reserves would increase by approximately $90 million.  CNA’s net reserves for commercial auto were approximately $1.2 billion as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n. \nGiven the factors described above, it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate exposure represented by claims and related litigation. As a result, CNA regularly reviews the adequacy of its reserves and reassesses its reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled and additional information becomes available in subsequent periods. In reviewing CNA’s reserve estimates, CNA makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. These reviews have resulted in CNA’s identification of information and trends that have caused CNA to change its reserves in prior periods and could lead to CNA’s identification of a need for additional material increases or decreases in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, which could materially affect our results of operations and equity and CNA’s business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings positively or negatively. See Note 8 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for additional information about reserve development.\n72\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes gross and net carried reserves for CNA’s Property & Casualty Operations:\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \nGross Case Reserves\n$\n6,589\n \n$\n5,759 \nGross IBNR Reserves\n15,093\n \n14,184 \nTotal Gross Carried Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\n$\n21,682\n \n$\n19,943 \n \nNet Case Reserves\n$\n5,573\n \n$\n4,978 \nNet IBNR Reserves\n12,761\n \n12,235 \nTotal Net Carried Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\n$\n18,334\n \n$\n17,213 \nThe following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves for other insurance businesses in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP:\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \nGross Case Reserves\n$\n1,241\n \n$\n1,353 \nGross IBNR Reserves\n1,431\n \n1,333 \nTotal Gross Carried Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\n$\n2,672\n \n$\n2,686 \n \nNet Case Reserves\n$\n120\n \n$\n129 \nNet IBNR Reserves\n268\n \n239 \nTotal Net Carried Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\n$\n388\n \n$\n368 \n73\nTable of Contents\nLife & Group Policyholder Reserves\nCNA’s Life & Group business includes its run-off long-term care business as well as structured settlement obligations not funded by annuities related to certain property and casualty claimants. Long-term care policies may provide benefits for nursing homes, assisted living facilities and home health care subject to various daily and lifetime caps. Generally, policyholders must continue to make periodic premium payments to keep the policy in force and CNA has the ability to increase policy premiums, subject to state regulatory approval.\nCNA maintains future policy benefit reserves for its long-term care policies. Future policy benefit reserves for long-term care policies relate to policyholders that are currently receiving benefits, including claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported, as well as policyholders that are not yet receiving benefits. In developing the future policy benefit reserves, CNA’s actuaries perform a reserve review on an annual basis. During the annual review, historical policyholder morbidity, persistency, anticipated future premium rate increases and expense experience is reviewed and compared to the current best estimate actuarial assumption set for potential revision. On a quarterly basis, actuaries perform experience studies that monitor the appropriateness of best estimate actuarial assumptions against emerging experience to assess whether any updates to those assumptions are warranted. The determination of these reserves requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected policyholder experience over the remaining life of the policies. Since policies may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are subject to significant estimation risk. Future policy benefit reserves are discounted as discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nIn addition, claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are maintained for CNA’s structured settlement obligations. In developing the claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for CNA’s structured settlement obligations, CNA’s actuaries monitor mortality and expense experience on an annual basis. CNA’s recorded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves reflect CNA’s best estimate after incorporating the results of the most recent reviews. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for structured settlement obligations are discounted as discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThe actuarial assumptions related to future policy benefit reserves for long-term care policies that management believes are subject to the most variability are morbidity, persistency and anticipated future premium rate increases. Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted. Persistency is the percentage of policies remaining in force and can be affected by policy lapses, benefit reductions and death. Future premium rate increases are generally subject to regulatory approval, and therefore the exact timing and size of the approved rate increases are unknown. As a result of this variability, CNA’s long-term care reserves may be subject to material increases if actual experience develops adversely to its expectations.\nThe table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on CNA’s results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to its liability for future policyholder benefits reserve assumptions. CNA has assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each long-term care product. The impact of each sensitivity is discrete and does not reflect the impact one factor may have on another or the mitigating impact from management actions, which may include additional future premium rate increases. Although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, CNA believes they could occur based on past variances in experience and its expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur. Any actual adjustment would be dependent on the specific policies affected and, therefore, may differ from the estimates summarized below. The estimated impacts to results of operations in the table below are after consideration of any net premium ratio impacts.\n74\nTable of Contents\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024\nEstimated Reduction to Pretax Income\n(In millions)\n \n \n \nHypothetical revisions\nMorbidity:\n2.5% increase in morbidity\n$\n290\n \n5% increase in morbidity\n590\n \nPersistency:\n5% decrease in active life mortality and lapse\n$\n160\n \n10% decrease in active life mortality and lapse\n310\n \nPremium rate actions:\n25% decrease in anticipated future premium rate increases\n$\n10\n \n50% decrease in anticipated future premium rate increases\n20\n \nAs part of the annual reserve review, statutory long-term care reserve adequacy is evaluated by premium deficiency testing, by comparing carried statutory reserves with best estimate reserves, which incorporates best estimate discount rate and liability assumptions in its determination. Statutory margin is the excess of carried reserves over best estimate reserves. As of September 30, 2024, statutory long-term care margin increased to $1.4 billion from $1.3 billion, primarily driven by a more favorable interest rate environment resulting in a higher yielding investment portfolio.\n \nThe following tables summarize policyholder reserves for CNA’s long-term care operations:\nDecember 31, 2024\nClaim and claim adjustment expenses\nFuture \npolicy benefits\nTotal\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLong-term care\n$\n13,158\n \n$\n13,158\n \nStructured settlement and other\n$\n541\n \n541\n \nTotal\n541\n \n13,158\n \n13,699\n \nCeded reserves\n81\n \n81\n \nTotal gross reserves\n$\n622\n \n$\n13,158\n \n$\n13,780\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nLong-term care\n$\n13,959 \n$\n13,959 \nStructured settlement and other\n$\n582 \n582 \nTotal\n582 \n13,959 \n14,541 \nCeded reserves\n93 \n93 \nTotal gross reserves\n$\n675 \n$\n13,959 \n$\n14,634 \nCATASTROPHES AND RELATED REINSURANCE\nVarious events can cause catastrophe losses. These events can be natural or man-made, including hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fires, floods, riots, strikes, civil unrest, cyber attacks, pandemics and acts of terrorism that produce unusually large aggregate losses. In most, but not all cases, CNA’s catastrophe losses from these events in the U.S. are defined consistent with the definition of the Property Claims Service (“PCS”). PCS defines a catastrophe as an event that causes damage of $25 million or more in direct insured losses to property and affects a significant number of policyholders and insurers. For events outside of the U.S., CNA defines a catastrophe as an industry recognized event that generates an accumulation of claims amounting to more than $1 million for the International line of business.\n75\nTable of Contents\nCatastrophes are an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance business and have contributed to material period-to-period fluctuations in CNA’s results of operations and/or equity. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, of $358 million and $236 million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. Catastrophe losses for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were driven by severe weather related events, including $71 million for Hurricane Helene and $33 million for Hurricane Milton in 2024.\nCNA uses various analyses and methods, including using one of the industry standard natural catastrophe models, to estimate hurricane and earthquake losses at various return periods and to inform underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. CNA generally seeks to manage its exposure through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance and utilize various reinsurance programs to mitigate catastrophe losses, including excess-of-loss occurrence and aggregate treaties covering property and workers’ compensation, a property quota share treaty and the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (“TRIPRA”), as well as individual risk agreements that reinsure from losses from specific classes or lines of business. CNA conducts an ongoing review of its risk and catastrophe reinsurance coverages and from time to time makes changes as it deems appropriate. The following discussion summarizes CNA’s most significant catastrophe reinsurance coverage at January 1, 2025.\nGroup North American Property Treaty\nCNA purchased corporate catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty reinsurance covering its U.S. states and territories and Canadian property exposures underwritten in its North American and European companies. The treaty has a term of June 1, \n2024\n to June 1, 2025 and provides coverage for the accumulation of covered losses from catastrophe occurrences above CNA’s per occurrence retention of $250 million up to $1.4 billion for all losses. Losses stemming from terrorism events are covered unless they are due to a nuclear, biological or chemical attack. All layers of the treaty provide for one full reinstatement.\nGroup Workers’ Compensation Treaty\nCNA also purchased corporate Workers’ Compensation catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty reinsurance for the period January 1, 2025 to January 1, 2026  providing $275 million of coverage for the accumulation of covered losses related to natural catastrophes above CNA’s per occurrence retention of $25 million. The treaty also provides $775 million of coverage for the accumulation of covered losses related to terrorism events above CNA’s per occurrence retention of $25 million. Of the $775 million in terrorism coverage, $200 million is provided for nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation events. All layers of the treaty provide for one full reinstatement.\nTerrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019\nCNA’s principal reinsurance protection against large-scale terrorist attacks, including nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological attacks, is the coverage currently provided through TRIPRA which runs through the end of 2027. TRIPRA provides a U.S. government backstop for insurance-related losses resulting from any “act of terrorism,” which is certified by the Secretary of Treasury in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security for losses that exceed a threshold of $200 million industry-wide for the calendar year 2025. Under the current provisions of the program, in 2025 the federal government will reimburse 80% of CNA’s covered losses in excess of its applicable deductible up to a total industry program cap of $100 billion. CNA’s deductible is based on eligible commercial property and casualty earned premiums for the preceding calendar year. Based on \n2024\n earned premiums, CNA’s estimated deductible under the program is $1.2 billion for 2025. If an act of terrorism or acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the $100 billion annual industry aggregate limit, Congress would be responsible for determining how additional losses in excess of $100 billion will be paid.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.\n76\nTable of Contents\nWe consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements as their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, actual results could differ significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, equity, business and/or CNA’s insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.\nInsurance Reserves\nInsurance reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. Short-duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims. Long-duration contracts are primarily related to long-term care policies and the reserves are recorded as Future policy benefits reserves as discussed below. The reserve for unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written related to the unexpired terms of coverage.\n \nIf the recorded reserves are insufficient to cover the estimated ultimate unpaid liability, an increase to the insurance reserves may be needed. \nThe reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Insurance Reserves section of this MD&A.\nLong Term Care Reserves\nFuture policy benefits reserves for long-term care policies are based on certain actuarial assumptions, including morbidity, persistency, anticipated future premium rate increases and expenses. The adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and future expectations related to these key assumptions. If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring an increase to reserves.\n \nThe reserves are discounted using upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yields as of each reporting date. In addition, regulatory approval may not be received for the level of premium rate increases requested. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Insurance Reserve section of this MD&A. \nReinsurance and Other Receivables\nExposure exists with respect to the collectibility of ceded property and casualty and life reinsurance to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities CNA has ceded under reinsurance agreements. An allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer financial strength rating and solvency, industry experience and current and forecast economic conditions. Further information on CNA’s reinsurance receivables is included in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nAdditionally, exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of amounts due from customers on other receivables. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due, currently as well as in the future, historical business default data, management’s experience and current and forecast economic conditions.\nIf actual experience differs from the estimates made by management in determining the allowances for doubtful accounts on reinsurance and other receivables, net receivables as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets may not be collected. Further information on CNA’s process for determining the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance and insurance receivables is in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nValuation of Investments and Impairment of Securities\nFixed maturity and equity securities are carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value represents the price that would be received in a sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date, the determination of which may require us to make a significant number of assumptions and judgments. Securities with the greatest level of subjectivity around valuation are those that rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value and that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable inputs are based on assumptions consistent with what we believe other market participants would use to price such securities. Further information on fair value measurements is included in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nCNA’s fixed maturity securities are subject to market declines below amortized cost that may result in the recognition of impairment losses in earnings. Factors considered in the determination of whether or not an impairment loss is recognized in earnings include a current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether a credit loss has occurred for a security. CNA considers all available evidence when determining whether a security requires a credit allowance to be recorded, including the financial condition \n77\nTable of Contents\nand expected near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, whether the issuer is current with interest and principal payments, credit ratings on the security or changes in ratings over time, general market conditions, industry, sector or other specific factors and whether CNA expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.\nCNA’s mortgage loan portfolio is subject to the expected credit loss model, which requires immediate recognition of estimated credit losses over the life of the asset and the presentation of the asset at the net amount expected to be collected. Significant judgment is required in the determination of estimated credit losses and any changes in CNA’s expectation of the net amount to be collected are recognized in earnings.\nFurther information on CNA’s process for evaluating impairments and expected credit losses is included in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE\nFor a discussion of accounting standards updates that have been adopted, please read Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. \nItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nWe are a large diversified holding company. As such, we and our subsidiaries have significant amounts of financial instruments that involve market risk. Our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments. Changes in the trading portfolio are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us and our subsidiaries at December 31, assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below. We believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions. The estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss, even under adverse conditions, because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ. In addition, since our and our subsidiaries investment portfolios are subject to change based on portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur.\nExposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management of the parent company and its subsidiaries. Senior management approves the overall investment strategy and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk. Management of risk may include buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions.\nInterest Rate Risk – We and our subsidiaries have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We and our subsidiaries attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps, commitments to purchase securities, options, futures and forwards. We and our subsidiaries monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes by revaluing financial assets and liabilities using a variety of different interest rates. Duration and convexity at the security level are used to estimate the change in fair value that would result from a change in each security’s yield. Duration measures the price sensitivity of an asset to changes in yield. Convexity measures how the duration of the asset changes with interest rates. The duration and convexity analysis takes into account the unique characteristics (e.g., call and put options and prepayment expectations) of each security, in determining the hypothetical change in fair value. The analysis is performed at the security level and is aggregated up to the asset category level.\nThe evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in the yield rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on shareholders’ equity. The analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period.\nThe sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the fair value of interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on December 31, 2024 and 2023 due to an instantaneous change in the yield of the security at the end of the period of 100 basis points, with all other variables held constant.\nThe interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates. Accordingly, the analysis may not be indicative of, is not intended to provide, and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on our \n78\nTable of Contents\nearnings or shareholders’ equity. Further, the computations do not contemplate any actions that could be undertaken in response to changes in interest rates.\nOur and our subsidiaries’ debt is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars and has been primarily issued at fixed rates, therefore, interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts. The impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of $381 million and $341 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The impact of a 100 basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of $401 million and $363 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact of a 100 basis point increase in interest rates on variable rate debt, net of the effects of the swaps, would result in a $2 million increase interest expense.\nEquity Price Risk – We and our subsidiaries have exposure to equity price risk as a result of investments in equity securities and equity derivatives. Equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes. Equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous 25% decrease in the underlying reference price or index from its level at December 31, \n2024\n and 2023, with all other variables held constant. For limited partnership holdings, the estimated change in value was largely derived from a beta analysis calculation of historical experience of the portfolio and indices with similar strategies relative to the S&P 500.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk – Foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments. We and our subsidiaries have foreign exchange rate exposure when we buy or sell foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency, which is reduced through the use of forward contracts. The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 20% decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar from their levels at December 31, 2024 and 2023, with all other variables held constant.\nCommodity Price Risk – We and our subsidiaries have exposure to price risk as a result of our investments in commodities. Commodity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities. Commodity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous decrease of 20% from their levels at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nCredit Risk – We and our subsidiaries are exposed to credit risk relating to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations. Although nearly all customers pay for their services on a timely basis, the Company and its subsidiaries actively monitors the credit exposure to its customers. Certain of our subsidiaries may perform credit reviews of customers and may require customers to provide cash collateral, post a letter of credit, prepay for services or provide other credit enhancements.\nCredit Spread Risk – \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into credit default swap index transactions with a notional value of $2 billion that potentially benefit from widening investment grade credit spreads associated with the underlying securities that comprise the index. In addition to our exposure to tightening investment grade credit spreads as a result of these transactions, carrying costs associated with maintaining the positions could adversely affect returns.  \nThe following tables present the estimated effects on the fair value of our and our subsidiaries’ financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 due to an increase in yield rates of 100 basis points, a 20% decline in foreign currency exchange rates and a 25% decline in the S&P 500, with all other variables held constant, on the basis of those entered into for trading purposes and other than trading purposes.\n79\nTable of Contents\nTrading portfolio:\n \nIncrease (Decrease)\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nFair Value Asset (Liability)\n \n Interest Rate Risk\n \nEquity Price Risk\n \n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFixed maturities – long\n$\n716\n \n$\n(6)\nEquity securities – long\n403\n \n$\n(101)\n – short\n(88)\n22\n \nOptions – purchased\n2\n \n44\n \nOther invested assets\n10\n \nShort-term investments\n2,180\n \n(5)\nOther than trading portfolio:\nIncrease (Decrease)\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nFair Value Asset\n \n(Liability)\nInterest Rate Risk\n \nForeign Currency\n \nRisk\n \nEquity Price Risk\n \n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFixed maturities\n$\n41,111\n \n$\n(2,684)\n$\n(651)\nEquity securities\n659\n \n(15)\n$\n(45)\nLimited partnership investments\n2,520\n \n(2)\n(252)\nOther invested assets\n85\n \n(16)\nMortgage loans\n987\n \n(30)\nShort-term investments\n2,426\n \n(1)\n(45)\nOther derivatives\n6\n \n1\n \n40\n \n80\nTable of Contents\nTrading portfolio:\n \nIncrease (Decrease) \nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Value Asset (Liability) \nInterest Rate \nRisk \nEquity Price \nRisk \n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFixed maturities – long\n$\n201 \n$\n(3)\nEquity securities – long\n366 \n$\n(91)\n – short\n(62)\n15 \nOptions – purchased\n1 \n35 \nOther invested assets\n8 \nShort-term investments\n2,109 \n(6)\nOther than trading portfolio:\n \nIncrease (Decrease) \nDecember 31, 2023\nFair Value Asset (Liability) \nInterest Rate \nRisk \nForeign Currency Risk \nEquity Price \nRisk \n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFixed maturities\n$\n40,425 \n$\n(2,779)\n$\n(638)\nEquity securities\n683 \n(14)\n$\n(48)\nLimited partnership investments\n2,174 \n(1)\n(217)\nOther invested assets\n81 \n(15)\nMortgage loans\n997 \n(34)\nShort-term investments\n2,287 \n(2)\n(38)\nOther derivatives\n14 \n4 \n3 \n29 \nChanges in discount rates used to measure CNA’s liability for future policyholder benefits (“LFPB”) would reduce the impact of the decrease in Fixed maturity securities within Other comprehensive income.

Our internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nThere are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any control system, however well designed, including the possibility of human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Management must make judgments with respect to the relative cost and expected benefits of any specific control measure. The design of a control system also is based in part upon assumptions and judgments made by management about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that a control will be effective under all potential future conditions. As a result, even an effective system of internal control over financial reporting can provide no more than reasonable assurance with respect to the fair presentation of financial statements and the processes under which they were prepared.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n. Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an audit report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The report of Deloitte & Touche LLP follows this Report.\n83\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Loews Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, and the related notes and the schedules listed in the Index at Item 15 (a) (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated \nFebruary 11, 2025\n, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nClaim and claim adjustment expense reserves – Property & Casualty — Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe estimation of property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expense reserves (“P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves”), including those claims that are incurred but not reported, requires significant judgment. Estimating P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves is subject to a high degree of variability as it involves complex estimates that are generally derived using a variety of actuarial estimation techniques and numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, many of which are highly uncertain. Modest changes in judgments and assumptions can materially impact the valuation of these liabilities, particularly for claims with longer-tailed exposures such as workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability claims and certain shorter-tailed exposures, such as surety.\n84\nTable of Contents\nGiven the significant judgments made by management in estimating P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, auditing P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to the determination of P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, including those controls related to the estimation of and management’s review of P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.\n•\nWe tested the underlying data, including historical claims, that served as the basis for the actuarial analyses, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimates were accurate and complete.\n•\nWith the assistance of our actuarial specialists:\n◦\nWe developed a range of independent estimates of P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and compared the recorded reserves to our range of estimates.\n◦\nWe performed a retrospective review which involved comparing our prior year estimates of expected incurred losses to actual experience during the most recent year to identify potential bias in the Company’s determination of P&C claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nFuture policy benefit reserves – Long Term Care — Refer to Notes 1 and \n9\n to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe estimation of long term care future policy benefit reserves (“LTC future policy benefit reserves”) requires significant judgment in the selection of key assumptions, including morbidity and persistency.\nEstimating future experience for long term care policies is subject to significant estimation risk as the required projection period spans several decades. Morbidity and persistency experience can be volatile and modest changes in each of these assumptions can materially impact the valuation of these liabilities.\nGiven the significant judgments made by management in estimating LTC future policy benefit reserves, auditing LTC future policy benefit reserves required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the involvement of our actuarial specialists. \n85\nTable of Contents\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to LTC future policy benefit reserves included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to the determination of LTC future policy benefit reserves, including those controls related to the estimation of and management’s review of LTC future policy benefit reserves and determination of key assumptions.\n•\nWe tested the underlying data, including demographic and historical claims data, that served as the basis for the actuarial analyses, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimates were accurate and complete.\n•\nWith the assistance of our actuarial specialists:\n◦\nWe \nindependently recalculated cohort level LTC future policy benefit reserves and compared our estimates to the recorded reserves.\n◦\nWe \nevaluated the judgments made by management in setting assumptions, including comparing those assumptions to the Company’s historical experience used as the basis for setting those assumptions.\n◦\nFor a sample of policies, we evaluated management’s estimate of future cash flows. This included confirming that assumptions were applied as intended.\n \n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew York, New York\n \nFebruary 11, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1969.\n86\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Loews Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Loews Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, of the Company and our report dated February 11, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nNew York, New York\n \nFebruary 11, 2025\n87\nTable of Contents\nLoews Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of presentation\n − Loews Corporation is a holding company. Its consolidated operating subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of business: commercial property and casualty insurance (CNA Financial Corporation (“CNA”), an approximately \n92\n% owned subsidiary); transportation and storage of natural gas and natural gas liquids, olefins and other hydrocarbons (Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipelines”), a wholly owned subsidiary) and the operation of a chain of hotels (Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels & Co”), a wholly owned subsidiary). Unless the context otherwise requires, as used herein, the term “Company” means Loews Corporation including its subsidiaries, the term “Parent Company” means Loews Corporation excluding its subsidiaries and the term “Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation” means Net income (loss) attributable to Loews Corporation shareholders.\nAccounting estimates and principles of consolidation\n – The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported on the consolidated financial statements and the related notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include all subsidiaries and intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n \nInvestments\n – Fixed maturity securities are classified as either available-for-sale or trading, and as such, they are carried at fair value. Short-term investments are carried at fair value. Changes in fair value of trading securities are reported within Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in fair value of available-for-sale securities are reported as a component of Other comprehensive income.\nThe cost of fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, which are included in Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The amortization of premium and accretion of discount for fixed maturity securities takes into consideration call and maturity dates that produce the lowest yield.\nFor asset-backed securities included in fixed maturity securities, income is recognized using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments predominantly using the retrospective method.\nEquity securities are carried at fair value. Non-redeemable preferred stock investments contain characteristics of debt securities, are priced similarly to bonds and are held primarily for income generation through periodic dividends. While recognition of gains and losses on these securities is not discretionary, the changes in fair value of non-redeemable preferred stock are not considered to be reflective of its primary operations. As such, the changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded through Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Common stock is owned with the intention of holding the securities primarily for market appreciation and as such, the changes in the fair value of these securities are recorded through Net investment income (loss).\nCarrying value of investments in limited partnerships is the owner’s share of the net asset value of each partnership, as determined by the general partner. Certain partnerships for which results are not available on a timely basis are reported on a lag, primarily three months or less. These investments are accounted for under the equity method and changes in net asset values are recorded within Net investment income on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nMortgage loans are commercial in nature, are carried at unpaid principal balance, net of unamortized fees and an allowance for expected credit losses, and are recorded once funded. The allowance for expected credit losses on mortgage loans is developed by assessing the credit quality of pools of mortgage loans in good standing using debt service coverage ratios (“DSCR”) and loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios. The DSCR compares a property’s net operating income to its debt service payments, including principal and interest. The LTV ratio compares the current unpaid principal balance of the loan to the estimated fair value of the underlying property collateralizing the loan. The pools developed to measure the credit loss allowance use increments of DSCR and LTV to draw distinctions between risk levels. Expected credit loss rates are applied by pool to the outstanding receivable balances. Changes in the allowance for mortgage loans are presented as a component of Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Mortgage loans are included in Other invested assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nInterest income from mortgage loans is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective yield method.\n96\nTable of Contents\nInvestments in derivative securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a component of Investment gains (losses), Net investment income or Other comprehensive income (loss), depending on their hedge designation. A derivative is typically defined as an instrument whose value is “derived” from an underlying instrument, index or rate, has a notional amount, requires little or no initial investment and can be net settled. Derivatives include the following types of investments: interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, put and call options, warrants, futures, forwards, commitments to purchase securities, credit default swaps and combinations of the foregoing. Derivatives embedded within non-derivative instruments (such as call options embedded in convertible bonds) must be split from the host instrument when the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host instrument.\nAn available-for-sale security is impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its cost adjusted for accretion, amortization and allowance for credit losses. When a security is impaired, it is evaluated to determine whether there is an intent to sell the security before recovery of amortized cost or whether a credit loss exists. Losses on securities that are intended to be sold are recognized as impairment losses within Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. If a credit loss exists, an allowance is established and the corresponding amount is recognized as an impairment loss within Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The allowance for credit losses related to available-for-sale fixed maturity securities is the difference between the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. In subsequent periods, the allowance is reviewed, with any changes in the allowance presented as a component of Investment gains (losses) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Changes in the difference between the amortized cost basis, net of the allowance, and the fair value, are recognized in Other comprehensi\nve income.\nSignificant judgment is required in the determination of whether an impairment loss has occurred for a security. A consistent and systematic process is followed for determining and recording an impairment loss, including the evaluation of securities in an unrealized loss position and securities with an allowance for credit losses on at least a quarterly basis.\nThe assessment of whether an impairment loss has occurred incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information. A credit loss exists if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis. Significant assumptions enter into these cash flow projections including delinquency rates, probable risk of default, loss severity upon a default, over collateralization and interest coverage triggers and credit support from lower level tranches. All available evidence is considered when determining whether an investment requires a credit loss write-down or allowance to be recorded. Examples of such evidence may include the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, whether the issuer is current with interest and principal payments, credit ratings on the security or changes in ratings over time, general market conditions and industry, sector or other specific factors and whether it is likely that the amortized cost will be recovered through the collection of cash flows.\nCredit losses \n–\n \nThe allowances for credit losses on fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, reinsurance receivables, insurance receivables and trade receivables are valuation accounts that are reported as a reduction of a financial asset’s cost basis and are measured on a pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist. The allowance is estimated using relevant available information from both internal and external sources. Historical credit loss experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses and adjustments may be made to reflect current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Adjustments to historical loss information are made for additional factors that come to the Company’s attention. This could include significant shifts in counterparty financial strength ratings, aging of past due receivables, amounts sent to collection agencies, or other underlying portfolio changes. Current and forecast economic conditions are considered, using a variety of economic metrics and forecast indices. The sensitivity of expected credit losses relative to changes to the forecast of economic conditions can vary by financial asset class. A reasonable and supportable forecast period is up to 24 months from the balance sheet date. After the forecast period, the Company reverts to historical credit experience. Collateral arrangements such as letters of credit and amounts held in beneficiary trusts to mitigate credit risk are considered in the estimate of the net amount expected to be collected. Amounts are written off against the allowance when determined to be uncollectible. \nA policy election has been made to present accrued interest balances separately from the amortized cost basis of assets, and a practical expedient has been elected to exclude the accrued interest from the tabular disclosures for mortgage loans and available-for-sale securities. An election has been made not to estimate an allowance for credit losses on accrued interest receivables. The accrual of interest income is discontinued and the asset is placed on nonaccrual status within \n90\n days of the interest becoming delinquent. Interest accrued but not received for assets on nonaccrual status is reversed through Net investment income. Interest received for assets that are on nonaccrual status is recognized as payment is received. The asset is returned to accrual status when the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current, and future payments are expected. Interest receivables are presented in Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n97\nTable of Contents\nEquity method investments \n– Loews Hotels & Co has interests in operating joint ventures related to hotel properties over which it exercises significant influence but does not have control over them. Loews Hotels & Co uses the equity method of accounting for these investments. The Company also has interests in Altium Packaging LLC (“Altium Packaging”), which is engaged in the manufacture of rigid packaging solutions. Loews Corporation shares certain participating rights related to capital allocation and other decisions with the joint venture partner, therefore, the investment in Altium Packaging is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company’s total investment in entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting, excluding limited partnership investments, was $\n937\n million and $\n996\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and is reported in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Equity method income for investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting, excluding limited partnerships, was $\n58\n million, $\n120\n million and $\n139\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and is reported separately in expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Equity method investments are reviewed for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.\n See Note 3 for a discussion of limited partnership investments.\nHedging\n – The Company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions. The Company also formally assesses (both at the hedge’s inception and on an ongoing basis) whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows of hedged items and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods. When it is determined that a derivative for which hedge accounting has been designated is not (or ceases to be) highly effective, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.\n See Note 3 for additional information on the Company’s use of derivatives.\nSecurities lending activities\n – The Company lends securities for the purpose of enhancing income or to finance positions to unrelated parties who have been designated as primary dealers by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Borrowers of these securities must deposit and maintain collateral with the Company of no less than \n100\n% of the fair value of the securities loaned. United States of America (“U.S.”) Government securities and cash are accepted as collateral. The Company maintains effective control over loaned securities and, therefore, continues to report such securities as investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSecurities lending is typically done on a matched-book basis where the collateral is invested to substantially match the term of the loan. This matching of terms tends to limit risk. In accordance with the Company’s lending agreements, securities on loan are returned immediately to the Company upon notice. Collateral is not reflected as an asset of the Company. There was \nno\n collateral held at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nRevenue recognition\n – Premiums on property and casualty insurance contracts are recognized in proportion to the underlying risk insured and are primarily earned ratably over the term of the policies. Premiums on long-term care contracts are earned ratably over the policy year in which they are due. The reserve for unearned premiums represents the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage.\nProperty and casualty contracts that are retrospectively rated or subject to audit premiums contain provisions that result in an adjustment to the initial policy premium depending on the contract provisions. These provisions stipulate the adjustment due to loss experience of the insured during the coverage period, or changes in the level of exposure to insurance risk. For such contracts, CNA estimates the amount of ultimate premiums that it may earn upon completion of the coverage period and recognizes either an asset or a liability for the difference between the initial policy premium and the estimated ultimate premium. CNA either adjusts such estimated ultimate premium amounts during the course of the coverage period based on actual results to date or by conducting premium audits after the policy has expired to determine the final exposure to insured risks. The resulting adjustment is recorded as either a reduction of or an increase to the earned premiums for the period.\nInsurance receivables include balances due currently or in the future, including amounts due from insureds related to paid losses under high deductible policies, and are presented at unpaid balances, net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n26\n million and $\n28\n million for insurance receivables has been established using a loss rate methodology to determine expected credit losses for premium receivables. This methodology uses CNA’s historical annual credit losses relative to gross premium written to develop a range of credit loss rates for each dollar of gross written premium underwritten. Additionally, an expected credit loss for amounts due from insureds under high deductible and retrospectively rated policies is calculated on a pool basis, informed by historical default rate data obtained from major rating agencies. Changes in the allowance are presented as a component of Other operating expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts are considered past due based on policy payment terms. Insurance receivables and any related allowance are written off after collection efforts are exhausted or a negotiated settlement is reached.\n98\nTable of Contents\nCNA’s non-insurance warranty revenues are primarily generated from separately-priced service contracts that provide mechanical breakdown and other coverages to vehicle or consumer goods owners, which generally provide coverage from \none month\n to \nten years\n. For warranty products where CNA acts as the principal in the transaction, Non-insurance warranty revenue is reported on a gross basis, with amounts paid by customers reported as Non-insurance warranty revenue and commissions paid to agents and dealers reported as Non-insurance warranty expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Additionally, CNA provides warranty administration services for dealer and manufacturer warranty products. Non-insurance revenues are recognized when obligations under the terms of the contract with CNA’s customers are satisfied, which is generally over time as obligations are fulfilled. CNA recognizes non-insurance warranty revenue over the service period in proportion to the actuarially determined expected claims emergence pattern. Customers predominantly pay in full at the inception of the warranty contract. The liability for unearned warranty revenue, reported as Deferred non-insurance warranty revenue on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, represents the unearned portion of revenue in advance of CNA’s performance, including amounts which are refundable upon cancellation.\nContract costs to obtain or fulfill non-insurance warranty contracts with customers are deferred and recorded as Deferred non-insurance warranty acquisition expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These costs are expected to be recoverable over the term of the contract and are amortized in the same manner the related revenue is recognized. CNA evaluates deferred costs for recoverability including consideration of anticipated investment income. Adjustments to deferred costs, if necessary, are recorded in the current period results of operations.\nBoardwalk Pipelines primarily earns revenues by providing transportation and storage services for natural gas and natural gas liquids, olefins and other hydrocarbons (referred to together as “NGLs”) on a firm and interruptible basis and providing ethane supply and transportation services for industrial customers in Louisiana and Texas. Boardwalk Pipelines also provides interruptible natural gas parking and lending services. The majority of Boardwalk Pipelines’ operating subsidiaries are subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulations and certain revenues collected, under certain circumstances, may be subject to possible refunds to its customers. An estimated refund liability is recorded considering regulatory proceedings, advice of counsel and estimated total exposure. The majority of Boardwalk Pipelines’ revenues are from firm service contracts which are accounted for as a single promise to stand ready each month of the contract term to provide the committed capacity for either transportation or storage services. The transaction price is comprised of a fixed fee based on the capacity reserved plus a usage fee paid on the volume of commodity transported or injected and withdrawn from storage. Both the fixed and the usage fees are allocated to the single performance obligation of providing transportation or storage service and recognized over time as control is passed to the customer. These service contracts can range in term from \none\n to \n20\n years and are invoiced monthly. For the ethane supply contracts, the purchases and sales are with different counterparties and control transfers at different receipt and delivery points, resulting in the purchases and sales being presented on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nLoews Hotels & Co provides lodging and related goods and services as well as management and marketing services. Lodging and related revenues are recognized as the guest takes possession of the goods or receives the services. Management and marketing services revenues are recognized as the services are provided and billed on a monthly basis. In addition, Loews Hotels & Co recognizes revenue for the reimbursement of payroll and other expenses as they are incurred on behalf of the owners of joint venture and managed hotel properties.\nClaim and claim adjustment expense reserves\n – Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, except reserves for structured settlements not associated with asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”) and workers’ compensation lifetime claims, are not discounted and are based on (i) case basis estimates for losses reported on direct business, adjusted in the aggregate for ultimate loss expectations; (ii) estimates of incurred but not reported losses; (iii) estimates of losses on assumed reinsurance; (iv) estimates of future expenses to be incurred in the settlement of claims; (v) estimates of salvage and subrogation recoveries and (vi) estimates of amounts due from insureds related to losses under high deductible policies. Management considers current conditions and trends as well as past CNA and industry experience in establishing these estimates. The effects of inflation, which can be significant, are implicitly considered in the reserving process and are part of the recorded reserve balance. Ceded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reported as a component of Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nClaim and claim adjustment expense reserves are presented net of anticipated amounts due from insureds related to losses under deductible policies of $\n1.3\n billion and $\n1.2\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. A significant portion of these amounts are supported by collateral. CNA also has an allowance for uncollectible deductible amounts, which is presented as a component of the allowance for doubtful accounts included in Receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nStructured settlements have been negotiated for certain property and casualty insurance claims. Structured settlements are agreements to provide fixed periodic payments to claimants. CNA’s obligations for structured settlements not funded by annuities are included in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and are discounted at a weighted average \n99\nTable of Contents\ninterest rate of \n6.6\n% and \n6.4\n% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. This interest rate is based on the expected yield of the assets that support the reserves and reinvestment assumptions. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the discounted reserves for unfunded structured settlements were $\n444\n million and $\n465\n million, net of discount of $\n535\n million and $\n559\n million. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amount of interest recognized on the discounted reserves of unfunded structured settlements was $\n33\n million, $\n34\n million and $\n36\n million. This interest accretion is presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations but is excluded from the disclosure of prior year loss reserve development.\nWorkers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves are calculated using mortality assumptions determined through statutory regulation and economic factors. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves are discounted at a \n3.5\n% interest rate. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the discounted reserves for workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves were $\n179\n million and $\n196\n million, net of discount of $\n80\n million and $\n88\n million. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amount of interest accretion recognized on the discounted reserves of workers’ compensation lifetime claim reserves was $\n6\n million, $\n9\n million and $\n9\n million. This interest accretion is presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, but is excluded from the disclosure of prior year loss reserve development.\nFuture policy benefit reserves\n – Future policy benefit reserves are associated with CNA’s run-off long-term care business and relate to policyholders that are currently receiving benefits, including claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported, as well as policyholders that are not yet receiving benefits. \nThe \nliability for future policyholder benefits (“LFPB”)\n is computed using the net level premium method, which incorporates cash flow and discount rate assumptions. \nUnder the net level premium method, the LFPB is equal to the present value of future benefits and claim settlement expenses less the present value of future net premiums. Net premiums are equal to gross premiums multiplied by the\n \nNet Premium Ratio (“NPR”).\n \nThe NPR is generally the ratio of the present value of benefits and expense payments to the present value of gross premiums, expected over the lifetime of the policy.\n \nAs a result of the modified retrospective adoption of ASU 2018-12, CNA’s NPR calculation incorporates the original locked in discount rate and the reserve balance as of the transition date of January 1, 2021.\nThe key cash flow assumptions used to estimate the LFPB are morbidity, persistency, anticipated future premium rate increases and expenses. Morbidity is the frequency and severity of injury, illness, sickness and diseases contracted.\n \nPersistency is the percentage of policies remaining in force and can be affected by policy lapses, benefit reductions and death.\n \nFuture premium rate increases are generally subject to regulatory approval, and therefore the exact timing and size of the approved rate increases are unknown.\n \nExpense assumptions relate to claim adjudication. The practical expedient was not elected that allows locking in the expense assumption.\n \nThe carried LFPB discount rate is determined using the upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yield curve. \nCNA has elected to update the NPR and the LFPB for actual experience on a quarterly basis. A quarterly assessment is also made as to whether evidence suggests that cash flow assumptions should be updated. Annually, in the third quarter, actuarial analysis is performed on policyholder morbidity, persistency, premium rate increase and expense experience.  This analysis, combined with judgment, informs the setting of updated cash flow assumptions used to estimate the LFPB. Actuarial analysis includes predictive modeling, actual to expected experience comparisons and trend analysis.\n \nApplicable industry research is also considered. The effect of changes in cash flow assumptions and actual variances from expected experience are recorded in the results of operations within Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits. \nQuarterly, to derive the upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yield discount rate assumption, a published spot rate curve constructed from single-A rated U.S. dollar denominated corporate bonds is used. Linear interpolation to determine yield assumptions for tenors that fall between points for which observable rates are available is used.\n \nFor cash flows that are projected to occur beyond the tenor for which market-observable rates are available, CNA applies judgment  to estimate a normative rate which it grades to over 10 years. The effect of changes in discount rate assumptions are recorded in Other comprehensive income (loss). \nQuarterly, the updated NPR is used to derive an updated LFPB as of the beginning of the current quarter measured at the original locked in discount rate. The updated LFPB is then compared to the existing carrying amount of the liability as of the same date (measured at the original locked in discount rate) to determine the re-measurement gain (loss), which is presented parenthetically within the Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits line on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \n100\nTable of Contents\nInsurance contracts are grouped into cohorts according to issue year.\n \nContracts assumed through reinsurance are generally included within the same cohorts as contracts issued directly, according to issue year.\n \nThe issue year for assumed contracts is defined according to the date that assumption of insurance risk incepted.\n \nFor assumed contracts that were reinsured concurrently with the issuance of the underlying direct contract, issue year is defined as the year that the underlying policy was issued.\n \nFor contracts that were already in-force when assumed, issue year is defined as the year in which the reinsurance agreement incepted. For group long-term care business, issue year is defined as the year the individual insurance certificate was issued. Long-term care is CNA’s only long-duration product line, therefore, cohorts are not further disaggregated by product.\nInsurance-related assessments \n– Liabilities for insurance-related assessments are accrued when an assessment is probable, when it can be reasonably estimated and when the event obligating the entity to pay an imposed or probable assessment has occurred. Liabilities for insurance-related assessments are not discounted and are included as part of Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the liability balances were $\n86\n million and $\n84\n million.\nReinsurance\n – Reinsurance accounting allows for contractual cash flows to be reflected as premiums and losses. To qualify for reinsurance accounting, reinsurance agreements must include risk transfer. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity.\nReinsurance receivables related to paid losses are presented at unpaid balances. Reinsurance receivables related to unpaid losses are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefit reserves. Reinsurance receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cost of reinsurance is primarily accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies or over the reinsurance contract period. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, an allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n21\n million and \n$\n22\n million\n have been established for each year for reinsurance receivables, which relates to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed when losses are paid in the future. For assessing expected credit losses, CNA separates reinsurance receivables into two pools: voluntary reinsurance receivables and involuntary receivables related to mandatory pools. CNA has not recorded an allowance for involuntary pools as there is no perceived credit risk. The principal credit quality indicator used in the valuation of the allowance on voluntary reinsurance receivables is the financial strength rating of the reinsurer sourced from major rating agencies. If the reinsurer is unrated, an internal financial strength rating is assigned based on CNA’s historical loss experience and the assessment of the reinsurance counterparty’s risk profile, which generally corresponds with a B rating. Reinsurer financial strength ratings are updated and reviewed on an annual basis or sooner if CNA becomes aware of significant changes related to a reinsurer. The allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables is estimated on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer financial strength rating and solvency, industry experience and current and forecast economic conditions. Because billed receivables generally approximate \n6\n% or less of total reinsurance receivables, the age of the reinsurance receivables related to paid losses is not a significant input into the allowance analysis. Changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables are presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAmounts are considered past due based on the reinsurance contract terms. Reinsurance receivables related to paid losses and any related allowance are written off after collection efforts have been exhausted or a negotiated settlement is reached with the reinsurer. Reinsurance receivables from insolvent insurers related to paid losses are written off when the settlement due from the estate can be reasonably estimated. At the time reinsurance receivables related to paid losses are written off, any required adjustment to reinsurance receivables related to unpaid losses is recorded as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nA loss portfolio transfer is a retroactive reinsurance contract. If the cumulative claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses ceded under a loss portfolio transfer exceed the consideration paid, the resulting gain from such excess is deferred and amortized into earnings in future periods in proportion to actual recoveries under the loss portfolio transfer. In any period in which there is a revised estimate of claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses and the loss portfolio transfer is in a gain position, the deferred gain is recalculated as if the revised estimate was available at the inception date of the loss portfolio transfer and the change in the deferred gain is recognized in earnings.\nDeferred acquisition costs\n – Deferrable acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain underwriting and policy issuance costs which are incremental direct costs of successful contract acquisitions. Acquisition \n101\nTable of Contents\ncosts related to property and casualty business are deferred and amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are presented net of ceding commissions and other ceded acquisition costs.\nCNA evaluates deferred acquisition costs for recoverability. Anticipated investment income is considered in the determination of the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs. Adjustments, if necessary, are recorded in current period results of operations.\nPolicyholder dividends \n–\n \nPolicyholder dividends are paid to participating policyholders within the workers’ compensation and surety lines of business. Net written premiums for participating dividend policies were approximately \n2\n% of total net written premiums for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Dividends to policyholders are accrued according to CNA’s best estimate of the amount to be paid in accordance with contractual provisions and applicable state laws. Dividends to policyholders are presented as a component of Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\n – Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets of acquired entities. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or when certain triggering events require additional tests. Subsequent reversal of a goodwill impairment charge is not permitted.\nOther intangible assets are reported within Other assets. Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Indefinite-lived other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or when certain triggering events require such tests.\n See Note 7 for additional information on goodwill and other intangible assets.\nProperty, plant and equipment\n – Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the various classes of properties. Leaseholds and leasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the terms of the related leases (including optional renewal periods, where appropriate) or the estimated lives of improvements, if less than the lease term.\nThe principal service lives used in computing provisions for depreciation are as follows:\nYears\nPipeline equipment\n30\nto\n50\nHotel properties and other\n3\nto\n40\nImpairment of long-lived assets\n – Long-lived and finite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Long-lived assets and intangibles with finite lives, under certain circumstances, are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value. Assets to be disposed of and assets not expected to provide any future service potential are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nIncome taxes\n − The Company and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated tax return. Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period in which such change is enacted. Future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes may not be realized.\nThe Company recognizes uncertain tax positions that it has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. See Note 11 for additional information on the provision for income taxes.\nPension and postretirement benefits\n – The overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit plans is recognized in Other assets or Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in funded status related to prior service costs and credits and actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the year in which the changes occur through Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”). Benefit plan assets and obligations are measured at December 31. Annual service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service costs and credits and amortization of actuarial gains and losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n102\nTable of Contents\nStock-based compensation\n – Compensation expense is recorded upon issuance, modification or cancellation of all share-based payment awards granted, primarily on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, generally \nthree years\n. Restricted Stock Units are valued using the grant-date fair value of Loews Corporation’s stock.\nNet income per share\n – Basic net income per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stock by the weighted average number of Loews Corporation common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted net income per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue Loews Corporation common stock were exercised or converted into common stock.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, approximately \n0.3\n million, \n0.3\n million and \n0.4\n million potential shares attributable to issuances and exercises under the Loews Corporation 2016 Incentive Compensation Plan and the prior plan were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share, and there were \nno\n shares attributable to employee stock-based compensation awards excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share because the effect would have been antidilutive.\n \nForeign currency\n – Foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in Shareholders’ equity as a component of AOCI. Foreign subsidiaries’ balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rates in effect at each reporting date and income statement accounts are translated at the average exchange rates during the reporting period. There were foreign currency transaction gains (losses) of $(\n7\n) million, $\n8\n million and $(\n20\n) million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRegulatory accounting \n– The majority of Boardwalk Pipelines’ revenues are earned from operating subsidiaries that are regulated by FERC. Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (“Texas Gas”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipelines, applies regulatory accounting to certain assets for GAAP purposes, which records certain assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates. Gulf South Pipeline Company, LLC (“Gulf South”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Boardwalk Pipelines, has implemented fuel trackers, for which regulatory accounting is applied. Accordingly, the value of fuel received from customers paying the maximum tariff rate and the related value of fuel used in transportation are recorded to a regulatory asset or liability depending on whether Gulf South uses more fuel than it collects from customers or collects more fuel than it uses. Other than as described for Texas Gas and the fuel trackers for Gulf South, regulatory accounting is not applicable to Boardwalk Pipelines’ other FERC regulated entities or operations.\nSupplementary cash flow information\n – Cash payments made for interest on long-term debt, net of capitalized interest, amounted to $\n422\n million, $\n385\n million and $\n380\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Cash payments for federal, foreign, state and local income taxes amounted to $\n403\n million, $\n304\n million and $\n376\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Investing activities include $\n37\n million of previously accrued capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2024 and exclude $\n9\n million and $\n33\n million of accrued capital expenditures for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. \nAccounting changes\n – In November of 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” The updated accounting guidance requires enhanced reportable segment disclosures, primarily related to significant segment expenses which are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The guidance has been adopted retrospectively, with comparative period segment disclosures adjusted to reflect the change in accounting guidance. See Note 20 for additional information. \nIn August of 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12, “Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”). \nThe updated accounting guidance requires changes to the measurement and disclosure of long-duration contracts.\n \nEntities are required to review, and update if there is a change, cash flow assumptions (including morbidity and persistency) used to measure the liability for future policyholder benefits (“LFPB”) at least annually. The LFPB must also be updated for actual experience at least annually. The discount rate assumption used to measure the LFPB must be updated quarterly using an upper-medium grade (low credit risk) fixed-income instrument yield, commonly interpreted as a single-A rate. \nThe guidance was adopted effective January 1, 2023, using the modified retrospective method applied as of the transition date of January 1, 2021. CNA’s run-off long-term care business is in scope of the guidance. Prior periods presented in the financial statements have been adjusted to reflect application of the guidance. While the requirements of the guidance represent a material change from legacy accounting, it does not impact capital and surplus under statutory accounting practices, cash flows or the underlying economics of the business.\n103\nTable of Contents\nRecently issued ASUs - \nIn December of 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-08, “Intangibles-Goodwill and Other- Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60): Accounting for and Disclosure of Crypto Assets.” The updated accounting guidance requires that an entity measure crypto assets at fair value in the statement of financial position each reporting period and recognize changes from remeasurement in net income. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The update requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance at the date of adoption. At adoption on January 1, 2025, the Company estimates an increase to Retained earnings of $\n5\n million.\nIn December of 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” The updated accounting guidance requires expanded income tax disclosures, including the disaggregation of existing disclosures related to the effective tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Prospective application is required, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the updated guidance will have on its financial statement disclosures. \nIn November of 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, “Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses.” The updated accounting guidance requires disaggregated disclosure of specified expense categories. The guidance also requires disclosure of total selling expenses and how the Company defines selling expenses. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Prospective application is required, with retrospective application permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the updated guidance will have on its financial statement disclosures.\n \nNote 2. \nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Deconsolidations\nBoardwalk Pipelines\nOn September 29, 2023, Boardwalk Pipelines acquired \n100\n% of the equity interests of Williams Olefins Pipeline Holdco LLC (“Bayou Ethane”) from Williams Field Services Group, LLC for $\n355\n million in cash. \nLoews Hotels & Co\nDuring 2024, Loews Hotels & Co acquired all the remaining outstanding noncontrolling equity interests of \ntwo\n owned and consolidated hotels for \n$\n44\n million.\nDuring \n2024\n, Loews Hotels & Co received proceeds of \n$\n23\n million\n for the sale of an owned hotel.\nDuring 2023, Loews Hotels & Co paid \n$\n46\n million\n \nto acquire an additional equity interest in a previously unconsolidated joint venture property.

securities in the gross unrealized loss position table above are not indicative of the ultimate collectability of the current amortized cost of the securities, but rather are primarily attributable to changes in risk-free interest rates. In reaching this determination, the volatility in risk-free rates and credit spreads, as well as the fact that the unrealized losses are concentrated in investment grade issuers, were considered. Additionally, there is no current intent to sell securities with unrealized losses, nor is it more likely than not that sale will be required prior to recovery of amortized cost; accordingly, it was determined that there are \nno\n additional impairment losses to be recorded at December 31, 2024.\nThe following tables present the activity related to the allowance on available-for-sale securities with credit impairments and purchased credit-deteriorated (“PCD”) assets. \nAccrued interest receivables\n on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities totaled $\n442\n million and $\n435\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and are excluded from the estimate of expected credit losses and the amortized cost basis in the tables within this Note.\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nCorporate and Other Bonds\n \nAsset-backed\nTotal\n \n (In millions)\n \n \n \nAllowance for credit losses:\n \n \n \nBalance as of January 1, 2024\n$\n4\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n16\n \nAdditions to the allowance for credit losses:\nSecurities for which credit losses were not previously recorded\n9\n \n18\n \n27\n \nAvailable-for-sale securities accounted for as PCD assets\n4\n \n4\n \n \nReductions to the allowance for credit losses:\nSecurities sold during the period (realized)\n3\n \n1\n \n4\n \nIntent to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the \nsecurity before recovery of its amortized cost basis\n1\n \n1\n \nWrite-offs charged against the allowance\n9\n \n9\n \nAdditional increases to the allowance for credit \nlosses on securities that had an allowance recorded in a previous period\n12\n \n12\n \nTotal allowance for credit losses\n$\n13\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n45\n \n109\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nCorporate \nand Other Bonds \nAsset-backed\nTotal \n(In millions)\n \n \n \nAllowance for credit losses:\n \n \n \nBalance as of January 1, 2023\n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \nAdditions to the allowance for credit losses:\nSecurities for which credit losses were not previously recorded\n10\n \n7\n \n17\n \nAvailable-for-sale securities accounted for as PCD assets\n22\n \n22\n \n \nReductions to the allowance for credit losses:\nSecurities sold during the period (realized)\n6\n \n6\n \nIntent to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the \nsecurity before recovery of its amortized cost basis\n8\n \n8\n \nWrite-offs charged against the allowance\n15\n \n15\n \nAdditional increases to the allowance for credit \nlosses on securities that had an allowance recorded in a previous period\n1\n \n4\n \n5\n \nTotal allowance for credit losses\n$\n4\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n16\n \nContractual Maturity\nThe following table presents available-for-sale fixed maturity securities by contractual maturity.\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nCost or Amortized Cost\nEstimated Fair \nValue\nCost or Amortized Cost\nEstimated \nFair \nValue\n(In millions)\nDue in one year or less\n$\n1,761\n \n$\n1,753\n \n$\n1,121\n \n$\n1,091\n \nDue after one year through five years\n11,678\n \n11,403\n \n11,563\n \n11,180\n \nDue after five years through ten years\n13,083\n \n12,365\n \n13,359\n \n12,573\n \nDue after ten years\n16,908\n \n15,540\n \n16,371\n \n15,581\n \nTotal\n$\n43,430\n \n$\n41,061\n \n$\n42,414\n \n$\n40,425\n \nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain securities may be called or prepaid.

The number of limited partnerships held and the strategies employed provide diversification to the limited partnership portfolio and the overall invested asset portfolio.\n110\nTable of Contents\nLimited partnerships comprising \n86\n% and \n85\n% of the carrying value at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were invested in private debt and equity. Limited partnerships comprising \n14\n% and \n15\n% of the carrying value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 employ hedge fund strategies. Private debt and equity funds cover a broad range of investment strategies including buyout, co-investment, private credit, growth capital, distressed investing and real estate. Hedge fund strategies include both long and short positions in fixed income, equity and derivative instruments.\nThe \nten\n largest limited partnership positions held totaled $\n648\n million and $\n622\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Based on the most recent information available regarding percentage ownership of the individual limited partnerships, the carrying value reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets represents approximately \n1\n% of the aggregate partnership equity at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related income reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations represents approximately \n1\n%, \n1\n%, and \n2\n% of the changes in aggregate partnership equity for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nThere are risks inherent in limited partnership investments which may result in losses due to short-selling, derivatives or other speculative investment practices. The use of leverage increases volatility generated by the underlying investment strategies.\nPrivate debt, private equity and other non-hedge fund limited partnership investments generally do not permit voluntary withdrawals. Hedge fund limited partnership investments contain withdrawal provisions that generally limit liquidity for a period of \nthirty days\n up to \none year\n or longer. Typically, hedge fund withdrawals require advance written notice of up to \n90\n days.\nMortgage Loans\nThe following table presents the amortized cost basis of mortgage loans for each credit quality indicator by year of origination. \nThe primary credit quality indicators utilized are debt service coverage ratios (“DSCR”) and loan-to-value (“LTV”) ratios.\nMortgage Loans Amortized Cost Basis by Origination Year (a)\nAs of December 31, 2024\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nPrior\nTotal\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDSCR ≥1.6x\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nLTV less than 55%\n$\n34\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n60\n \n$\n169\n \n$\n272\n \nLTV 55% to 65%\n15\n \n$\n11\n \n4\n \n12\n \n42\n \nLTV greater than 65%\n13\n \n30\n \n12\n \n55\n \nDSCR 1.2x - 1.6x\nLTV less than 55%\n$\n49\n \n28\n \n5\n \n2\n \n49\n \n71\n \n204\n \nLTV 55% to 65%\n53\n \n30\n \n21\n \n30\n \n20\n \n39\n \n193\n \nLTV greater than 65%\n46\n \n46\n \nDSCR ≤1.2x\nLTV less than 55%\n21\n \n21\n \nLTV 55% to 65%\n22\n \n75\n \n20\n \n117\n \nLTV greater than 65%\n35\n \n21\n \n48\n \n104\n \nTotal\n$\n102\n \n$\n127\n \n$\n236\n \n$\n76\n \n$\n133\n \n$\n380\n \n$\n1,054\n \n(a)\nThe values in the table above reflect DSCR on a standardized amortization period and LTV ratios based on the most recent appraised values trended forward using changes in a commercial real estate price index.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDerivatives may be used in the normal course of business, primarily in an attempt to reduce exposure to market risk (principally interest rate risk, credit risk, equity price risk, commodity price risk and foreign currency risk) stemming from various assets and liabilities. The principal objective under such strategies is to achieve the desired reduction in economic risk, even if the position does not receive hedge accounting treatment.\n111\nTable of Contents\nInterest rate swaps, futures and forward commitments to purchase securities may be entered into to manage interest rate risk. Credit derivatives such as credit default swaps may be entered into to modify the credit risk inherent in certain investments. Forward contracts, futures, swaps and options may be used to manage foreign currency and commodity price risk.\nIn addition to the derivatives used for risk management purposes described above, derivatives may also be used for purposes of income enhancement. Income enhancement transactions include interest rate swaps, call options, put options, credit default swaps, index futures and foreign currency forwards. See Note 4 for information regarding the fair value of derivative instruments.\nThe following tables present the aggregate contractual or notional amount and estimated fair value related to derivative financial instruments.\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nContractual/Notional Amount\nEstimated Fair Value \nContractual/Notional Amount\nEstimated Fair Value \nAsset\n(Liability)\n \nAsset\n(Liability) \n(In millions)\nWithout hedge designation:\nEquity markets:\nOptions - purchased\n$\n268\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n202\n \n$\n1\n \nFutures - short\n167\n \n1\n \n116\n \nWarrants\n1\n \n1\n \n84\n \n3\n \nInterest rate swaps\n300\n \n4\n \n300\n \n13\n \nCurrency forwards\n13\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\nCredit default swap index - purchased\n2,000\n \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company entered into credit default swap index transactions that potentially benefit from widening investment grade credit spreads associated with the underlying securities that comprise the index. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n the notional value of the credit default swap index is $\n2\n billion and the fair value is less than $\n1\n million which is recognized in Payable to brokers in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of the position is measured using observable market inputs, including credit spreads. For the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n, Net investment income related to the position was less than $\n1\n million.\nInvestment Commitments\nAs part of the overall investment strategy, investments are made in various assets which require future purchase, sale or funding commitments. These investments are recorded once funded, and the related commitments may include future capital calls from various third-party limited partnerships, signed and accepted mortgage loan applications and obligations related to private placement securities. As of December 31, 2024, commitments to purchase or fund were approximately $\n1.7\n billion and to sell were approximately $\n30\n million under the terms of these investments.\nInvestments on Deposit\nCash and securities with carrying values of approximately $\n3.1\n billion were deposited by CNA’s insurance subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities and others as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nCash and securities with carrying values of approximately $\n0.7\n billion and \n$\n0.9\n billion \nwere deposited with financial institutions in trust accounts or as collateral for letters of credit to secure obligations with various third parties as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n112\nTable of Contents\nNote 4. \nFair Value\nFair value is the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The following fair value hierarchy is used in selecting inputs, with the highest priority given to Level 1, as these are the most transparent or reliable:\n•\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2 – Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable in active markets.\n•\nLevel 3 – Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs are not observable.\nPrices may fall within Level 1, 2 or 3 depending upon the methodology and inputs used to estimate fair value for each specific security. In general, securities are priced using third party pricing services. Securities not priced by pricing services are submitted to independent brokers for valuation and, if those are not available, internally developed pricing models are used to value assets using a methodology and inputs that market participants presumably would use to value the assets. Prices obtained from third-party pricing services or brokers are not adjusted.\nControl procedures are performed over information obtained from pricing services and brokers to ensure prices received represent a reasonable estimate of fair value and to confirm representations regarding whether inputs are observable or unobservable. Procedures may include: (i) the review of pricing service methodologies or broker pricing qualifications, (ii) back-testing, where past fair value estimates are compared to actual transactions executed in the market on similar dates, (iii) exception reporting, where period-over-period changes in price are reviewed and challenged with the pricing service or broker based on exception criteria and (iv) detailed analysis, where an independent analysis of the inputs and assumptions used to price individual securities is performed.\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized in the following tables. Corporate bonds and other includes obligations of the U.S. Treasury, government-sponsored enterprises, foreign governments and redeemable preferred stock.\n113\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31,

of levels within the fair value hierarchy based on the availability of observable market information and quoted prices used to determine the fair value of the security. The availability of observable market information and quoted prices varies based on market conditions and trading volume.\nValuation Methodologies and Inputs\nThe following section describes the valuation methodologies and relevant inputs used to measure different financial instruments at fair value, including an indication of the level in the fair value hierarchy in which the instruments are generally classified.\nFixed Maturity Securities\nLevel 1 securities include highly liquid government securities and exchange traded bonds valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 securities include most other fixed maturity securities as the significant inputs are observable in the marketplace. All classes of Level 2 fixed maturity securities are valued using a methodology based on information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets, a discounted cash flow methodology or a combination of both when necessary. Common inputs for all classes of fixed maturity securities include prices from recently executed transactions of similar securities, marketplace quotes, benchmark yields, spreads off benchmark yields, interest rates and U.S. Treasury or swap curves. Specifically for asset-backed securities, key inputs include prepayment and default projections based on past performance of the underlying collateral and current market data. Fixed maturity securities are primarily assigned to Level 3 in cases where broker/dealer quotes are significant inputs to the valuation, and there is a lack of transparency as to whether these quotes are based on information that is observable in the marketplace. Level 3 securities also include private placement debt securities whose fair value is determined using internal models with some inputs that are not market observable.\nEquity Securities\nLevel 1 securities include publicly traded securities valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 securities are primarily valued using pricing for similar securities, recently executed transactions and other pricing models utilizing market observable inputs. Level 3 securities are primarily priced using broker/dealer quotes and internal models with some inputs that are not market observable.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nEquity options are valued using quoted market prices and are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Over-the-counter derivatives, principally interest rate swaps, currency forwards, total return swaps, commodity swaps, credit default swaps, equity warrants and options, are valued using inputs including broker/dealer quotes and are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, depending on the amount of transparency as to whether these quotes are based on information that is observable in the marketplace.\nShort-Term and Other Invested Assets\nSecurities that are actively traded or have quoted prices are classified as Level 1. These securities include money market funds, treasury bills and exchange traded open-end funds valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 primarily includes non-U.S. government securities for which all inputs are market observable. Fixed maturity securities purchased within one year of maturity are classified consistent with fixed maturity securities discussed above. Short-term investments as presented in the tables above differ from the amounts presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets because certain short-term investments, such as time deposits, are not measured at fair value.\n117\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\nThe following tables present quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs utilized in the fair value measurement of Level 3 assets. Valuations for assets and liabilities not presented in the tables below are primarily based on broker/dealer quotes for which there is a lack of transparency as to inputs used to develop the valuations. The quantitative detail of unobservable inputs from these broker quotes is neither provided nor reasonably available. The weighted average rate is calculated based on fair value.\nDecember 31, 2024\nEstimated \nFair Value\nValuation Techniques\nUnobservable Inputs\nRange (Weighted Average)\n \n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \nFixed maturity securities\n$\n1,724\n \nDiscounted cash flow\nCredit spread\n1\n%\n—\n6\n%\n(\n2\n%)\n \n \n \nDecember 31, 2023\n \n \n \n \n \nFixed maturity securities\n$\n1,495\n \nDiscounted cash flow\nCredit spread\n1\n%\n—\n7\n%\n(\n2\n%)\nFor fixed maturity securities, an increase to the credit spread assumptions would result in a lower fair value measurement.\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value\nThe carrying amount, estimated fair value and the level of the fair value hierarchy of the financial assets and liabilities which are not measured at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are presented in the following tables. The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of short-term debt and long-term debt exclude finance lease obligations. The carrying amounts reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and short-term investments not carried at fair value and certain other assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these items.\nCarrying Amount\nEstimated Fair Value\nDecember 31, 2024\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAssets:\n \n \n \n \n \nOther invested assets, primarily mortgage loans\n$\n1,019\n \n$\n987\n \n$\n987\n \n \nLiabilities:\nShort-term debt\n4\n \n5\n \n5\n \nLong-term debt\n8,936\n \n$\n7,702\n \n966\n \n8,668\n \n \nDecember 31, 2023\n \nAssets:\nOther invested assets, primarily mortgage loans\n$\n1,035\n \n$\n997\n \n$\n997\n \n \nLiabilities:\nShort-term debt\n1,083\n \n$\n546\n \n520\n \n1,066\n \nLong-term debt\n7,915\n \n7,255\n \n385\n \n7,640\n \n118\nTable of Contents\nThe fair values of debt were based on observable market prices when available.

It was determined that the carrying values of \ntwo\n properties in 2023 and \ntwo\n properties in 2022 were impaired. Loews Hotels & Co recorded aggregate impairment charges of $\n12\n million ($\n9\n million after tax) and $\n25\n million ($\n19\n million after tax) for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, which are reported within Operating expenses and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nLoews Hotels & Co utilizes an undiscounted probability-weighted cash flow analysis in testing the recoverability of its long-lived assets for potential impairment. Assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include, among other things, (i) room revenue based on occupancy and average room rates, (ii) other revenue generated by the property, including food and beverage sales and ancillary services, as well as property specific revenue sources, (iii) operating expenses, including management and marketing fees and (iv) expenditures for repairs and refurbishments to maintain the asset’s value. When necessary, scenarios are developed using multiple assumptions of expected future events which Loews Hotels & Co assigns a probability of occurrence based on management’s expectations. This initial analysis results in a projected probability-weighted cash flow of the property, which is compared to the carrying value of the asset to assess recoverability. If the long-lived asset’s carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, Loews Hotels & Co compares the long-lived asset’s carrying value to fair value, estimating the fair value of the asset by discounting future cash flows using market participant assumptions or third-party indicators of fair value such as a recent independent appraisal. These calculations, at times, utilize significant unobservable inputs, including estimating the growth in the asset’s revenue and cost structure and are therefore considered Level 3 fair value measurements.\nNote 7. \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nA summary of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill is as follows:\n \nCNA Financial\nBoardwalk Pipelines\nTotal\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBalance, December 31, 2022\n$\n109\n \n$\n237\n \n$\n346\n \nOther adjustments\n1\n \n1\n \nBalance, December 31, 2023 and 2024\n110\n \n237\n \n347\n \nA summary of the net carrying amount of other intangible assets is as follows:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nGross \nCarrying \nAmount\nAccumulated Amortization\nGross \nCarrying Amount\nAccumulated Amortization\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinite-lived intangible assets:\n \n \n \n \nCustomer relationships\n$\n93\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n93\n \n$\n21\n \nOther\n10\n \n8\n \n11\n \n9\n \nTotal finite-lived intangible assets\n103\n \n32\n \n104\n \n30\n \n \nIndefinite-lived intangible assets\n76\n \n77\n \nTotal other intangible assets\n$\n179\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n181\n \n$\n30\n \nAmortization expense for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 of \n$\n4\n million, \n$\n3\n million, and \n$\n3\n million\n is reported in Operating expenses and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Reserve projections are based primarily on detailed analysis of the facts in each case, experience with similar cases and various historical development patterns. Consideration is given to historical patterns such as claim reserving trends and settlement practices, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims and product mix, economic, medical and social inflation, and public attitudes. All of these factors can affect the estimation of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nEstablishing claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, including claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for catastrophic events that have occurred, is an estimation process. Many factors can ultimately affect the final settlement of a claim and, therefore, the necessary reserve. Changes in the law, results of litigation, medical costs, the cost of repair materials and labor rates can affect ultimate claim costs. In addition, time can be a critical part of reserving determinations since the longer the span between the incidence of a loss and the payment or settlement of the claim, the more variable the ultimate settlement amount can be. Accordingly, short-tail claims, such as property damage claims, tend to be more reasonably estimable than long-tail claims, such as workers’ compensation, general liability and professional liability claims. \nClaim and claim adjustment expense reserves are also maintained for structured settlement obligations.\n \nIn developing the claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for structured settlement obligations, actuaries review mortality experience on an annual basis. \nAdjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in the results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. There can be no assurance that the ultimate cost for insurance losses will not exceed current estimates.\nCNA’s commercial property and casualty insurance operations (“Property & Casualty Operations”) include its Specialty, Commercial and International lines of business. CNA’s Other Insurance Operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations include its long-term care business that is in run-off, certain corporate expenses, including interest on CNA’s corporate debt, and certain property and casualty businesses in run-off, including CNA Re, A&EP, a legacy portfolio of excess workers’ compensation policies and certain legacy mass tort reserves.\nLiability for Unpaid Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses\nThe table below reconciles the net liability for unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses to the amount presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDecember 31\n2024\n(In millions)\n \n \n \nNet liability for unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses:\n \nProperty & Casualty Operations\n$\n18,334\n \nOther Insurance Operations\n (a)\n929\n \nTotal net claim and claim adjustment expenses\n19,263\n \n \nReinsurance receivables:\n (b)\nProperty & Casualty Operations\n3,348\n \nOther Insurance Operations \n(c)\n2,365\n \nTotal reinsurance receivables\n5,713\n \nTotal gross liability for unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses\n$\n24,976\n \n(a)\nOther Insurance Operations amounts are related to unfunded structured settlements arising from short duration contracts.\n(b)\nReinsurance receivables presented are gross of the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and do not include reinsurance receivables related to paid losses.\n(c)\nThe Other Insurance Operations reinsurance receivables are primarily related to A&EP claims covered under the A&EP loss portfolio transfer (“LPT”).\n121\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents a reconciliation between beginning and ending claim and claim adjustment expense reserves.\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nReserves, beginning of year:\n \n \n \nGross\n$\n23,304\n \n$\n22,120\n \n$\n21,269\n \nCeded\n5,141\n \n5,191\n \n4,969\n \nNet reserves, beginning of year\n18,163\n \n16,929\n \n16,300\n \n \nNet incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses:\nProvision for insured events of current year\n6,330\n \n5,667\n \n5,181\n \nIncrease (decrease) in provision for insured events of prior years\n42\n \n48\n \n(\n32\n)\nAmortization of discount\n39\n \n44\n \n44\n \nTotal net incurred\n (a)\n6,411\n \n5,759\n \n5,193\n \n \nNet payments attributable to:\nCurrent year events\n(\n1,093\n)\n(\n922\n)\n(\n821\n)\nPrior year events\n(\n4,096\n)\n(\n3,679\n)\n(\n3,481\n)\nTotal net payments\n(\n5,189\n)\n(\n4,601\n)\n(\n4,302\n)\n \nForeign currency translation adjustment and other\n(\n122\n)\n76\n \n(\n262\n)\n \nNet reserves, end of year\n19,263\n \n18,163\n \n16,929\n \nCeded reserves, end of year\n5,713\n \n5,141\n \n5,191\n \nGross reserves, end of year\n$\n24,976\n \n$\n23,304\n \n$\n22,120\n \n(a)\nTotal net incurred does not agree to Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations due to amounts related to retroactive reinsurance deferred gain accounting and uncollectible reinsurance, which are not reflected in the table above.\nReserving Methodology\nIn developing claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates, CNA’s actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. The data is organized at a reserve group level. Every reserve group is reviewed at least once during the year, but most are reviewed more frequently. The analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, the historical pattern and volatility of the actuarial indications, the sensitivity of the actuarial indications to changes in paid and incurred loss patterns, the consistency of claims handling processes, the consistency of case reserving practices, changes in CNA’s pricing and underwriting, pricing and underwriting trends in the insurance market and legal, judicial, geopolitical, social and economic trends. In addition to the detailed analyses, CNA reviews actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.\nIn developing the loss reserve estimates for property and casualty contracts, CNA generally projects ultimate losses using several common actuarial methods as listed below. CNA reviews the indications from the various methods and applies judgment to select an actuarial point estimate. The carried reserve may differ from the actuarial point estimate as a result of CNA’s consideration of the factors noted above as well as the potential volatility of the projections associated with the specific product being analyzed and other factors affecting claims costs that may not be quantifiable through traditional actuarial analysis. The indicated required reserve is the difference between the selected ultimate loss and the inception-to-date paid losses. The difference between the selected ultimate loss and the case incurred or reported loss is IBNR. IBNR includes a provision for development on known cases as well as a provision for late reported incurred claims. \n122\nTable of Contents\nThe most frequently utilized methods to project ultimate losses include the following:\n•\nPaid development\n: The paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident years with further expected changes in paid losses.\n•\nIncurred development\n: The incurred development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses.\n•\nLoss ratio\n: The loss ratio method multiplies premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident year.\n•\nBornhuetter-Ferguson paid loss\n: The Bornhuetter-Ferguson paid loss method is a combination of the paid development approach and the loss ratio approach. This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method.\n•\nBornhuetter-Ferguson incurred loss\n: The Bornhuetter-Ferguson incurred loss method is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson using premiums and paid loss method except that it uses case incurred losses.\n•\nFrequency times severity\n: The frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimates.\n•\nStochastic modeling\n: The stochastic modeling method produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying assumptions related to the particular product being modeled.\nFor many exposures, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a case, CNA’s actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development method. As claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. For most of CNA’s products, even the incurred losses for accident or policy years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, CNA may not assign much, if any weight to the paid and incurred development methods. CNA may use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods. For short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner, primarily because CNA’s history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, CNA may also use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods for short-tail exposures. For other more complex reserve groups where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, CNA uses additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation\n.\nCNA’s reserving methodologies for mass tort and A&EP are similar as both are based on detailed reviews of large accounts with estimates of ultimate payments based on the facts in each case and CNA’s view of applicable law and coverage litigation.\n123\nTable of Contents\nGross and Net Carried Reserves\nThe following tables present the gross and net carried reserves:\nDecember 31, 2024\nProperty and Casualty Operations\nOther Insurance Operations\nTotal\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGross Case Reserves\n$\n6,589\n \n$\n1,813\n \n$\n8,402\n \nGross IBNR Reserves\n15,093\n \n1,481\n \n16,574\n \n \nTotal Gross Carried Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\n$\n21,682\n \n$\n3,294\n \n$\n24,976\n \n \nNet Case Reserves\n$\n5,573\n \n$\n634\n \n$\n6,207\n \nNet IBNR Reserves\n12,761\n \n295\n \n13,056\n \n \nTotal Net Carried Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\n$\n18,334\n \n$\n929\n \n$\n19,263\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Case Reserves\n$\n5,759\n \n$\n1,979\n \n$\n7,738\n \nGross IBNR Reserves\n14,184\n \n1,382\n \n15,566\n \nTotal Gross Carried Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\n$\n19,943\n \n$\n3,361\n \n$\n23,304\n \nNet Case Reserves\n$\n4,978\n \n$\n685\n \n$\n5,663\n \nNet IBNR Reserves\n12,235\n \n265\n \n12,500\n \nTotal Net Carried Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\n$\n17,213\n \n$\n950\n \n$\n18,163\n \nNet Prior Year Development\nChanges in estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, net of reinsurance, for prior years are defined as net prior year loss reserve development.

Also presented are loss reserve development tables that illustrate the change over time of reserves established for claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses arising from short-duration insurance contracts for certain lines of business within CNA’s Property & Casualty Operations. Not all lines of business are presented based on their context to CNA’s overall loss reserves, calendar year reserve development, or calendar year net earned premiums. Insurance contracts are considered to be short-duration contracts when the contracts are not expected to remain in force for an extended period of time.\nThe Cumulative Net Incurred Claim and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses tables, reading across, show the cumulative net incurred claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses relating to each accident year at the end of the stated calendar year. Changes in the cumulative amount across time are the result of CNA’s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The Cumulative Net Paid Claim and Allocated Claim Adjustment Expenses tables, reading across, show the cumulative amount paid for claims for each accident year as of the end of the stated calendar year. The Net Strengthening or (Releases) of Prior Accident Year Reserves tables, reading across, show the net increase or decrease in the cumulative net incurred accident year claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses during each stated calendar year and indicates whether the reserves for that accident year were strengthened or released.\nThe information in the tables is reported on a net basis after reinsurance and does not include the effects of discounting. The information contained in calendar years 2023 and prior is unaudited. To the extent CNA enters into a commutation, the transaction is reported on a prospective basis. To the extent that CNA enters into a disposition, the effects of the disposition are reported on a retrospective basis by removing the balances associated with it.\nThe amounts reported for the cumulative number of reported claims include direct and assumed open and closed claims by accident year at the claimant level. The number excludes claim counts for claims within a policy deductible where the insured is responsible for payment of losses in the deductible layer. Claim count data for certain assumed reinsurance contracts is unavailable.\nIn the loss reserve development tables, IBNR includes reserves for incurred but not reported losses and expected development on case reserves. CNA does not establish case reserves for allocated loss adjusted expenses (“ALAE”), therefore ALAE reserves are also included in the estimate of IBNR.\n2024\nUnfavorable\n development in other professional liability and management liability was primarily due to higher than expected claim severity and frequency in CNA’s professional errors and omissions (“E&O”) and cyber

Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”) together with several insurance subsidiaries completed a transaction with National Indemnity Company (“NICO”), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which substantially all of their legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO through a loss portfolio transfer (“LPT”). At the effective date of the transaction, approximately $\n1.6\n billion of net A&EP claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves were ceded to NICO under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $\n4.0\n billion. The $\n1.6\n billion of claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves ceded to NICO was net of $\n1.2\n billion of ceded claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves under existing third party reinsurance contracts. The NICO LPT aggregate reinsurance limit also covers credit risk on the existing third party reinsurance related to these liabilities. NICO was paid a reinsurance premium of $\n2.0\n billion and billed third party reinsurance receivables related to A&EP claims with a net book value of $\n215\n million were transferred to NICO, resulting in total consideration of $\n2.2\n billion.\nIn years subsequent to the effective date of the LPT, adverse prior year development on A&EP reserves was recognized resulting in additional amounts ceded under the LPT. As a result, the cumulative amounts ceded under the LPT have exceeded the $\n2.2\n billion consideration paid, resulting in the NICO LPT moving into a gain position, requiring retroactive reinsurance accounting. Under retroactive reinsurance accounting, this gain is deferred and only recognized in earnings in proportion to actual paid recoveries under the LPT. Over the life of the contract, there is no economic impact as long as any additional losses incurred are within the limit of the LPT. In a period in which a change in the estimate of A&EP reserves is recognized that increases or decreases the amounts ceded under the LPT, the proportion of actual paid recoveries to total ceded losses is affected and the change in the deferred gain is recognized in earnings as if the revised estimate of ceded losses was available at the effective date of the LPT. The effect of the deferred retroactive reinsurance benefit is recorded in Insurance claims and policyholders’ benefits on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe following table presents the impact of the Loss Portfolio Transfer on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditional amounts ceded under LPT:\n \n \n \nNet A&EP adverse development before consideration of LPT\n$\n103\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n92\n \nProvision for uncollectible third-party reinsurance on A&EP\n(\n5\n)\nTotal additional amounts ceded under LPT\n103\n \n86\n \n87\n \nRetroactive reinsurance benefit recognized\n(\n95\n)\n(\n94\n)\n(\n91\n)\nPretax impact of deferred retroactive reinsurance\n$\n8\n \n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n(\n4\n)\n134\nTable of Contents\nNet unfavorable prior year development of $\n103\n million, $\n86\n million and $\n92\n million was recognized before consideration of cessions to the LPT for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. The unfavorable development in \n2024,\n 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by higher than anticipated defense and indemnity costs on known direct asbestos and environmental accounts. Additionally, in 2022, \n$\n5\n million \nof the provision for uncollectible third-party reinsurance was released. \nNone\n of the provision for uncollectible third-party reinsurance was released in 2024 or 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the cumulative amounts ceded under the LPT were $\n3.7\n billion and $\n3.6\n billion. The unrecognized deferred retroactive reinsurance benefit was $\n425\n million and $\n417\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and is included within Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNICO established a collateral trust account as security for its obligations under the LPT. The fair value of the collateral trust account was $\n2.3\n billion as of December 31, 2024. In addition, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. guaranteed the payment obligations of NICO up to the aggregate reinsurance limit as well as certain of NICO’s performance obligations under the trust agreement. NICO is responsible for claims handling and billing and collection from third-party reinsurers related to A&EP claims.\nExcess Workers’ Compensation LPT\nOn February 5, 2021, CNA completed a transaction with Cavello Bay Reinsurance Limited (“Cavello”), a subsidiary of Enstar Group Limited, under which certain legacy excess workers’ compensation (“EWC”) liabilities were ceded to Cavello. Under the terms of the transaction, based on reserves in place as of January 1, 2020, approximately $\n690\n million of net EWC claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves were ceded to Cavello under a loss portfolio transfer (“EWC LPT”) with an aggregate limit of $\n1.0\n billion. Cavello was paid a reinsurance premium of $\n697\n million, less claims paid between January 1, 2020 and the closing date of the agreement of $\n64\n million. After transaction costs, a loss of approximately $\n11\n million (after tax and noncontrolling interest) was recognized in Other Insurance Operations in the first quarter of 2021 related to the EWC LPT.\nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the cumulative amount ceded under the EWC LPT was $\n690\n million.\nCavello established a collateral trust as security for its obligations. The fair value of the collateral trust was $\n298\n million as of \nDecember 31, 2024.\nNote 9. \nFuture \nPolicy\n Benefits Reserves\nFuture policy benefits reserves are associated with CNA’s run-off long-term care business, included in Other Insurance Operations, and relate to policyholders that are currently receiving benefits, including claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported, as well as policyholders that are not yet receiving benefits. Future policy benefits reserves are comprised of the LFPB which is reflected as Insurance reserves: Future policy benefits on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nThe determination of Future policy benefits reserves requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected policyholder experience over the remaining life of the policy. Since policies may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are subject to significant estimation risk. As a result of this variability, CNA’s future policy benefits reserves may be subject to material increases if actual experience develops adversely to its expectations. \nAnnually in the third quarter, actuarial analysis is performed on policyholder morbidity, persistency, premium rate increase and expense experience. This analysis, combined with judgment, informs the setting of updated cash flow assumptions used to estimate the LFPB. Actuarial analysis includes predictive modeling, actual to expected experience comparisons and trend analysis. Applicable industry research is also considered. \nThe cash flow assumption updates completed in the third quarter of \n2024\n resulted in a $\n15\n million pretax increase in the LFPB. Included in the assumption updates was a favorable impact from outperformance on premium rate assumptions and an unfavorable impact from higher cost of care inflation. The cash flow assumption updates completed in the third quarter of 2023 resulted in an $\n8\n million pretax increase in the LFPB. Persistency updates were unfavorable due to revisions to lapse rates. Morbidity updates were favorable, driven by claim severity assumption updates, and there was a favorable impact from outperformance on premium rate assumptions.\n135\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes balances and changes in the LFPB.\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nPresent value of future net premiums\nBalance, January 1\n$\n3,710\n \n$\n3,991\n \n$\n4,735\n \nEffect of changes in discount rate\n(\n125\n)\n(\n74\n)\n(\n880\n)\nBalance, January 1, at original locked in discount rate\n3,585\n \n3,917\n \n3,855\n \nEffect of changes in cash flow assumptions (a)\n111\n \n28\n \n352\n \nEffect of actual variances from expected experience (a)\n(\n41\n)\n(\n126\n)\n(\n49\n)\nAdjusted balance, January 1\n3,655\n \n3,819\n \n4,158\n \nInterest accrual\n183\n \n202\n \n216\n \nNet premiums: earned during period\n(\n420\n)\n(\n436\n)\n(\n457\n)\nBalance, end of period at original locked in discount rate\n3,418\n \n3,585\n \n3,917\n \nEffect of changes in discount rate\n7\n \n125\n \n74\n \nBalance, December 31\n$\n3,425\n \n$\n3,710\n \n$\n3,991\n \nPresent value of future benefits & expenses\nBalance, January 1\n$\n17,669\n \n$\n17,471\n \n$\n22,745\n \nEffect of changes in discount rate\n(\n578\n)\n(\n125\n)\n(\n5,942\n)\nBalance, January 1, at original locked in discount rate\n17,091\n \n17,346\n \n16,803\n \nEffect of changes in cash flow assumptions (a)\n126\n \n36\n \n538\n \nEffect of actual variances from expected experience (a)\n69\n \n(\n46\n)\n(\n21\n)\nAdjusted balance, January 1\n17,286\n \n17,336\n \n17,320\n \nInterest accrual\n924\n \n962\n \n979\n \nBenefit & expense payments\n(\n1,187\n)\n(\n1,207\n)\n(\n953\n)\nBalance, end of period at original locked in discount rate\n17,023\n \n17,091\n \n17,346\n \nEffect of changes in discount rate\n(\n440\n)\n578\n \n125\n \nBalance, December 31\n$\n16,583\n \n$\n17,669\n \n$\n17,471\n \nNet LFPB, December 31\n$\n13,158\n \n$\n13,959\n \n$\n13,480\n \n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 the re-measurement loss of $(\n125\n), $(\n88\n) and $(\n214\n) presented parenthetically on the Consolidated Statement of Operations is comprised of the effect of changes in cash flow assumptions and the effect of actual variances from expected experience. \n136\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents earned premiums and interest expense associated with the long-term care business recognized on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\n \n \n \nEarned premiums\n$\n437\n \n$\n451\n \n$\n473\n \nInterest expense\n741\n \n760\n \n763\n \nThe following table presents undiscounted expected future benefit and expense payments and undiscounted expected future gross premiums.\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nExpected future benefit and expense payments\n$\n31,712\n \n$\n32,851\n \nExpected future gross premiums\n5,183\n \n5,414\n \nDiscounted expected future gross premiums at the upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yield discount rate were $\n3.6\n billion and $\n3.8\n billion as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n.\nThe weighted average effective duration of the LFPB calculated using the original locked in discount rate was \n11\n years as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n.  \nThe weighted average interest rates in the table below are calculated based on the rate used to discount all future cash flows.\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nOriginal locked in discount rate\n5.20\n \n%\n5.22\n \n%\nUpper-medium grade fixed income instrument discount rate\n5.51\n \n4.94\n \nFor the years ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and \n2023\n, immediate charges to net income resulting from adverse development in certain cohorts where the NPR exceeded 100% were $\n159\n million and $\n164\n million.

Loews Corporation has entered into a separate tax allocation agreement with CNA, a majority-owned subsidiary in which its ownership exceeds \n80\n%.\n \nThe agreement provides that Loews Corporation will: (i) pay to CNA the amount, if any, by which Loews Corporation’s consolidated federal income tax is reduced by virtue of inclusion of CNA in Loews Corporation’s return or (ii) be paid by CNA an amount, if any, equal to the federal income tax that would have been payable by CNA if it had filed a separate consolidated return.\n \nThe agreement may be canceled by either of the parties upon \nthirty days\n written notice.\nFor 2022 through \n2024\n, the Company participates in the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”), which is a voluntary program for large corporations. Under CAP, the IRS conducts a real-time audit and works contemporaneously with the Company to resolve any issues prior to the filing of the tax return. For 2023, the Company was selected to participate in the phase of CAP reserved for taxpayers whose risk of noncompliance did not support use of IRS resources. The Company believes that participation in CAP should reduce tax-related uncertainties, if any. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the Company believes that any adjustments resulting from audits will not have a material impact on its results of operations, financial position or cash flows. The Company and/or its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in various state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These returns, with few exceptions, are no longer subject to examination by the various taxing authorities before 2020.\n138\nTable of Contents\nThe current and deferred components of income tax expense are as follows:\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIncome tax expense (benefit):\n \n \n \nFederal:\n \n \n \nCurrent\n$\n320\n \n$\n267\n \n$\n241\n \nDeferred\n(\n10\n)\n81\n \n(\n60\n)\nState and city:\nCurrent\n47\n \n20\n \n25\n \nDeferred\n(\n40\n)\n31\n \n15\n \nForeign\n63\n \n52\n \n2\n \nTotal\n$\n380\n \n$\n451\n \n$\n223\n \nThe components of U.S. and foreign income before income tax and a reconciliation between the federal income tax expense at statutory rates and the actual income tax expense is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIncome before income tax:\n \n \n \nU.S.\n$\n1,672\n \n$\n1,798\n \n$\n973\n \nForeign\n202\n \n198\n \n141\n \nTotal\n$\n1,874\n \n$\n1,996\n \n$\n1,114\n \n \nIncome tax expense at statutory rate\n$\n393\n \n$\n419\n \n$\n235\n \nIncrease (decrease) in income tax expense resulting from:\nExempt investment income\n(\n22\n)\n(\n28\n)\n(\n38\n)\nForeign related tax differential\n(\n5\n)\n1\n \n(\n15\n)\nValuation allowance\n1\n \n2\n \n1\n \nState taxes\n8\n \n48\n \n36\n \nOther\n5\n \n9\n \n4\n \nIncome tax expense\n$\n380\n \n$\n451\n \n$\n223\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, income tax expense includes a \n$\n36\n million\n income tax benefit from an adjustment to deferred state income taxes for a rate reduction effective in 2025 resulting from legislation enacted during the fourth quarter of 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, \nno\n deferred taxes are required on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries subject to tax.\n139\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, there were \nno\n unrecognized tax benefits. \nAccrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits and tax refund claims is recognized in Income tax expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Approximately $\n1.5\n billion and \n$\n1.4\n billion \nof revenues recognized during each of the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were included in deferred revenue as of January 1, \n2024\n and 2023.\nContract costs\n – As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had approximately $\n3.5\n billion and \n$\n3.7\n billion\n of costs to obtain contracts with customers related to CNA for amounts paid to dealers and other agents to obtain non-insurance warranty contracts, which are reported as Deferred non-insurance warranty acquisition expenses on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, amortization expense of $\n1.2\n billion\n \nis reported as Non-insurance warranty expense on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. There were \nno\n adjustments to deferred costs recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nPerformance obligations \n– As of December 31, 2024, approximately $\n18.6\n billion of estimated operating revenues is expected to be recognized in the future related to outstanding performance obligations. The balance relates primarily to revenues for transportation and storage services for natural gas and NGLs and certain ethane supply contracts at Boardwalk Pipelines and non-insurance warranty revenue at CNA. Approximately $\n2.9\n billion will be recognized during 2025, $\n2.4\n billion in 2026 and the remainder in following years. The actual timing of recognition may vary due to factors outside of the Company’s control.\nNote 15. \nStatutory Accounting Practices\nCNA’s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in various jurisdictions. These subsidiaries prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the respective jurisdictions’ insurance regulators. Domestic prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in a variety of publications of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. These statutory accounting principles vary in certain respects from GAAP. In converting from statutory accounting principles to GAAP, the more significant adjustments include deferral of policy acquisition costs and the inclusion of net unrealized holding gains or losses in shareholders’ equity relating to certain fixed maturity securities.\nCNA has a prescribed practice as it relates to the accounting under Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 62R, \nProperty and Casualty Reinsurance\n, paragraphs 87 and 88 in conjunction with the 2010 loss portfolio transfer with NICO which is further discussed in Note 8. The prescribed practice allows CNA to aggregate all third party A&EP reinsurance balances administered by NICO in Schedule F and to utilize the LPT as collateral for the underlying third-party reinsurance balances for purposes of calculating the statutory reinsurance penalty. This prescribed practice increased statutory capital and surplus by $\n55\n million and $\n92\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe payment of dividends by CNA’s insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary’s domiciliary jurisdiction is generally limited by formula. Dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective insurance regulator.\nDividends from CCC are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the State of Illinois, the domiciliary state of CCC. Under these laws, ordinary dividends, or dividends that do not require prior approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance (the “Department”) are determined based on the greater of the prior year’s statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus as of the end of the prior year, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding 12 months. Additionally, ordinary dividends may only be paid from earned surplus, which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus. As of December 31, 2024, CCC was in a positive earned surplus position. The maximum allowable dividend CCC could pay during 2025 that would not be subject to the Department’s prior approval is $\n1.1\n billion, less dividends paid during the preceding 12 months measured at that point in time. CCC paid dividends of $\n995\n million in \n2024\n. The actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity, holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company.\n145\nTable of Contents\nCombined statutory capital and surplus and statutory net income for the Combined Continental Casualty Companies are presented in the table below, determined in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by insurance and/or other regulatory authorities.\nStatutory Capital and Surplus\nStatutory Net Income\n \nDecember 31\nYear Ended December 31\n \n2024\n(a)\n2023\n2024(a)(b)\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCombined Continental Casualty Companies\n$\n11,165\n$\n10,946\n$\n713\n$\n1,172\n$\n1,072\n(a)\nInformation derived from the statutory-basis financial statements to be filed with insurance regulators.\n(b)\nIncludes a $\n293\n million after-tax loss from pension settlement transactions. Pension settlement transactions are further discussed in Note 16.\nCNA’s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. RBC is a method developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The formula for determining the amount of RBC specifies various factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity. The adequacy of a company’s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the RBC results, as determined by the formula. Companies below minimum RBC requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action.\nThe statutory capital and surplus presented above for CCC as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was significantly above the level at which any RBC regulatory action would occur. The statutory capital and surplus of CNA’s foreign insurance subsidiaries, which is not significant to the overall statutory capital and surplus, also met or exceeded their respective regulatory and other capital requirements.\nNote 16. \nBenefit Plans\nPension Plans – Several non-contributory defined benefit plans are maintained for eligible employees. For benefits in certain plans, the accrued pension balance is credited with interest based on specified annual interest rates (which are established annually for all participants). The benefits for another plan which covers salaried employees are based on formulas which include, among others, years of service and average pay. The funding policy is to make contributions in accordance with applicable governmental regulatory requirements.\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans – Several postretirement benefit plans cover eligible employees and retirees. Participants generally become eligible after reaching age \n55\n with required years of service. Actual requirements for coverage vary by plan. Benefits for retirees who were covered by bargaining agreements vary by each unit and contract. Benefits for certain retirees are in the form of a health care account.\nBenefits for retirees reaching age \n65\n are generally integrated with Medicare. Other retirees, based on plan provisions, must use Medicare as their primary coverage, with a portion of the unpaid amount being reimbursed by the employer; or are reimbursed for the Medicare Part B premium or have no employer coverage. The benefits provided are basically health and, for certain retirees, life insurance type benefits.\nCertain of these benefit plans are funded and postretirement benefits are accrued during the active service of those employees who would become eligible for such benefits when they retire. December 31 is used as the measurement date for the plans.\n146\nTable of Contents\nWeighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations:\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscount rate\n5.4\n \n%\n5.0\n \n%\n5.2\n \n%\n5.5\n \n%\n5.1\n \n%\n5.4\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate\n4.3\n \n%\n4.5\n \n%\n3.4\n \n%\n \n \nRate of compensation increase\n0.0\n% to \n4.5\n%\n0.0\n% to \n3.5\n%\n0.0\n% to \n4.5\n%\n \n \n \nWeighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost:\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscount rate\n5.0\n \n%\n5.2\n \n%\n3.4\n \n%\n5.1\n \n%\n5.4\n \n%\n2.6\n \n%\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n6.1\n \n%\n6.2\n \n%\n6.3\n \n%\n3.3\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\n2.0\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate\n4.5\n \n%\n3.5\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\n \n \n \nRate of compensation increase\n0.0\n% to \n3.5\n%\n0.0\n% to \n3.8\n%\n0.0\n% to \n3.0\n%\n \n \n \nIn determining the discount rate assumption, current market and liability information is utilized, including a discounted cash flow analysis of the pension and postretirement obligations. In particular, the basis for the discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of plan liabilities. The yield curve was applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans. The yield curves and indices evaluated in the selection of the discount rate are comprised of high quality corporate bonds that are rated AA by an accepted rating agency.\nThe expected long-term rate of return for plan assets is determined based on widely-accepted capital market principles, long-term return analysis for global fixed income and equity markets as well as the active total return oriented portfolio management style. Long-term trends are evaluated relative to market factors such as inflation, interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies, in order to assess the capital market assumptions as applied to the plan. Consideration of diversification needs and rebalancing is maintained.\nAssumed health care cost trend rates:\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n \n \n \nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year\n4.0\n% to \n8.0\n%\n4.0\n% to \n7.0\n%\n4.0\n% to \n6.5\n%\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline (the ultimate trend rate)\n4.0\n% to \n5.5\n%\n4.0\n% to \n5.5\n%\n4.0\n% to \n5.5\n%\nYear that the rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\n2025\n-\n2029\n2024\n-\n2028\n2023\n-\n2026\nDuring 2023, the Parent Company completed the termination of a non-contributory defined benefit plan. In total, the plan paid $\n66\n million for the purchase of group annuity contracts from a third party insurance company to settle its obligations to retirees and certain participants and $\n34\n million in lump sum payments to settle its obligations to certain other participants. The Company recorded a settlement expense of $\n47\n million ($\n37\n million after-tax) to recognize unrealized losses which were previously included in AOCI.\nIn \n2024\n, a subsidiary of CNA, as a sponsor of the CNA Employee Retirement Plan Trust (the “Plan”), paid $\n1\n billion to purchase a nonparticipating single premium group annuity contract with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (the “Insurer”) that transferred to the Insurer $\n1\n billion of the Plan’s defined benefit pension obligations. The group annuity contract covers approximately \n7,600\n Plan participants and beneficiaries (the “Transferred Participants”), representing approximately \n60\n% of the Plan’s obligations. Under the group annuity contract, the Insurer has made an irrevocable commitment, and will be solely responsible, to pay the pension benefits of each Transferred Participant that are due on and after January 1, 2025. The purchase of the group annuity contract was funded directly by assets of the Plan and required no cash or asset contributions from CNA. As a result of the transaction, CNA recognized a \npretax pension settlement charge\n of \n147\nTable of Contents\n$\n367\n million ($\n265\n million after tax and noncontrolling interest). This charge is largely driven by the accelerated recognition of the actuarial pension loss from Accumulated other comprehensive income into Net income, which does not impact Shareholders’ equity. \nIn 2023, the CNA Retirement Plan paid $\n80\n million to settle its obligation to certain retirees through the purchase of a group annuity contract from a third party insurance company, which reduced the plan's projected benefit obligation by $\n86\n million.\n148\nTable of Contents\nNet periodic (benefit) cost components:\nPension Benefits\n \nOther Postretirement Benefits\n \nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nService cost\n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \nInterest cost\n96\n \n110\n \n76\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n1\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n119\n)\n(\n125\n)\n(\n165\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n2\n)\nAmortization of unrecognized net loss\n29\n \n35\n \n32\n \n1\n \n1\n \nSettlements\n372\n \n48\n \n5\n \nNet periodic (benefit) cost\n$\n380\n \n$\n70\n \n$\n(\n50\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\nThe following provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations and plan assets:\nPension Benefits\n \nOther Postretirement Benefits\n \n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChange in benefit obligation:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBenefit obligation at January 1\n$\n1,991\n \n$\n2,220\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n33\n \nService cost\n2\n \n2\n \nInterest cost\n96\n \n110\n \n2\n \n2\n \nPlan participants’ contributions\n2\n \n3\n \nActuarial (gain) loss\n(\n29\n)\n31\n \n6\n \nBenefits paid from plan assets\n(\n149\n)\n(\n181\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n10\n)\nSettlements\n(\n1,052\n)\n(\n194\n)\nForeign exchange\n(\n2\n)\n3\n \nBenefit obligation at December 31\n$\n857\n \n$\n1,991\n \n$\n31\n \n$\n34\n \nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets at January 1\n$\n2,074\n \n$\n2,212\n \n$\n83\n \n$\n81\n \nActual return on plan assets\n120\n \n206\n \n3\n \n5\n \nCompany contributions\n13\n \n22\n \n2\n \n4\n \nPlan participants' contributions\n2\n \n3\n \nBenefits paid from plan assets\n(\n149\n)\n(\n181\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n10\n)\nSettlements\n(\n1,052\n)\n(\n188\n)\nForeign exchange\n(\n2\n)\n3\n \nFair value of plan assets at December 31\n$\n1,004\n \n$\n2,074\n \n$\n83\n \n$\n83\n \nFunded status\n$\n147\n \n$\n83\n \n$\n52\n \n$\n49\n \n149\nTable of Contents\nPension Benefits\n \nOther Postretirement Benefits\n \n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOther assets\n$\n283\n \n$\n229\n \n$\n61\n \n$\n59\n \nOther liabilities\n(\n136\n)\n(\n146\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n10\n)\nNet amount recognized\n$\n147\n \n$\n83\n \n$\n52\n \n$\n49\n \nAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), not yet recognized in net periodic (benefit) cost:\nPrior service credit\n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \nNet actuarial loss\n241\n \n672\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n3\n \nNet amount recognized\n$\n242\n \n$\n673\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n3\n \nInformation for plans with projected and accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:\nProjected benefit obligation\n$\n136\n \n$\n229\n \nAccumulated benefit obligation\n136\n \n143\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n11\n \nFair value of plan assets\n—\n \n83\n \nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n854\n million and $\n2.0\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. Changes for the year ended December 31, 2024 include the impact of the pension settlement transaction discussed above and an actuarial gain of $\n29\n million primarily driven by changes in the discount rate used to determine the benefit obligations. \nA total return approach is employed whereby a mix of equity, limited partnerships and fixed maturity securities are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk and to manage cash flows according to plan requirements. The target allocation of plan assets is \n0\n% to \n40\n% invested in equity securities and limited partnerships, with the remainder primarily invested in fixed maturity securities. The intent of this strategy is to minimize expenses by generating investment returns that exceed the growth of the plan liabilities over the long run. Risk tolerance is established after careful consideration of the plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial conditions. The investment portfolios contain a diversified blend of fixed maturity, equity and short-term securities. Alternative investments, including limited partnerships, are used to enhance risk adjusted long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification. At December 31, 2024, $\n92\n million is committed to fund future capital calls from various third party limited partnership investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related partnerships. Investment risk is monitored through annual liability measurements, periodic asset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews.\n150\nTable of Contents\nThe table below presents the estimated future minimum benefit payments at December 31, 2024.\nExpected future benefit payments\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement Benefits\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n2025\n$\n86\n \n$\n3\n \n2026\n78\n \n3\n \n2027\n81\n \n3\n \n2028\n79\n \n3\n \n2029\n72\n \n2\n \n2030 – 2034\n310\n \n10\n \nIn 2025, it is expected that contributions of approximately $\n16\n million will be made to pension plans and $\n1\n million to postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans.\nPension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below.\nDecember 31, 2024\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPlan assets at fair value:\n \n \n \n \nFixed maturity securities:\n \n \n \n \nCorporate and other bonds\n$\n408\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n413\n \nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions\n6\n \n6\n \nAsset-backed\n113\n \n8\n \n121\n \nTotal fixed maturities\n$\n—\n \n527\n \n13\n \n540\n \nEquity securities\n44\n \n15\n \n59\n \nShort-term investments\n59\n \n59\n \nFixed income mutual funds\n40\n \n40\n \nOther assets\n2\n \n2\n \nTotal plan assets at fair value\n$\n143\n \n$\n544\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n700\n \nPlan assets at net asset value: (a)\nL\nimited partnerships\n304\n \nTotal plan assets\n$\n143\n \n$\n544\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n1,004\n \n151\nTable of Contents\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPlan assets at fair value:\n \n \n \n \nFixed maturity securities:\n \n \n \n \nCorporate and other bonds\n$\n10\n \n$\n1,041\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n1,057\n \nStates, municipalities and political subdivisions\n55\n \n55\n \nAsset-backed\n233\n \n8\n \n241\n \nTotal fixed maturities\n10\n \n1,329\n \n14\n \n1,353\n \nEquity securities\n154\n \n6\n \n160\n \nShort-term investments\n114\n \n114\n \nFixed income mutual funds\n26\n \n26\n \nOther assets\n11\n \n11\n \nTotal plan assets at fair value\n$\n304\n \n$\n1,346\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n1,664\n \nPlan assets at net asset value:\n (a)\nEquity securities\n25\n \nL\nimited partnerships\n385\n \nTotal plan assets\n$\n304\n \n$\n1,346\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n2,074\n \n(a)\nCertain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

The aggregate number of shares of Loews Corporation common stock authorized under the 2016 Loews Plan is \n6,000,000\n shares, plus up to \n3,000,000\n shares that may be forfeited under the prior plan. The maximum number of shares of Loews Corporation common stock with respect to which awards may be granted to any individual in any calendar year is \n500,000\n shares. In accordance with the 2016 Loews Plan and the prior equity plan, Loews Corporation stock-based compensation consists of the following:\nSARs: \nStock appreciation rights (“SARs”) were granted under the prior equity plan. The exercise price per share may not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Generally, SARs vested ratably over a \nfour-year\n period and expire in \nten years\n.\nTime-based Restricted Stock Units:\n Time-based restricted stock units (“RSUs”) are granted under the 2016 Loews Plan and represent the right to receive \none\n share of Loews Corporation common stock for each vested RSU. Generally, RSUs vest \n50\n% on the second anniversary of the grant date and \n50\n% on the third anniversary of the grant date.\nPerformance-based Restricted Stock Units:\n Performance-based RSUs (“PSUs”) are granted under the 2016 Loews Plan and represent the right to receive \none\n share of Loews Corporation common stock for each vested PSU, subject to the achievement of specified performance goals by the Company. Generally, performance-based RSUs vest, if performance goals are satisfied, \n50\n% on the second anniversary of the grant date and \n50\n% on the third anniversary of the grant date.\nIn 2024, Loews Corporation granted an aggregate of \n160,895\n RSUs and PSUs at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $\n73.38\n per unit. \nNo\n RSUs were forfeited during the year. \n192,000\n SARs were outstanding at December 31, 2024 with a weighted average exercise price of $\n38.59\n.\nThe Company recognized compensation expense in connection with stock-based compensation that decreased net income by $\n39\n million, $\n36\n million and $\n34\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. CNA also maintains their own stock-based compensation plan. Such amounts include Loews Corporation’s share of expense related to this plan.\n153\nTable of Contents\nNote 17. \nReinsurance\nCNA cedes insurance to reinsurers to limit its maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk, minimize exposures on larger risks and to exit certain lines of business. The ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of CNA. A credit exposure exists with respect to reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations. A collectability exposure also exists to the extent that the reinsurer disputes the liabilities assumed under reinsurance agreements. Property and casualty reinsurance coverages are tailored to the specific risk characteristics of each product line and CNA’s retained amount varies by type of coverage. Reinsurance contracts are purchased to protect specific lines of business such as property and workers’ compensation. Corporate catastrophe reinsurance is also purchased for property and workers’ compensation exposure. CNA also utilizes facultative reinsurance in certain lines. In addition, CNA assumes reinsurance, primarily through Hardy and as a member of various reinsurance pools and associations.\nThe following table presents the amounts receivable from reinsurers:\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \nReinsurance receivables related to insurance reserves:\n \n \nCeded claim and claim adjustment expenses\n$\n5,713\n \n$\n5,141\n \nReinsurance receivables related to paid losses\n359\n \n293\n \nReinsurance receivables\n6,072\n \n5,434\n \nLess allowance for doubtful accounts\n21\n \n22\n \nReinsurance receivables, net of allowance for doubtful accounts\n$\n6,051\n \n$\n5,412\n \nCNA has established an allowance for doubtful accounts on voluntary reinsurance receivables which relates to both amounts already billed on ceded paid losses as well as ceded reserves that will be billed when losses are paid in the future. The following table summarizes the outstanding amount of voluntary reinsurance receivables, gross of any collateral arrangements, by financial strength rating:\nAs of December 31, 2024\n \n(In millions)\n \n \n \nA- to A++\n$\n4,585\n \nB- to B++\n892\n \nInsolvent\n14\n \nTotal voluntary reinsurance outstanding balance \n(a)\n$\n5,491\n \n(a)\nExpected credit losses for legacy A&EP receivables are ceded to NICO and the reinsurance limit on the LPT has not been exhausted, therefore no allowance is recorded for these receivables and they are excluded from the table above. See Note \n8\n for more information on the LPT. Also excluded are receivables from involuntary pools.\nCNA attempts to mitigate its credit risk related to reinsurance by entering into reinsurance arrangements with reinsurers that have credit ratings above certain levels and by obtaining collateral. On a limited basis, CNA may enter into reinsurance agreements with reinsurers that are not rated, primarily captive reinsurers. Receivables from captive reinsurers are backed by collateral arrangements and comprise the majority of the voluntary reinsurance receivables within the B- to B++ rating distribution in the table above. The primary methods of obtaining collateral are through reinsurance trusts, letters of credit and funds withheld balances. Such collateral, limited by the balance of open recoverables, was approximately $\n3.4\n billion and $\n3.6\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n154\nTable of Contents\nCNA’s largest recoverables from a single reinsurer, including ceded unearned premium reserves as of December 31, 2024 were approximately $\n1.8\n billion from subsidiaries of the Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group, $\n559\n million from Cavello Bay Reinsurance Limited and $\n371\n million from the Swiss Reinsurance Group. These amounts are substantially collateralized or otherwise secured. The recoverable from subsidiaries of the Berkshire Hathaway Insurance Group includes amounts related to third party reinsurance for which NICO has assumed the credit risk under the terms of the loss portfolio transfer as discussed in Note 8.\nThe effects of reinsurance on earned premiums are presented in the following table:\n \n \n \n \nAssumed/ \n \nDirect\nAssumed\nCeded\nNet\nNet % \n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProperty and casualty\n$\n14,629\n \n$\n252\n \n$\n5,107\n \n$\n9,774\n \n2.6\n \n%\nLong-term care\n396\n \n41\n \n437\n9.4\n \nEarned premiums\n$\n15,025\n \n$\n293\n \n$\n5,107\n \n$\n10,211\n \n2.9\n \n%\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n \nProperty and casualty\n$\n13,908\n \n$\n223\n \n$\n5,102\n \n$\n9,029\n \n2.5\n \n%\nLong-term care\n407\n \n44\n \n451\n \n9.8\n \nEarned premiums\n$\n14,315\n \n$\n267\n \n$\n5,102\n \n$\n9,480\n \n2.8\n \n%\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2022\n \nProperty and casualty\n$\n13,097\n \n$\n231\n \n$\n5,134\n \n$\n8,194\n \n2.8\n \n%\nLong-term care\n427\n \n46\n \n473\n \n9.7\n \nEarned premiums\n$\n13,524\n \n$\n277\n \n$\n5,134\n \n$\n8,667\n \n3.2\n \n%\nIncluded in the direct and ceded earned premiums for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are $\n2.7\n billion, $\n2.9\n billion and $\n3.3\n billion related to property business that is \n100\n% reinsured under a significant third party captive program. The third party captives that participate in this program are affiliated with the non-insurance company policyholders, therefore this program provides a means for the policyholders to self-insure this property risk. CNA receives and retains a ceding commission.\nInsurance claims and policyholders’ benefits reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations are net of estimated reinsurance recoveries of $\n3.5\n billion, $\n2.8\n billion and $\n2.6\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, including $\n1.7\n billion, $\n1.5\n billion and $\n1.8\n billion related to the significant third party captive program discussed above.\nLong-term care premiums are from long-duration contracts; property and casualty premiums are from short-duration contracts.\nNote 18. \nLegal Proceedings\nLoews Hotels & Co\nOn February 20, 2024, Jeanette Portillo filed a putative class action against Loews Hotels Holdings Corporation and other defendants in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. On March 1, 2024. Ryan Segal filed a putative class action against Loews Hotels Holdings Corporation and other defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Both suits assert antitrust claims against defendants under the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, and allege that certain hotel chains, including Loews Hotels, engaged in a conspiracy to fix higher prices for hotel rooms. Defendants jointly filed motions to dismiss the complaints in \nPortillo\n and \nSegal\n on May 17, 2024 and June 24, \n155\nTable of Contents\n2024, respectively. Defendants await decisions in both cases. The parties have agreed to stay discovery in both cases pending the courts’ rulings on these motions.\nBoardwalk Pipelines\nOn May 25, 2018, plaintiffs Tsemach Mishal and Paul Berger (on behalf of themselves and the purported class, “Plaintiffs”) initiated a purported class action in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the “Trial Court”) against the following defendants: Boardwalk Pipelines, Boardwalk GP, LP (“General Partner”), Boardwalk GP, LLC and Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (“BPHC”) (together, “Defendants”), regarding the potential exercise by the General Partner of its right to purchase all of the issued and outstanding common units representing limited partnership interests in Boardwalk Pipelines not already owned by the General Partner or its affiliates.\nOn June 25, 2018, Plaintiffs and Defendants entered into a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise and Settlement, subject to the approval of the Trial Court (the “Proposed Settlement”). Under the terms of the Proposed Settlement, the lawsuit would be dismissed, and related claims against the Defendants would be released by the Plaintiffs, if BPHC, the sole member of the General Partner, elected to cause the General Partner to exercise its right to purchase the issued and outstanding common units of Boardwalk Pipelines pursuant to Boardwalk Pipelines’ Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended (“Limited Partnership Agreement”), within a period specified by the Proposed Settlement. On June 29, 2018, the General Partner elected to exercise its right to purchase all of the issued and outstanding common units representing limited partnership interests in Boardwalk Pipelines not already owned by the General Partner or its affiliates pursuant to the Limited Partnership Agreement within the period specified by the Proposed Settlement. The transaction was completed on July 18, 2018.\nOn September 28, 2018, the Trial Court denied approval of the Proposed Settlement. On February 11, 2019, a substitute verified class action complaint was filed in this proceeding, which among other things, added the Parent Company as a Defendant. The Defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was heard by the Trial Court in July of 2019. In October of 2019, the Trial Court ruled on the motion and granted a partial dismissal, with certain aspects of the case proceeding to trial. A trial was held the week of February 22, 2021 and post-trial oral arguments were held on July 14, 2021.\nOn November 12, 2021, the Trial Court issued a ruling in the case. The Trial Court held that the General Partner breached the Limited Partnership Agreement and awarded Plaintiffs approximately $\n690\n million, plus pre-judgment interest (approximately $\n166\n million), post-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees. \nThe Company believed that the Trial Court ruling included factual and legal errors. Therefore, on January 3, 2022, the Defendants appealed the Trial Court’s ruling to the Supreme Court of the State of Delaware (the “Supreme Court”). On January 17, 2022, the Plaintiffs filed a cross-appeal to the Supreme Court contesting the calculation of damages by the Trial Court. Oral arguments were held on September 14, 2022, and on December 19, 2022, the Supreme Court reversed the Trial Court’s ruling and remanded the case to the Trial Court for further proceedings related to claims not decided by the Trial Court’s ruling. Briefing by the parties at the Trial Court on the remanded issues was completed in September 2023. A hearing on the remanded issues was held at the Trial Court in April 2024. In September 2024, the Trial Court ruled in favor of the Defendants on all of the remanded issues. On October 21, 2024, the Plaintiffs appealed the Trial Court’s ruling on the remanded issues to the Supreme Court. Briefing on the appeal is ongoing and is expected to be completed in March 2025.\nThe Company is from time to time party to other litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. While it is difficult to predict the outcome or effect of any litigation, management does not believe that the outcome of any pending litigation, including the matters described above, will materially affect the Company’s results of operations or equity.\n \nNote 19. \nCommitments and Contingencies\nCNA Guarantees\nCNA has provided guarantees, if the primary obligor fails to perform, to holders of structured settlement annuities issued by a previously owned subsidiary. As of December 31, 2024, the potential amount of future payments CNA could be required to pay under these guarantees was approximately $\n1.4\n billion, which will be paid over the lifetime of the annuitants. CNA does not believe any payment is likely under these guarantees, as CNA is the beneficiary of a trust that must be maintained at a level that approximates the discounted reserves for these annuities.\nNote 20. \nSegments\nLoews Corporation has \nfour\n reportable segments comprised of \nthree\n individual consolidated operating subsidiaries, CNA, Boardwalk Pipelines and Loews Hotels & Co; and the Corporate segment. The Corporate segment is comprised of Loews Corporation, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries, and includes the equity method of accounting for Altium \n156\nTable of Contents\nPackaging. Each of the consolidated operating subsidiaries is headed by a chief executive officer who is responsible for the operation of its business and has the duties and authority commensurate with that position.\nCNA’s business is the sale of property and casualty insurance products and services, including surety, primarily through a network of independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters. CNA’s operations also include its long-term care business that is in run-off, certain corporate expenses, including interest on CNA’s corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty businesses in run-off, including CNA Re, A&EP, a legacy portfolio of EWC policies and certain legacy mass tort reserves.  \nBoardwalk Pipelines operates in the midstream portion of the natural gas and NGLs industry, providing transportation and storage for those commodities. It also provides ethane supply and transportation services for industrial customers in Louisiana and Texas. Boardwalk Pipelines owns approximately \n14,315\n miles of natural gas and NGL pipelines and underground storage caverns. Boardwalk Pipelines’ natural gas pipeline systems are located in the Gulf Coast region, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, and its NGL pipelines and storage facilities are located in Louisiana and Texas.\nLoews Hotels & Co operates a chain of \n25\n hotels, \n24\n of which are in the United States and \none\n of which is in Canada. \nEleven\n of these hotels are owned by Loews Hotels & Co, \ntwelve\n are owned by joint ventures in which Loews Hotels & Co has noncontrolling equity interests and \ntwo\n are managed for unaffiliated owners.\nThe Corporate segment consists of investment income from the Parent Company’s cash and investments, Parent Company interest expense and other unallocated Parent Company expenses. \nCorporate also includes\n the equity method of accounting for Altium Packaging\n.\n Purchase accounting adjustments have been pushed down to the appropriate subsidiary.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1.\nIn the following tables certain financial measures are presented to provide information used by management to monitor the Company’s operating performance. The Company’s CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM uses the trend of net income attributable to Loews Corporation from the most recent years to evaluate the performance of the segments and to make decisions regarding the allocation of capital. The following schedules present the reportable segments of the Company and their contribution to the consolidated financial statements. Amounts presented will not necessarily be the same as those in the individual financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries due to adjustments for purchase accounting, income taxes and noncontrolling interests.\n157\nTable of Contents\nStatements of Operations and Total assets by segment are presented in the following tables. \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nCNA Financial\n \nBoardwalk Pipelines\n \nLoews \nHotels & Co\n \nCorporate\nTotal\n \n(In millions)\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRevenues:\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInsurance premiums\n$\n10,211\n \n$\n10,211\n \nNet investment income\n2,497\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n242\n \n2,780\n \nInvestment losses\n(\n81\n)\n \n(\n81\n)\nNon-insurance warranty revenue\n1,609\n \n1,609\n \nOperating revenues and other\n34\n \n2,033\n \n924\n \n \n2,991\n \nTotal\n14,270\n \n2,065\n \n933\n \n242\n \n17,510\n \n \nExpenses:\n \nInsurance claims and policyholders’ benefits (a)\n7,738\n \n7,738\n \nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs\n1,798\n \n1,798\n \nNon-insurance warranty expense\n1,547\n \n1,547\n \nOperating expenses and other (b)\n1,843\n \n1,377\n \n873\n \n77\n \n4,170\n \nEquity method (income) loss\n \n \n(\n86\n)\n28\n \n(\n58\n)\nInterest\n133\n \n183\n \n51\n \n74\n \n441\n \nTotal\n13,059\n \n1,560\n \n838\n \n179\n \n15,636\n \nIncome before income tax\n1,211\n \n505\n \n95\n \n63\n \n1,874\n \nIncome tax expense\n(\n252\n)\n(\n92\n)\n(\n25\n)\n(\n11\n)\n(\n380\n)\nNet income\n959\n \n413\n \n70\n \n52\n \n1,494\n \nAmounts attributable to noncontrolling interests\n(\n80\n)\n(\n80\n)\nNet income attributable to Loews Corporation\n$\n879\n \n$\n413\n \n$\n70\n \n$\n52\n \n$\n1,414\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \nTotal assets\n$\n66,434\n \n$\n9,853\n \n$\n2,498\n \n$\n3,158\n \n$\n81,943\n \n(a)\nSignificant segment expenses within Insurance claims and policyholders' benefits include catastrophe losses of $\n358\n million and unfavorable development of $\n48\n million.
