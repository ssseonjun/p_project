Internal capabilities and acquisitions expand the Company’s ability to unlock the potential of nature and serve customers’ evolving and expanding needs through its offerings of innovative ingredients for all segments. \nSource and Availability of Raw Materials\nA significant majority of the Company’s raw materials are agricultural commodities. In addition, the Company sources specific fruits, vegetables, and nuts for extracts to make flavors and colors. In any single year, the availability and price of these commodities are subject to factors such as changes in weather conditions, plantings, government programs and policies, competition, changes in global demand, changes in standards of living, and global production of similar and competitive crops. The Company’s raw materials are procured from thousands of growers, grain elevators, and wholesale merchants in North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA), Asia, and Australia, pursuant primarily to short-term (less than one year) agreements or on a spot basis. The Company is not dependent upon any particular grower, elevator, or merchant as a source for its raw materials. \n8\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\nSome of the principal crops that ADM sources and processes present specific climate change risks. For example, South American soy and global palm present risks of deforestation due to their proximity to the forest and other high-carbon-value landscapes. In addition, when not managed appropriately, row crops such as corn, soy, wheat, and canola present environmental risks such as water quality impairment, erosion, soil degradation, and GHG emissions. However, these crops also present an opportunity to combat climate change through their ability to sequester carbon in the soil using regenerative agricultural practices. In 2022, ADM launched its “re: generations” program to engage and encourage growers in its supply chain to implement regenerative agriculture practices. In the first year of the program, the Company exceeded its goal to enroll one million acres. The Company has since expanded its regenerative agriculture program to cover more than 2.8 million acres across 18 U.S. states and Canada and has also extended the program into new geographies, launching regenerative agriculture projects in Europe and South America, with a goal to enroll five million acres globally by the end of 2025.\nUnder the stewardship of ADM’s Board of Directors, the Company has established several key social and environmental policies that collectively outline expectations for its employees, business partners and contractors, and the Company as a whole with respect to its sourcing operations. These policies set the standards that govern the Company’s approach to environmental stewardship, employee conduct, and raw material sourcing, among other areas, and outline ADM’s positions on issues of widespread public interest. These standards are included in, among others, the Company’s Code of Conduct; Environment, Health, and Safety Policy; Human Rights Policy; Commitment to Protect Forests, Biodiversity, and Communities; Statement on Genetically Modified Organisms; Statement on Animal Testing; Commitment to Anti-Corruption Compliance; Protocol for Managing Supplier Non-Compliance and ADM Supplier Expectations, all of which are available on the Company’s website (see Item 1, Business - Available Information).\nIn addition to policies, a portion of the Company’s commodity sourcing is conducted using third-party certification programs including ADM Responsible Soy, Biomass Biofuel Sustainability Voluntary Scheme, Round Table for Responsible Soy, International Sustainability and Carbon Certification, Round Table on Sustainable Palm Oil, and U.S. Soy Sustainability Assurance Protocol. These programs have standards that are established to provide transparency on specific sustainability-related criteria. ADM procures canola, soybeans, and palm under these programs.\nTrademarks, Brands, Recipes, and other Intellectual Property\nThe Company owns trademarks, brands, recipes, and other intellectual property including patents, with a net book value of $660 million as of December 31, 2024. More than 90% of these intangibles are in the Nutrition segment which is not materially dependent upon any individual trademark, brand, recipe or other intellectual property.\nSeasonality, Working Capital Needs, and Significant Customers\nThere is a degree of seasonality in the growing cycles, procurement, and transportation of the Company’s principal raw materials: oilseeds, corn, wheat, and other grains. The Company has seasonal financing arrangements with farmers in certain countries around the world. Typically, advances on these financing arrangements occur during the planting season and are repaid at harvest.\n \nThe prices of agricultural commodities, which may fluctuate significantly and change quickly, directly affect the Company’s working capital requirements. Because the Company has a higher portion of its operations in the northern hemisphere, principally North America and Europe, relative to the southern hemisphere, primarily South America, inventory levels typically peak after the northern hemisphere fall harvest and are generally lower during the northern hemisphere summer months. Working capital requirements have historically trended with inventory levels.\nNo material part of the Company’s business is dependent upon a single customer or very few customers. \n9\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\nCompetition\nThe Company has significant competition in the markets in which it operates based principally on price, foreign exchange rates, quality, global supply, and alternative products, some of which are made from different raw materials than those utilized by the Company. Given the commodity-based nature of many of its businesses, the Company, on an ongoing basis, focuses on managing unit costs and improving efficiency through technology improvements, productivity enhancements, and regular evaluation of the Company’s asset portfolio. The Company’s Nutrition business is a vertically integrated business that provides ingredients and solutions for humans, animals, and pets in a highly competitive environment with a variety of companies offering the same products and services. The industry includes ingredient suppliers, contract manufacturers, global fast moving consumer goods companies, and private label brands, as well as smaller companies that specialize in specific niche markets. The Company focuses on staying ahead of the curve in terms of innovation and science-based solutions, building direct-to-consumer sales channels and focusing on consumer needs, expanding into new markets, building strategic partnerships, leveraging data and technology, and building a strong distribution network. \nResearch, Creation, Design, and Development (R&D)\nR&D expense, net of reimbursements of government grants, for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $269 million.\nThe Company is committed to global health and sustainable products, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health. ADM\n’\ns R&D efforts focus on creating science-based products, solutions, and technologies aligned with macro trends in food security, sustainable processes, health, and personalized nutrition. The Company strategically invests in R&D across the entire nutrition value chain by leveraging its access to innovative processes and product optimization. The R&D team is also engaged in BioSolutions initiatives which are a key part of ADM’s commitment to utilize its value chain to reduce its carbon footprint, redesign core products with sustainable alternatives, and explore new markets.\nThe Company is dedicated to transforming aspirations into solutions and brand innovation. The integration of interdisciplinary experts in biology, chemistry, physiology, nutrition, agronomy, and product development provides a competitive edge.\nR&D teams are closely connected to customers and the global markets. Targeted product development leverages innovative ingredients and ADM’s existing portfolio across different segments. R&D innovation centers across three continents enable the rapid transformation of ideas into products. An external network of collaborators, including customers, key opinion leaders, start-ups, and academia amplifies the Company’s scientific excellence.\nThe scope and application of the Company’s technical capabilities reinforce its commitment to global health and sustainable products. High-throughput screening and characterization facilities strengthen ADM’s extensive ingredient database. Formulation platforms enable rapid upscaling or downscaling for cost-effective innovation. Resources dedicated to functional ingredient characterization enhance the Company’s capacity to deliver on the science behind each product.\nADM’s R&D strategy prioritizes fulfilling customer expectations and supporting the Company’s growth. The Company’s future strategy aims to deliver world-class solutions more efficiently and sustainably, and to capitalize on ADM’s full potential. \nEnvironmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)\nThe Company knows that the health of our natural resources is critical to our future, and that its commitment to sustainable practices will result in a stronger ADM and a better world. ADM is committed to being a force for change in developing innovative, sustainable solutions in agriculture, food and nutrition, industrial and consumer products, energy, and packaging materials while pursuing ways to continually improve the Company’s efforts in both protecting the environment and enhancing environmental sustainability. The United Nations Development Programme created the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) blueprint as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. ADM focuses its efforts toward goals that align with its business objectives and allow the Company to make the greatest contribution towards the achievement of the SDGs, specifically Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Decent Work and Economic Growth, Climate Action, and Life On Land.\n10\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\nGovernance \nThe Sustainability and Technology Committee of the Board actively oversees the Company’s objectives, goals, strategies, and activities relating to sustainability. The Sustainability Committee also oversees the Company’s compliance with sustainability laws and regulations, assesses performance relating to industry benchmarks, and assists the Board of Directors in overseeing the Company’s operations as a sustainable organization and responsible corporate citizen in order to enhance shareholder value and protect ADM’s reputation. The Company’s Chief Sustainability Officer, Senior Vice President of Global Operations, and Chief Technology Officer regularly attend committee meetings as management representatives. The Executive Council of ADM, the Company’s highest strategic and operational body, provides close supervision of the Company’s ESG efforts and in-depth review of sustainability issues. Furthermore, regional sustainability teams, along with the corporate sustainability team, support the Chief Sustainability Officer to drive sustainability efforts in the Company’s facilities and supply chains around the world. ADM’s sustainability efforts are also supported by functional expertise throughout the Company such as in Operations and Utilities, Supply Chain and Procurement, Agricultural Services and Oilseeds, and Environmental Health and Safety (EHS).\nStrategy \nThe Company aims to mitigate climate change and protect biodiversity through renewable product and process innovations, supply chain efforts including a commitment to no-deforestation or native vegetation conversion and regenerative agriculture, and a strategic approach to operational excellence with a focus on enhancing the efficiency of ADM’s production plants throughout its global operations.\nADM believes sustainability is critical to its future growth strategy. ADM’s strategic plan of sustainable growth leverages the trends and technologies in sustainability to help the Company grow and create value for its stakeholders. Agricultural Services and Oilseeds is focused on traceability of sourcing and differentiation and working with growers on low carbon agricultural practices and products. Carbohydrate Solutions is focused on decarbonization efforts that increasingly position the segment to offer low-carbon intensity feedstocks for biosolutions and biomaterials, including fuel solutions, to replace petroleum-based products. Nutrition is working with suppliers and customers to identify nature positive solutions that can reduce environmental impact in supply chains. The growth of these projects and businesses will be integral to supporting the objective of helping the planet limit total global warming to the 1.5°C threshold indicated by the United Nations. Additionally, the Company has incorporated the achievement of GHG emission goals and water reuse goals to executive performance measurement to reflect the strategic importance of ESG to its business. \nMoreover, ADM has a large industrial footprint and believes it is important to reduce GHG emissions related to its business activities and the entire agricultural supply chain. The Company continues to use internal and external resources to identify opportunities and take action to reduce its GHG emissions globally to meet its continued commitment to mitigate the effects of climate change.\nADM's Strive 35 plan is an ambitious plan to, by 2035, reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 25% from a 2019 baseline, reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25% from a 2021 baseline, increase use of low-carbon energy sources to 25% of total energy used, reduce absolute water withdrawal by 10%, and achieve a 90% landfill diversion rate. To support the Company’s Strive 35 environmental goals, ADM developed a feasibility study with a leading engineering professional services firm that provides the technology pathway for absolute reduction of GHG emissions by 2035. The Company has also committed to develop a global strategy focused on improving community well-being in priority watersheds, including water-stressed areas, by the end of 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company reduced absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 14.7% and reduced Scope 3 GHG emissions by 7.7%. The Company reduced absolute water withdrawal by 4.2%. The Company realized no increase in low carbon energy usage and achieved 86.1% of its waste diverted from landfill. \nThe Company anticipates spending between $400 million and $500 million on capital projects to achieve the Strive 35 targets. Through December 31, 2024, ADM has spent $297 million on projects in support of these goals since inception, of which $139 million was spent in 2024.\n11\nTable of Contents\nARCHER-DANIELS-MIDLAND COMPANY\nPART I\nThe Company believes that protection of natural resources, habitats, and biodiversity are important to life and to the Company’s business. ADM is committed to eliminating deforestation from all of the Company’s supply chains in 2025. In 2023, after a strategic investigation of the impact of conversion of native habitats in its key supply chains, the Company announced its commitment to eliminate conversion of native habitats in high risk areas in South America for direct suppliers of all commodities in 2025 and indirect suppliers by 2027, with a 2025 cutoff date (a date after which conversion of primary native vegetation renders a given area or production unit non-compliant) for both direct and indirect suppliers. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company spent $64 million specifically to improve equipment, facilities, and programs for pollution control and in light of requirements of various environmental agencies.\nThere have been no material effects upon the earnings and competitive position of the Company resulting from compliance with applicable laws or regulations enacted or adopted relating to the protection of the environment. \nADM’s corporate social investment program, ADM Cares, aligns the Company’s corporate giving with its business strategies and sustainability objectives. Through the program, ADM works to sustain and strengthen its commitment to communities where ADM colleagues work, live, and operate by directing funding to initiatives and organizations driving meaningful social, economic, and environmental progress. The ADM Cares team evaluates potential projects submitted for funding to ensure they meet eligibility criteria, such as initiatives that support food security, health and well-being, and sustainability around the world. \nAdditional Sustainability Disclosures\nProgram updates, scenario analysis, and metrics and targets are available in ADM’s Corporate Sustainability Report which can be accessed through its website at http://www.adm.com.\nReferences to the Company’s website address in this report are provided as a convenience, and information contained on, or available through, the website is not incorporated by reference.
