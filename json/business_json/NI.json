Many of our subsidiary offices in various communities served are occupied under leases. All properties are subject to routine liens for taxes, assessments and undetermined charges (if any) incidental to construction. It is our practice to regularly pay such amounts, as and when due, unless contested in good faith. In general, the electric lines, gas pipelines and related facilities are located on land not owned by us or our subsidiaries, but are covered by necessary consents of various governmental authorities or by appropriate rights obtained from owners of private property. We do not, however, generally have specific easements from the owners of the property adjacent to public highways over, upon or under which our electric lines and gas distribution pipelines are located. At the time each of the principal properties was purchased, a title search was made. In general, no examination of titles as to rights-of-way for electric lines, gas pipelines or related facilities was made, other than examination, in certain cases, to verify the grantors’ ownership and the lien status thereof.\nITEM 3.

There is no preferred stock outstanding as of December 31, 2024. The policy of the Board has been to declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of February, May, August, and November. At its January 23, 2025 meeting, the Board declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.280 per share, payable on February 20, 2025 to holders of record on February 3, 2025.\nAlthough the Board currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on common shares, the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the earnings of NiSource’s subsidiaries, their financial condition, cash requirements, regulatory restrictions, any restrictions in financing agreements and other factors deemed relevant by the Board. There can be no assurance that NiSource will continue to pay such dividends or the amount of such dividends.\nAs of February 5, 2025 NiSource had 14,161 common stockholders of record and 469,939,639 shares outstanding.\nThe graph below compares the cumulative total shareholder return of NiSource’s common stock for the period commencing December 31, 2019 and ending December 31, 2024 with the cumulative total return for the same period of the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Utility indices.  \nThe foregoing performance graph is being furnished as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K solely in accordance with the requirement under Rule 14a-3(b)(9) to furnish stockholders with such information, and therefore, shall not be deemed to be filed or incorporated by reference into any filings by NiSource under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act.\nThe total shareholder return for NiSource common stock and the two indices is calculated from an assumed initial investment of $100 and assumes dividend reinvestment.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers. \nFor the three months ended December 31, 2024, no equity securities that are registered by NiSource Inc. pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were purchased by or on behalf of us or any of our affiliated purchasers.\n33\nTable of Contents\nITEM 6.

Risk Factors, \"Operational Risks,\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further detail.\nThe current replacement plan primarily includes renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar, battery storage, and flexible natural gas resources to be obtained through a combination of NIPSCO ownership and PPAs. NIPSCO has sold, and may in the future sell, renewable energy credits from its renewable generation to third parties to offset customer costs. NIPSCO has executed several PPAs to purchase 100% of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per MWh. Each facility supplying the energy will have an associated nameplate capacity, and payments under the PPAs will not begin until the associated generation facility is constructed by the owner/seller. NIPSCO has also executed several BTAs with developers to construct renewable generation facilities. \nSince 2020, two wind PPA projects and six owned projects (two wind, two solar and two solar plus storage) have been placed into service totaling 2,201 MW of nameplate capacity, including Dunns Bridge II which was placed into service in January 2025. NIPSCO has executed commercial agreements for each of the six remaining identified projects. Fairbanks, Gibson, Green River, Appleseed and Carpenter have received IURC approval. The Templeton Wind project previously received approval as a PPA, however, NIPSCO has contracted with a developer to convert the PPA to a BTA and has provided a notice of intent to file a CPCN with the IURC. In January 2024, the IURC approved increases to the project costs as well as the full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II. In August 2024, the IURC approved full ownership of Gibson and Fairbanks as well as increases to the cost of the Fairbanks project. In October 2024, the IURC approved the CPCN for NIPSCO's planned gas peaking facility to be located at the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe continually evaluate the availability of adequate financing to fund our ongoing business operations, working capital and core safety and infrastructure investment programs. Our financing is sourced through cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and/or equity. External debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of long-term debt, accounts receivable securitization programs and our $1.85 billion commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our committed revolving credit facility with a total availability from third-party lenders of $1.85 billion. Sources of financing activities for the current year are as follows:\n•\nOn December 31, 2023, we consummated the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction in exchange for a capital contribution of $2.16 billion in cash. \n•\nOn January 3, 2024, we applied the proceeds from the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction and repaid in full our $1.0 billion term credit agreement and our $650.0 million term credit agreement. \n•\nOn February 22, 2024, we entered into an ATM equity program that provides an opportunity to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate issuance of $900.0 million through December 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the ATM program had approximately $297.7 million of equity available for issuance.  \n•\nOn March 14, 2024, we completed the issuance and sale of $650.0 million of 5.350% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2034, which resulted in approximately $642.6 million of net proceeds after discount and debt issuance costs.\n•\nOn March 15, 2024, we redeemed all 20,000 outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock for a redemption price of $25,000 per share and all 20,000 outstanding shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock for a redemption price of $0.01 per share or $500.0 million in total. \n•\nOn May 16, 2024, we completed the issuance and sale of $500.0 million of 6.950% fixed-to-fixed reset rate junior subordinated notes maturing in 2054, which resulted in approximately $493.4 million of net proceeds after debt issuance costs. \n•\nOn June 24, 2024, we completed the issuance and sale of $600.0 million of 5.200% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2029, which resulted in approximately $593.7 million of net proceeds after discount and debt issuance costs. \n•\nOn September 9, 2024, we completed the issuance and sale of $500.0 million of 6.375% fixed-to-fixed reset rate junior subordinated notes maturing in 2055, which resulted in approximately $493.6 million of net proceeds after debt issuance costs. \nSee Note 4, \"Noncontrolling Interests,\", Note 6, \"Equity,\" Note 7, \"Short-Term Borrowings,\" and Note 8, \"Long-Term Debt,\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. \nWe believe these sources provide adequate capital to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures in 2025 and beyond. \nOperating Activities\nNet cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $1,781.5 million, a decrease of $153.6 million from 2023. This decrease in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by year over year change in accounts receivable collections and exchange gas receivables due to the impact of lower gas prices, offset by a year over year increase in revenue, net of cost of energy and higher accounts payables due to increased gas purchases.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $3,213.0 million, a decrease of $358.6 million from 2023. Lower current year investing activities were primarily driven by lower milestone payments to renewable generation asset developers for certain of our BTA projects in 2024 compared to 2023.\n48\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7.

Schahfer gas peaker as part of our generation transition and invested $65.7 million in deferred cloud computing costs in 2024. We also made $454.2 million of capital investments in the form of milestone payments to the renewable generation asset developers in 2023 that were recognized in capital expenditures in 2024. \nWe expect to make capital investments totaling approximately $19.4 billion during the 2025-2029 period related to infrastructure modernization, generation transition and customer growth. This forecast incorporates an estimated $1.6 billion of additional investment in renewable generation projects.\n(in billions)\n2024 Actual\n2025 Estimated\n2026 Estimated\n2027 Estimated\n2028 Estimated\n2029 Estimated\nCapital Investments\n$3.3\n$4.0 - 4.3\n$3.4 - 3.7\n$3.6 - 3.9\n$3.7 - 4.0\n$3.8 - 4.1\nRegulatory Capital Programs. \nWe are in the process of upgrading and modernizing our electric system to enhance safety and reliability by addressing aged infrastructure and deploying advanced grid technologies.

These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. As of December 31, 2024, a collateral requirement of approximately $115.5 million would be required in the event of a downgrade below investment grade. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. \nEquity. \nOur authorized capital stock consists of 770,000,000 shares, $0.01 par value, of which 750,000,000 are common stock and 20,000,000 are preferred stock. As of December 31, 2024, 469,822,472 shares of common stock were outstanding. For more information regarding our common and preferred stock, see Note 6, \"Equity,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations, Cash Requirements and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. Our material cash requirements are detailed below. We intend to use funds from the liquidity sources referenced above to meet these cash requirements.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had \n$13,355.7 million\n in long-term debt, of which \n$1,281.2 million\n is current and \n$604.6 million\n in short-term borrowings outstanding. \nDuring 2025 and 2026, we expect to make cash payments of $685.5 million and $631.2 million, \nrespectively, related to pipeline service obligations including demand for gas transportation, gas storage and gas purchases, and \n$140.5 million and $24.9 million\n, respectively, for long lead time items related to plant equipment purchases.\n51\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7.

Plan contributions beyond 2025 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated at this time. In 2025, we expect to make contributions of approximatel\ny $2.3 million to our pension plans and approximately $21.3 million to our postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to\n Note 16, \"Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nWe cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to certain of our long-term obligations classified as \"Total Other Liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe have uncertain income tax positions for which we are unable to predict when the matters will be resolved. Refer to Note 15, \"Income Taxes,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nNIPSCO has executed several PPAs to purchase 100% of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per MWh. NIPSCO has also executed several BTAs with developers to construct renewable generation facilities. See Note 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies - A. Contractual Obligations,\" and \nNote 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies - E. Other Matters,\"\n in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn addition, we, along with certain of our subsidiaries, enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit. \nRefer to Note 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual obligations over the next 5 years and thereafter and our off-balance sheet arrangements.\nMarket Risk Disclosures\nRisk is an inherent part of our businesses. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability. We seek to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. We manage risk through a multi-faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. Our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. These may include, but are not limited to market, operational, financial, compliance and strategic risk types. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, our risk management process, policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.\nCommodity Price Risk\nOur gas and electric subsidiaries have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, our subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps, forwards and options. We do not participate in speculative energy trading activity.\nCommodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rate-regulated subsidiaries is limited and does not bear significant exposure to earnings risk, since our current regulatory mechanisms allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas costs through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. These changes are included in the GCA and FAC regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms. If these mechanisms were to be adjusted or eliminated, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk. For additional information, see \"Results and Discussion of Operations\" in this Management's Discussion.\nOur subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, some of which are reflected in our restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.\nRefer to Note 13, \"Risk Management Activities,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n52\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program, and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates. Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $7.9 million and $18.9 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. We are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future long-term debt issuances. From time to time, we may enter into forward interest rate instruments to lock in long term interest costs and/ or rates. \nCredit Risk\nDue to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities. Our extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Management Policy which establishes guidelines for documenting management approval levels for credit limits, evaluating creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function, which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative-related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit.\nThe financial status of our banking partners is periodically assessed through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies.\nOther Information\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nWe apply certain accounting policies in accordance with GAAP, which require that we make estimates and judgments that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on our operations and Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements:\nBasis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.\n ASC Topic 980, \nRegulated Operations\n, provides that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be billed and collected. Accordingly, certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income may be deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. For additional information, refer to Note 12, \"Regulatory Matters,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future, all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980, \nRegulated Operations\n. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under GAAP for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980, \nRegulated Operations\n, we would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980-20, \nDiscontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting\n. In management’s opinion, our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980, \nRegulated Operations\n for the foreseeable future.\nCertain of the regulatory assets reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, we believe that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. If we determine that the amounts included as regulatory assets are no longer probable of recovery, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.\n53\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nOne of the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance is the regulatory overlay for JV accounting. The application of HLBV to consolidated VIEs generally results in the recognition of profit from the related JVs over a time frame that is different from when the regulatory return is earned. In accordance with the principles of ASC 980, we have recognized a regulatory deferral of certain amounts representing the timing difference between the profit earned from the JVs and the amount included in regulated rates to recover our approved investments in consolidated JVs. For additional information, refer to Note 1, \"Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - S. Noncontrolling Interest,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits.\n We have defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care trend rates, and mortality rates, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into AOCI or a regulatory balance sheet account, depending on the jurisdiction of our entity. These deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets (known in GAAP as the “corridor” method) or when settlement accounting is triggered.\nThe discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. Methods used to develop these assumptions are described below. While a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions, we are ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions.\nThe discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. Our discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an AA-rated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, target asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. For measurement of 2024 net periodic benefit cost, we selected a weighted-average assumption of the expected pre-tax long-term rate of return of 7.02% and 7.06% for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, respectively. For measurement of 2025 net periodic benefit cost, we selected a weighted-average assumption of the expected pre-tax long-term rate of return \no\nf 7.30% and 7.09 % respectively, \nfor\n our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets.\nWe estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate, which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense, based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation, third-party actuarial surveys and general economic conditions. \nWe utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 16, \"Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nTypically, we use the Society of Actuaries’ most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. We adopted Aon's U.S. Endemic Mortality Improvement scale MP-2021, accounting for both the near-term and long-term COVID-19 impacts.\n54\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nThe following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant:\nImpact on December 31, 2024 Projected Benefit Obligation Increase/(Decrease)\nChange in Assumptions \n(in millions)\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement Benefits\n+50 basis points change in discount rate\n$\n(44.9)\n$\n(18.8)\n-50 basis points change in discount rate\n48.2 \n20.4 \nImpact on 2024 Expense Increase/(Decrease)\n(1)\nChange in Assumptions \n(in millions)\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement Benefits\n+50 basis points change in discount rate\n$\n(1.6)\n$\n0.3 \n-50 basis points change in discount rate\n1.6 \n0.4 \n+50 basis points change in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n(6.8)\n(1.2)\n-50 basis points change in expected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n6.8 \n1.2 \n(1)\nBefore labor capitalization and regulatory deferrals.\n \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\n We have six goodwill reporting units, comprised of the six state operating companies within both the Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations reportable segments. Our goodwill assets at December 31, 2024 were $1,485.9 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000.\nAs required by GAAP, we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. Our annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was performed on May 1, 2024. A quantitative (\"step 1\") test was completed on May 1, 2024 for all reporting units. Consistent with our historical impairment testing of goodwill, fair value of the reporting units was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. These approaches require significant judgments including appropriate long-term growth rates and discount rates for the income approach and appropriate multiples of earnings for peer companies and control premiums for the market approach. The discount rates were derived using peer company data compiled with the assistance of a third party valuation services firm. The discount rates used are subject to change based on changes in tax rates at both the state and federal level, debt and equity ratios at each reporting unit, U.S. Treasury interest rates and general economic conditions. The long-term growth rate was derived by evaluating historic growth rates, new business and investment opportunities beyond the near term horizon. The long-term growth rate is subject to change depending on inflationary impacts to the U.S. economy and the individual business environments in which each reporting unit operates. The Step 1 analysis performed indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeds their carrying value. As a result, no impairment charges were recorded. See Note 10, \"Goodwill,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our 2024 analyses and assumptions.\nUnbilled Revenue.\n We record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon historical usage, customer rates and weather. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded $408.1 million of customer accounts receivable for unbilled revenue. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Refer to Note 3, \"Revenue Recognition,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our significant judgments and estimates related to unbilled revenue recognition.\nIncome Taxes. \nThe consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require use of estimates and significant management judgement. Although we believe that current estimates for deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons, including reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. \n55\nTable of Contents\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nUltimate resolution or clarification of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.\nWe account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We evaluate each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $21.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits. Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations.\nOn a quarterly basis, we evaluate our deferred tax assets by considering current and historical financial results, expectations for future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented, if necessary, to realize deferred tax assets. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance when we conclude it is more likely than not that all, or a portion, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized in future periods. Significant judgment is required to determine the amount of tax benefits expected to be realized. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had established $6.4 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of valuation allowances (net of federal benefit) related to certain state net operating loss carryforwards.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 12, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. \nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRegulatory Matters - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Notes 1, 9, and 12 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s primary subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in six states. These rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged to and collected from customers. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are later recognized in income as the related amounts are included in customer rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.\n58\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nThe Company’s subsidiaries’ rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the subsidiaries’ costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the subsidiaries’ investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The respective commission’s regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital. Decisions to be made by the commission in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the commission will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation, specifically certain regulatory assets and liabilities at the Company’s Northern Indiana Public Service Company LLC and Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. subsidiaries, as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about certain account balances and the significant degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the likelihood of recovery of incurred costs in current or future rates due in part to uncertainty related to future decisions by the rate regulators. This required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities and a significant degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s conclusions. \nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the rate regulators, specifically the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC) and the Public Utility Commission of Ohio (PUCO), included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over (1) the evaluation of the likelihood of (a) the recovery of costs deferred as regulatory assets in future periods, and (b) regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates; and (2) the evaluation of Hypothetical Liquidation Book Value (HLBV) accounting for the company’s Renewable Joint Ventures and its impact on the Company’s regulatory liability.\n•\nWe evaluated Northern Indiana Public Service Company LLC and Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc.’s disclosures related to the financial statement impacts of rate regulation.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the IURC and the PUCO, including regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated this external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness, including the implementation of new rate orders at Northern Indiana Public Service Company LLC’s gas business.\n•\nWe inspected minutes of the boards of directors for discussions of changes in legal, regulatory, or business factors which could impact management’s conclusions with respect to the financial statement impacts of rate regulation.\n•\nFor the Northern Indiana Public Service Company LLC electric base rate case proceeding that is in-process, we inspected the Company’s and intervenors’ filings with the commission that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions related to recoverability of recorded assets. \n•\nWe inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned with an emphasis on the generation strategy related to Northern Indiana Public Service Company LLC’s R.M. Schahfer and Michigan City Generating Stations. We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the IURC to identify evidence that may contradict management’s assertion regarding probability of an abandonment.\n59\nTable of Contents\nITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\n1.     Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nA.           \nCompany Structure and Principles of Consolidation.\n We are an energy holding company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Merrillville, Indiana. Our subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving approximately \n3.8\n million customers in six states. We generate substantially all of our operating income through these rate-regulated businesses. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of us, our majority-owned subsidiaries, and VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions.\nB.       \nUse of Estimates. \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nC.           \nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash.\n We consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We report amounts deposited in brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash. In addition, we have amounts deposited in trusts to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property, liability, workers compensation, and long-term disability insurance, and holdbacks related to certain joint venture development agreements which is classified as restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and disclosed with cash and cash equivalents on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.\nD.           \nAccounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenue.\n Accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from their last cycle billing date through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates, weather and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending in large part on weather impacts and price volatility. Our accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include unbilled revenue, less reserves. The reserve for uncollectible receivables is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable. We determined the reserve based on historical collection experience, current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Account balances are charged against the allowance when it is anticipated the receivable will not be recovered. Refer to Note 3, \"Revenue Recognition,\" for additional information on customer-related accounts receivable, including amounts related to unbilled revenues.\n \nE.       \nInvestments in Debt Securities.\n Our investments in debt securities are carried at fair value and are designated as available-for-sale. These investments are included within “Available-for-sale debt securities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. At each reporting period these investments are qualitatively and quantitatively assessed to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. Impairments related to credit loss are recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Impairments that are not related to credit losses are included in other comprehensive income and are reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Income. No material impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. Refer to Note 14, \"Fair Value,\" for additional information.\nF.           \nBasis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.\n Rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be billed and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination that would normally be reflected in income for non-regulated entities are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are later recognized in income as the related amounts are included in customer rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.\nWe continually evaluate whether or not our operations are within the scope of ASC 980 and rate regulations. As part of that analysis, we evaluate probability of recovery for our regulatory assets. In management’s opinion, our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to regulatory accounting for the foreseeable future. Refer to Note 12, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nG.           \nPlant and Other Property and Related Depreciation and Maintenance.\n Property, plant and equipment (principally utility plant) is stated at cost. Our rate-regulated subsidiaries record depreciation using composite rates on a straight-line basis over the remaining service lives of the electric, gas and common properties, as approved by the appropriate regulators.\n68\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nNon-utility property, consisting of renewable generation assets owned by JVs of which we are the primary beneficiary and certain retired regulatory assets described below, is generally depreciated over the life of the associated assets. Refer to Note 9, \"Property, Plant and Equipment,\" for additional information related to depreciation expense.\nFor rate-regulated companies where provided for in rates, AFUDC is capitalized on all classes of property except organization costs, land, autos, office equipment, tools and other general property purchases. The allowance is applied to construction costs for that period of time between the date of the expenditure and the date on which such project is placed in service. Our consolidated pre-tax rate for AFUDC was \n4.8\n% in 2024, \n3.9\n% in 2023 and \n3.4\n% in 2022. \nGenerally, our subsidiaries follow the practice of charging maintenance and repairs, including the cost of removal of minor items of property, to expense as incurred. When our subsidiaries retire regulated property, plant and equipment, original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable a regulated asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the corresponding accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset. If the asset is still in operation, the gross amounts are classified as \"Non-Utility and Other \" as described in Note 9, \"Property, Plant and Equipment.\" If the asset is no longer operating but still subject to recovery, the net amount is classified in \"Regulatory assets\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If we are able to recover a full return of and on investment, the carrying value of the asset is based on historical cost. If we are not able to recover a full return on investment, a loss on impairment is recognized to the extent the net book value of the asset exceeds the present value of future revenues discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.\nExternal and internal costs associated with on-premise computer software developed for internal use are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs commences upon the completion of the preliminary stage of each project. Once the installed software is ready for its intended use, such capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis generally over a period of five years. External and internal up-front implementation costs associated with cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the associated internal-use software capitalized to plant if the we have a contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty and it is feasible for us to either run the software on our own hardware or contract with another party unrelated to the vendor to host the software. Once the installed software is ready for its intended use, such deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis to \"Operation and maintenance,\" over the minimum term of the contract plus contractually-provided renewal periods that are reasonably expected to be exercised.\n \nH.           \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\n Substantially all of our goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000. We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of May 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Fair value of our reporting units is determined using a combination of income and market approaches. See Note 10, \"Goodwill,\" for additional information.\nI.         \nAccounts Receivable Transfer Programs.\n Certain of our subsidiaries have agreements with third parties to transfer certain accounts receivable without recourse. These transfers of accounts receivable are accounted for as secured borrowings. The entire gross receivables balance remains on the December 31, 2024 and 2023 Consolidated Balance Sheets. When amounts are securitized, the short-term debt is recorded in the amount of proceeds received from the transferees involved in the transactions. Refer to Note 7, \"Short-Term Borrowings,\" for further information.\nJ.           \nGas Cost and Fuel Adjustment Clause.\n Our regulated subsidiaries defer most differences between gas and fuel purchase costs and the recovery of such costs in revenues and adjust future billings for such deferrals on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff provisions. These deferred balances are recorded as \"Regulatory assets\" or \"Regulatory liabilities,\" as appropriate, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 12, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nK.           \nGas Storage and Other Inventories.\n Both the LIFO inventory methodology and the weighted average cost methodology are used to value natural gas in storage, as approved by regulators for all of our regulated subsidiaries. Inventory valued using LIFO was $\n43.8\n million and $\n43.9\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Based on the average cost of gas using the LIFO method, the estimated replacement cost of gas in storage was less than the stated LIFO cost by $\n12.8\n million at December 31, 2024 and was less than the stated LIFO cost by $\n22.5\n million at December 31, 2023. As all LIFO inventory costs are collected from customers through our rate-regulated subsidiaries, no inventory impairment has been recorded. Gas inventory valued using the weighted average cost methodology was $\n135.8\n million at December 31, 2024 and $\n222.0\n million at December 31, 2023.\n69\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nElectric production fuel is valued using the weighted average cost inventory methodology, as approved by NIPSCO's regulator. \nMaterials and supplies are valued using the weighted average cost inventory methodology. Materials and supplies are charged to expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment when issued.\nL.           \nAccounting for Exchange and Balancing Arrangements of Natural Gas.\n Our Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations segment enters into balancing and exchange arrangements of natural gas as part of its operations and off-system sales programs. We record a receivable or payable for any of our respective cumulative gas imbalances, as well as for any gas inventory borrowed or lent under an exchange agreement. Exchange gas is valued based on individual regulatory jurisdiction requirements (for example, historical spot rate, spot at the beginning of the month). These receivables and payables are recorded as “Exchange gas receivable” or “Exchange gas payable” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate.\n \nM.        \nAccounting for Risk Management Activities. \nWe account for our derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with ASC 815. We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, unless such contracts are exempted as a normal purchase normal sale under the provisions of the standard. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation. \nWe do not offset the fair value amounts recognized for any of our derivative instruments against the fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or obligation to return cash collateral for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. See Note 13, \"Risk Management Activities,\" for additional information.\nN.       \nIncome Taxes and Investment Tax Credits. \nUnder the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Investment tax credits associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized as a reduction to income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties. Furthermore, the tax basis of the asset is reduced by 50% of the ITCs received, resulting in a net deferred tax asset.\nTo the extent certain deferred income taxes of the regulated companies are recoverable or payable through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been established. Regulatory assets for income taxes are primarily attributable to property-related tax timing differences for which deferred taxes had not been provided in the past when regulators did not recognize such taxes as costs in the rate-making process. Regulatory liabilities for income taxes are primarily attributable to the regulated companies’ obligation to refund to ratepayers deferred income taxes provided at rates higher than the current Federal income tax rate. Such property-related amounts are credited to ratepayers using either the average rate assumption method or the reverse South Georgia method. Non property-related amounts are credited to ratepayers consistent with state utility commission direction. \nPursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and relevant state taxing authorities, we and our subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns for federal and certain state jurisdictions. We and our subsidiaries are parties to a tax sharing agreement. Income taxes recorded by each party represent amounts that would be owed had the party been separately subject to tax.\n \nO.           \nPension Remeasurement. \nWe utilize a third-party actuary for the purpose of performing actuarial valuations of our defined benefit plans. Annually, as of December 31, we perform a remeasurement for our defined benefit plans. Quarterly, we monitor for significant events, and if a significant event is identified, we perform a qualitative and quantitative assessment to determine if the resulting remeasurement would materially impact the NiSource financial statements. If material, an interim remeasurement is performed. See Note 16, \"Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits,\" for additional information.\nP.           \nEnvironmental Expenditures.\n We accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations, including expenditures related to asset retirement obligations and cost of removal, when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made. The estimated future expenditures are based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and estimated site-specific costs where assumptions may be made about the nature and extent of site contamination, the extent of cleanup efforts, costs of alternative cleanup methods and other variables. The liability is adjusted as further information is discovered or circumstances change. The accruals for estimated environmental expenditures are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Other accruals” for short-term portions of these liabilities and “Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits” for the respective long-term portions of these liabilities. Rate-regulated subsidiaries applying regulatory accounting establish regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance \n70\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nSheets to the extent that future recovery of environmental remediation costs is probable through the regulatory process. Refer to Note 11, \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" and Note 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies,\" for further information.\nQ.        \nExcise Taxes.\n As an agent for some state and local governments, we invoice and collect certain excise taxes levied by state and local governments on customers and record these amounts as liabilities payable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction. Such balances are presented within \"Other accruals\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These types of taxes collected from customers, comprised largely of sales taxes, are presented on a net basis affecting neither revenues nor cost of sales. We account for excise taxes for which we are liable by recording a liability for the expected tax with a corresponding charge to “Other taxes” expense on the Statements of Consolidated Income.\n \nR.        \nAccrued Insurance Liabilities.\n We accrue for insurance costs related to workers compensation, automobile, property, general and employment practices liabilities based on the most probable value of each claim. In general, claim values are determined by professional, licensed loss adjusters who consider the facts of the claim, anticipated indemnification and legal expenses, and respective state rules. Claims are reviewed by us at least quarterly and an adjustment is made to the accrual based on the most current information.\n \nS.     Noncontrolling Interest\n.\n We maintain a controlling financial interest in certain of our less than wholly owned subsidiaries. We consolidate these subsidiaries as either voting interest entities or VIEs and present the third-party investors' portion of our net income (loss), net assets and comprehensive income (loss) as noncontrolling interest. Noncontrolling interest is included as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. \nOn December 31, 2023, the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction closed and a \n19.9\n% equity interest in NIPSCO Holdings II, the sole owner of NIPSCO, was issued to an affiliate of Blackstone. NIPSCO Holdings II does not meet the criteria of a VIE and instead is consolidated under the voting interest model in accordance with ASC 810 as we maintain control through a majority interest in NIPSCO Holdings II. Refer to Note 4, \"Noncontrolling Interests,\" for further discussion on the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction.\nWe fund a portion of our renewable generation assets through JVs with tax equity partners. We consolidate these JVs in accordance with ASC 810 as they are VIEs in which we hold a variable interest, and we control decisions that are significant to the JVs' ongoing operations and economic results (i.e., we are the primary beneficiary).\nThese JVs are subject to profit sharing arrangements in which the allocation of the JVs' cash distributions and tax benefits to members is based on factors other than members' relative ownership percentages. As such, we utilize the HLBV method to allocate proceeds to each partner at the balance sheet date based on the liquidation provisions of the related JV's operating agreement and adjust the amount of the VIE's net income attributable to us and the noncontrolling tax equity member during the period.\nIn each reporting period, the application of HLBV to our consolidated VIEs results in a difference between the amount of profit from the consolidated JVs and the amount included in regulated rates. As discussed above in \"F. Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries,\" we are subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC 980. In accordance with these principles, we recognize a regulatory liability or asset for amounts representing the timing difference between the profit earned from the JVs and the amount included in regulated rates to recover our approved investments in consolidated JVs. The amounts recorded in income will ultimately reflect the amount allowed in regulated rates to recover our investments over the useful life of the projects. The offset to the regulatory liability or asset associated with our renewable investments included in regulated rates is recorded in \"Depreciation expense\" on the Statements of Consolidated Income.\n2.     Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \nIncome Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40)\n. This pronouncement requires disaggregated disclosure of income statement expenses for public business entities. The ASU requires disclosure in tabular format of disaggregation of relevant expense captions presented on the income statement by certain natural expense categories with certain related qualitative disclosures within the notes to the financial statements. The ASU does not change the expense captions an entity presents on the income \n71\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nstatement. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. We are currently evaluating the impacts this amendment will have on our required disclosures.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n. This pronouncement enhances required income tax disclosures. The pronouncement will require disclosure of specific categories and reconciling items included in the rate reconciliation, disaggregation between federal, state and local income taxes paid, and disclosure of income taxes paid by jurisdictions over a certain threshold. Additionally, the pronouncement eliminates certain required disclosures related to unrecognized tax benefits. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied on a prospective basis with retrospective application permitted. We will implement and provide the required disclosures beginning in 2025. \nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n. This pronouncement enhances annual and interim disclosure requirements over reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. Specifically, the pronouncement requires disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\") and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, disclosure of an amount for other segment items representing the difference between segment revenue and segment expenses already disclosed, disclosure of all required annual disclosures for interim periods and disclosure of title and position of the CODM and how the CODM uses reported measures. The pronouncement also allows for more than one measure of segment profit if the CODM uses more than one measure in assessing segment performance. This pronouncement is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The Company adopted this pronouncement as of December 31, 2024 with retrospective application and updated its disclosures to include significant expenses regularly provided to the CODM, the CODM's title and how the CODM utilizes reported measures. See Note 21, \"Business Segment Information\" for further discussion.\n3.     Revenue Recognition\nCustomer Revenues.\n Substantially all of our revenues are tariff-based. Under ASC 606, the recipients of our utility service meet the definition of a customer, while the operating company tariffs represent an agreement that meets the definition of a contract, which creates enforceable rights and obligations. Customers in certain of our jurisdictions participate in programs that allow for a fixed payment each month regardless of usage. Payments received that exceed the value of gas or electricity actually delivered are recorded as a liability and presented in \"Customer deposits and credits\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts in this account are reduced and revenue is recorded when customer usage exceeds payments received.\nWe have identified our performance obligations created under tariff-based sales as 1) the commodity (natural gas or electricity, which includes generation and capacity) and 2) delivery. These commodities are sold and / or delivered to and generally consumed by customers simultaneously, leading to satisfaction of our performance obligations over time as gas or electricity is delivered to customers. Due to the at-will nature of utility customers, performance obligations are limited to the services requested and received to date. Once complete, we generally maintain no additional performance obligations.\nTransaction prices for each performance obligation are generally prescribed by each operating company’s respective tariff. Rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel and purchased power costs and cost of natural gas. Revenues are adjusted for differences between actual costs, subject to reconciliation, and the amounts billed in current rates. Under or over recovered revenues related to these cost recovery mechanisms are included in \"Regulatory assets\" or \"Regulatory liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recovered from or returned to customers through adjustments to tariff rates. As we provide and deliver service to customers, revenue is recognized based on the transaction price allocated to each performance obligation. Distribution revenues are generally considered daily or \"at-will\" contracts as customers may cancel their service at any time (subject to notification requirements), and revenue generally represents the amount we are entitled to bill customers.\nIn addition to tariff-based sales, our gas distribution in both our Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations segments enters into balancing and exchange arrangements of natural gas as part of our operations and off-system sales programs. Performance obligations for these types of sales include transportation and storage of natural gas and can be satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time, depending on the specific transaction. For those transactions that span a period of time, we record a \n72\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nreceivable or payable for any cumulative gas imbalances, as well as for any gas inventory borrowed or lent under a gas distribution operations exchange agreement.\nRevenue Disaggregation and Reconciliation.\n We disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers based upon reportable segment, as well as by customer class. As of January 1, 2024, we have changed our reportable segments from Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations to Columbia Operations and NIPSCO Operations. Our historical segment disclosures have been recast to be consistent with the current presentation. For additional information see Note 21, \"Business Segment Information\". \nThe Columbia Operations segment provides regulated natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, and Maryland. The NIPSCO Operations segment provides regulated gas and electric service in northern Indiana for residential, commercial and industrial customers.\nOther Revenues.\n As permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, regulated utilities have the ability to earn certain types of revenue that are outside the scope of ASC 606. These revenues primarily represent revenue earned under alternative revenue programs. Alternative revenue programs represent regulator-approved mechanisms that allow for the adjustment of billings and revenue for certain approved programs. We maintain a variety of these programs, including demand side management initiatives that recover costs associated with the implementation of energy efficiency programs, as well as normalization programs that adjust revenues for the effects of weather or other external factors. Additionally, we maintain certain programs with future test periods that operate similarly to FERC formula rate programs and allow for recovery of costs incurred to replace aging infrastructure. When the criteria to recognize alternative revenue have been met, we establish a regulatory asset and present revenue from alternative revenue programs on the Statements of Consolidated Income as “Other revenues”. When amounts previously recognized under alternative revenue accounting guidance are billed, we reduce the regulatory asset and record a customer account receivable.\nThe tables below reconcile revenue disaggregation by customer class to segment revenue, as well as to revenues reflected on the Statements of Consolidated Income:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024 (in millions)\nColumbia Operations\nNIPSCO Operations\nCorporate and Other\nTotal\nGas Distribution\nResidential\n$\n1,833.8\n \n$\n531.4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,365.2\n \nCommercial\n580.3\n \n199.2\n \n—\n \n779.5\n \nIndustrial\n144.2\n \n79.0\n \n—\n \n223.2\n \nOff-system\n42.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n42.6\n \nWholesale\n1.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1.2\n \nMiscellaneous\n(1)\n26.3\n \n15.4\n \n—\n \n41.7\n \nSubtotal\n$\n2,628.4\n \n$\n825.0\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,453.4\n \nElectric Generation and Power Delivery \nResidential\n$\n— \n$\n649.9\n \n$\n— \n$\n649.9\n \nCommercial\n— \n620.4\n \n— \n620.4\n \nIndustrial\n— \n499.1\n \n— \n499.1\n \nWholesale\n— \n38.3\n \n— \n38.3\n \nPublic Authority\n— \n8.1\n \n— \n8.1\n \nMiscellaneous\n(1)\n— \n13.7\n \n— \n13.7\n \nSubtotal\n$\n— \n$\n1,829.5\n \n$\n— \n$\n1,829.5\n \nTotal Customer Revenues\n(2)\n2,628.4\n \n2,654.5\n \n—\n \n5,282.9\n \nOther Revenues\n(3)\n74.8\n \n96.5\n \n0.9\n \n172.2\n \nTotal Operating Revenues\n$\n2,703.2\n \n$\n2,751.0\n \n$\n0.9\n \n$\n5,455.1\n \n(1)\nAmounts included in Columbia Operations are primarily related to earnings sharing mechanisms and late fees.

Amounts included in Corporate and Other primarily related to the Transition Services Agreement entered into in connection with the sale of the Massachusetts Business.\nCustomer Accounts Receivable.\n Accounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts, as well as certain amounts that are not related to customer revenues. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from the date of their last cycle billing through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates, and weather. A significant portion of our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. During the heating season, primarily from November through March, revenues and receivables from gas sales are more significant than in other months. \nThe opening and closing balances of customer receivables for the year ended December 31, 2024, are presented in the table below. We had no significant contract assets or liabilities during the period. Additionally, we have not incurred any significant costs to obtain or fulfill contracts.\n(in millions)\nCustomer Accounts Receivable, Billed (less reserve)\nCustomer Accounts Receivable, Unbilled (less reserve)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n479.4\n \n$\n337.6\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n525.1\n \n408.1\n \nUtility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. We expect that substantially all customer accounts receivable will be collected following customer billing, as this revenue consists primarily of periodic, tariff-based billings for service and usage. We maintain common utility credit risk mitigation practices, including requiring deposits and actively pursuing collection of past due amounts. Our regulated operations also utilize certain regulatory mechanisms that facilitate recovery of bad debt costs within tariff-based rates, which provides further evidence of collectibility. It is probable that substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled from customers will be collected upon satisfaction of performance obligations.\n \n75\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nAllowance for Credit Losses.\n To evaluate for expected credit losses, customer account receivables are pooled based on similar risk characteristics, such as customer type, geography, payment terms, and related macro-economic risks. Expected credit losses are established using a model that considers historical collections experience, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Internal and external inputs are used in our credit model including, but not limited to, energy consumption trends, revenue projections, actual charge-offs data, recoveries data, shut-offs, customer delinquencies, final bill data, and inflation. We continuously evaluate available information relevant to assessing collectability of current and future receivables. We evaluate creditworthiness of specific customers periodically or following changes in facts and circumstances. When we become aware of a specific commercial or industrial customer's inability to pay, an allowance for expected credit losses is recorded for the relevant amount. We also monitor other circumstances that could affect our overall expected credit losses including, but not limited to, creditworthiness of overall population in service territories, adverse conditions impacting an industry sector, and current economic conditions.\nAt each reporting period, we record expected credit losses to an allowance for credit losses account. When deemed to be uncollectible, customer accounts are written-off. \nA rollforward of our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, are presented in the tables below:\n(in millions)\nColumbia Operations\nNIPSCO Operations\nCorporate and Other\nTotal\nBalance as of January 1, 2024\n$\n10.2\n \n$\n11.9\n \n$\n0.8\n \n$\n22.9\n \nCurrent period provisions\n26.7\n \n12.1\n \n—\n \n38.8\n \nWrite-offs charged against allowance\n(\n43.9\n)\n(\n11.0\n)\n(\n0.8\n)\n(\n55.7\n)\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off\n16.8\n \n0.9\n \n—\n \n17.7\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n9.8\n \n$\n13.9\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n23.7\n \n(in millions)\nColumbia Operations\nNIPSCO Operations\nCorporate and Other\nTotal\nBalance as of January 1, 2023\n$\n11.1\n \n$\n12.0\n \n$\n0.8\n \n$\n23.9\n \nCurrent period provisions\n28.3\n \n11.5\n \n—\n \n39.8\n \nWrite-offs charged against allowance\n(\n49.2\n)\n(\n12.4\n)\n—\n \n(\n61.6\n)\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off\n20.0\n \n0.8\n \n—\n \n20.8\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n10.2\n \n$\n11.9\n \n$\n0.8\n \n$\n22.9\n \n4.    Noncontrolling Interests\nVariable Interest Entities.\n A VIE is an entity in which the controlling interest is determined through means other than a majority voting interest. Refer to Note 1, \"Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - S. Noncontrolling Interest,\" for information on our accounting policy for the VIEs.\nNIPSCO is the managing member and operator of two wind JVs, Rosewater and Indiana Crossroads Wind, which have \n102\n MW and \n302\n MW of nameplate capacity, respectively. NIPSCO is also a managing member and operator of two solar JVs, Indiana Crossroads Solar and Dunns Bridge I, which have a nameplate capacity of \n200\n MW and \n265\n MW, respectively. We have determined that these JVs are VIEs. NIPSCO controls decisions that are significant to these entities' ongoing operations and economic results. Therefore, we have concluded that NIPSCO is the primary beneficiary and have consolidated all four entities. \nMembers of each respective JV include NIPSCO (who is the managing member) and a tax equity partner. Earnings, tax attributes and cash flows are allocated to both NIPSCO and the tax equity partner in varying percentages by category and over the life of the partnership. NIPSCO and each tax equity partner contributed cash to the respective JV. Once the tax equity partner has earned their negotiated rate of return and the JV has reached a stated contractual date, NIPSCO has the option to purchase the remaining interest in the respective JV from the tax equity partner.

See Note 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies - E. Other Matters,\" for a detailed discussion of the NIPSCO Holdings II LLC Agreement and governance structure.\n \n5.    Earnings Per Share\nThe calculations of basic and diluted EPS are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS includes the incremental effects of the various long-term incentive compensation plans and ATM forward sale agreements under the treasury stock method when the impact would be dilutive. For the purposes of determining diluted EPS, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the shares underlying the purchase contracts included within the Equity Units were included in the calculation of potential common stock outstanding using the if-converted method under US GAAP and we assumed share settlement of the remaining purchase contract payment balance from our Equity Units based on the average share price during the period. This method assumes conversion at the beginning of the reporting period, or at time of issuance, if later. The purchase contracts were settled on December 1, 2023. For the purchase contracts, the number of shares of our common stock that would have been issuable at the end of each reporting period prior to the settlement date were reflected in the denominator of our diluted EPS calculation. A numerator adjustment was reflected in the calculation of diluted EPS for interest expense incurred in 2023 and 2022, net of tax, related to the purchase contracts.\nWe adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022, which required us to assume share settlement of the remaining purchase contract payment balance from our Equity Units based on the average share price during the period.\nThe shares underlying the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock included within the Equity Units were contingently convertible as the conversion was contingent on a successful remarketing. Contingently convertible shares where conversion was not tied to a market price trigger were excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS until such time as the contingency had been resolved under the if-converted method. The unsuccessful remarketing resolved the contingency and no shares were reflected in the denominator for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, for the calculation of diluted EPS.\nWe began using the two-class method of computing earnings per share in 2023 because we have participating securities in the form of non-vested restricted stock units with a non-forfeitable right to dividend equivalents, for which vesting is predicated solely on the passage of time. The calculation of earnings per share using the two-class method excludes income attributable to these participating securities from the numerator and excludes the dilutive impact of those shares from the denominator.\n77\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nDuring 2022, we had no outstanding securities other than common and preferred stock, which required holders’ participation in dividends and earnings; therefore, we were not required to calculate EPS under the two-class method. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, to the extent they are dilutive.

The policy of the Board has been to declare cash dividends on a quarterly basis payable on or about the 20th day of February, May, August and November. We have certain debt covenants that could potentially limit the amount of dividends we could pay in order to maintain compliance with these covenants.

Following the redemption, dividends ceased to accrue on the shares of Series B Preferred Stock, shares of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock were no longer deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock terminated. In conjunction with the redemption, we recorded a $\n14.0\n million preferred stock redemption premium, calculated as the difference between the carrying value on the redemption date of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock and the total amount of consideration paid to redeem, which was recorded as a reduction to retained earnings during the first quarter of 2024. We did not recognize an excise tax liability under the IRA in connection with this redemption as we issued common stock in 2024 in excess of the fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series B-1 Preferred Stock redeemed. \nIn March 2024, we filed a Certificate of Elimination to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware to eliminate from the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation all matters set forth in the Certificate of Designations with respect to the Series B Preferred Stock and the Certificate of Designations with respect to the Series B-1 Preferred Stock.

Each of these borrowing sources is described further below.\nRevolving Credit Facility. \nWe maintain a revolving credit facility to fund ongoing working capital requirements, including the provision of liquidity support for our commercial paper program, provide for issuance of letters of credit, and also for general corporate purposes. Our revolving credit facility has a program limit of $\n1.85\n billion and is comprised of a syndicate of banks. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had \nno\n outstanding borrowings under this facility. \nCommercial Paper Program. \nAt\n \nDecember 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\n \nour commercial paper program had a program limit of up to $\n1.85\n billion and $\n1.50\n billion, respectively. On February 9, 2024, we increased the program limit from $\n1.50\n billion to $\n1.85\n billion. We had $\n604.6\n million and $\n1,061.0\n million of commercial paper outstanding with weighted-average interest rates of \n4.73\n% and \n5.65\n% as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable Transfer Programs. \nColumbia of Ohio, NIPSCO, and Columbia of Pennsylvania each maintain a receivables agreement whereby they transfer their customer accounts receivables to third party financial institutions through consolidated special purpose entities. The three agreements expire between May 2025 and October 2025 and may be further extended if mutually agreed to by the parties thereto.\nAll receivables transferred to third parties are valued at face value, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The amount of the undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivables transferred is determined in part by required loss reserves under the agreements. \nTransfers of accounts receivable are accounted for as secured borrowings resulting in the recognition of short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum amount we could borrow related to our accounts receivable programs is $\n175.0\n million.\nWe had \nzero\n and $\n337.6\n million short-term borrowings related to the securitization transactions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, $\n337.6\n million and $\n9.6\n million, respectively, was recorded as cash flows used for financing activities related to the change in short-term borrowings due to securitization transactions. For the accounts receivable transfer programs, we pay used facility fees for amounts borrowed, unused commitment fees for amounts not borrowed, and upfront renewal fees. Fees associated with the securitization transactions were $\n1.5\n million, $\n2.7\n million, and $\n2.5\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Columbia of Ohio, NIPSCO and Columbia of Pennsylvania remain responsible for collecting the receivables securitized, and the receivables cannot be transferred to another party. Refer to Note 23, \"Interest Expense, Net,\" for additional information on securitization transaction fees. \nTerm Credit Agreements.\n At December 31, 2023, we had $\n1.0\n billion, and $\n650.0\n million outstanding under term credit agreements with interest rates of \n6.41\n% and \n6.50\n%, respectively.

The subordinated notes were issued pursuant to a Subordinated Indenture, dated as of May 16, 2024, between us and The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture thereto, dated as of September 9, 2024. \nDetails of our 2023 long-term debt related activity are summarized below:\n•\nOn March 24, 2023, we completed the issuance sale of $\n750.0\n million of \n5.250\n% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2028, which resulted in approximately $\n742.2\n million of net proceeds after discount and debt issuance costs.\n•\nOn June 8, 2023, we completed the issuance and sale of $\n300.0\n million of \n5.250\n% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2028 (the \"2028 Notes\"). The terms of the 2028 Notes, other than the issue date and the price to the public, are identical to the terms of, and constitute as a reopening of, our \n5.250\n% senior unsecured notes due 2028 issued on March 24, 2023. With the incremental issuance, we now have $\n1.05\n billion of \n5.250\n% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2028. On June 8, 2023, we also completed the issuance and sale of $\n450.0\n million of \n5.400\n% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2033. These issuances resulted in approximately $\n742.5\n million of total net proceeds after discount and debt issuance costs.\nSee Note 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies - A. Contractual Obligations,\" for the outstanding long-term debt maturities at December 31, 2024. \nUnamortized debt expense, premium and discount on long-term debt applicable to outstanding bonds are being amortized over the life of such bonds.  \n82\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nWe are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed \n70\n%. As of December 31, 2024, the ratio was \n52.6\n%.\nWe are also subject to certain other non-financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on our assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $\n200\n million. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, conveyance, lease, transfer or other disposition of our assets to those dispositions that are for a price not materially less than fair market of such assets, that would not materially impair our ability to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect. The covenant also restricts dispositions to no more than \n15\n% of our consolidated total assets on December 31, 2022. Additionally, the revolving credit facility requires us to own directly or indirectly at least \n70\n% of NIPSCO. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of us or any of our subsidiaries in a principal amount of $\n75.0\n million or more.\nOur indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, our indentures are generally subject to cross-default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $\n5.0\n million to $\n50.0\n million, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on our assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at \n10\n% of our consolidated net tangible assets.\n9.    Property, Plant and Equipment\nOur property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are classified as follows:\n \nAt December 31, \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nGas Distribution Utility\n$\n20,007.2\n \n$\n18,154.5\n \nElectric Utility\n8,666.8\n \n7,907.9\n \nCorporate\n248.1\n \n274.2\n \nConstruction Work in Process\n2,084.7\n \n1,261.1\n \nJV Renewable Generation Assets\n(1)\n1,434.2\n \n1,434.4\n \nNon-Utility and Other\n1,711.9\n \n1,450.0\n \nTotal Property, Plant and Equipment\n$\n34,152.9\n \n$\n30,482.1\n \nAccumulated Depreciation and Amortization\nGas Distribution Utility\n$\n(\n4,166.8\n)\n$\n(\n3,924.4\n)\nElectric Utility\n(\n2,707.8\n)\n(\n2,709.5\n)\nCorporate\n(\n163.4\n)\n(\n174.2\n)\nJV Renewable Generation Assets\n(1)\n(\n110.4\n)\n(\n64.5\n)\nNon-Utility and Other\n(\n1,550.6\n)\n(\n1,334.6\n)\nTotal Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization\n$\n(\n8,699.0\n)\n$\n(\n8,207.2\n)\nNet Property, Plant and Equipment\n$\n25,453.9\n \n$\n22,274.9\n \n(1)\nThese JV renewable generation assets owned and operated by JVs between NIPSCO and unrelated tax equity partners represent Non-Utility Property, are depreciated straight-line over 30 years and are part of our NIPSCO Operations segment.

Our unamortized software balance was $\n236.1\n million and $\n205.6\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nAmortization of Cloud Computing Costs. \nWe amortized $\n17.7\n million, $\n12.6\n million and $\n11.1\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, related to cloud computing costs to \"Operation and maintenance\" expense. Our unamortized cloud computing balance was $\n77.5\n million and $\n32.2\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \n10.    Goodwill\nSubstantially all of our goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000. Our goodwill balance was $\n1,485.9\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. The majority of our goodwill has been allocated to the Columbia Operations segment.\nFor our annual goodwill impairment analysis performed as of May 1, 2024, we completed a quantitative (\"step 1\") fair value measurement of our reporting units. Fair value of our reporting units was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. The income approach calculated discounted cash flows using updated cash flow projections, discount rates and return on equity assumptions. The market approach applied a combination of comparable company multiples and comparable transactions and used the most recent cash flow projections. The test indicated that the fair value of each of the reporting units that are allocated goodwill exceeded their carrying values, indicating that no impairment was necessary.\n11.    Asset Retirement Obligations\nWe have recognized asset retirement obligations associated with various legal obligations including costs to remove and dispose of certain construction materials located within many of our facilities (including our JV facilities), certain costs to retire pipeline, removal costs for certain underground storage tanks, removal of certain pipelines known to contain PCB contamination, closure costs for certain sites including ash ponds, solid waste management units and a landfill, as well as some other nominal asset retirement obligations. We also have an obligation associated with the decommissioning of our two hydro facilities located in Indiana. These hydro facilities have an indeterminate life, and as such, no asset retirement obligation has been recorded.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, we continued to evaluate the applicability of revisions to the EPA rule for disposal of CCRs, which was announced in May 2024. As a result, we recorded an increase of $\n149.7\n million based on initial assessments of estimated costs to comply with the EPA rule for certain sites. Additional costs will be recorded if they become probable and estimable. These costs are expected to be recoverable through existing and future depreciation rates. See Note 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies - D.

No collateral was either received or posted related to our outstanding derivative positions at December 31, 2024 and 2023. If the above gross asset and liability positions were presented net of amounts owed or receivable from counterparties, we would report a net asset position of $\n23.5\n million and $\n13.9\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nC\nommodity price risk management. \nWe, along with our utility customers, are exposed to variability in cash flows associated with natural gas purchases and volatility in natural gas prices. We purchase natural gas for sale and delivery to our retail, commercial and industrial customers, and for most customers the variability in the market price of gas is passed through in their rates. Some of our utility subsidiaries offer programs whereby variability in the market price of gas is assumed by the respective utility. The objective of our commodity price risk programs is to mitigate the gas cost variability, for us or on behalf of our customers, associated with natural gas purchases or sales by economically hedging the various gas cost components using a combination of futures, options, forwards or other derivative contracts. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had \n77.8\n MMDth and \n76.1\n MMDth, respectively, of net energy derivative volumes outstanding related to our natural gas hedges.\nNIPSCO has received IURC approval to lock in a fixed price for its natural gas customers using long-term forward purchase instruments and is limited to \n20\n% of NIPSCO’s average annual GCA purchase volume. As of December 31, 2024, the remaining terms of these instruments range from \none\n to \nthree years\n. Likewise, Columbia of Pennsylvania has received approval for a 24-month rolling hedge program. The hedging program was executed in December 2023, with an effective date of April 1, 2024 and will continue in perpetuity. The program is designed to financially hedge approximately \n20\n% of the customer’s annual demand. All gains and losses on these derivative contracts are deferred as regulatory liabilities or assets and are remitted to or collected from customers through the relevant cost recovery mechanism. \n89\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nLevel 1-\n When utilized, exchange-traded derivative contracts are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore, nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. These financial assets and liabilities are deemed to be cleared and settled daily by NYMEX as the related cash collateral is posted with the exchange. As a result of this exchange rule, NYMEX derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes, and are presented in Level 1 net of posted cash; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and are subject to future commodity price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms.\nLevel 2- \nCertain non-exchange-traded derivatives are valued using broker or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. In such cases, these non-exchange-traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non-exchange-based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. We use a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs, (i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means). Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized within Level 2.\nLevel 3-\n Certain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized within Level 3. \nCredit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange-traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements that reduce exposures. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were \nno\n material transfers between fair value hierarchies. Additionally, there were no changes in the method or significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments.\nNIPSCO and Columbia of Pennsylvania have entered into long-term forward natural gas purchase instruments to lock in a fixed price for their natural gas customers. We value these contracts using a pricing model that incorporates market-based information when available, as these instruments trade less frequently and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For additional information, see Note 13, “Risk Management Activities.”\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities. \nAvailable-for-sale debt securities are investments pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to our wholly-owned insurance company. We value U.S. Treasury, corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities using a matrix pricing model that incorporates market-based information. These securities trade less frequently and are classified within Level 2. \nOur available-for-sale debt securities impairments are recognized periodically using an allowance approach. At each reporting date, we utilize a quantitative and qualitative review process to assess the impairment of available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level. For securities in a loss position, we evaluate our intent to sell or whether it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost. If either criteria is met, the loss is recognized in earnings immediately, with the offsetting entry to the carrying value of the security. If both criteria are not met, we perform an analysis to determine whether the unrealized loss is related to credit factors. The analysis focuses on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, downgrade on ratings of the security, defaults in the current reporting period or projected defaults in the future, the security's yield spread over treasuries, and other relevant market data. If the unrealized loss is not related to credit factors, it is included in other comprehensive income. If the unrealized loss is related to credit factors, the loss is recognized as credit loss expense in earnings during the period, with an offsetting entry to the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the credit loss recorded to the allowance account is limited by the amount at which the security's fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. If certain amounts recorded in the allowance for credit losses are deemed uncollectible, the allowance on the uncollectible portion will be charged off, with an offsetting entry to the carrying value of the security. Subsequent improvements to the estimated credit losses of available-for-sale debt securities will be recognized immediately in earnings. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we recorded $\n0.1\n million and $\n0.6\n million, respectively, as an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as a result of the analysis described above. Continuous credit monitoring and portfolio credit balancing mitigates our risk of credit losses on our available-for-sale debt securities. \n91\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8.

These plan investments are classified as \"Other investments\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNon-recurring Fair Value Measurements\nWe measure the fair value of certain assets, including goodwill, on a non-recurring basis, typically when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. \nB.         Other Fair Value Disclosures for Financial Instruments\n. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable, customer deposits and short-term borrowings is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. Our long-term borrowings are recorded at historical amounts.\nThe following method and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments.\nLong-term debt\n. The fair value of outstanding long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar securities. Certain premium costs associated with the early settlement of long-term debt are not taken into consideration in determining fair value. These fair value measurements are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there was no change in the method or significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of long-term debt.\n92\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8.

The Company has transitioned to the Bridge Phase of the IRS CAP for the year ended December 31, 2022 and participated in the Bridge Plus pilot program in 2022 and 2023.

As of December 31, 2024, there were no state income tax audits in progress that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nNiSource is obligated to report adjustments resulting from IRS audits or settlements to state taxing authorities. In addition, if NiSource utilizes net operating losses or tax credits generated in years for which the statute of limitations has expired, such amounts are generally subject to examination.\nOn April 14, 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15 which provides a safe harbor method of accounting that taxpayers may use to determine whether expenses to repair, maintain, replace, or improve linear property and non-linear natural gas transmission and distribution property must be capitalized as improvements or are allowable as deductions. On June 3, 2024, the IRS extended the favorable rules to a Year 2 adoption period. The Company is planning to elect this change in tax accounting method with its 2024 consolidated tax return filing in the upcoming year and continues to analyze and quantify the provisions of the safe harbor method of accounting.\n16.     Pension and Other Postemployment Benefits\nWe provide defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover certain of our employees. Benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans reflect the employees’ compensation, years of service and age at retirement. Additionally, we provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. The majority of employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for us. The expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees’ years of service. Current rates of rate-regulated companies include postretirement benefit costs, including amortization of the regulatory assets that arose prior to inclusion of these costs in rates. For most plans, cash contributions are remitted to grantor trusts.\nOur Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans’ Asset Management\n. The Board has delegated oversight of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets to the NiSource Benefits Committee (the \"Committee\"). The Committee has adopted investment policy statements for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets. For the pension plans, we employ a liability-driven investing strategy. A total return approach is utilized for the other postretirement benefit plans’ assets. A mix of diversified investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets and hedge the liabilities at a prudent level of risk. The investment portfolio includes U.S. and non-U.S. equities, real estate, long-term and intermediate-term fixed income and alternative investments. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, funded status, and asset class volatility. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.\n96\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nIn determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, historical markets are studied, relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed and current market factors, such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated with consideration of diversification and rebalancing. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding long-term capital market assumptions for each asset class. The pension plans’ investment policy calls for a gradual reduction in the allocation of return-seeking assets (equities, real estate and private equity) and a corresponding increase in the allocation of liability-hedging assets (fixed income) as the funded status of the plans’ increase.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established by the policy for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\nPostretirement Benefit Plan\nAsset Category\nMinimum\nMaximum\nMinimum\nMaximum\nDomestic Equities\n10\n%\n30\n%\n0\n%\n55\n%\nInternational Equities\n5\n%\n15\n%\n0\n%\n25\n%\nFixed Income\n65\n%\n75\n%\n20\n%\n100\n%\nReal Estate\n0\n%\n0\n%\n0\n%\n0\n%\nPrivate Equity\n0\n%\n3\n%\n0\n%\n0\n%\nShort-Term Investments\n0\n%\n10\n%\n0\n%\n10\n%\nDecember 31, 2023\nDefined Benefit Pension Plan\nPostretirement Benefit Plan\nAsset Category\nMinimum\nMaximum\nMinimum\nMaximum\nDomestic Equities\n10\n%\n30\n%\n0\n%\n55\n%\nInternational Equities\n5\n%\n15\n%\n0\n%\n25\n%\nFixed Income\n65\n%\n75\n%\n20\n%\n100\n%\nReal Estate\n0\n%\n0\n%\n0\n%\n0\n%\nPrivate Equity\n0\n%\n3\n%\n0\n%\n0\n%\nShort-Term Investments\n0\n%\n10\n%\n0\n%\n10\n%\n97\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8.

Assets are classified in their entirety based on the observability of inputs used in determining the fair value measurement. There were no material investment assets in the pension and other postretirement benefits trusts classified within Level 3 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nWe use the following valuation techniques to determine fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2024, there were no significant changes to valuation techniques to determine the fair value of our pension and other postretirement benefits' assets. \nLevel 1 Measurements\nMost common and preferred stocks are traded in active markets on national and international securities exchanges and are valued at closing prices on the last business day of each period presented. Cash is stated at cost, which approximates fair value, with the exception of cash held in foreign currencies which fluctuates with changes in the exchange rates. Short-term bills and notes are priced based on quoted market values.\nLevel 2 Measurements\nMost U.S. Government Agency obligations, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and corporate fixed income securities are generally valued by benchmarking model-derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for identical or comparable securities. To the extent that quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that includes inputs such as interest rate yield curves and credit spreads. Securities traded in markets that are not considered active are valued based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. Other fixed income includes futures and options which are priced on bid valuation or settlement pricing. \n98\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nLevel 3 Measurements\nInvestments with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities are classified as level 3 investments.\nNot Classified\nCommingled funds, private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. Instead, these assets are measured at estimated fair value using the net asset value per share of the investments. Commingled funds' underlying assets are principally marketable equity and fixed income securities. Units held in commingled funds are valued at the unit value as reported by the investment managers. Private equity funds invest capital in non-public companies and real estate funds invest in commercial and distressed real estate directly or through related debt instruments. The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the funds’ underlying assets.\n99\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8.

The 2010 Omnibus Plan provided for awards to employees and non-employee directors of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards and superseded the Director Stock Incentive Plan (“Director Plan”) with respect to grants made after the effective date of the 2010 Omnibus Plan.\nThe stockholders approved and adopted the NiSource Inc. 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (\"2020 Omnibus Plan\") at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 19, 2020. The 2020 Omnibus Plan provides for awards to employees and non-employee directors of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards and supersedes the 2010 Omnibus Plan with respect to grants made after the effective date of the 2020 Omnibus Plan.\nThe 2020 Omnibus Plan provides that the number of shares of common stock of NiSource available for awards is \n10,000,000\n plus the number of shares subject to outstanding awards that expire or terminate for any reason that were granted under the \n107\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\n2020 Omnibus Plan, the 2010 Omnibus Plan or any other equity plan under which awards were outstanding as of May 19, 2020. At December 31, 2024, there were \n7,216,823\n shares available for future awards under the 2020 Omnibus Plan.\nWe recognized stock-based employee compensation expense of $\n32.1\n million, $\n23.9\n million and $\n19.0\n million, during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, as well as related tax benefits of $\n7.0\n million, $\n7.7\n million and $\n3.6\n million, respectively. We recognized related excess tax benefits from the distribution of vested share-based employee compensation of $\n2.0\n million, $\n2.9\n million, and $\n0.4\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards amounted to $\n46.7\n million, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of \n1.8\n years.\nRestricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock\n. We granted \n655,713\n, \n500,968\n, and \n477,292\n restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock to employees, subject to service conditions in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. The total grant date fair value of the restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock during 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, was $\n17.1\n million, $\n13.7\n million, and $\n12.5\n million. The grant date fair value for the 2024 and 2023 awards is based on the average market price of our common stock at the date of each grant. For the year ended 2022, the grant date fair value is based on the average market price of our common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of any dividends not received during the vesting period. The awards are expensed over the vesting period which is generally \nthree years\n. As of December 31, 2024, \n592,490\n, \n393,509\n, and \n270,325\n non-vested restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock granted in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, were outstanding. Our non-vested restricted stock units have a non-forfeitable right to dividend equivalents, with immaterial amounts paid in the periods ending December 31, 2024 and 2023. See Note 5, \"Earnings Per Share,\" for further discussion. \nIn general, if an employee terminates employment before the service conditions lapse under the 2022, 2023 or 2024 awards due to (1) retirement or disability (as defined in the 2020 Omnibus Plan), or (2) death, the service conditions will lapse on the date of such termination with respect to a pro rata portion of the restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock based upon the percentage of the service period satisfied between the grant date and the date of the termination of employment. In the event of a change in control (as defined in the 2020 Omnibus Plan), all unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded will immediately vest upon termination of employment occurring in connection with a change in control. Termination due to any other reason, in general, will result in all unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded being forfeited effective on the employee’s date of termination.\nA summary of our restricted stock unit award transactions for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:\n(shares)\nRestricted Stock\nUnits\nWeighted Average\nAward Date Fair \nValue Per Unit ($)\nNon-vested at December 31, 2023\n1,066,916\n \n25.71\n \nGranted\n655,713\n \n26.10\n \nForfeited\n(\n167,057\n)\n26.19\n \nVested\n(\n227,452\n)\n22.90\n \nNon-vested at December 31, 2024\n1,328,120\n \n26.49\n \nEmployee Performance Shares\n. We granted \n896,363\n performance shares subject to service, performance and/or market-based vesting conditions in 2024. The performance conditions for these shares are based on the achievement of one non-GAAP financial measure, achievement of relative total shareholder return, and other operational metrics, which make up 55%, 25%, and 20% of the issued awards respectively. \nThe non-GAAP financial measure is cumulative adjusted earnings per share, which we define as diluted earnings per share adjusted for certain items. Relative total shareholder return, a market-based vesting condition, which we define as the annualized growth in dividends and share price of a share of our common stock (calculated using a 20 trading day average of our closing price over the performance period, approximately) compared to the total shareholder return of a predetermined peer group of companies. A Monte Carlo analysis was used to value the portion of these awards dependent on the market-based vesting condition. The grant date fair value of the non-GAAP financial measure shares is based on the closing stock price of our common stock at the date of each grant, which will be expensed over the requisite service period of \nthree years\n.

The performance conditions for these shares are based on the achievement of one non-GAAP financial measure, achievement of relative total shareholder return, and other operational metrics, which make up 50%, 25%, and 25% of the issued awards respectively. The operational metrics consist of goals of economic inclusion (5%), OPEX (\"Operating Expenses\") Index (10%), Employee Engagement Index Score (5%), and Environmental GHG Reduction (5%). The OPEX Index is further defined by goals related to risk mitigation and modernization of our infrastructure.\nIn 2022, we granted \n566,086\n \nperformance shares subject to service, performance and/or market-based vesting conditions. The performance conditions for these shares are based on the achievement of one non-GAAP financial measure, and/or achievement of relative total shareholder return, outlined above. The number of shares that are eligible to vest based on these performance conditions are adjusted based on performance of the magnifier framework for 2022 awards. The operational magnifier framework for 2022 performance shares consists of three areas of focus, including safety, environment, and workforce, representing 20%, 10% and 10%, respectively. \nThe following table presents details of the performance awards described above.\nAward Year\nService Conditions Lapse date\nPerformance Period\nAward Conditions\nShares outstanding at 12/31/2024\n(shares)\nGrant Date Fair Value\n(in millions)\n2024\n2/26/2027\n01/01/2024-\n12/31/2026\nNon-GAAP Financial and Operational Measures\n619,673\n \n$\n17.4\n \nRelative Total Shareholder Return\n206,524\n \n$\n6.9\n \n2023\n2/28/2026\n01/01/2023-\n12/31/2025\nNon-GAAP Financial and Operational Measures\n430,670\n \n$\n13.3\n \nRelative Total Shareholder Return\n143,540\n \n$\n5.4\n \n2022\n2/28/2025\n01/01/2022-\n12/31/2024\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\n195,460\n \n$\n7.4\n \nRelative Total Shareholder Return\n195,460\n \n$\n10.6\n \nA summary of our performance award transactions for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:\n(shares)\nPerformance\nAwards\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date Fair \nValue Per Unit ($)\nNon-vested at December 31, 2023\n1,558,509\n \n28.01\n \nGranted\n896,363\n \n27.05\n \nForfeited\n(\n189,080\n)\n31.75\n \nVested\n(\n546,569\n)\n21.95\n \nNon-vested at December 31, 2024\n1,719,223\n \n24.96\n \nNon-employee Director Awards\n.

The vested restricted stock units are payable as soon as practicable following vesting except as otherwise provided pursuant to the non-employee director’s deferral election. Certain restricted stock units remain outstanding from the 2010 Omnibus Plan and the Director Plan. All such awards are fully vested and shall be distributed to the directors upon their separation from the Board.\nAs of December 31, 2024, \n292,566\n restricted stock units are outstanding to non-employee directors under either the 2020 Omnibus Plan, the 2010 Omnibus Plan or the Director Plan. Of this amount, \n68,436\n restricted stock units are unvested and expected to vest. \n401(k) Match, Profit Sharing and Company Contribution.\n Eligible salaried employees hired after January 1, 2010 and hourly and union employees hired after January 1, 2013 receive a non-elective company contribution of \n4.5\n% of eligible pay payable in cash or shares of NiSource common stock. We also have a voluntary 401(k) savings plan covering eligible union and nonunion employees that allows for periodic discretionary matches as a percentage of each participant’s contributions payable in cash or shares. Further, we have a retirement savings plan that provides for discretionary profit sharing contributions to eligible employees. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized 401(k) match, profit sharing and non-elective contribution expense of $\n56.9\n million, $\n50.7\n million and $\n39.1\n million, respectively.\n18.    Leases\nLease Descriptions.\n We are the lessee for substantially all of our leasing activity, which includes operating and finance leases for corporate and field offices, railcars, land, and fleet vehicles. Our corporate and field office leases and certain land leases have remaining terms between \n1\n and \n39\n years with options to renew the leases for up to \n35\n years. We lease railcars to transport coal to and from our electric generation facilities in Indiana. Our railcars are specifically identified in the lease agreements which have remaining lease terms between \n1\n and \n3\n years with options to renew for \n1\n year. Our fleet vehicles include trucks, trailers and equipment that have been customized specifically for use in the utility industry. We lease fleet vehicles for \n1\n year terms, after which we have the option to extend on a month-to-month basis or terminate with written notice. We elected the short-term lease practical expedient, allowing us to not recognize ROU assets or lease liabilities for all leases with a term of 12 months or less. ROU assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets do not include obligations for possible fleet vehicle lease renewals beyond the initial lease term. While we have the ability to renew these leases beyond the initial term, we are not reasonably certain to do so. \nWe have not provided material residual value guarantees for our leases, nor do our leases contain material restrictions or covenants. Lease contracts containing renewal and termination options are mostly exercisable at our sole discretion. Certain of our real estate and railcar leases include renewal periods in the measurement of the lease obligation if we have deemed the renewals reasonably certain to be exercised.\nWith respect to service contracts involving the use of assets, if we have the right to direct the use of the asset and obtain substantially all economic benefits from the use of an asset, we account for the service contract as a lease. Unless specifically provided to us by the lessor, we utilize NiSource's collateralized incremental borrowing rate commensurate to the lease term as the discount rate for all of our leases. ASC 842 permits a lessee, by class of underlying asset, not to separate nonlease components from lease components. Our policy is to apply this expedient for our leases of fleet vehicles, IT assets and railcars when calculating their respective lease liabilities.\nLease costs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 are presented in the table below.

Operating lease balances do not include obligations for possible fleet vehicle lease renewals beyond the initial lease term. While we have the ability to renew these leases beyond the initial term, we are not reasonably certain to do \nso as they are renewed month-to-month after the first year. \n(4)\nOther liabilities shown above are primarily related to the Dunns Bridge II and Indiana Crossroads Solar Developer payments due in 2025 and ongoing maintenance service agreements for our renewable joint ventures.\nPurchase and Service Obligations. \nWe have entered into various purchase and service agreements whereby we are contractually obligated to make certain minimum payments in future periods. Our energy commodity contracts are for the purchase of physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. Our service obligations, consisting of pipeline service obligations and IT service obligations, encompass a broad range of business support and maintenance functions which are generally described below. Our plant equipment purchase obligations are for plant equipment, typically for generation assets, with long lead times that require payments made over time \nOur subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantity of these commodities we are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. To the extent contractual purchase prices are variable, obligations disclosed in the table above are valued at market prices as of December 31, 2024.\nNIPSCO has PPAs representing a total of \n600\n MW of wind power, with contracts expiring between 2038 and 2040. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity generation from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon early termination of one of these agreements by NIPSCO for any reason (other than material breach by the counterparties), NIPSCO may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination. \nWe have pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from \n2028\n to \n2038\n, require us to pay fixed monthly charges. \nNIPSCO has contracts with \nthree\n major rail operators providing coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through \n2025\n.\nWe have executed agreements with multiple IT service providers. The agreements extend for various periods through \n2029\n. \n113\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nB.        Guarantees and Indemnities\n. We and certain of our subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries as part of normal business. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiaries’ intended commercial purposes. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, we issued stand-by letters of credit of $\n9.4\n million and $\n9.9\n million, respectively, for the benefit of third parties. \nWe provide guarantees related to our future performance under BTAs for our renewable generation projects. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our guarantees for multiple BTAs totaled $\n1,127.5\n million and $\n646.1\n million, respectively. The amount of each guaranty will decrease upon completion of certain milestones for the construction of the facilities, including mechanical and substantial completion. See “- E. Other Matters - Generation Transition,” below for more information.\nWe provide guarantees related to some of our rail and pipeline service agreements. If we do not meet our contractual obligations under the terms of these agreements we would be required to pay up to a maximum of $\n61.7\n million.\nC.        Legal Proceedings\n. From time to time, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company and its subsidiaries. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company establishes reserves whenever it believes it to be appropriate for pending litigation matters. However, the actual results of resolving the pending litigation matters may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved. If one or more other matters were decided against us, the effects could be material to our results of operations in the period in which we would be required to record or adjust the related liability and could also be material to our cash flows in the periods that we would be required to pay such liability. Due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim, proceeding or investigation would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nOther Claims and Proceedings. \nWe are also party to certain other claims, regulatory and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business in each state in which we have operations, and based upon an investigation of these matters and discussion with legal counsel, we believe the ultimate outcome of such other legal proceedings to be individually, or in aggregate, not material at this time.\nD.        Environmental Matters\n.\n \nOur operations are subject to environmental statutes and regulations related to air quality, water quality, hazardous waste and solid waste. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the environmental regulations currently applicable to our operations.\nIt is management's continued intent to address environmental issues in cooperation with regulatory authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable compliance plans. However, there can be no assurance that fines and penalties will not be incurred. Management expects the majority of environmental assessment and remediation costs and asset retirement costs, further described below, to be recoverable through rates. See Note 11, \"Asset Retirement Obligations\" and Note 12, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional detail.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had recorded a liability of $\n91.8\n million and $\n80\n million, respectively, to cover environmental remediation at various sites. This liability is included in \"Other accruals\" and \"Other noncurrent liabilities and deferred credits\" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognize costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The original estimates for remediation activities may differ materially from the amount ultimately expended. The actual future expenditures depend on many factors, including laws and regulations, the nature and extent of impact and the method of remediation. These expenditures are not currently estimable at some sites. We periodically adjust our liability as information is collected and estimates become more refined. \nCERCLA. \nOur subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites under the CERCLA and similar state laws. Under CERCLA, each potentially responsible party can be held jointly, severally and strictly liable for the remediation costs as the EPA, or state, can allow the parties to pay for remedial action or perform remedial action themselves and request reimbursement from the potentially responsible parties. Our affiliates have retained CERCLA environmental liabilities, including remediation liabilities, associated with certain current and former operations. At this time, we cannot estimate the full cost of remediating properties that have not yet been investigated, but it is possible that the future costs could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n114\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nMGP.\n We maintain a program to identify and investigate former MGP sites where gas distribution subsidiaries or predecessors may have liability. The program has identified \n51\n such sites where liability is probable. Remedial actions at many of these sites are being overseen by state or federal environmental agencies through consent agreements or voluntary remediation agreements.\nWe utilize a probabilistic model to estimate our future remediation costs related to MGP sites. The model was prepared with the assistance of a third party and incorporates our experience and general industry experience with remediating MGP sites. We complete an annual refresh of the model in the second quarter of each fiscal year. We recorded an $\n11.2\n million increase to the estimated future remediation costs as a result of the refresh completed in the second quarter of 2024. No material changes to the estimated future remediation costs were noted as a result of an internal quarterly review of environmental reserves completed as of December 31, 2024. Our total estimated liability related to the facilities subject to remediation was $\n86.4\n million and $\n73.7\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The liability represents our best estimate of the probable cost to remediate the MGP sites. Our model indicates that it is reasonably possible that remediation costs could vary by as much as $\n16.3\n million in addition to the costs noted above. Remediation costs are estimated based on the best available information, applicable remediation standards at the balance sheet date, and experience with similar facilities.\nCCRs. \nNIPSCO continues to meet the compliance requirements established by the EPA for the regulation of CCRs. The CCR rule requirements currently in effect required revisions to previously recorded legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain NIPSCO facilities. The actual asset retirement costs related to the CCR rule may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased asset retirement obligation due to the uncertainty about the requirements that will be established by environmental authorities, compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs. As allowed by the rule, NIPSCO will continue to collect data over time to determine the specific compliance solutions and associated costs and, as a result, the actual costs may vary. \nOn May 8, 2024, the EPA finalized changes to the current CCR regulations (\"Legacy CCR Rule\") which address inactive surface impoundments at inactive facilities, referred to as legacy impoundments, and CCR management units (\"CCRMUs\") at inactive and active facilities. The rule largely requires these newly regulated units to conform to existing requirements, such as groundwater monitoring, closure requirements, and post-closure care. During 2024, we recorded additional asset retirement obligations of $\n149.7\n million to cover probable and estimable compliance activities associated with the Legacy CCR Rule with an offsetting regulatory asset. Facility evaluations for CCRMUs are required by February 2026 and 2027. NIPSCO continues to assess whether existing legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain facilities must be revised and to estimate probable additional required asset retirement costs. NIPSCO expects to receive recovery of any such costs through existing and future depreciation rates.\nE.         Other Matters\nGeneration Transition.\n \nNIPSCO has executed several BTAs with developers to construct renewable generation facilities. NIPSCO has received IURC approval for all of its BTAs and PPAs. In October 2024, NIPSCO contracted with a developer to convert the previously approved Templeton Wind PPA to a BTA and has provided a notice of intent to file a CPCN with the IURC. In addition to IURC approval, NIPSCO's purchase obligation under certain BTAs is dependent on timely completion of construction. Certain agreements require NIPSCO to make partial payments upon the developer's completion of significant construction milestones. With respect to BTAs for which tax equity partnerships are utilized, once the tax equity partner has earned its negotiated rate of return and we have reached the agreed upon contractual date, NIPSCO has the option to purchase at fair market value the remaining interest in the JV from the tax equity partner. In January 2024, the IURC approved the full ownership of Cavalry and Dunns Bridge II which will allow those BTAs to be executed through direct ownership. In March 2024, Cavalry achieved mechanical completion, resulting in NIPSCO making a $\n110.6\n million payment to the developer. In May 2024, Cavalry achieved substantial completion and commenced commercial operations, resulting in NIPSCO making a $\n114.9\n million payment to the developer. In August 2024, the IURC approved full ownership of the Gibson and Fairbanks projects as well as an increase to the cost of the Fairbanks project. In January 2025, Fairbanks achieved mechanical completion resulting in NIPSCO making a $\n336.6\n million payment to the developer. In September 2024, Dunns Bridge II achieved mechanical completion, resulting in NIPSCO making a $\n153.3\n million payment to the developer. In January 2025, substantial completion was achieved requiring a final payment of $\n217.6\n million to be paid in February 2025. NIPSCO has filed a request to modify the ownership structure for the Templeton wind project to become a wholly owned project.\nNIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction\n. On December 31, 2023, pursuant to the terms of the BIP Purchase Agreement and simultaneously with the closing of the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction, Blackstone, NIPSCO Holdings I, NIPSCO \n115\nTable of Contents\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nHoldings II and NiSource entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the \"LLC Agreement\") of NIPSCO Holdings II. Specifically, under the terms of the LLC Agreement, Blackstone will provide up to $\n250\n million in additional capital contributions over a three-year period after the closing, which the obligation is backed by an Equity Commitment Letter from an affiliate of Blackstone. Under the LLC Agreement, Blackstone is entitled to appoint two directors to the board of directors of NIPSCO Holdings II (the “Board”) so long as Blackstone (together with any approved affiliate) holds at least a \n17.5\n% percentage interest (as defined in the LLC Agreement). In connection with the closing, Blackstone appointed two directors to the Board, such that the Board is now comprised of seven directors, two appointed by Blackstone and five appointed by NiSource. The LLC Agreement also contains certain investor protections, including, among other things, requiring Blackstone approval for Holdings II to take certain major actions. In addition, the LLC Agreement contains certain terms regarding transfer rights and other obligations applicable to both Blackstone and NiSource. The LLC Agreement establishes, among other things, governance rights, exit rights, requirements for additional capital contributions, mechanics for distributions, and other arrangements for Holdings II following the closing. On January 31, 2024, BIP transferred a \n4.5\n% equity interest in NIPSCO Holdings II to BIP Blue Buyer VCOC L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company and also an affiliate of Blackstone. Effective upon the closing of this transfer, the members of NIPSCO Holdings II entered into a Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Operating Agreement of NIPSCO Holdings II (the \"Amended LLC \nAgreement\"). The two affiliates of Blackstone must vote their equity holdings under the Amended LLC Agreement as one investor. \nRefer to Note 4, \"Noncontrolling Interests,\" for detailed discussion of accounting for the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction.\n \n20.     Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table displays the activity of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss, net of tax:\n(in millions)\nGains and Losses on Securities\n(1)\nGains and Losses on Cash Flow Hedges\n(1)\nPension and OPEB Items\n(1)\nAccumulated\nOther\nComprehensive\nLoss\n(1)\nBalance as of January 1, 2022\n$\n2.1\n \n$\n(\n122.5\n)\n$\n(\n6.4\n)\n$\n(\n126.8\n)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications\n(\n13.7\n)\n109.7\n \n(\n8.9\n)\n87.1\n \nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n0.4\n \n0.2\n \n2.0\n \n2.6\n \nNet current-period other comprehensive (loss) income\n(\n13.3\n)\n109.9\n \n(\n6.9\n)\n89.7\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n(\n11.2\n)\n$\n(\n12.6\n)\n$\n(\n13.3\n)\n$\n(\n37.1\n)\nOther comprehensive (loss) income before reclassifications\n3.1\n \n(\n0.5\n)\n(\n1.4\n)\n1.2\n \nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n0.8\n \n0.3\n \n1.2\n \n2.3\n \nNet current-period other comprehensive (loss) income\n3.9\n \n(\n0.2\n)\n(\n0.2\n)\n3.5\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n(\n7.3\n)\n$\n(\n12.8\n)\n$\n(\n13.5\n)\n$\n(\n33.6\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n1.5\n \n—\n \n(\n1.2\n)\n0.3\n \nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n1.8\n \n(\n0.4\n)\n1.5\n \n2.9\n \nNet current-period other comprehensive income (loss)\n3.3\n \n(\n0.4\n)\n0.3\n \n3.2\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n(\n4.0\n)\n$\n(\n13.2\n)\n$\n(\n13.2\n)\n$\n(\n30.4\n)\n \n(1)\nAll amounts are net of tax.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\n21.     Business Segment Information\nOur reportable segments reflect the manner in which our business is managed and our resources are allocated. Following the consummation of the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction, we revised how we evaluate results and allocate resources across our business with an increased focus on operating performance at the state level. Refer to Note 4, \"Noncontrolling Interests,\" for additional information on the NIPSCO Minority Interest Transaction. At December 31, 2024, our operations are divided into \ntwo\n primary reportable segments, the Columbia Operations and the NIPSCO Operations segments. Columbia Operations aggregates the results of the fully regulated and wholly owned subsidiaries of NiSource Gas Distribution Group, Inc. (a holding company that owns Columbia of Kentucky, Columbia of Maryland, Columbia of Ohio, Columbia of Pennsylvania, and Columbia of Virginia). Each Columbia distribution company is an operating segment which we aggregate to form the Columbia Operations reportable segment. NIPSCO Operations includes the results of NIPSCO Holdings I and its majority-owned subsidiaries, including NIPSCO, which has fully regulated gas and electric operations in northern Indiana. Our historical segment disclosures have been recast to be consistent with the current presentation.\nThe remainder of our operations, which are not significant enough on a stand-alone basis to warrant treatment as an operating segment, are presented as \"Corporate and Other\" in the subsequent reconciliation table and primarily are comprised of interest expense on holding company debt and unallocated corporate costs and activities. Refer to Note 3, \"Revenue Recognition,\" for additional information on our segments and their sources of revenues. The following table provides information about our reportable segments. We use operating income as our primary measurement for each of the reported segments and make decisions on financing, dividends and taxes at the corporate level on a consolidated basis. We provide this measure to our Chief Operating Decision Maker, the CEO, who utilizes this measure to make operating segment level strategy decisions based on budget-to-actual variances and against prior periods to allocate resources accordingly. Segment revenues include intersegment sales to affiliated subsidiaries, which are eliminated in consolidation. Affiliated sales are recognized on the basis of prevailing market, regulated prices or at levels provided for under contractual agreements.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNone.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur CEO and CFO are responsible for evaluating the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)). Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act are accumulated and communicated to management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. Based upon that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that financial information was processed, recorded and reported accurately. \nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including our CEO and CFO, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. However, management would note that a control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our management has adopted the 2013 framework set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission report, Internal Control - Integrated Framework, the most commonly used and understood framework for evaluating internal control over financial reporting, as its framework for evaluating the reliability and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. During 2024, we conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nDeloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued an attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n122\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\n I\nNC\n.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of NiSource Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 12, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 12, 2025\n123\nTable of Contents\nITEM 9B.
