Legal Proceedings \nWe are involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including, but not limited to, disputes involving hotel-level contracts, employment litigation, compliance with laws, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, tax disputes and other general matters. We or our operators are defending these claims vigorously; however, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings. We believe, based on currently available information, that the results of such proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, but might be material to our operating results for any period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such period. We record a liability when a loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

Market for Registrant’s Common Stock, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities for Host Inc. \nHost Inc.’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market and trades under the symbol “HST.” \nAs of February 21, 2025, there were 14,537 holders of record of Host Inc.’s common stock. However, because many of the shares of our common stock are held by brokers and other institutions on behalf of stockholders, we believe that there are considerably more beneficial owners of our common stock than record holders. As of February 21, 2025, there were 996 limited partners of Host L.P. (in addition to Host Inc.). OP units are redeemable for cash, or, at our election, for Host Inc. common stock. \nStockholder Return Performance\nThe following graph compares the five-year cumulative total stockholder return on the common stock of Host Inc. against the cumulative total returns of the Standard & Poor’s Corporation Composite 500 Index and the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust (“NAREIT”) Lodging Index.

Reserved\n37\nTable of Contents\nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion focuses on our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. For a discussion and analysis of the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the same period in 2022, please refer to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in Part II Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10‑K for the year ended December 31, 2023, filed with the SEC on February 28, 2024.\nOverview\nHost Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered REIT that owns hotels and conducts operations through Host L.P., of which Host Inc. is the sole general partner and of which it holds approximately 99% of its common OP units as of December 31, 2024. The remainder of Host L.P.’s common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Host Inc. has the exclusive and complete responsibility for Host L.P.’s day-to-day management and control. \nHost Inc. is the largest lodging REIT in NAREIT’s composite index and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper upscale hotels. As of February 21, 2025, we own 81 hotels in the United States, Canada and Brazil and have minority ownership interests in an additional 40 hotels through joint ventures in the United States and in India. These hotels are operated primarily under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry. Most of our hotels are located in central business districts of major cities, near airports and in resort/conference destinations. \nOur customers fall into three broad groups: transient business, group business and contract business, which accounted for approximately 60%, 36%, and 4%, respectively, of our 2024 room sales. For a discussion of our customer categories, see “Item 1 Business – Our Customers”. \nUnderstanding Our Performance\nOur Revenues and Expenses.\n Our hotels are operated by third-party managers under long-term agreements, pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each hotel. We provide operating funds, or working capital, which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages, utilities, property taxes and other hotel-level expenses. We generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each month, which distribution reflects hotel-level sales less property-level operating expenses (excluding depreciation). \nOperations from our domestic portfolio account for approximately 98% of our total revenues and 2% relate to our five hotels in Canada and Brazil. The following table presents the components of our hotel revenues as a percentage of our total revenue:\n% of 2024\nRevenues\n \n•\nRooms revenues\n. Occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenues. The business mix of the hotel (group versus transient and retail versus discount business) is a significant driver of room rates.\n60 \n%\n•\nFood and beverage revenues\n. Food & beverage revenues consist of revenues from group functions, which may include banquet revenues and audio and visual revenues, as well as outlet revenues from the restaurants and lounges at our hotels.\n30 \n%\n•\nOther revenues\n. Occupancy, the nature of the hotel (e.g., resort) and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenues, such as attrition and cancelation fees, resort and destination fees, parking, golf courses, spas, entertainment and other guest services. This category also includes other rental revenues.\n10 \n%\n38\nTable of Contents\nHotel operating expenses represent approximately 99.7% of our total operating costs and expenses. The following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses:\n% of 2024\nOperating\nCosts and\nExpenses\n \n•\nRooms expenses\n. These costs include housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Occupancy is the major driver of rooms expenses. These costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages, as well as on the level of service and amenities that are provided.\n18 \n%\n•\nFood and beverage expenses\n. These expenses primarily include food, beverage and the associated labor costs and will correlate closely with food and beverage revenues. Group functions with banquet sales and audio and visual components generally will have lower overall costs as a percentage of revenues than outlet sales.\n24 \n%\n•\nOther departmental and support expenses\n. These expenses include labor and other costs associated with other ancillary revenues, such as parking, golf courses, spas, entertainment and other guest services, as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments, allocated brand costs, sales and marketing, repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs.\n29 \n%\n•\nManagement fees\n. Base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenues. Incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain thresholds.\n5 \n%\n•\nOther property-level expenses\n. These expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes, ground rent, equipment rent and property insurance. Many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels.\n9 \n%\n•\nDepreciation and amortization expense\n. This is a non-cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotels and the amounts of historical capital expenditures. This component also can include impairment expense.\n15 \n%\nThe expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations. It also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items. Taken separately, these costs represent approximately 57% of our rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses.\nKey Performance Indicators.\n The following key performance indicators commonly are used in the hospitality industry and we believe provide useful information to management and investors in order to compare our performance with the performance of other lodging REITs:\n•\nhotel occupancy\n is a volume indicator based on the percentage of available room nights that are sold;\n•\naverage daily rate\n \n(“ADR”) \nis a price indicator calculated by dividing rooms revenues by the number of rooms sold;\n•\nrevenues per available room (“RevPAR”)\n is used to evaluate hotel operations. RevPAR is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved. RevPAR does not include food and beverage, parking, or other guest service revenues generated by the hotel. Although RevPAR does not include these ancillary revenues, it is considered a key indicator of core revenues for many hotels; and\n•\ntotal revenues per available room (“Total RevPAR”)\n is a summary measure of hotel results calculated by dividing the sum of rooms, food and beverage and other ancillary services revenues by room nights available to guests for the period. It includes ancillary revenues that are not included in the calculation of RevPAR.\n39\nTable of Contents\nRevPAR changes that are driven by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels, as well as incremental operating profit, than do changes that are driven by average room rate. For example, increases in occupancy at a hotel will lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues, such as food and beverage revenues, as well as additional incremental costs (including housekeeping services, utilities and room amenity costs). RevPAR increases due to higher room rates, however, will not result in additional room-related costs, except those charged as a percentage of revenues. As a result, changes in RevPAR driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than do changes in RevPAR caused by occupancy levels.\nWe also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non-GAAP financial measures. Each of these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to GAAP performance measures such as total revenues, operating profit, net income and earnings per share. We provide a more detailed discussion of these non-GAAP financial measures, how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in “—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Our non-GAAP financial measures include:\n•\nNAREIT Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and Adjusted FFO per diluted share. \nWe use NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share as supplemental measures of company-wide profitability. NAREIT adopted FFO to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust NAREIT FFO for gains and losses on extinguishment of debt, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business.\n•\nComparable hotel EBITDA.\n Hotel EBITDA measures property-level results before debt service, depreciation and corporate-level expenses (as this is a property level measure) and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property-level profitability. We use comparable hotel EBITDA and associated margins to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels.\n•\nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre.\n Earnings before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) is a supplemental measure of our operating performance and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners who are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. NAREIT adopted EBITDA for real estate (“EBITDA\nre”\n) in order to promote an industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. We also adjust EBITDA\nre\n for property insurance gains and property damage losses, certain acquisition costs, litigation gains or losses outside the ordinary course of business and severance costs outside the ordinary course of business (“Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n”).\nSummary of 2024 Operating Results\nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations and the significant operating statistics for the two years ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except per share and hotel statistics):\nHistorical Income Statement Data:\n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n5,684 \n$\n5,311 \n7.0 \n%\nNet income\n707 \n752 \n(6.0 \n%)\nOperating profit\n875 \n827 \n5.8 \n%\nOperating profit margin under GAAP\n15.4 \n%\n15.6 \n%\n(20)\n bps\nEBITDAre \n⁽¹⁾\n$\n1,726 \n$\n1,632 \n5.8 \n%\nAdjusted EBITDAre \n⁽¹⁾\n1,656 \n1,629 \n1.7 \n%\nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n0.99 \n$\n1.04 \n(4.8 \n%)\nNAREIT FFO per diluted share \n⁽¹⁾\n1.97 \n1.92 \n2.6 \n%\nAdjusted FFO per diluted share\n ⁽¹⁾\n1.97 \n1.92 \n2.6 \n%\n40\nTable of Contents\nComparable Hotel Data:\n2024 Comparable Hotels ⁽¹⁾\n \n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nComparable hotel revenues \n⁽¹⁾\n$\n5,546 \n$\n5,418 \n2.4 \n%\nComparable hotel EBITDA \n⁽¹⁾\n1,622 \n1,617 \n0.3 \n%\nComparable hotel EBITDA margin \n⁽¹⁾\n29.2 \n%\n29.8 \n%\n(60)\n bps\nComparable hotel Total RevPAR \n⁽¹⁾\n$\n355.88 \n$\n348.70 \n2.1 \n%\nComparable hotel RevPAR \n⁽¹⁾\n216.06 \n214.15 \n0.9 \n%\n___________\n \n(1)\nEBITDAre, Adjusted EBITDAre, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share and comparable hotel operating results (including hotel revenues and hotel EBITDA and margins) are non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of the rules of the SEC. See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” and “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” for more information on these measures, including why we believe these supplemental measures are useful, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, and the limitations on the use of these supplemental measures. Additionally, comparable hotel results and statistics are based on 78 comparable hotels as of December 31, 2024 and include adjustments for non-comparable hotels, dispositions and acquisitions. See \"Comparable Hotel RevPAR Overview\" for results of the portfolio based on our ownership period, without these adjustments.\nRevenues\nTotal revenues increased $373 million, or 7.0%, compared to 2023, benefiting from the 2024 acquisitions of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown, 1 Hotel Central Park and The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay and also the results of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed in the first half of 2023 as a result of Hurricane Ian. However, this was partially offset by the closure of The Don CeSar for the fourth quarter of 2024 following the impacts of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. In addition, continued growth in group business, building on its recovery in 2023, drove improvements in food and beverage revenues. Comparable hotel RevPAR increased 0.9%, compared to 2023, due to an increase in average room rates, as occupancy remained flat, reflecting continued strong group demand, tempered by continued imbalance in outbound travel from the U.S. compared to international inbound travel and the slow recovery in Maui following the August 2023 wildfires. In 2024, performance at our Maui hotels impacted comparable hotel RevPAR by approximately 160 basis points for the full year.\nComparable hotel Total RevPAR increased 2.1% for the year due primarily to improvements in food and beverage revenues driven by the strength in group business, as well as strong spa and other ancillary revenues. The growth was led by our Denver, Nashville and Northern Virginia markets with increases of 13.2%, 12.9% and 10.3%, respectively, compared to 2023, through a combination of rate and occupancy growth, driven by strong group demand. Our hotels in Jacksonville and New Orleans also outperformed our portfolio with comparable hotel Total RevPAR increases of 7.2% and 7.1%, respectively. These strong performances were offset by comparable hotel Total RevPAR declines at our Atlanta and San Francisco/San Jose markets of 9.4% and 5.3%, respectively. The declines were driven primarily by a decrease in business travel and short-term transient demand, with Atlanta also affected by disruption from renovations. In addition, comparable hotel Total RevPAR at our Maui market declined by 11.0% due to the continuing impacts of the August 2023 Maui wildfires (see “Statement of Operations Results and Trends”). \nOperating Profit\nAs expected, we faced higher wages and inflationary pressures compared to 2023. This, coupled with Maui performance, led to an operating profit margin (calculated based on GAAP operating profit as a percentage of GAAP revenues) decline of 20 basis points to 15.4% in 2024, compared to 15.6% in 2023, despite an increase in net gains on insurance settlements. Operating profit margins under GAAP are also significantly affected by several items, including acquisitions, dispositions, depreciation expense and corporate expenses. Our comparable hotel EBITDA margins, which exclude these items, declined 60 basis points to 29.2% for the year, down from 29.8% in 2023 due to the trends discussed above. \nNet Income, Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n and Adjusted FFO per Diluted Share\nNet income for Host Inc. was $707 million, a decrease of $45 million, or 6.0%, from the prior year, reflecting the decrease in gains on asset sales of $71 million and an increase in interest expense of $24 million, partially offset by an increase in net gains on insurance settlements of $24 million. These results led to a 4.8% decrease in diluted earnings per common share for Host Inc. to $0.99. Adjusted EBITDA\nre, \nwhich excludes gain on sale of assets and interest expense, among other items, increased 1.7% to $1,656 million as a result of operations from our acquisitions and the resumption of \n41\nTable of Contents\noperations at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed during the first half of 2023, despite a $43 million decrease in business interruption gains. Adjusted FFO per diluted share increased 2.6% to $1.97 in 2024, reflecting the increase in Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n as well as the impact of share repurchases in 2024 and 2023. \nThe trends and transactions described above for Host Inc. affected similarly the operating results for Host L.P., as the only significant difference between the Host Inc. and Host L.P. statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the unaffiliated limited partners of Host L.P. \n2025 Outlook\nThroughout 2024, group business at our properties continued to improve and group revenue on the books remains strong for 2025. Average rates remained elevated at our resorts compared to pre-pandemic levels, although they have moderated from post-pandemic highs. However, further growth has been hampered by the slow recovery from the wildfires in Maui, one of our largest markets by revenues, and the slower post-pandemic recovery of the San Francisco market. These trends are expected to continue into 2025. \nOn the macroeconomic front, the U.S. economy remained resilient during 2024 with real U.S. GDP growth of 2.8%, as unemployment remained at low levels and business investment grew at a robust 3.7%. U.S. lodging demand is correlated to changes in gross domestic product (GDP) and business investment, although the recovery of the industry post-pandemic has lagged that of the economy. Inflation moderated substantially during the year but remains a concern for 2025, with fewer rate cuts expected in the coming year. In addition, the new administration has brought heightened uncertainty due to anticipated changes to trade policy, tax policy and government spending. Other risks to economic growth remain, including geopolitical instability throughout the globe, high interest rates and volatile oil prices. As a result, leading indicators point toward slower economic growth in 2025. As of February 2025, Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus projects real U.S. GDP growth of 2.2%, reflecting a deceleration from 2024. Business investment growth is also anticipated to slow over the coming year, averaging 2.3%, down from 3.7% in 2024. \nHotel supply growth is anticipated to remain below the historical average, although we expect to see above-average growth in a few markets where our hotels are located, such as Nashville and Austin. Supply chain challenges have resulted in project delays across the U.S., and a tight lending environment has created construction financing challenges for future projects. We anticipate that the construction pipeline will remain modest until macroeconomic uncertainty moderates and interest rates decline further. \nBased on the trends noted, we expect comparable hotel RevPAR growth for the full year 2025 will be between 0.5% and 2.5%. In addition, we expect margins to decline in comparison to 2024, driven by higher wages and benefits, including increases driven by new union contracts in certain cities, as well as growth in insurance and real estate taxes. \nAs discussed above, the current outlook for the lodging industry remains uncertain, reflecting varying analyst assumptions surrounding the impact of higher interest rates, inflation, the recovery in Maui and escalating geopolitical conflicts. Therefore, there can be no assurances as to lodging demand performance for any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, the slow recovery in Maui or deteriorating macroeconomic conditions. For more information on the risks that can affect our future results, see \nPart I,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A.\n “Risk Factors.” \nStrategic Initiatives\nFor 2025, we intend to continue our disciplined approach to capital allocation to strengthen our portfolio and to deliver stockholder value through multiple levers, which may include, over time, acquiring hotels or investing in our portfolio. We intend to take advantage of our strong capital position and overall scale to acquire upper-upscale and luxury properties, through single asset or portfolio acquisitions, that we believe have sustainable competitive advantages to drive long-term value to the extent favorable pricing opportunities arise. At the same time, we will opportunistically sell hotels when market conditions permit. We also continue to critically analyze our portfolio to seek to take advantage of the inherent value of our real estate for its highest and best use. \nAcquisitions\n. \nDuring 2024, we completed the following acquisitions:\n•\nthe 215-room 1 Hotel Nashville and 506-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for $530 million;\n•\nthe 234-room 1 Hotel Central Park for $265 million; and\n42\nTable of Contents\n•\nthe 450-room Turtle Bay Resort, including a 49-acre land parcel entitled for development, for a total purchase price of $680 million, which is net of $45 million in key money received from Marriott International as part of an agreement to transition management to Marriott and convert the property to The Ritz-Carlton brand. The property has been renamed The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay.\nCapital Projects. \nWe continue to pursue opportunities to enhance asset value through select capital improvements, including projects that are designed to increase the eco-efficiency of our hotels, incorporate elements of sustainable design and replace aging equipment and systems with more efficient technology. During 2024, we spent approximately $548 million on capital expenditures, of which $260 million represented return on investment (“ROI”) capital expenditures, $252 million represented renewal and replacement projects and $36 million was for hurricane restoration work. This included completing the final steps of our restoration efforts following Hurricane Ian of bringing the permanent central energy plant online at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. For all properties impacted by Hurricane Ian, we estimate the total property reconstruction and remediation costs, including significant enhancements, was approximately $315 million, of which approximately 30% related to remediation costs. In 2024, we reached a final settlement with our insurance providers on covered costs related to damage and disruption caused by Hurricane Ian, which totaled $308 million. In total, $99 million of the insurance receipts were recognized as a gain on business interruption. Another major capital project completed during the year was the repositioning renovations at The Singer Oceanfront Resort, Curio Collection by Hilton, including rooms, public space, and food and beverage outlets.\nIn addition, hotels within certain regions are subject to environmental and weather-related events, including hurricanes, wildfires, floods, rising sea levels, mudslides, earthquakes, and other natural perils. To mitigate some of these physical risks, we execute capital expenditure projects, including replacements and restorations of exterior walls, doors and windows, roofs, grounds, relocated/elevated critical equipment and distributed energy systems to further increase the resilience of our hotels. A portion of our capital expenditures for 2024 include these types of projects, which we expect to continue in future years. While the number of projects and overall cost varies from year to year, on average approximately 6% our capital expenditures have related to these types of projects over the past six years. The enhanced resilience projects implemented during the reconstruction of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples were successful in minimizing damage to the resort during the two hurricanes that made landfall in 2024; however, no assurances can be made as to whether these enhanced resiliency projects will be successful in mitigating the damage from future environmental and weather-related events, especially as the frequency and severity of these events are expected to increase over time.\nIn collaboration with Hyatt, we initiated a transformational capital program in 2023 at six properties in our portfolio, the Grand Hyatt Atlanta in Buckhead, Grand Hyatt Washington, Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego, Hyatt Regency Austin, Hyatt Regency Washington on Capitol Hill, and Hyatt Regency Reston. These investments are intended to position the targeted hotels to compete better in their respective markets while seeking to enhance long-term performance. During 2024, we spent approximately $155 million on this program, which is included in ROI capital projects. The total investment is expected to be approximately $550 million to $600 million, two-thirds of which we were planning to invest as part of our capital plan over the next few years. We expect to invest between $125 million and $200 million per year on this program. Hyatt has agreed to provide additional priority returns on the agreed upon investments and operating profit guarantees totaling $40 million to offset expected business disruptions. We received approximately $9 million of the operating profit guarantees in 2024 from Hyatt and expect to receive approximately $27 million in 2025.\nFor 2025, we expect total capital expenditures of $580 million to $670 million, consisting of ROI projects of approximately $270 million to $315 million, renewal and replacement expenditures of $240 million to $275 million, and $70 million to $80 million for the restoration work from the damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. The ROI projects include approximately $170 million to $180 million for the Hyatt transformational capital program. \nAlso in 2023, we announced and broke ground on a project to develop and sell 40 fee-simple condominiums on a five-acre development parcel to be Four Seasons-branded and managed residences at the Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World\n®\n Resort. Construction of the mid-rise building is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2025 and the villas are expected to complete in the first half of 2026. In 2024, we spent $64 million in development costs for this project and began marketing the units, resulting in buyer commitments for nearly one-third of the units. For 2025, the development costs for this project are expected to be $75 million to $85 million.\nFinancing transactions\n. \nOn April 1, 2024, we repaid $400 million of 3⅞% Series G senior notes at maturity. \nOn May 10, 2024, we issued $600 million of 5.700% Series K senior notes for proceeds of $584 million, net of original issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The net proceeds from this issuance were used to repay all \n43\nTable of Contents\noutstanding amounts then outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility. The Series K senior notes have been designated as green bonds, and an amount equal to the net proceeds was allocated to finance and/or refinance one or more eligible green projects.\nOn August 12, 2024, we issued $700 million of 5.500% Series L senior notes for proceeds of $683 million, net of\noriginal issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The net proceeds from this issuance were used in part to repay all $525 million of borrowings then outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility, including amounts borrowed in connection with the acquisitions of The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay and 1 Hotel Central Park. \nWe believe that our ability to maintain an investment grade balance sheet and well-laddered maturity schedule is an important factor in our investment strategy. As of December 31, 2024, we have a debt balance of $5.1 billion, our weighted average interest rate is 4.7%, and our weighted average debt maturity is 5.2 years.\nFor a detailed discussion, see “—Liquidity and Capital Resources.” For a detailed discussion of our significant debt activities, see Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5. Debt” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShare Repurchase and Dividends.\n In 2024, we repurchased 6.3 million shares at an average price of $16.99 per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $107 million, under our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2024, we have $685 million available for repurchase under the program.\nDuring 2024, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors declared dividends totaling $0.90 per share on its common stock, including a fourth quarter special dividend of $0.10 per share. Accordingly, Host L.P. made distributions of $0.9193446 per unit with respect to its common OP units for 2024. On February 19, 2025, we announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share on our common stock. The dividend will be paid on April 15, 2025 to stockholders of record on March 31, 2025. The amount of any future dividends will be based on our policy of distributing, over time, 100% of our taxable income and will be determined by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors.\nThere can be no assurances that any future dividends will match or exceed those set forth above for any number of reasons, including a decline in operations or an increase in liquidity needs. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to fund our capital expenditures programs and to take advantage of investment opportunities.  \n44\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations \nThe following table reflects certain line items from our audited consolidated statements of operations for the two years ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except percentages):\n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n5,684 \n$\n5,311 \n7.0 \n%\nOperating costs and expenses:\nProperty-level costs \n⁽¹⁾\n4,796 \n4,438 \n8.1 \nCorporate and other expenses\n123 \n132 \n(6.8)\nNet gain on insurance settlements\n110 \n86 \n27.9 \nOperating profit\n875 \n827 \n5.8\nInterest expense\n215 \n191 \n12.6 \nOther gains\n— \n71 \n(100.0)\nProvision for income taxes\n14 \n36 \n(61.1)\nHost Inc.:\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n10 \n12 \n(16.7)\nNet income attributable to Host Inc.\n697 \n740 \n(5.8)\nHost L.P.:\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests\n1 \n1 \n— \nNet income attributable to Host L.P.\n706 \n751 \n(6.0)\n \n___________\n(1)\nAmounts represent total operating costs and expenses from our audited consolidated statements of operations, less corporate and other expenses and net gain on insurance settlements.\nStatement of Operations Results and Trends\nOperations improved in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting (i) the operations of our recent acquisitions, including 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown acquired in April 2024, 1 Hotel Central Park acquired in July 2024, and The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay acquired in July 2024 (collectively, the \"2024 Acquisitions\"); (ii) strong group business which led to improvements in food and beverage revenues, and (iii) the resumption of operations at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed during the first half of 2023 as a result of Hurricane Ian. The improvements were partially offset by a slow recovery in Maui and the closures of Alila Ventana Big Sur, which closed at the end of March 2024 and reopened on May 22, 2024, following the collapse of a portion of Highway 1 in California, and The Don CeSar, which closed on September 25, 2024 and remains closed due to Hurricanes Helene and Milton.\nThe following table presents revenues in accordance with GAAP and includes all consolidated hotels for the two years ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except percentages):\n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nRevenues:\nRooms\n$\n3,426 \n$\n3,244 \n5.6 \n%\nFood and beverage\n1,716 \n1,582 \n8.5 \n%\nOther\n542 \n485 \n11.8 \n%\nTotal revenues\n$\n5,684 \n$\n5,311 \n7.0 \n%\nRooms\n. Total rooms revenues increased $182 million, or 5.6%, in 2024, reflecting the operations of the 2024 Acquisitions and the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. Rooms revenues at our comparable hotels increased $40 million, or 1.2%, driven by an increase in average room rates compared to 2023. \n45\nTable of Contents\nFood and beverage\n. Total food and beverage (\"F&B\") revenues increased $134 million, or 8.5%, in 2024, due to the 2024 Acquisitions and the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. Comparable F&B revenues increased $57 million, or 3.6%, driven by improvements in banquet and audio-visual revenues at resort and convention hotels as group demand remained strong throughout the year. \nOther revenues\n. Total other revenues increased $57 million, or 11.8%, in 2024, driven by results from the 2024 Acquisitions and the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples. Other revenues at our comparable hotels increased $31 million, or 6.2%, primarily due to strong spa and other ancillary revenues.\nProperty-level Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents consolidated property-level operating expenses in accordance with GAAP and includes all consolidated hotels for the two years ended December 31, 2024 (in millions, except percentages):\n2024\n2023\nChange\n \nExpenses:\nRooms\n$\n849 \n$\n787 \n7.9 \n%\nFood and beverage\n1,137 \n1,042 \n9.1 \n%\nOther departmental and support expenses\n1,383 \n1,280 \n8.0 \n%\nManagement fees\n254 \n249 \n2.0 \n%\nOther property-level expenses\n411 \n383 \n7.3 \n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n762 \n697 \n9.3 \n%\nTotal property-level operating expenses\n$\n4,796 \n$\n4,438 \n8.1 \n%\nOur operating costs and expenses, which consist of both fixed and variable components, are affected by several factors. Rooms expenses are affected mainly by occupancy, which drives costs related to items such as housekeeping, reservation systems, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs. Food and beverage expenses correlate closely with food and beverage revenues and are affected by occupancy and the mix of business between banquet, audio-visual and outlet sales. However, the most significant expense for the rooms, food and beverage, and other departmental and support expenses is wages and employee benefits, which comprise approximately 57% of these expenses in any given year. During 2024, these expenses increased approximately 5% compared to 2023, primarily due to an overall increase in general wage rates and benefits. Wage and benefit rate inflation is expected to be approximately 6% in 2025.\nOther property-level expenses consist of property taxes, the amounts and structure of which are highly dependent on local jurisdiction taxing authorities, and property and general liability insurance, all of which do not necessarily increase or decrease based on similar changes in revenues at our hotels.\nThe increases in expenses for rooms, food and beverage, other departmental and support, and management fees were generally due to the corresponding increases in revenues due to the 2024 Acquisitions, the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, and also reflected increased expenses at our comparable hotels primarily due to increased wages and benefits, as follows:\nRooms\n. Rooms expenses increased $62 million, or 7.9%, in 2024. Our comparable hotels rooms expenses increased $33 million, or 4.1%, in 2024, driven by an overall increase in wage rates. Wages and benefits represented approximately 67% of our 2024 and 2023 rooms expenses.\nFood and beverage. \nF&B expenses increased $95 million, or 9.1%, in 2024. For our comparable hotels, F&B expenses increased $41 million, or 3.9%, in 2024. Overall, F&B costs as a percentage of revenues remained consistent year over year. Wages and benefits represented approximately 69% of our 2024 and 2023 F&B expenses.\nOther departmental and support expenses\n. Other departmental and support expenses increased $103 million, or 8.0%, in 2024. On a comparable hotel basis, other departmental and support expenses increased $62 million, or 3.2%. These increases were primarily due to higher wage expense. Wages and benefits represented approximately 41% of our 2024 and 2023 other departmental and support expenses.\n46\nTable of Contents\nManagement fees\n. Total management fees increased $5 million, or 2.0%, in 2024. Base management fees, which generally are calculated as a percentage of total revenues, increased $10 million, or 6.7%, compared to 2023. At our comparable hotels, base management fees increased $6 million, or 3.8%, for 2024. Incentive management fees, which generally are based on the amount of operating profit at each hotel after we receive a priority return on our investment, decreased $5 million, primarily due to the closure of The Don CeSar, and the decrease at our comparable hotels of $3 million, or 2.8%, which was due to renovations at certain properties. \nOther property-level expenses\n. These expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance. Other property-level expenses increased $28 million, or 7.3%, in 2024, due to increases in property insurance premiums and property taxes. Other property-level expenses at our comparable hotels increased $12 million, or 3.1%, in 2024. Other property-level expenses were partially offset by the receipt of operating profit guarantees from Marriott and Hyatt under the transformational capital programs in both 2024 and 2023.\nOther Income and Expenses \nCorporate and other expenses\n.\n Corporate and other expenses include the following items (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nGeneral and administrative costs\n$\n93 \n$\n85 \nNon-cash stock-based compensation expense\n24\n30 \nLitigation accruals\n6\n17 \n       Total        \n$\n123 \n$\n132 \nGeneral and administrative costs primarily consist of wages and benefits, travel, corporate insurance, legal fees, audit fees, building rent and systems costs. The overall decrease in corporate and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2024 is primarily due to a decrease in litigation accruals, partially offset by an increase in systems costs and other administrative fees.\nNet gain on insurance settlements.\n The following table details our gain on insurance settlements for property damage and business interruption, net of property damage and remediation losses, related to Hurricanes Ian, Helene and Milton, the Maui wildfires and other weather events (in millions): \nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nProperty damage\nHurricanes Helene/Milton\n(6)\n— \nHurricane Ian\n72\n3 \nOther\n4\n— \nBusiness interruption\nHurricane Ian\n19\n80 \nMaui wildfires\n21\n— \nOther\n—\n3 \nNet gain on insurance settlements\n$\n110 \n$\n86 \n47\nTable of Contents\nInterest expense\n.\n Interest expense increased $24 million, or 12.6%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher outstanding debt balances during 2024 as we issued additional senior notes to fund our 2024 Acquisitions. The following table presents certain components of interest expense (in millions): \nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nCash interest expense \n⁽¹⁾\n$\n205 \n$\n178 \nNon-cash interest expense\n10 \n9 \nCash debt extinguishment costs \n⁽¹⁾\n— \n3 \nNon-cash debt extinguishment costs\n— \n1 \nTotal interest expense\n$\n215 \n$\n191 \n___________\n(1)\nTotal cash interest expense paid was $172 million and $183 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, which includes an increase (decrease) due to the change in accrued interest of $(33) million and $2 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther gains.\n The following table presents the gains recognized on the sale of assets and other (in millions):\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\nThe Camby, Autograph Collection\n$\n— \n$\n69 \nOther\n— \n2 \n$\n— \n$\n71 \nEquity in earnings of affiliates\n. Equity in earnings of affiliates increased $1 million, or 16.7%, in 2024, reflecting increased earnings from our investment in the Noble joint venture, partially offset by a $6 million loss for our share of an inventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture.\nProvision for income taxes. \nWe lease substantially all our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as TRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Taxable income or loss generated/incurred by the TRS primarily represents hotel-level operations and the aggregate rent paid to Host L.P. by the TRS, on which we record an income tax provision or benefit. In 2024 and 2023, we recorded an income tax provision of $14 million and $36 million, respectively, due primarily to the profitability of hotel operations retained by the TRS, including $40 million and $83 million of business interruption insurance gains recorded in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The 2024 tax provision was partially offset by the recognition of an income tax benefit due to federal income tax credits resulting from the installation of a co-generation plant at one of our properties. As a result of legislation enacted by the CARES Act in 2020, a portion of the 2020 domestic net operating loss was carried back to 2017-2019 in order to procure a refund of U.S. federal corporate income taxes previously paid. The remaining portion of the 2020 net operating loss, as well as the entire 2021 net operating loss incurred by our TRS, may be carried forward indefinitely, subject to an annual limit on the use thereof equal to 80% of annual taxable income. See also Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 7. Income Taxes” for a discussion of our income taxes.\nComparable Hotel RevPAR Overview\nWe discuss operating results for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis. Comparable hotels are those properties that we consolidate as of the reporting periods being compared. Comparable hotels do not include the results of hotels sold or classified as held-for-sale, hotels that have sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or hotels that have undergone large-scale capital projects, in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer during the reporting periods being compared. We believe this provides investors with a better understanding of underlying growth trends for our current portfolio, without impact from properties that experienced closures. We have removed The Don CeSar, Alila Ventana Big Sur, and The Ritz-Carlton, Naples from our comparable operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 due to closures. See “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” below for more information on how we determine our comparable hotels.

The information below is derived from business mix results from the 78 comparable hotels owned as of December 31, 2024.\nImprovements in 2024 compared to 2023 were primarily driven by an increase in group business, through increases in average rates and occupancy, as our convention and downtown properties continued to benefit from group demand. The growth in group demand was partially offset by a 0.3% decrease in transient revenue, reflecting the impacts of the Maui wildfires and moderating leisure demand.  \n50\nTable of Contents\nThe following are the results of our transient, group and contract business:\nYear ended December 31, 2024\n \nTransient\nbusiness\n \nGroup\nbusiness\n \nContract\nbusiness\n \nRoom nights (in thousands)\n5,966 \n4,256 \n752 \nPercentage change in room nights vs. same period in 2023\n(0.3 \n%)\n0.8 \n%\n2.7 \n%\nRooms Revenues (in millions)\n$\n2,016 \n$\n1,196 \n$\n155 \nPercentage change in rooms revenues vs. same period in 2023\n(0.3 \n%)\n2.7 \n%\n11.5 \n%\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n The liquidity and capital resources of Host Inc. and Host L.P. are derived primarily from the activities of Host L.P., which generates the capital required by our business from hotel operations, the incurrence of debt, the issuance of OP units or the sale of hotels. Host Inc. is a REIT and its only significant asset is the ownership of general and limited partner interests of Host L.P.; therefore, its financing and investing activities are conducted through Host L.P., except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock. Proceeds from common and preferred stock issuances by Host Inc. are contributed to Host L.P. in exchange for common and preferred OP units. Additionally, funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends or to repurchase its stock are provided by Host L.P. Therefore, while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P., we have not included a separate discussion of liquidity and capital resources as the discussion below applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P. \nOverview. \nWe look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash, debt and equity to provide financial flexibility given the inherent volatility of the lodging industry. We believe this strategy has resulted in a better cost of debt capital, allowing us to complete opportunistic investments and acquisitions and positioning us to manage potential declines in operations throughout the lodging cycle. We have structured our debt profile to maintain a balanced maturity schedule and to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt. Currently, only one of our consolidated hotels is encumbered by mortgage debt. Over the past several years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had decreased our leverage as measured by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio and reduced our debt service obligations, leading to an increase in our fixed charge coverage ratio. As a result, the company was well positioned at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic with sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to withstand the severe slowdown in U.S. economic activity and lodging demand brought on by the pandemic. We intend to use available cash in the near term predominantly to fund, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to fund, corporate expenses, capital expenditures, hotel acquisitions and dividends and remain well positioned to execute additional investment transactions to the extent opportunities arise.\nCash Requirements. \nWe use cash for acquisitions, capital expenditures, debt payments, operating costs, and corporate and other expenses, as well as for dividends and distributions to stockholders and Host L.P. limited partners and stock and OP unit repurchases. Our primary sources of cash include cash from operations, proceeds from the sale of assets, borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances. In the short term, our cash obligations include $500 million of senior notes due in June 2025. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to repay them at maturity, or we can refinance the notes with our access to capital markets. For our long-term senior note and credit facility obligations, we historically have refinanced these amounts prior to their maturity through the issuance of new senior notes or the entry into new credit facility agreements. Whether we will refinance the June 2025 senior notes upon maturity with new senior notes will depend upon market conditions generally, including the interest rate environment, and our cash requirements. Also, in the short term, our cash obligations include the minimum lease payments on our ground leases, which in 2025 are approximately $31 million, and most of our other operating obligations. In the long term, our ground lease payments are the longest time horizon obligations and currently run up to 100 years. For a summary of our obligations under our ground leases, see Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report.\nIn addition to the liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, under our capital expenditures program, we have budgeted to spend $580 million to $670 million in 2025. Commitments for capital expenditures generally run less than two years for the life of the project. In the long term, renewal and replacement (\"R&R\") capital expenditures are designed to maintain the quality and competitiveness of our hotels and typically occur at intervals of seven to ten years. The projects are primarily funded through the FF&E reserves established at each hotel. Average annual R&R spend over the last five years has been $245 million. \n51\nTable of Contents\nOur 2025 capital expenditures budget includes approximately $70 million to $80 million for restoration work at our Florida properties affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton in 2024, primarily at The Don CeSar, which sustained significant damage and remains closed. We estimate the total property reconstruction and remediation costs from the storms, including resiliency enhancements, for The Don CeSar to be approximately $100 million to $110 million of which approximately 25-30% relates to remediation costs. We believe our insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover the property remediation and reconstruction costs and the near-term loss of business in excess of our deductibles of approximately $20 million, although the timing for the receipt of insurance proceeds remains uncertain. \nAs part of our investment in our Noble joint venture, we have made a $211.5 million capital commitment to Noble Fund V and an additional capital commitment of $30 million through a related co-investment. As of December 31, 2024, we have funded $72 million and $13 million of these commitments, respectively, with the remaining amounts expected to be paid within the next two years.\nAs a REIT, Host Inc. is required to pay dividends to its stockholders in an amount equal to at least 90% of its taxable income, excluding net capital gain, on an annual basis. See also Part II Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 17. Legal Proceedings, Guarantees and Contingencies” for a discussion of obligations under contingent liabilities or guarantees and a more detailed description of the damage caused by Hurricanes Helene and Milton. \nCapital Resources.\n As of December 31, 2024, we had $554 million of cash and cash equivalents, $242 million  in our FF&E escrow reserve and $1.5 billion available under the revolver portion of our credit facility. In the near term, with the exception of the $500 million Series E senior notes due in June 2025, as described above, we expect to fund our above cash requirements, including our dividends, capital expenditures program, debt service and operating and corporate costs, primarily through hotel operations and our existing cash reserves. Based on our cash balance at December 31, 2024 and our expected cash obligations, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity to meet our near-term obligations. Future acquisitions and/or obligations also may be funded through a draw on the available portion of the revolver under our credit facility, equity issuances, or asset sales.\nWe depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth, including acquisitions. As a result, the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure. Our financial flexibility, including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends, make distributions and make investments, is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility and senior notes, which include, among other things, the allowable amounts of leverage, interest coverage and fixed charges. \nThe following graph summarizes our aggregate debt maturities as of February 21, 2025:\n \n___________\n(1)\nThe first term loan under our credit facility that is due in 2027 has an extension option that would extend maturity of the instrument to 2028, subject to meeting certain conditions, including payment of a fee. The second term loan tranche that is due in 2028 does not have an extension option.\n(2)\nMortgage and other debt excludes principal amortization of $2 million each year from 2025-2027 for the mortgage loan that matures in 2027.\n52\nTable of Contents\nGiven the total amount of our debt and our maturity schedule, we may continue to redeem or repurchase senior notes from time to time, taking advantage of favorable market conditions. In February 2023, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to $1.0 billion of senior notes other than in accordance with their respective terms, of which the entire amount remains available under this authority. We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. Repurchases of debt will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. Any retirement before the maturity date will affect earnings and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the accelerated expensing of previously deferred and capitalized financing costs. Accordingly, considering our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile and given prevailing conditions and relative pricing in the capital markets, we may, at any time, subject to applicable securities laws and the requirements of our credit facility and senior notes, be considering, or be in discussions with respect to, the repurchase or issuance of exchangeable debentures and/or senior notes or the repurchase or sale of our common stock. Any such transactions may, subject to applicable securities laws, occur simultaneously. \nTwo programs currently are in place relating to purchases and sales of our common stock. First, under our common stock repurchase program, common stock may be purchased from time to time depending upon market conditions and may be purchased in the open market or through private transactions or by other means, including principal transactions with various financial institutions, like accelerated share repurchases, forwards, options, and similar transactions and through one or more trading plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The plan does not obligate us to repurchase any specific number or any specific dollar amount of shares and may be suspended at any time at our discretion. In the fourth quarter of 2024, no shares were repurchased. For full year 2024, we repurchased 6.3 million shares at an average price of $16.99 per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $107 million. At December 31, 2024, we had $685 million available for repurchase under the program.\nSecond, on May 31, 2023, we entered into a distribution agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Jefferies LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Truist Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agents pursuant to which Host Inc. may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of Host Inc. common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $600 million. The sales will be made in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market” offerings under the SEC rules. We may sell shares of Host Inc. common stock under this program from time to time based on market conditions, although we are not under an obligation to sell any shares. We may sell shares when we believe conditions are advantageous and there is a compelling use of proceeds, including to fund future potential acquisitions or other investment opportunities. The agreement also contemplates that, in addition to the offering and sale of shares to or through the sales agents, we may enter into separate forward sale agreements with each of the forward purchasers named in the agreement. No shares were issued in 2023 or 2024. As of December 31, 2024, there was $600 million of remaining capacity under the agreement. \nWe continue to explore potential acquisitions and dispositions. We anticipate that any such future acquisitions will be funded by cash, debt issuances by Host L.P., equity offerings of Host Inc., issuances of OP units by Host L.P., or proceeds from sales of hotels. Given the nature of these transactions, we can make no assurances that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotels that we may review, bid on or negotiate to purchase or that we will be successful in disposing of any one or more of our hotels. We may acquire additional hotels or dispose of hotels through various structures, including transactions involving single assets, portfolios, joint ventures, acquisitions of the securities or assets of other REITs or distributions of hotels to our stockholders.\nSources and Uses of Cash. \nIn 2024, our primary sources of cash included cash from operations and proceeds from debt issuances. Our primary uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions, capital expenditures, operating costs, debt repayments, share repurchases and distributions to equity holders. We anticipate that our sources and uses of cash will be similar in 2025. \nCash Provided by Operating Activities\n. Our net cash provided by operating activities for 2024 was $1,498 million, an increase of $57 million compared to 2023, reflecting the reopening of The Ritz-Carlton, Naples, which was closed for the first half of 2023, as well as operations from our 2024 Acquisitions, partially offset by payments for the development of condo units at Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World\n®\n Resort.\nCash Used in Investing Activities\n. Approximately $2,040 million of cash was used in investing activities during 2024 compared to $183 million in 2023. The increase reflects the significant acquisition and joint venture investment activity in 2024 compared to the disposition-related activity in 2023 as detailed in the charts below. Additionally, cash used in investing activities included $548 million of capital expenditures in 2024, compared to $646 million in 2023. These \n53\nTable of Contents\namounts include certain internal costs and interest expense associated with our capital expenditures projects that have been capitalized in accordance with GAAP. These capitalized costs were $18 million, $24 million and $20 million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nThe following tables summarize significant acquisitions, dispositions and investments in affiliates from January 1, 2023 through February 21, 2025 (in millions):\nTransaction Date\nDescription of Transaction\nInvestment\n \nAcquisitions/Investments\nJanuary - December\n2024\nInvestment in Noble JV\n$\n(52)\nJuly\n2024\nAcquisition of The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay \n(1)\n(680)\nJuly\n2024\nAcquisition of 1 Hotel Central Park\n(265)\nApril\n2024\nAcquisition of 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown\n(530)\nTotal acquisitions/investments\n$\n(1,527)\n \n___________\n(1)\nInvestment amount represents a sales price of $725 million net of $45 million of key money received from Marriott International in connection with the conversion of the property to The Ritz-Carlton brand and includes the acquisition of a 49-acre land parcel entitled for development.

The loan was repaid in November 2023.\n(4)\nIn connection with the sale of the Sheraton Boston, we extended a $163 million bridge loan to the purchaser. The loan was repaid in September 2023.\nCash Used in Financing Activities\n. Net cash used in financing activities was $13 million for 2024, compared to $771 million in 2023. Cash used in financing activities in 2024 and 2023 included the payment of common stock dividends and common stock repurchases, and, in 2024, these were mostly offset by a net issuance of senior notes of $867 million.\nWe utilized the revolver under our credit facility for various funding needs in 2024 with all borrowings repaid by year end.

The Series K senior notes are due in July 2034, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1, commencing January 1, 2025. The Series K senior notes were issued as a “green bond,” and we allocated an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the Series K senior notes to finance and/or refinance one or more eligible green projects, including the April 2024 acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Nashville Downtown, each of which has received LEED Silver certification. Following the allocation to eligible green projects, the net proceeds of this issuance were used to repay all $215 million of borrowings that were outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility at that time. The Series K senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the July 1, 2034 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series K senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes.\nOn August 12, 2024, we issued $700 million of 5.500% Series L senior notes in an underwritten public offering for proceeds of approximately $683 million, net of original issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The Series L senior notes are due in April 2035 and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2025. The net proceeds were used in part to repay all $525 million of borrowings then outstanding under the revolver portion of our senior credit facility, including amounts borrowed during the third quarter in connection with the acquisitions of The Ritz-Carlton O’ahu, Turtle Bay and 1 Hotel Central Park. The Series L senior notes are not redeemable prior to 90 days before the April 15, 2035 maturity date, except at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series L senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes.\nThe following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indenture governing the various senior notes issued by Host L.P. We pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above. Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of Host L.P.’s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of Host L.P. Currently there are no guarantees provided with respect to the senior notes, but we have agreed that all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee other Host L.P. debt must similarly provide guarantees with respect to the senior notes.\nAll of our outstanding senior notes at December 31, 2024 were issued after we attained an investment grade rating and have covenants customary for investment grade debt and covenants that are similar to each other series of our senior notes. These covenants are primarily limitations on our ability to incur additional debt. There are no restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\nUnder the terms of our senior notes, Host L.P.’s ability to incur debt is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions, including the achievement of an EBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio of at least 1.5x by Host L.P. As calculated, this ratio excludes from interest expense items such as call premiums and deferred financing charges that are included in interest expense on Host L.P.’s audited consolidated statement of operations. In addition, the calculation is \n56\nTable of Contents\nbased on Host L.P.’s pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters, giving effect to certain transactions, such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings, as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Other covenants limiting Host L.P.’s ability to incur debt include maintaining total debt of less than 65% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values), maintaining secured debt of less than 40% of adjusted total assets (using undepreciated real estate book values) and maintaining total unencumbered assets of at least 150% of the aggregate principal amount of outstanding unsecured debt of Host L.P. and its subsidiaries. So long as Host L.P. maintains the required level of interest coverage and satisfies these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture, it may incur additional debt. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we have met the minimum financial covenant levels under our senior notes indentures. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the senior notes indenture for our senior notes and our actual credit ratios as of December 31, 2024:\nActual Ratio\nCovenant Requirement\nUnencumbered assets tests\n438 \n%\nMinimum ratio of 150%\nTotal indebtedness to total assets\n23 \n%\nMaximum ratio of 65%\nSecured indebtedness to total assets\n<1%\nMaximum ratio of 40%\nEBITDA-to-interest coverage ratio\n7.0x\nMinimum ratio of 1.5x\nCredit Facility.\n On January 4, 2023, we entered into the sixth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $1.5 billion. The revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, Mexican pesos, of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $500 million, subject to a lower amount in the case of Mexican peso borrowings. The credit facility also provides for a term loan facility of $1 billion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $100 million for swingline borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars and a subfacility of up to $100 million for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to add in the future $500 million of commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions.\nThe revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of January 4, 2027, which date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of either a 1-year extension option or two 6-month extension options, each of which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties. One $500 million term loan tranche has an initial maturity date of January 4, 2027, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of one 1 -year extension option, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $500 million term loan tranche has a maturity date of January 4, 2028, which date may not be extended.\nNeither the revolving credit facility nor the term loans, as applicable, requires any scheduled amortization payments prior to maturity. The term loans are subject to the same terms and conditions as those in the credit facility regarding subsidiary guarantees, operational covenants, financial covenants and events of default (as discussed below).\nGuarantees. \nSimilar to our senior note indenture, the credit facility requires all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guaranty Host L.P. senior unsecured debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. Currently, there are no such guarantees.\nPrepayments. \nVoluntary prepayments of revolver borrowings and term loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty. \nFinancial Covenants. \nThe credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage. We are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA (“leverage ratio”) is not in excess of 7.25x, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than 1.75x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than 1.25x. These calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred \n57\nTable of Contents\nfinancing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility, and non-cash interest expense, all of which are included in interest expense on our audited consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept, pursuant to which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $100 million are deducted from our total debt balance. \nWe are in compliance with all of our financial covenants under the credit facility. The following table summarizes the financial tests contained in the credit facility and our actual credit ratios as of December 31, 2024: \nActual Ratio\nCovenant Requirement\n for all years\nLeverage ratio\n2.7x\nMaximum ratio of 7.25x\nFixed charge coverage ratio\n5.5x\nMinimum ratio of 1.25x\nUnsecured interest coverage ratio ⁽¹⁾\n7.0x\nMinimum ratio of 1.75x\n___________\n(1)\nIf at any time our leverage ratio is above 7.0x, our minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio requirement will decrease to 1.50x. \nInterest and Fees.\n The 2023 amendment and restatement also converted the underlying reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points. We pay interest on U.S. dollar revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to SOFR (plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points) plus a margin ranging from 72.5 to 140 basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating). We also pay a facility fee on the total $1.5 billion revolver commitment ranging from 12.5 to 30 basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. We also may elect to pay interest on revolver and term loan borrowings using a base rate plus a margin that is similarly determined based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating. The credit facility includes a sustainability pricing adjustment that can result in a change in the interest rate applicable to borrowings. The adjustment can result in an increase or decrease of the interest rate for revolving loans of up to 4 basis points and an increase or decrease of the facility fee of up to 1 basis point. In the case of the term loans, the adjustment can result in an increase or decrease of the interest rate applicable of up to 5 basis points. The adjustments will be determined annually on the basis of an annual audited report of Host L.P.’s performance against targets established in the credit facility for (1) the percentage of our consolidated portfolio with green building certifications and (2) the percentage of electricity used at all our consolidated properties that is generated by renewable resources. Effective June 26, 2024, we achieved a milestone in the progress towards both of our targets, resulting in the maximum benefit of the basis point reduction in the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility. Based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2024, we are able to borrow on the revolver at a rate of adjusted SOFR plus 85 basis points less 4 basis points for meeting sustainability milestones for an all-in rate of 5.25% and pay a facility fee of 19 basis points. \nInterest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to SOFR (plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points) plus a margin ranging from 80 to 160 basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating) and adjusted for sustainability pricing. Based on Host L.P.’s long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2024, our applicable margin on SOFR loans under both term loans is 95 basis points, less 5 basis points for meeting sustainability milestones, for an all-in rate of 5.34%. \nOther Covenants and Events of Default.\n The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x. At any time that our leverage ratio is below 6.0x, acquisitions, investments, dividends and distributions generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on the incurrence of debt incorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture.\nThe credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated and the lenders’ commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy-related events of default, all amounts due under the credit facility automatically will become due and payable and the lenders’ commitments automatically will terminate.\nMortgage Debt, Including Unconsolidated Joint Ventures.\n At December 31, 2024, we own one consolidated property that is encumbered by mortgage debt. All of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets, except in instances of fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2024, our mortgage debt has an interest rate of 4.67% and matures in 2027, with principal and interest payments due monthly. We also own non-controlling interests in joint ventures that are not consolidated and that are accounted for under the equity \n58\nTable of Contents\nmethod. The portion of the mortgage and other debt of these joint ventures attributable to us, based on our ownership percentage thereof, was $240 million at December 31, 2024. The debt of our unconsolidated joint ventures is non-recourse to us.\nDistributions/Dividends\n.\n Host Inc.’s policy on common dividends generally is to distribute, over time, at least 100% of its taxable income, which primarily is dependent on our results of operations, as well as on tax gains and losses on hotel sales. For the fourth quarter of 2024, Host Inc. paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share and a special dividend of $0.10 per share on its common stock on January 15, 2025 to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2024. Any future dividend will be subject to approval by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors. \nFunds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends are provided by distributions from Host L.P. As of December 31, 2024, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately 99% of Host L.P.’s common OP units. The remaining common OP units are owned by various unaffiliated limited partners. Each OP unit may be offered for redemption by the limited partners for cash or, at the election of Host Inc., Host Inc. common stock based on the then current conversion ratio. The current conversion ratio is 1.021494 shares of Host Inc. common stock for each OP unit.\nInvestors should consider the 1% non-controlling position of Host L.P. OP units when analyzing dividend payments by Host Inc. to its stockholders, as these holders of OP units share, on a pro rata basis, in amounts being distributed by Host L.P. to holders of its OP units. For example, if Host Inc. paid a $1 per share dividend on its common stock, it would be based on the payment of a $1.021494 per common OP unit distribution by Host L.P. to Host Inc., as well as to the other common OP unitholders. \nCounterparty Credit Risk.\n We are subject to counterparty credit risk, which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non-performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price. We assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligations to determine the impact, if any, of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility. We believe our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited, as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. While we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. We evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to the impairment of long-lived assets, on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. All our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion of the critical accounting policies related to impairment testing on our property and equipment and valuation of acquisitions, which require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates, see “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”.\nComparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results\nTo facilitate a year-to-year comparison of our operations, we present certain operating statistics (i.e., Total RevPAR, RevPAR, average daily rate and average occupancy) and operating results (revenues, expenses, hotel EBITDA and associated margins) for the periods included in our reports on a comparable hotel basis in order to enable our investors to better evaluate our operating performance. We define our comparable hotels as those that: (i) are owned or leased by us as of the reporting date and are not classified as held-for-sale; and (ii) have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption, or undergone large-scale capital projects, in each case requiring closures lasting one month or longer (as further defined below), during the reporting periods being compared.\nWe make adjustments to include recent acquisitions to include results for periods prior to our ownership. For these hotels, since the year-over-year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership, the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results. Additionally, operating results of hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed or the hotel is classified as held-for-sale. \n59\nTable of Contents\nThe hotel business is capital-intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business. Generally, hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels. A large-scale capital project would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set if it requires the entire property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer.\nSimilarly, hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption if it requires the property to be closed to hotel guests for one month or longer. In each case, these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after the hotel has reopened. Often, related to events that cause property damage and the closure of a hotel, we will collect business interruption insurance proceeds for the near-term loss of business. These proceeds are included in net gain on insurance settlements on our consolidated statements of operations. Business interruption insurance gains covering lost revenues while the property was considered non-comparable also will be excluded from the comparable hotel results.\nOf the 81 hotels that we owned as of December 31, 2024, 78 have been classified as comparable hotels. The operating results of the following properties that we owned as of December 31, 2024 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods:\n•\nThe Don CeSar (business disruption due to Hurricane Helene resulting in closure of the hotel beginning at the end of September 2024);\n•\nAlila Ventana Big Sur (business disruption due to the collapse of a portion of Highway 1, causing closure of the hotel beginning in March 2024, reopened in May 2024); \n•\nThe Ritz-Carlton, Naples (business disruption due to Hurricane Ian beginning in September 2022, reopened in July 2023); and\n•\nSales and marketing expenses related to the development and sale of condominium units on a development parcel adjacent to Four Seasons Resort Orlando at Walt Disney World® Resort.\nForeign Currency Translation\nOperating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction, or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period. Therefore, hotel statistics and results for non-U.S. properties include the effect of currency fluctuations, consistent with our financial statement presentation.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use certain “non-GAAP financial measures,” which are measures of our historical financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, within the meaning of applicable SEC rules. These measures are as follows: (i) EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P., (ii) Funds From Operations (“FFO”) and FFO per diluted share (both NAREIT and Adjusted), as a measure of performance for Host Inc., and (iii) comparable hotel operating results, as a measure of performance for Host Inc. and Host L.P. \nWe calculate EBITDA\nre\n and NAREIT FFO per diluted share in accordance with standards established by NAREIT, which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies that do not use the NAREIT definition of EBITDA\nre\n and FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance. In addition, although EBITDA\nre \nand FFO per diluted share are useful measures when comparing our results to other REITs, they may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non-REITs. We also calculate Adjusted FFO per diluted share and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, which measures are not in accordance with NAREIT guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other REITs or by other companies. This information should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating profit, cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with GAAP. Cash expenditures for various long-term assets (such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures), interest expense (for EBITDA, EBITDA\nre,\n and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n purposes only) severance expense related to significant property-level reconfiguration\n \nand other items have been, and will be, made and are not reflected in the EBITDA, EBITDA\nre,\n Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share presentations. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows include interest expense, capital expenditures, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures. Additionally, NAREIT FFO per diluted share, Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA, \n60\nTable of Contents\nEBITDA\nre\n and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n should not be considered as measures of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make cash distributions. In addition, NAREIT FFO per diluted share and Adjusted FFO per diluted share do not measure, and should not be used as measures of, amounts that accrue directly to stockholders’ benefit. \nSimilarly, EBITDA\nre\n, Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO include adjustments for non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships. Our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11% to 67% in eight domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 40 properties and a vacation ownership development. Due to the voting rights of the outside owners, we do not control and, therefore, do not consolidate these entities. The non-controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1% interest in Host L.P. held by unaffiliated limited partners and a 15% interest held by an unaffiliated limited partner in one hotel for which we do control the entity and, therefore, consolidate its operations. These pro rata results for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, EBITDA\nre \nand Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n are calculated as set forth below. Readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships (for NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share) and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic consequences of our investments in these entities. The following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance. \nEBITDA, EBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre \nEBITDA \nEarnings before Interest Expense, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries. Management believes EBITDA provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). Management also believes the use of EBITDA facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging REITs, hotel owners that are not REITs and other capital-intensive companies. Management uses EBITDA to evaluate property-level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and, like FFO and Adjusted FFO per diluted share, it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for compensation programs.  \nEBITDAre and Adjusted EBITDAre\nWe present EBITDA\nre\n in accordance with NAREIT guidelines, as defined in its September 2017 white paper “Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization for Real Estate,” to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of our results with other REITs. NAREIT defines EBITDA\nre\n as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, income tax, depreciation and amortization, gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property (including gains or losses on change of control), impairment expense for depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate, and adjustments to reflect the entity’s pro rata share of EBITDA\nre\n of unconsolidated affiliates.\nWe make additional adjustments to EBITDA\nre\n when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of net income, is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes. We adjust EBITDA\nre\n for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n: \n•\nProperty Insurance Gains and Property Damage Losses\n – We exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets. In addition, property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets. Similarly, losses from property damage or remediation costs that are not covered through insurance are excluded. \n61\nTable of Contents\n•\nAcquisition Costs\n – Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company. \n•\nLitigation Gains and Losses\n – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance.\n•\nSeverance Expense \n– In certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add-back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.\n•\nEffective January 1, 2025, we will exclude the expense recorded for non-cash stock-based compensation, as it represents a non-cash transaction and the add back is consistent with the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA for our financial covenant ratios under our credit facility and senior notes indentures and consistent with the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n for the majority of other lodging REIT filers. In 2024, this amount totaled $24 million.\nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust EBITDA\nre\n for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the Company’s current operating performance. The last adjustment of this nature was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n to net income, the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider the most directly comparable:  \nReconciliation of Net Income to EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n and Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n for Host Inc. and Host L.P. \n(in millions) \nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nNet income⁽¹⁾\n$\n707 \n$\n752 \nInterest expense\n215 \n191 \nDepreciation and amortization\n762 \n697 \nIncome taxes\n14 \n36 \nEBITDA⁽¹⁾\n1,698 \n1,676 \nGain on dispositions⁽²⁾\n— \n(70)\nEquity investment adjustments:\nEquity in earnings of affiliates\n(7)\n(6)\nPro rata EBITDAre of equity investments⁽³⁾\n35 \n32 \nEBITDAre⁽¹⁾\n1,726 \n1,632 \nAdjustments to EBITDA\nre\n:\nNet gain on property insurance settlements\n(70)\n(3)\nAdjusted EBITDAre⁽¹⁾\n$\n1,656 \n$\n1,629 \n___________\n(1)\nNet income, EBITDA, EBITDA\nre\n, Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO for the year ended December 31, 2024 include a loss of $6 million related to inventory impairment expense recorded by our Maui timeshare joint venture, reflected through equity in earnings of affiliates.\n(2)\nReflects the sale of one hotel in 2023.\n(3)\nUnrealized gains of our unconsolidated investments are not recognized in our EBITDA\nre,\n Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n, NAREIT FFO or Adjusted FFO until they have been realized by the unconsolidated partnership.\n62\nTable of Contents\nFFO Measures\nWe present NAREIT FFO and NAREIT FFO per diluted share as non-GAAP measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share (calculated in accordance with GAAP). We calculate NAREIT FFO per diluted share as our NAREIT FFO (defined as set forth below) for a given operating period, as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities, divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with NAREIT guidelines. As noted in NAREIT’s Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, NAREIT defines FFO as net income (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding depreciation and amortization related to certain real estate assets, gains and losses from the sale of certain real estate assets, gains and losses from change in control, impairment expense of certain real estate assets and investments and adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates. Adjustments for consolidated partially-owned entities and unconsolidated affiliates are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the FFO of those entities on the same basis.\nWe believe that NAREIT FFO per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of NAREIT FFO per diluted share, when combined with the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share, provides beneficial information to investors. By excluding the effect of real estate depreciation, amortization, impairment expense and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance, we believe such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other REITs, even though NAREIT FFO per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted by NAREIT in its Funds From Operations White Paper – 2018 Restatement, the primary purpose for including FFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance of a REIT is to address the artificial nature of historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and real estate-related assets mandated by GAAP. For these reasons, NAREIT adopted the FFO metric in order to promote a uniform industry-wide measure of REIT operating performance. \nWe also present Adjusted FFO per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance. Management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance, in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs. We believe that the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share, when combined with both the primary GAAP presentation of earnings per share and FFO per diluted share as defined by NAREIT, provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our operating performance. We adjust NAREIT FFO per diluted share for the following items, which may occur in any period, and refer to this measure as Adjusted FFO per diluted share:\n•\nGains and Losses on the Extinguishment of Debt\n – We exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt, including the acceleration of the write-off of deferred financing costs from the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period. We also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock. We believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs. \n•\nAcquisition Costs\n –Under GAAP, costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred. We exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the Company. \n•\nLitigation Gains and Losses\n – We exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under GAAP that we consider to be outside the ordinary course of business. We believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance. \n•\nSeverance Expense – \nIn certain circumstances, we will add back hotel-level severance expenses when we do not believe that such expenses are reflective of the ongoing operation of our properties. Situations that would result in a severance add back include, but are not limited to: (i) costs incurred as part of a broad-based reconfiguration of the operating model with the specific hotel operator for a portfolio of hotels and (ii) costs incurred at a specific hotel due to a broad-based and significant reconfiguration of a hotel and/or its workforce. We do not add back corporate-level severance costs or severance costs at an individual hotel that we consider to be incurred in the normal course of business.\n•\nEffective January 1, 2025, we will exclude the expense recorded for non-cash stock-based compensation, as it represents a non-cash transaction and the add back is consistent with the calculation \n63\nTable of Contents\nof Adjusted EBITDA for our financial covenant ratios under our credit facility and senior notes indentures and consistent with the presentation of Adjusted FFO per diluted share for the majority of other lodging REIT filers. In 2024, this amount totaled $24 million.\nIn unusual circumstances, we also may adjust NAREIT FFO for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of our current operating performance. For example, in 2017, as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 and recorded a one-time adjustment to reduce our deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately $11 million. We do not consider this adjustment to be reflective of our ongoing operating performance and, therefore, we excluded this item from Adjusted FFO. \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between our non-GAAP financial measures, NAREIT FFO and Adjusted FFO (separately and on a per diluted share basis), and net income, the financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP that we consider most directly comparable:\nHost Inc.

Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans, preferred OP units held by non-controlling limited partners and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partner interests to common OP units. No effect is shown for securities if they are anti-dilutive.\n64\nTable of Contents\nComparable Hotel Property Level Operating Results\nWe present certain operating results for our hotels, such as hotel revenues, expenses, food and beverage profit, and EBITDA (and the related margins), on a comparable hotel, or \"same store,\" basis as supplemental information for our investors. Our comparable hotel results present operating results for our hotels without giving effect to dispositions or properties that experienced closures due to renovations or property damage, as discussed in “Comparable Hotel Operating Statistics and Results” above. We present comparable hotel EBITDA to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels after removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and our asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization expense). Corporate-level costs and expenses also are removed to arrive at property-level results. We believe these property-level results provide investors with supplemental information about the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels. Comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for our properties in the aggregate. We eliminate from our comparable hotel level operating results severance costs related to broad-based and significant property-level reconfiguration that is not considered to be within the normal course of business, as we believe this elimination provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor’s understanding of our ongoing operating performance. We also eliminate depreciation and amortization expense because, even though depreciation and amortization expense are property-level expenses, these non-cash expenses, which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets, implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. As noted earlier, because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions, many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient.\nBecause of the elimination of corporate-level costs and expenses, gains or losses on disposition, certain severance expenses and depreciation and amortization expense, the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues, expenses, operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole. Management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance. Our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts, all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance.\nWe present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period-to-period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel REITs and hotel owners. In particular, these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and/or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels (which represent the vast majority of our portfolio) or from other factors. While management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance, this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of our hotels, as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results in the aggregate. For these reasons, we believe comparable hotel operating results, when combined with the presentation of GAAP operating profit, revenues and expenses, provide useful information to investors and management.\n65\nTable of Contents\nThe following table presents certain operating results and statistics for our comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein:\nComparable Hotel Results for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\n(in millions, except hotel statistics)\nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nNumber of hotels\n78\n78\nNumber of rooms\n42,508\n42,508\nChange in comparable hotel Total RevPAR\n2.1 \n%\n— \nChange in comparable hotel RevPAR\n0.9 \n%\n— \nOperating profit margin⁽¹⁾\n15.4 \n%\n15.6 \n%\nComparable hotel EBITDA margin⁽¹⁾\n29.2 \n%\n29.8 \n%\nFood and beverage profit margin⁽¹⁾\n33.7 \n%\n34.1 \n%\nComparable hotel food and beverage profit margin⁽¹⁾\n33.7 \n%\n33.9 \n%\nNet income\n$\n707 \n$\n752 \nDepreciation and amortization\n762 \n697 \nInterest expense\n215 \n191 \nBenefit (provision) for income taxes\n14 \n36 \nGain on sale of property and corporate level income/expense\n(8)\n(23)\nProperty transaction adjustments⁽²⁾\n42 \n87 \nNon-comparable hotel results, net⁽³⁾\n(110)\n(123)\nComparable hotel EBITDA\n$\n1,622 \n$\n1,617 \n___________\n(1)\nProfit margins are calculated by dividing the applicable operating profit by the related revenue amount.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk \nAll information in this section applies to both Host Inc. and Host L.P. \nInterest Rate Sensitivity \nOur future income, cash flows and fair values with respect to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. We have no derivative financial instruments that are held for trading purposes. We use derivative financial instruments to manage, or hedge, interest rate risks. As of February 21, 2025, we do not have any interest rate derivatives outstanding.\nThe interest payments on 80% of our debt are fixed in nature. Valuations for mortgage debt and the credit facility are determined based on expected future payments, discounted at risk-adjusted rates. The senior notes are valued based on quoted market prices. If market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by 100 basis points, interest expense would increase or decrease, respectively, our earnings and cash flows by approximately $10 million in 2025. The table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates (in millions, except percentages):\nExpected Maturity Date\n \n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\n \nTotal\nFair Value\nLiabilities\nDebt:\nFixed rate \n⁽¹⁾\n$\n495 \n$\n396 \n$\n85 \n$\n(7)\n$\n643 \n$\n2,479 \n$\n4,091 \n$\n3,929 \nAverage interest rate\n4.6 \n%\n4.6 \n%\n4.6 \n%\n4.6 \n%\n4.6 \n%\n4.9 \n%\n \nVariable rate \n⁽¹⁾\n$\n(4)\n$\n(4)\n$\n500 \n$\n500 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n992 \n$\n1,000 \nAverage interest rate \n⁽²⁾\n5.3 \n%\n5.3 \n%\n5.3 \n%\n5.3 \n%\n— \n%\n— \n%\nTotal debt\n$\n5,083 \n$\n4,929 \n___________\n(1)\nThe amounts are net of unamortized discounts, premiums and deferred financing costs; therefore, negative amounts prior to maturity represent the amortization of original issue discounts and deferred financing costs. \n(2)\nThe interest rate for our floating rate payments is based on the rate in effect as of December 31, 2024. No adjustments are made for forecast changes in the rate.\nExchange Rate Sensitivity \nWe have currency exchange risk because of our hotel ownership in Brazil and Canada and our minority investment in a joint venture in India. We may utilize several strategies to mitigate the exposure of currency exchange risk for our portfolio, including (i) utilizing local currency denominated debt (including foreign currency draws on our credit facility), (ii) entering into forward or option foreign currency purchase contracts, or (iii) investing through partnership and joint venture structures. For 2024 and 2023, revenues from our consolidated foreign operations were $101 million and $92 million, respectively, or approximately 2%, of our total revenues.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, three foreign currency forward purchase contracts matured, with a total notional amount of CAD 99 million ($74 million), and we received $1.4 million in the aggregate upon settlement of these contracts. In replacement of the maturing contracts, we entered into two new foreign currency forward purchase contracts with the same total notional amount of CAD 99 million ($73 million), which will mature in August 2025. The foreign currency exchange agreements into which we have entered strictly are to hedge foreign currency risk and are not for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of these contracts was $3.3 million. These contracts are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income (loss) for contracts designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, and through net income for contracts acting as a natural hedge of intercompany \n67\nTable of Contents\nloans. The foreign currency forward sale contracts are valued based on the forward yield curve of the foreign currency to U.S. dollar forward exchange rate on the date of measurement. Pursuant to these contracts, we will sell the foreign currency amount, as applicable, and receive the U.S. dollar amount on the forward sale date. We also evaluate counterparty credit risk when we calculate the fair value of the derivatives.\n68\nTable of Contents\nItem 8.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of hotel properties for impairment\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, property and equipment, less accumulated depreciation and amortization as of December 31, 2024, was $10,906 million. The Company assesses its property and equipment, primarily comprised of hotel properties, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. If such events or changes in circumstances are identified, the Company performs a recoverability analysis to compare the carrying amount of the hotel property to its expected undiscounted future cash flows over its remaining useful life.\nWe identified the evaluation of hotel properties for impairment as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment was required to assess the events or changes in circumstances that the Company used to evaluate its expected hold period. In addition, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate the key assumptions used by the Company in the recoverability analysis for a certain hotel property. The key assumptions included the undiscounted future cash flows and \n70\nTable of Contents\nthe expected hold period of this hotel property. Additionally, the audit effort associated with the evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows for this hotel property required specialized skills and knowledge.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the impairment process. This included controls over the identification and assessment of expected hold periods for certain hotel properties and over the undiscounted future cash flows used by the Company in the recoverability analysis for a certain hotel property. We evaluated the expected hold periods, by:\n●    inquiring of management and obtaining written representations regarding potential property disposal plans, if any\n●    reading minutes of the meetings of the Company’s board of directors\n●    inquiring about the Company’s plans with those in the organization who are responsible for, and have authority over, potential disposition activities\n●    comparing management’s assessment of properties with potential shortened expected hold periods to information obtained from those in the organization responsible for disposition activity, and\n●    inspecting listings from external sources of real estate properties for sale by the Company.\nEvaluation of the fair value of land acquired in real estate asset acquisitions\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown, 1 Hotel Central Park and Turtle Bay Resort for approximately $530 million, $265 million and $680 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2024. The Company determined the acquisitions to be asset acquisitions and allocated the acquisition cost to the individual assets acquired based on their relative fair values as of the acquisition date. \nWe identified the evaluation of the fair value of land acquired in these real estate asset acquisitions as a critical audit matter. Subjective auditor judgment and specialized skills and knowledge were required to evaluate the Company’s key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of land acquired in the real estate asset acquisitions. Specifically, the key assumptions used in such determinations included the identification and weighting of comparable market sales transactions. \nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s asset acquisition process, including controls related to the determination of the fair value of land acquired. This included controls related to the identification of the population of comparable market sales transactions and weighting of such transactions. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: \n•\nevaluating the Company’s identified comparable market sales transactions by comparing third-party evidence of comparable market sales transactions independently obtained from industry sources, including information about the transaction prices and features of the comparable market sales transactions and\n•\nevaluating the weighting of comparable market sales transactions by assessing the characteristics of such transactions.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nMcLean, Virginia\nFebruary 26, 2025\n71\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nHost Hotels & Resorts, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 26, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nMcLean, Virginia\nFebruary 26, 2025\n72\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Partners of Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. and Board of Directors of Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. and subsidiaries (the Partnership) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, capital, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule III (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Partnership as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Partnership’s management.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Partnership is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Partnership’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

As a result, we have reclassified $\n30\n million from property and equipment to other assets.\nOn January 20, 2022, we entered into definitive agreements with Noble Investment Group, LLC, and certain other entities and persons related to Noble Investment Group, LLC, pursuant to which we made an investment in a joint venture with Noble Investment Group. In connection with the investment, Host L.P. issued approximately \n3.2\n million OP units valued at approximately $\n56\n million.\nIn connection with the sales of The Camby, Autograph Collection in March 2023, the Sheraton Boston Hotel in February 2022 and the Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel in April 2022, we issued bridge loans to the buyers for $\n72\n million, $\n163\n million and $\n250\n million, respectively. The proceeds received from the sales are net of the loans.\nIn 2024 and 2022, non-cash consideration for the acquisitions of The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay and Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole included the assumption of hotel level liabilities of approximately $\n15\n million and $\n19\n million, respectively, consisting primarily of obligations to provide future services due to advance deposits.\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \n86\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.    \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business \nHost Hotels & Resorts, Inc. operates as a self-managed and self-administered real estate investment trust, or REIT, with its operations conducted solely through Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, operates through an umbrella partnership structure, with Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc., a Maryland corporation, as its sole general partner. In the notes to the consolidated financial statements, we use the terms “we” or “our” to refer to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. together, unless the context indicates otherwise. We also use the term “Host Inc.” to refer specifically to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc. and the term “Host L.P.” to refer specifically to Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P. in cases where it is important to distinguish between Host Inc. and Host L.P. Host Inc. holds approximately \n99\n% of Host L.P.’s partnership interests, or OP units.\nConsolidated Portfolio \nAs of December 31, 2024, the hotels in our consolidated portfolio are in the following countries:\nHotels\nUnited States\n76\nBrazil\n3\nCanada\n2\nTotal\n81\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of Host Inc., Host L.P. and their subsidiaries and controlled affiliates, including joint ventures and partnerships. We consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to control them. For the majority of our hotel and real estate investments, we consider those control rights to be (i) approval or amendment of developments plans, (ii) financing decisions, (iii) approval or amendments of operating budgets, and (iv) investment strategy decisions.\nWe also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they are variable interest entities (“VIEs”). If a subsidiary is a VIE, it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for VIEs. Typically, the entity that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact economic performance consolidates the VIE. We consider an entity to be a VIE if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We review our subsidiaries and affiliates at least annually to determine (i) if they should be considered VIEs, and (ii) whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in the characteristics thereof.\nFive\n partnerships are considered VIE’s, as the general partner of these partnerships maintains control over the decisions that most significantly impact the partnerships. The first VIE is the operating partnership, Host L.P., which is consolidated by Host Inc., of which Host Inc. is the general partner and holds \n99\n% of the limited partner interests. Host Inc.’s sole significant asset is its investment in Host L.P. and substantially all of Host Inc.’s assets and liabilities represent assets and liabilities of Host L.P. All of Host Inc.’s debt is an obligation of Host L.P. and may be settled only with assets of Host L.P. The consolidated partnership that owns the Houston Airport Marriott at George Bush Intercontinental, of which we are the general partner and hold \n85\n% of the partnership interests, also is a VIE. The total assets of this VIE at December 31, 2024 are $\n47\n million and consist primarily of cash, a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and property and equipment. Liabilities for the VIE total $\n26\n million and primarily consist of a lease liability and accounts payable. \nThree\n unconsolidated partnerships that own hotel properties, of which we hold limited partner interests ranging from \n11\n% - \n32\n%, also are VIEs. The combined carrying amount of our investments in these entities at December 31, 2024 is $\n77\n million and is included in advances to and investments in affiliates. The mortgage debt held by these VIEs is non-recourse to us. See Note 4 - Investments in Affiliates for further information.\n87\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents \nWe consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.\n \nProperty and Equipment \nGenerally, property and equipment is recorded at cost. For hotels that we develop, cost includes interest, property insurance and real estate taxes incurred during construction. For property and equipment acquired in a business combination, we record the assets acquired based on their fair value as of the acquisition date. Replacements and improvements and finance leases are capitalized, while repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. \nProperties acquired in an asset acquisition are recorded at cost. The acquisition cost is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, as well as identifiable intangible and lease assets and liabilities. Acquisition cost is allocated using relative fair values. We evaluate several factors, including weighted market data for similar assets, expected future cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates, and replacement costs for assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair values.\nWe capitalize certain inventory (such as china, glass, silver, and linen) at the time of a hotel opening or acquisition, or when significant inventory is purchased (in conjunction with a major rooms renovation or when the number of rooms or meeting space at a hotel is expanded). These amounts then are amortized over the estimated useful life of \nthree years\n. Subsequent replacement purchases are expensed when placed in service. \nWe maintain a furniture, fixtures and equipment replacement fund for renewal and replacement capital expenditures at our hotels, which generally is funded with \n5\n% of property revenues. \nImpairment testing.\n \nWe analyze our consolidated hotels for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We test for impairment in several situations, including:\n•\nwhen a hotel has a current or projected loss from operations;\n•\nwhen management’s intent or ability to hold a property for a period that recovers its carrying value changes, making it more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life and therefore reducing the expected hold period, and the anticipated sales price is at or below the book value; or \n•\nwhen other events, trends, contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. \nTo the extent that a hotel has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not that it will be sold prior to the end thereof, it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the property’s carrying amount. In the absence of other factors, we assume that the estimated useful life is equal to the remaining GAAP depreciable life because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements. We adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise, such as an expiring ground lease, or that it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to the end of its previously expected useful life. We also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimated useful life of our properties, including critical infrastructure, which regularly is maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life. \nIn 2024 and 2023, we identified \none\n property that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis. Based on this testing, \nno\n impairment was necessary, and no further analysis was required. \n88\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn 2022, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operations, we performed recoverability tests on certain of our properties, which did not result in the impairment of any of our properties. \nClassification of Assets as Held for Sale.\n We will classify a hotel as held for sale when its sale is probable, will be completed within one year and actions to complete the sale are unlikely to change or it is unlikely that the sale will not occur. This policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale frequently are not known until purchase agreements are executed, the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist that could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner. We typically classify hotels as held for sale when all the following conditions are met:\n•\nHost Inc.’s Board of Directors has approved the sale (to the extent that the dollar amount of the sale requires Board approval); \n•\na binding agreement to sell the property has been signed under which the buyer has deposited a significant amount of nonrefundable cash; and \n•\nno significant financing or legal contingencies exist that could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner. \nIf these criteria are met, we will cease recording depreciation expense and will record an impairment expense if the fair value less costs to sell is less than the carrying amount of the hotel. We will classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet. Gains on sales of properties are recognized at the time of sale or are deferred and recognized as income in subsequent periods as conditions requiring deferral are satisfied or expire without further cost to us.\nDiscontinued Operations. \nWe generally include the operations of a hotel that was sold or a hotel that has been classified as held for sale in continuing operations, including the gain or loss on the sale, unless the sale represents a strategic shift that will have a major impact on our future operations and financial results.\nAsset retirement obligations.\n We recognize the fair value of any liability for conditional asset retirement obligations, including environmental remediation liabilities, when incurred, which generally is upon acquisition, construction, or development and/or through the normal operation of the asset, if information exists with which to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense.\n We depreciate our property and equipment using the straight-line method. Depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets. The useful lives of the assets are based on several assumptions, including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets, as well as specific market and economic conditions. While management believes its estimates are reasonable, a change in the estimated useful lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels.\nNon-Controlling Interests \nHost Inc.’s treatment of the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. \nHost Inc. adjusts the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. each period so that the amount presented equals the greater of its carrying amount based on its historical cost or its redemption value. The historical cost is based on the proportional relationship between the historical cost of equity held by our common stockholders relative to that of the unitholders of Host L.P. The redemption value is based on the amount of cash or Host Inc. common stock, at our option, that would be paid to the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. if it were terminated. We have estimated that the redemption value is equivalent to the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the OP units currently owned by unaffiliated limited partners (one OP unit may be exchanged for \n1.021494\n shares of Host Inc. common stock) valued at the market price of Host Inc. common stock at the balance sheet date. Redeemable non-controlling interests of Host L.P. are classified in the mezzanine section of the balance sheet as they do not meet the requirements for equity classification because the redemption feature requires the delivery of registered shares.\n \n89\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe table below details the historical cost and redemption values for the non-controlling interests of Host L.P.:  \n As of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nCommon OP units outstanding (millions) \n9.2\n \n9.5\n \nMarket price per Host Inc. common share \n$\n17.52\n \n$\n19.47\n \nShares issuable upon conversion of one common OP unit \n1.021494\n1.021494\nRedemption value (millions) \n$\n165\n \n$\n189\n \nHistorical cost (millions) \n90\n \n93\n \nBook value (millions) ⁽¹⁾\n165\n \n189\n \n_____\n(1)\nThe book value recorded is equal to the greater of the redemption value or the historical cost.\n \nNet income is allocated to the non-controlling interests of Host L.P. based on their weighted average ownership percentage during the period.\n Net income attributable to Host Inc. has been reduced by the amount attributable to non-controlling interests in Host L.P., which totaled $\n9\n million, $\n11\n million and $\n9\n million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nOther Consolidated Partnerships. \nNon-redeemable non-controlling interests - other consolidated partnerships on the consolidated balance sheets consists of the third party partnership interest of \none\n majority-owned partnership.\nInvestments in Affiliates \nDistributions from Investments in Affiliates.\n We classify the distributions from our equity investments in the statements of cash flows based upon an evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances of each distribution. For example, distributions of cash that were generated by property operations are classified as cash flows from operating activities. However, distributions of cash that were generated by property sales and certain other transactions, such as debt issuances or repayments, are classified as cash flows from investing activities.\n \nIncome Taxes \nHost Inc. elected to be treated as a REIT effective January 1, 1999 pursuant to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. It is our intention to continue to comply with the REIT qualification requirements and to maintain our qualification for treatment as a REIT. A corporation that elects REIT status and meets certain tax law requirements regarding the distribution of its taxable income to its stockholders as prescribed by applicable tax laws and that complies with certain other requirements (relating primarily to the composition of its assets and the sources of its gross income) generally is not subject to federal and state corporate income taxation on its operating income that is distributed to its stockholders. As a partnership for federal income tax purposes, Host L.P. is not subject to federal income tax. Host L.P. is, however, subject to state, local and foreign income and franchise tax in certain jurisdictions. Additionally, each of the Host L.P. taxable REIT subsidiaries is taxable as a C corporation, and is subject to federal, state and foreign corporate income tax. Our consolidated income tax provision (benefit) includes the income tax provision (benefit) related to the operations of our taxable REIT subsidiaries, and state, local, and foreign income taxes incurred by Host L.P. and its subsidiaries.\nDeferred\n \nTax Assets and Liabilities.\n Pursuant to its partnership agreement, Host L.P. generally is required to reimburse Host Inc. for any tax payments it is required to make. Accordingly, the tax information included herein represents disclosures regarding Host Inc. and its subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for net operating loss, general business credit, and capital loss carryovers. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which such amounts are expected to be realized or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted. However, deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies.\nGAAP prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return. We must determine whether it is “more-likely-than-not” that a tax \n90\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nposition will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than \n50\n% likely of being realized upon settlement to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. This accounting standard applies to all tax positions related to income taxes. We recognize any accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.\nDeferred Charges \nFinancing costs related to long-term debt are deferred and amortized over the remaining life of the debt using the effective interest method. These costs are presented as a direct deduction from the related long-term debt on the balance sheets.\n \nForeign Currency Translation \nAs of December 31, 2024, our foreign operations consist of hotels located in Brazil and Canada, as well as an investment in a joint venture that indirectly owns hotels in India. The financial statements of these hotels and our investments therein are maintained in their functional currency, which generally is the local currency, and their operations are translated to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rates for the period. The assets and liabilities of the hotels and the investments therein are translated to U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting translation adjustments are reflected in other comprehensive income (loss).\nForeign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency for each applicable foreign entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at period end exchange rates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded in other gains (losses) on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, except when recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) as qualifying net investment hedges.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss \nThe components of total accumulated other comprehensive loss in the balance sheets are as follows (in millions):  \n As of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nGain on foreign currency forward contracts\n$\n6\n \n$\n3\n \nLoss on interest rate swap cash flow hedges\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nForeign currency translation\n(\n90\n)\n(\n73\n)\nOther comprehensive loss attributable to non-controlling interests\n1\n \n1\n \nTotal accumulated other comprehensive loss\n$\n(\n83\n)\n$\n(\n70\n)\nNo material amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2024 or 2023.\nRevenues \nSubstantially all of our operating results represent revenues and expenses generated by property-level operations. Payments are due from customers when services are provided to them. Due to the short-term nature of our contracts and the almost concurrent receipt of payment, we have no material unearned revenues at year end. We collect sales, use, occupancy \n91\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nand similar taxes at our hotels, which we present on a net basis (excluded from revenues) on our statements of operations. Revenues are recognized as follows: \nIncome statement line item\nRecognition method\nRooms revenues\nRooms revenues represent revenues from the occupancy of our hotel rooms and are driven by the occupancy and average daily rate charged. Rooms revenues do not include ancillary services or fees charged. The contracts for room stays with customers generally are very short term in duration and revenues are recognized over the course of the hotel stay. \nFood and beverage revenues\nFood and beverage revenues consist of revenues from group functions, which may include banquet revenues and audio-visual revenues, as well as outlet revenues from the restaurants and lounges at our properties. Revenues are recognized as the services or products are provided. Our hotels may employ third parties to provide certain services, for example, audio and visual services. These contracts are evaluated to determine if the hotel is the principal or the agent in the transaction and we record the revenues as appropriate (i.e., gross vs. net). \nOther revenues\nOther revenues consist of ancillary revenues at the hotel, including attrition and cancelation fees, golf courses, resort and destination fees, spas, entertainment and other guest services, as well as rental revenues; primarily consisting of leased retail outlets. Other revenues generally are recognized as the services or products are provided. Attrition and cancelation fees are recognized for non-cancelable deposits when the customer provides notification of cancelation or is a no-show for the specified date, whichever comes first.\nFair Value\n \nMeasurement\nIn evaluating the fair value of both financial and non-financial assets and liabilities, GAAP outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market assumptions based on market data (“observable inputs”) and a reporting entity’s own assumptions about market data (“unobservable inputs”). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability at the measurement date in an orderly transaction (an “exit price”). Assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows: \nLevel 1 — Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access at the measurement date. An active market is defined as a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing on an ongoing basis. \nLevel 2 — Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active (markets with few transactions), inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (i.e., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data correlation or other means. \nLevel 3 — Unobservable inputs reflect our assumptions about the pricing of an asset or liability when observable inputs are not available.\n \nEarnings (Loss) Per Common Share (Unit) \nBasic earnings per common share (unit) is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders (unitholders) by the weighted average number of shares of Host Inc. common stock or Host L.P. common units outstanding. Diluted earnings per common share (unit) is computed by dividing net income attributable to common \n92\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nstockholders (unitholders), as adjusted for potentially dilutive securities, by the weighted average number of shares of Host Inc. common stock or Host L.P. common units outstanding plus other potentially dilutive securities. Dilutive securities may include shares granted under comprehensive stock plans or the common OP units distributed to Host Inc. to support such shares granted, and other non-controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partner interests to common OP units. No effect is shown for any securities that are anti-dilutive. There are \n9.2\n million Host L.P. common units, which are convertible into \n9.4\n million Host Inc. common shares, that are not included in Host Inc.'s calculation of earnings per share as their effect is not dilutive.\n \n \nThe calculation of Host Inc. basic and diluted earnings per common share is shown below (in millions, except per share amounts): \nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n707\n \n$\n752\n \n$\n643\n \nLess: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n(\n10\n)\n(\n12\n)\n(\n10\n)\nNet income attributable to Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.\n$\n697\n \n$\n740\n \n$\n633\n \nBasic weighted average shares outstanding \n702.1\n \n709.7\n \n714.7\n \nAssuming distribution of common shares granted under the comprehensive stock plans, less shares assumed \n     purchased at market\n1.9\n \n3.1\n \n2.8\n \nDiluted weighted average shares outstanding\n704.0\n \n712.8\n \n717.5\n \nBasic earnings per common share\n$\n0.99\n \n$\n1.04\n \n$\n0.89\n \nDiluted earnings per common share\n$\n0.99\n \n$\n1.04\n \n$\n0.88\n \nThe calculation of Host L.P. basic and diluted earnings per common unit is shown below (in millions, except per unit amounts):\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet income\n$\n707\n \n$\n752\n \n$\n643\n \nLess: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nNet income attributable to Host Hotels & Resorts, L.P.\n$\n706\n \n$\n751\n \n$\n642\n \nBasic weighted average units outstanding \n696.7\n \n704.5\n \n709.7\n \nAssuming distribution of common units granted under the comprehensive stock plans, less units assumed \n     purchased at market\n1.9\n \n3.0\n \n2.7\n \nDiluted weighted average units outstanding\n698.6\n \n707.5\n \n712.4\n \nBasic earnings per common unit\n$\n1.01\n \n$\n1.07\n \n$\n0.91\n \nDiluted earnings per common unit\n$\n1.01\n \n$\n1.06\n \n$\n0.90\n \n \nShare-Based Payments \nUpon the issuance of Host’s common stock under the compensation plans, Host L.P. will issue to Host Inc. common OP units of an equivalent value. These liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements for Host Inc. and Host L.P.\nWe recognize costs resulting from Host Inc.’s share-based payment transactions over their vesting periods. We classify share-based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services either as equity-classified awards or liability-classified awards. Equity-classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant. Liability-\n93\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nclassified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period. The plan includes awards that vest over a \none-year\n, \ntwo-year\n and \nthree-year\n period. For performance-based awards, compensation cost will be recognized during the requisite service period based on the performance condition that is the most likely outcome. No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk \nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents. We are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions and access to our credit facility, however, this cash balance is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions.\n \nAcquisitions and\n \nBusiness Combinations \nWhen acquiring an asset, we determine whether the acquisition is an asset acquisition or a business combination based on whether the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single (group of similar) identifiable assets, resulting in an asset acquisition or, if not, resulting in a business combination. If treated as an asset acquisition, the asset is recorded in accordance with our property and equipment policy and related acquisition costs are capitalized as part of the asset.\n \nIn a business combination, we recognize identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests at their fair values at the acquisition date based on the exit price (i.e., the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date). We evaluate several factors, including market data for similar assets, expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets and liabilities acquired. Property and equipment are recorded at fair value and such fair value is allocated to land, buildings, improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties, and any consideration paid in excess of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired would be recorded to goodwill. Acquisition-related costs, such as due diligence, legal and accounting fees, are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets. \nOther items that we evaluate include identifiable intangible assets, lease assets and liabilities and, in a business combination, goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets typically consist of above- and below-market contracts, including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements, which are recorded at fair value in a business combination and at its relative fair value in an asset acquisition. These contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of terms and conditions for similar contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the contract. Intangible assets and other liabilities are amortized using the straight-line method over the remaining non-cancelable term of the related agreements. Classification of a lease does not change if it is part of an asset acquisition or a business combination. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we may utilize a number of sources that arise in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data, including third-party appraisals and valuations. In certain situations, and usually only in connection with the acquisition of a foreign hotel, a deferred tax liability is recognized due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the acquired assets at the acquisition date.\n \nLeases\nWe consider an arrangement to contain a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for compensation. All leases pursuant to which we are the lessee, including operating leases, are recognized as lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the present value of our fixed payment obligations. Leases with a term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. We use our estimated incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of our lease obligations at initiation or modification. Our operating leases may require fixed payments, variable payments based on a percentage of revenue or income, or payments equal to the greater of a fixed or variable payment. Variable payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our lease terms include renewal options that we are reasonably certain to exercise, and renewal options controlled by the lessor.\n \n94\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNotes Receivable\nAt December 31, 2024, our notes receivable consists of one outstanding loan issued in connection with a hotel sale. In conjunction with our dispositions, we may issue a loan to the purchaser to facilitate the sale. The loan is collateralized by the corresponding sold hotel and, in the event of a default of the loan, we would seek to enforce our rights against the collateral in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement. The loan is recorded at amortized cost, on an individual asset basis. We recognize interest as it is earned and include accrued interest receivable in other assets on the balance sheets. We individually assess our notes receivable for credit losses quarterly and estimate any credit losses based on an analysis of several factors, primarily the value of the hotel collateral, as well as current economic conditions and historical trends.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year financial statements amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.\nNew Accounting Standards\nOn January 1, 2024, we adopted ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280):\n Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.\n The standard requires additional information to be disclosed with regards to segments, including significant expense categories, identifying the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\"CODM\"), and additional interim disclosures. The standard also requires that public entities with a single reportable segment disclose all of the required segment disclosures under the previous ASC 280 guidance in addition to the new disclosures required under ASU No. 2023-07. We report on one reportable segment as noted in Note 16 – Geographic and Business Segment Information and additional disclosures were included to comply with the new requirements. \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): \nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\n. The standard requires additional disclosures about income taxes, including specific categories in the rate reconciliation and disaggregated information on income taxes paid and income from continuing operations. The standard also eliminates the requirement to disclose an estimated range of the reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months. We are still evaluating the level of disclosure that will be required. This standard is to be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Subtopic 220-40): \nExpense Disaggregation Disclosures\n. The standard requires additional disclosures with more granular information about expenses reported in the income statement. The standard also requires a reporting entity to disaggregate and disclose the nature of certain expense categories, including employee compensation, inventory-related costs, and depreciation, within the financial statement footnotes. We are still evaluating the level of disclosure that will be required. This standard is to be applied either on a prospective or retrospective basis and is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, with early adoption permitted.\n2.    \nRevenues\nSubstantially all our operating results represent revenues and expenses generated by property-level operations. Payments are due from customers when services are provided to them. Due to the short-term nature of our contracts and the almost concurrent receipt of payment, we have no material unearned revenue at quarter end. We collect sales, use, occupancy and similar taxes from our customers, which we present on a net basis (excluded from revenues) on our statements of operations.\n \nDisaggregation of Revenues\n.\n While we do not consider the following disclosure of hotel revenues by location to consist of reportable segments, we have disaggregated hotel revenues by market location. Our revenues also are presented by country in Note 16 – Geographic and Business Segment Information. \n95\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBy Location. \nThe following table presents hotel revenues for each of the geographic locations in our consolidated hotel portfolio (in millions): \n Year ended December 31,\nLocation\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSan Diego\n$\n523\n \n$\n498\n \n$\n446\n \nOrlando\n473\n \n466\n \n455\n \nFlorida Gulf Coast\n441\n \n339\n \n344\n \nNew York\n431\n \n374\n \n336\n \nMaui\n371\n \n415\n \n440\n \nPhoenix\n366\n \n366\n \n378\n \nSan Francisco/San Jose\n353\n \n371\n \n322\n \nWashington, D.C.

The debt of our joint ventures, if any, is non-recourse to, and not guaranteed by, us, and a default of such debt does not trigger a default under any of our debt instruments.

Amount shown represents deferred financing costs related to the credit facility revolver.\nSenior Notes \nGeneral.\n Under the terms of our senior notes indenture, our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all our unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all our subordinated obligations. The face amounts of our senior notes at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $\n4.1\n billion and $\n3.2\n billion, respectively. The senior notes balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are net of unamortized discounts and deferred financing costs of approximately $\n57\n million and $\n30\n million, respectively. We pay interest on each series of our senior notes semi-annually in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated in the table above. \nUnder the terms of the senior notes indenture, our ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we are in compliance with all of these covenants.\nOn April 1, 2024, we repaid our $\n400\n million 3⅞% Series G senior notes at maturity.\nOn May 10, 2024, we issued $\n600\n million of \n5.700\n% Series K senior notes in an underwritten public offering for proceeds of $\n584\n million, net of original issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The Series K senior notes are due in July 2034, and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1, commencing January 1, 2025. The Series K senior notes were issued as a “green bond,” and we allocated an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the Series K senior notes to finance and/or refinance \none\n or more eligible green projects, including the April 2024 acquisition of the 1 Hotel Nashville and Embassy Suites by Nashville Downtown, each of which has received LEED Silver certification. Following the allocation to eligible green projects, the net proceeds of this issuance were used to repay all $\n215\n million of borrowings that were outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility at that time. The Series K senior notes are not redeemable prior to \n90\n days before the July 1, 2034 maturity date, except at a price equal to \n100\n% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series K senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes.\nOn August 12, 2024, we issued $\n700\n million of \n5.500\n% Series L senior notes in an underwritten public offering for proceeds of approximately $\n683\n million, net of original issue discount, underwriting fees and expenses. The Series L senior notes are due in April 2035 and interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, \n98\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\ncommencing April 15, 2025. The net proceeds were used in part to repay all $\n525\n million of borrowings then outstanding under the revolver portion of our credit facility, including amounts borrowed during the third quarter of 2024 in connection with the acquisitions of The Ritz-Carlton O’ahu, Turtle Bay and 1 Hotel Central Park. The Series L senior notes are not redeemable prior to \n90\n days before the April 15, 2035 maturity date, except at a price equal to \n100\n% of their principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the applicable redemption date. The Series L senior notes have covenants similar to all other series of our outstanding senior notes.\nAuthorization for Repurchase of Senior Notes.\n In February 2023, Host Inc.’s Board of Directors authorized repurchases of up to $\n1\n billion of senior notes (other than in accordance with their terms) through February 2026. No repurchases occurred in 2024 under this program.\nCredit Facility.\n On January 4, 2023, we entered into the sixth amended and restated senior revolving credit and term loan facility, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as co-syndication agents, and certain other agents and lenders. The credit facility allows for revolving borrowings in an aggregate principal amount of up to $\n1.5\n billion. The revolver also includes a foreign currency subfacility for Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Euros, British pounds sterling and, if available to the lenders, Mexican pesos, of up to the foreign currency equivalent of $\n500\n million, subject to a lower amount in the case of Mexican peso borrowings. The credit facility also provides for a term loan facility of $\n1\n billion (which is fully utilized), a subfacility of up to $\n100\n million for swingline borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars and a subfacility of up to $\n100\n million for issuances of letters of credit. Host L.P. also has the option to add in the future $\n500\n million of commitments which may be used for additional revolving credit facility borrowings and/or term loans, subject to obtaining additional loan commitments (which we have not currently obtained) and the satisfaction of certain conditions. \nThe revolving credit facility has an initial scheduled maturity date of January 4, 2027, which date may be extended by up to a year by the exercise of either a \n1-year\n extension option or \ntwo\n \n6-month\n extension options, each of which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee and the accuracy of representations and warranties. One $\n500\n million term loan tranche has an initial maturity date of January 4, 2027, which date may be extended up to a year by the exercise of \none\n \n1\n-year extension option, which is subject to certain conditions, including the payment of an extension fee; and the second $\n500\n million term loan tranche has a maturity date of January 4, 2028, which date may not be extended. \nThe amendment also converted the underlying reference rate from LIBOR to SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment of \n10\n basis points. We pay interest on U.S. dollar revolver borrowings under the credit facility at floating rates equal to SOFR (plus a credit spread adjustment of \n10\n basis points) plus a margin ranging from \n72.5\n to \n140\n basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating). We also pay a facility fee on the total $\n1.5\n billion revolver commitment ranging from \n12.5\n to \n30\n basis points, depending on our rating and regardless of usage. The credit facility includes a sustainability pricing adjustment that can result in a change in the interest rate applicable to borrowings. The adjustment can result in an increase or decrease of the interest rate for revolving loans of up to \n4\n basis points and an increase or decrease of the facility fee of up to \n1\n basis point. In the case of the term loans, the adjustment can result in an increase or decrease of the interest rate applicable of up to \n5\n basis points. The adjustments will be determined annually on the basis of an annual audited report of Host L.P.’s performance against targets established in the credit facility for (1) the percentage of our consolidated portfolio with green building certifications and (2) the percentage of electricity used at all our consolidated properties that is generated by renewable resources. Effective June 26, 2024, we achieved a milestone in the progress towards both of our targets, resulting in the maximum benefit of the basis point reduction in the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility. Based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2024, we are able to borrow on the revolver at a rate of adjusted SOFR plus \n85\n basis points less \n4\n basis points for meeting sustainability milestones for an all-in rate of \n5.25\n% and pay a facility fee of \n19\n basis points. \nInterest on the term loans consists of floating rates equal to SOFR (plus a credit spread adjustment of \n10\n basis points) plus a margin ranging from \n80\n to \n160\n basis points (depending on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating) and adjusted for sustainability pricing. Based on Host L.P.’s long-term debt rating as of December 31, 2024, our applicable margin on SOFR loans under both term loans is \n95\n basis points less \n5\n basis points for meeting sustainability milestones, for an all-in rate of \n5.34\n%. We also may elect to pay interest on revolver and term loan borrowings using a base rate plus a margin that is similarly determined based on Host L.P.’s unsecured long-term debt rating.\n99\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe utilized the revolver under the credit facility for various funding needs in 2024 with all borrowings repaid by year end. As of December 31, 2024, we have $\n1.5\n billion of available capacity under the revolver portion of our credit facility.\nFinancial Covenants\n. The credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage, fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage (as defined in our credit facility). We are permitted to borrow and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated EBITDA (“leverage ratio”) is not in excess of \n7.25\nx, our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than \n1.75\nx and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than \n1.25\nx. These calculations are performed based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters, giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions, dispositions and financings as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Under the terms of the credit facility, interest expense excludes items such as gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt, deferred financing costs related to the senior notes or the credit facility, and non-cash interest expense, all of which are or have been included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations. Additionally, total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a “net debt” concept, under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of $\n100\n million are deducted from our total debt balance. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we are in compliance with all of these covenants.\nGuarantees\n. \nThe credit facility requires all Host L.P. subsidiaries which guarantee Host L.P. debt to similarly guarantee obligations under the credit facility. Currently, there are no such guarantees.\nOther Covenants and Events of Default\n.\n The credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters. Certain covenants are less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio is below \n6.0\nx. At any time that our leverage ratio is below \n6.0\nx, acquisitions, investments and dividends generally are permitted except where they would result in a breach of the financial covenants, calculated on a pro forma basis. Additionally, the credit facility’s restrictions on the incurrence of debt incorporate the same financial covenant as set forth in our senior notes indenture. Our senior notes and credit facility have cross default provisions that would trigger a default under those agreements if we were to have a payment default or an acceleration prior to maturity of other debt of Host L.P. or its subsidiaries. The amount of other debt in default needs to exceed certain thresholds in order to trigger a cross default and the thresholds are greater for secured debt than for unsecured debt. The credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature, and provides that, upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated, and the lenders’ commitments may be terminated. In addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default, all amounts owed under the credit facility will become due and payable and the lenders’ commitments will terminate. \n \nMortgage Debt \nOur mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets, except for environmental liabilities, fraud, misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions. As of December 31, 2024, we have mortgage debt secured by \none\n asset, with an interest rate of \n4.67\n%, which mortgage debt matures in November 2027. The loan is amortizing, with principal and interest payable monthly. As of  December 31, 2024, we are in compliance with the covenants under our mortgage debt obligation. We made mortgage debt repayments of $\n2\n million in each of 2024 and 2023. \n100\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAggregate Debt Maturities \nAggregate debt maturities, including principal amortization, are as follows (in millions): \n As of December 31, 2024\n2025\n$\n502\n \n2026\n402\n \n2027\n592\n \n2028\n500\n \n2029\n650\n \nThereafter\n2,500\n \n5,146\n \nDeferred financing costs\n(\n31\n)\nUnamortized discounts, net\n(\n32\n)\nTotal debt\n$\n5,083\n \nInterest \nThe following is a reconciliation between interest expense and cash interest paid (in millions):  \n Year ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest expense\n$\n215\n \n$\n191\n \n$\n156\n \nAmortization of debt premiums/discounts, net\n(\n3\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nAmortization of deferred financing costs\n(\n7\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n8\n)\nNon-cash losses on debt extinguishment\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n—\n \nChange in accrued interest\n(\n33\n)\n2\n \n(\n4\n)\nInterest paid ⁽¹⁾\n$\n172\n \n$\n183\n \n$\n142\n \n___________\n(1)\nDoes not include capitalized interest of $\n10\n million in each of 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n \n6.    \nEquity of Host Inc. and Capital of Host L.P.\nEquity of Host Inc. \nHost Inc. has authorized \n1,050\n million shares of common stock, with a par value of $\n0.01\n per share, of which \n699.1\n million and \n703.6\n million were outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nFifty\n million shares of \nno\n par value preferred stock are authorized; \nnone\n of such preferred shares was outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nCapital of Host L.P. \nAs of December 31, 2024, Host Inc. is the owner of approximately \n99\n% of Host L.P.’s common OP units.

In 2024, we repurchased \n6.3\n million shares at an average price of $\n16.99\n per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $\n107\n million. In 2023, we \n101\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nrepurchased \n11.4\n million shares at an average price of $\n15.93\n per share, exclusive of commissions, for a total of $\n181\n million. As of December 31, 2024, we have $\n685\n million available for repurchase under the program.\nOn May 31, 2023, we entered into a distribution agreement with J. P. Morgan Securities LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, Jefferies LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Scotia Capital (USA) Inc., Truist Securities, Inc. and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as sales agents pursuant to which Host Inc. may offer and sell, from time to time, shares of Host Inc. common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $\n600\n million. The sales will be made in transactions that are deemed to be “at the market” offerings under the SEC rules. We may sell shares of Host Inc. common stock under this program from time to time based on market conditions, although we are not under an obligation to sell any shares. The agreement also contemplates that, in addition to the offering and sale of shares to or through the sales agents, we may enter into separate forward sale agreements with each of the forward purchasers named in the agreement. There have been \nno\n shares issued in 2024 and 2023. As of December 31, 2024, there was $\n600\n million of remaining capacity under the agreement.\nDividends/Distributions \nHost Inc. is required to distribute at least \n90\n% of its annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to its stockholders in order to maintain its qualification as a REIT. Funds used by Host Inc. to pay dividends on its common stock are provided by distributions from Host L.P. The amount of any future dividends will be determined by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors.\nThe dividends that were taxable to our stockholders in 2024 are considered \n100.0\n% ordinary. The dividends that were taxable to our stockholders in 2023 are considered \n91.8\n% ordinary and \n8.2\n% unrecaptured Section 1250 gain. The 2024 and 2023 ordinary dividends are eligible for the \n20\n% deduction provided by Section 199A. \nThe table below presents the amount of common dividends declared per share and common distributions per unit as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCommon stock\n$\n0.90\n \n$\n0.90\n \n$\n0.53\n \nCommon OP units\n0.919\n \n0.919\n \n0.541\n \nOn February 19, 2025, Host Inc.'s Board of Directors announced a regular quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.20\n per share on its common stock. The dividend will be paid on April 15, 2025 to stockholders of record as of March 31, 2025.\n7.    \nIncome Taxes\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code commencing with our taxable year beginning January 1, 1999. To continue to qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least \n90\n% of our annual taxable income to our stockholders, excluding net capital gain. As a REIT, generally we will not be subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes on that portion of our annual taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal and state corporate income taxes at regular corporate income tax rates and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for \nfour\n subsequent taxable years. Even if we qualify to be treated as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state, local and foreign taxes on our income and property, and to U.S. federal and state corporate income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income. \n102\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSet forth below is a table that documents our domestic and foreign income tax attributes at December 31, 2024: \nType\nJurisdiction\nAmount (in millions)\nTax Year Expiration\nNet operating loss\nU.S. Federal\n$\n576\n \nNone\nCapital loss\nU.S. Federal and States\n2\n \n2028\nNet operating loss\nU.S. States\n901\n \nVarious\nNet operating loss\nBrazil\n19\n \nNone\nNet operating loss\nCanada\n7\n \nThrough 2042\nCapital loss\nCanada\n5\n \nNone\nGeneral business credit\nU.S. Federal\n4\n \n2044\nWe have recorded a \n100\n% valuation allowance of approximately $\n5\n million against the deferred tax asset related to certain of our foreign capital loss carryovers as of December 31, 2024.

All of such uncertain tax position amounts, if recognized, would impact our reconciliation between the income tax provision calculated at the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate of \n21\n% and the actual income tax provision recorded each year.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions generally include 2021-2024. There were \nno\n material interest or penalties recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n8.    \nLeases \nTaxable REIT Subsidiaries Leases \nWe lease substantially all our hotels to a wholly owned subsidiary that qualifies as a taxable REIT subsidiary due to the U.S. federal income tax prohibition on the ability of a REIT to derive revenues directly from the operations of a hotel. \nGround Leases \nAs of December 31, 2024, all or a portion of \n19\n of our hotels are subject to ground leases, generally with multiple renewal options, all of which are accounted for as operating leases. Payments for ground leases account for approximately \n73\n% of our 2024 minimum lease payments and \n96\n% of our total future minimum lease payments. For lease agreements with scheduled rent increases, we recognize the fixed portion of the lease expense ratably over the term of the lease. As the exercise of the renewal options were determined to be reasonably certain, the payments associated with the renewals have \n104\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nbeen included in the measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset. Contingent rental payments based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated amounts are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset but will be recognized as variable lease expense if and when they are incurred. However, certain of these leases contain provisions that increase the minimum lease payments based on an average of the variable lease payments made over the previous years, for which we will reevaluate the lease liability and ROU asset as these payments represent an increase in the minimum payments for the remainder of the lease term. Certain of these leases also contain provisions that increase the minimum lease payments based on an index such as the Consumer Price Index. Such increases are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and ROU asset but will be recognized as variable lease expense if and when they are incurred. The discount rate used to calculate the lease liability and ROU asset is based on our incremental borrowing rate (“IBR”), as the rate implicit in each lease is not readily determinable. To calculate our IBR, we obtained a forward curve using LIBOR swap rates, with terms ranging from \none\n to \nfifty years\n, as well as corresponding bond spreads based on the terms of the leases and our credit risk. The resulting discount rates for our ground leases range from \n4.3\n% to \n6.2\n%.\nOffice Leases and Other \nWe have office leases for our headquarters office in Bethesda, which expires in 2036, as well as a satellite office in Miami, which lease expires in 2025, with no renewal options.\nWe also have leases on facilities used in our former restaurant business, all of which we subsequently subleased. These leases and subleases contain \none\n or more renewal options, generally for \nfive\n- or \nten\n -year periods. The restaurant leases are accounted for as operating leases. Our contingent liability related to these leases is $\n0.9\n million and $\n1.1\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We, however, consider the likelihood of any material funding related to these leases to be remote. Our leasing activity also includes leases entered into by our hotels for various types of equipment, which may be accounted for either as operating or \nfinance leases\n, depending upon the characteristics of the particular lease arrangement. Our finance leases total less than $\n1\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe following table presents lease cost and other information (in millions): \nYear ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nLease cost\nOperating lease cost\n$\n43\n \n$\n42\n \n$\n41\n \nVariable lease cost\n36\n \n35\n \n27\n \nSublease income\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nTotal lease cost\n$\n78\n \n$\n76\n \n$\n67\n \nOther information\nOperating cash flows used for operating leases\n$\n43\n \n$\n42\n \n$\n41\n \nWeighted-average remaining lease term - operating leases\n46\n years\n46\n years\n47\n years\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases\n5.3\n \n%\n5.3\n \n%\n5.3\n \n%\n105\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the total amount of minimum lease payments, on an undiscounted basis, to the lease liability on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 (in millions): \nAs of December 31, 2024\nGround Leases\nOffice Leases and Other\nTotal\nWeighted-average discount rate - operating leases\n5.4\n \n%\n3.7\n \n%\n5.3\n \n%\n2025\n$\n31\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n38\n \n2026\n31\n \n6\n \n37\n \n2027\n31\n \n5\n \n36\n \n2028\n31\n \n5\n \n36\n \n2029\n31\n \n5\n \n36\n \nThereafter\n1,325\n \n33\n \n1,358\n \nTotal undiscounted cash flows\n$\n1,480\n \n$\n61\n \n$\n1,541\n \nPresent values\nLong-term lease liabilities\n$\n511\n \n$\n49\n \n$\n560\n \nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n511\n \n$\n49\n \n$\n560\n \nDifference between undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows\n$\n969\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n981\n \nMinimum payments for the operating leases have not been reduced by aggregate minimum sublease rentals from restaurants of approximately $\n1.7\n million that are payable to us under non-cancelable subleases.\n9.    \nEmployee Stock Plans \nUpon the issuance of Host Inc.’s common stock for stock-based compensation, Host L.P. issues to Host Inc. common OP units of an equivalent value. Accordingly, these awards and related disclosures are included in both Host Inc.’s and Host L.P.’s consolidated financial statements.\nHost Inc. maintains two stock-based compensation plans, the Comprehensive Stock and Cash Incentive Plan (the “2024 Comprehensive Plan”), under which Host Inc. may award to participating employees restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. At December 31, 2024, there were approximately \n22\n million shares of Host Inc.’s common stock reserved and available for issuance under the 2024 Comprehensive Plan.\nWe recognize costs resulting from share-based payments in our financial statements over their vesting periods. No compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite services. We classify share-based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity-classified or liability-classified awards. Equity-classified awards are measured based on their fair value as of the date of grant. In contrast, liability-classified awards are re-measured to fair value each reporting period.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of approximately $\n24\n million, $\n30\n million and $\n26\n million, respectively. Shares granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 totaled \n2.0\n million, \n1.8\n million and \n1.8\n million, respectively, while \n1.5\n million, \n2.3\n million and \n1.5\n million shares, respectively, vested during those years.\nSenior Executive Plan \nDuring 2024, Host Inc. granted \n1.7\n million RSU awards under the 2024 Comprehensive Plan, which amount represents the maximum number of RSUs that can be earned during the period of 2024 through 2026 if performance is at the “high” level of achievement and, for time-based awards, the executive remains employed. The RSUs vest over a \none\n, \ntwo\n or \nthree-year\n period and \n2.9\n million RSUs were unvested at December 31, 2024. Total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSU awards that vest through 2026 is approximately $\n19\n million. \n106\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRSU awards \nVesting of RSUs awarded in 2024 is based on (1) continued employment on the vesting date (“Time-Based Award”); (2) the achievement of relative total shareholder return (“TSR”); and (3) our Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n performance. Approximately \n25\n% of the RSUs are Time-Based Awards and vest on an annual basis over \nthree years\n; approximately \n37.5\n% of the RSUs are based on the satisfaction of the TSR compared to the NAREIT Equity Lodging & Resort index that serves as a relevant industry/asset specific measurement to our competitors and vest following a \nthree-year\n performance period; and the remaining \n37.5\n% are based on Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n performance and vest following a three-year performance period. The RSUs granted are considered equity-classified awards. As a result, the fair value of these awards is based on the fair value on the grant date, and such grant date fair value is not adjusted for subsequent movements thereof. \nWe value the time-based awards using the closing stock price on the grant date multiplied by the percentage of shares expected to be released, which is \n100\n% of the time based awards. We also value the Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n awards using the closing stock price on the grant date multiplied by the percentage of shares expected to be released; however, as a result of the Adjusted EBITDA\nre\n performance conditions, we reevaluate the percentage based on the probability of meeting the performance conditions each period. \nWe value the TSR awards using the economic theory that is the basis for all valuation models, including Binominal, Black-Scholes, exotic options formulas, and Monte Carlo valuations. We valued the TSR awards with the following assumptions:\nNAREIT Lodging & Resorts Index\n \n2024 Grant Awards\n2023 Grant Awards\nGrant date stock price\n$\n19.23\n \n$\n18.55\n \nVolatility\n33.2\n \n%\n49.2\n \n%\nBeta\n0.845\n0.695\nRisk-free rate - three year award\n4.16\n \n%\n4.08\n \n%\nIn making these assumptions, we base the expected volatility on the historical volatility over three years using daily stock price observations. The beta is calculated by comparing the risk of our stock to the risk of the applicable peer group index, using three years of daily price data. We base the risk-free rate on the Treasury bond yields corresponding to the length of each performance period as reported by the Federal Reserve. \nThe payout schedule for the TSR awards is as follows, with linear interpolation for points between the 30\nth\n and 75\nth\n percentiles:\nTSR Percentile Ranking\nPayout (% of Maximum)\nAt or above 75th percentile\n100\n \n%\n50th percentile\n50\n \n%\n30th percentile\n25\n \n%\nBelow 30th percentile\n—\n \n%\n107\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded compensation expense of approximately $\n21\n million, $\n27\n million and $\n23\n million, respectively, related to the RSU awards to senior executives. \nThe following table is a summary of the status of our senior executive plans for the three years ended December 31, 2024: \n Year ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nShares \n(in millions) \nFair Value \n(per share)\nShares \n(in millions) \nFair Value \n(per share)\nShares \n(in millions) \nFair Value \n(per share)\nBalance, at beginning of year\n2.6\n$\n17\n \n3.4\n$\n15\n \n3.2\n$\n12\n \nGranted\n1.7\n17\n \n1.6\n16\n \n1.6\n17\n \nVested \n(1)\n(\n1.3\n)\n18\n \n(\n2.2\n)\n19\n \n(\n1.3\n)\n16\n \nForfeited/expired\n(\n0.1\n)\n18\n \n(\n0.2\n)\n19\n \n(\n0.1\n)\n16\n \nBalance, at end of year\n2.9\n17\n \n2.6\n17\n \n3.4\n15\n \nIssued in calendar year \n(1)\n1.2\n19\n \n0.7\n16\n \n0.5\n17\n \n___________\n(1)\nShares that vest at December 31 of each year are issued to the employees in the first quarter of the following year, although the requisite service period is complete. Accordingly, the \n1.2\n million shares issued in 2024 include shares vested at December 31, 2023, after adjusting for shares withheld to meet employee tax requirements. The shares withheld for employee tax requirements were valued at $\n18\n million, $\n11\n million and $\n8\n million for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \nOther Stock Plans \nIn addition to the share-based plans described above, we maintain an upper-middle management plan and an employee stock purchase plan. The upper-middle management awards are time-based, equity-classified awards that vest within \nthree-years\n of the grant date and compensation expense is recognized over the life of the award based on the grant date fair value. Through the employee stock purchase plan, employees can purchase stock at a discount of \n10\n% of the lower of the beginning and ending stock price each quarter. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we granted a total of \n0.3\n million shares, \n0.2\n million shares and \n0.2\n million shares, respectively, under these two programs and recorded compensation expense of approximately $\n3\n million, $\n3\n million and $\n3\n million, respectively.\n \n10.    \nProfit Sharing and Post-employment Benefit Plans\nWe contribute to defined contribution plans for the benefit of employees who meet certain eligibility requirements and who elect participation in the plans. The discretionary amount to be matched by us is determined annually by Host Inc.’s Board of Directors. Our liability recorded for this obligation is not material. Payments for these items were not material for the three years ended December 31, 2024.\n \n11.    \nDispositions\nWe disposed of \none\n hotel in 2023 and \nfour\n hotels in 2022, and recorded aggregate gains on sale of approximately $\n69\n million and $\n18\n million, respectively. The gain on sale of assets is included in other gains on the statement of operations. We did \nnot\n have any dispositions during 2024.\nIn conjunction with the sale of The Camby, Autograph Collection in 2023, we provided a $\n72\n million loan to the buyer. The loan had an initial interest rate equal to Term SOFR plus \n425\n basis points and an initial scheduled maturity date of June 10, 2025. An additional $\n7\n million in funding was borrowed for property improvement plan financing. As of December 31, 2024, the outstanding loan was included in Notes Receivable on our balance sheets. Subsequent to year-end, the loan to the buyer was repaid in full.\nIn connection with the sales of the Sheraton Boston Hotel and Sheraton New York Times Square Hotel in 2022, we provided loans to the buyers for $\n163\n million and $\n250\n million, respectively. These loans were repaid during 2023.\n108\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n12.    \nAcquisitions\nDuring 2024, we acquired the following assets:\n \n•\nthe \n215\n-room 1 Hotel Nashville and \n506\n-room Embassy Suites by Hilton Nashville Downtown for $\n530\n million;\n•\nthe \n234\n-room 1 Hotel Central Park for $\n265\n million; and\n•\nthe \n450\n-room Turtle Bay Resort, including a \n49\n-acre land parcel entitled for development, for a total purchase price of $\n680\n million, net of key money received from Marriott International as part of an agreement to transition management to Marriott and convert the property to The Ritz-Carlton brand. The property has been renamed The Ritz-Carlton O'ahu, Turtle Bay.\nOn November 1, 2022, we acquired the \n125\n-room Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole for a total purchase price of $\n315\n million.\n \n13.    \nFair Value Measurements\nOther Liabilities\nFair Value of Other Financial Liabilities. \nWe did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our other financial assets or liabilities. The fair values of our notes receivable, secured debt and our credit facility are determined based on the expected future payments discounted at risk-adjusted rates.

Hotels managed or franchised by Marriott and Hyatt represent approximately \n60\n% and \n17\n% of our total revenues, respectively. Under these agreements, the managers generally have sole responsibility for all activities necessary for the day-to-day operation of the hotels, including establishing room rates, processing reservations and promoting and publicizing the hotels. The managers also provide all employees for the hotels, prepare reports, budgets and projections, control the working capital, and provide other administrative and accounting support services to the hotels. Costs and \n109\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nexpenses incurred by the managers are reimbursed by us. We have approval rights over budgets, capital expenditures, significant leases and contractual commitments, and various other matters.\nThe initial term of our agreements generally is \n10\n to \n25\n years, with \none\n or more renewal terms at the option of the manager. The majority of our agreements condition the manager’s right to exercise options for renewal upon the satisfaction of specified economic performance criteria. The manager typically receives a base management fee, which is calculated as a percentage (generally \n2\n-\n3\n%) of annual gross revenues, and an incentive management fee, which typically is calculated as a percentage (generally \n10\n-\n20\n%) of operating profit after the owner has received a priority return on its investment. In the case of our hotels operating under the W\n®\n, Westin\n®\n, Luxury Collection\n®\n and St. Regis\n®\n brands, the base management fee is \n1\n% of annual gross revenues, but that amount is supplemented by license fees payable to Marriott under a separate license agreement pertaining to the designated brand, including rights to use trademarks, service marks and logos, matters relating to compliance with certain brand standards and policies, and the provision of certain system programs and centralized services. Under the license agreement, Marriott generally receives \n5\n% of gross revenues attributable to room sales and \n2\n% of gross revenues attributable to food and beverage sales in addition to the base management fee.\nPursuant to the agreements, the manager furnishes the hotels with certain chain services, which generally are provided on a central or regional basis to all hotels in the manager’s hotel system. Chain services include central training, advertising and promotion, national reservation systems, computerized payroll and accounting services, and such additional services as needed which may be more efficiently performed on a centralized basis. Costs and expenses incurred in providing such services are allocated among the hotels managed, owned or leased by the manager on a fair and equitable basis. In addition, our managers generally sponsor a guest rewards program, the costs of which are charged to all of the hotels that participate in such program.\nWe are obligated to provide the manager with sufficient funds, generally \n4\n-\n5\n% of the revenues generated at the hotel, to cover the cost of (a) certain non-routine repairs and maintenance to the hotels which normally are capitalized, and (b) replacements and renewals to the hotels’ furniture, fixtures and equipment. Under certain circumstances, we will be required to establish escrow accounts for such purposes under terms outlined in the agreements.\nWe generally are limited in our ability to sell, lease or otherwise transfer our hotels unless the transferee assumes the related management agreement. However, most agreements include owner rights to terminate on the basis of the manager’s failure to meet certain performance-based metrics. Typically, these criteria are subject to the manager’s ability to ‘cure’ and avoid termination by payment to us of specified deficiency amounts (or, in some instances, waiver of the right to receive specified future management fees).\nIn addition to any performance-based or other termination rights, we have negotiated specific termination rights related to specific agreements. These termination rights can take a number of different forms, including termination of agreements upon sale that leave the property unencumbered by any agreement; termination upon sale provided that the property continues to be operated under a license or franchise agreement with continued brand affiliation; and termination without sale or other condition, which may require the payment of a fee.\n \n16.    \nGeographic and Business Segment Information\nOur chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") is our chief executive officer. We consider each one of our hotels to be an operating segment, as we allocate resources and assess operating performance based on individual hotels.

We do not allocate corporate level income and expenses to segments. Our CODM does not use asset book values in assessing performance or allocating resources for our operating segments and therefore this information is not disclosed.\n111\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents revenues, significant expenses, and EBITDA for our reportable segment (in millions):\n2024\n2023\n2022\nHotel Ownership\nTotal\nHotel Ownership\nTotal\nHotel Ownership\nTotal\nRevenues\nRooms\n$\n3,426\n \n$\n3,426\n \n$\n3,244\n \n$\n3,244\n \n$\n3,014\n \n$\n3,014\n \nFood and beverage\n1,716\n \n1,716\n \n1,582\n \n1,582\n \n1,418\n \n1,418\n \nOther\n542\n \n542\n \n485\n \n485\n \n475\n \n475\n \nTotal revenues \n5,684\n \n5,684\n \n5,311\n \n5,311\n \n4,907\n \n4,907\n \nExpenses\nRooms\n849\n \n849\n \n787\n \n787\n \n727\n \n727\n \nFood and beverage\n1,137\n \n1,137\n \n1,042\n \n1,042\n \n928\n \n928\n \nOther departmental and support expenses\n1,383\n \n1,383\n \n1,280\n \n1,280\n \n1,181\n \n1,181\n \nManagement fees\n254\n \n254\n \n249\n \n249\n \n217\n \n217\n \nOther property-level expenses\n411\n \n411\n \n383\n \n383\n \n325\n \n325\n \nOther segment items \n(1)\n(\n40\n)\n(\n40\n)\n(\n83\n)\n(\n83\n)\n(\n11\n)\n(\n11\n)\nSegment EBITDA\n1,690\n \n1,690\n \n1,653\n \n1,653\n \n1,540\n \n1,540\n \nAdjustments and reconciling items:\nDepreciation and amortization\n(\n762\n)\n(\n697\n)\n(\n664\n)\nCorporate and other expenses\n(\n123\n)\n(\n132\n)\n(\n107\n)\nNet gain on property insurance settlements\n70\n \n3\n \n6\n \nInterest income\n54\n \n75\n \n30\n \nInterest expense\n(\n215\n)\n(\n191\n)\n(\n156\n)\nOther gains\n—\n \n71\n \n17\n \nEquity in earnings of affiliates\n7\n \n6\n \n3\n \nProvision for income taxes\n(\n14\n)\n(\n36\n)\n(\n26\n)\nConsolidated Net Income\n$\n707\n \n$\n752\n \n$\n643\n \nCapital Expenditures\n$\n548\n \n$\n548\n \n$\n646\n \n$\n646\n \n$\n504\n \n$\n504\n \n_____________\n(1)\nOther segment items consist of gain on business interruption proceeds.

To the extent not covered by insurance, these lawsuits generally fall into the following broad categories: disputes involving hotel-level contracts, employment litigation, compliance with laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, tax disputes and other general matters. Under our management agreements, our operators have broad latitude to resolve individual hotel-level claims for amounts generally less than $\n150,000\n. However, for matters exceeding such threshold, our operators may not settle claims without our consent.\n112\nTable of Contents\nHOST HOTELS & RESORTS, INC., HOST HOTELS & RESORTS, L.P., AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBased on our analysis of legal proceedings with which the Company and our hotel managers are currently involved or of which we are aware and the resolution of similar claims in the past, we have recorded immaterial accruals as of December 31, 2024 related to such claims. We have estimated that, in the aggregate, our losses related to these proceedings will not be material. We are not aware of any other matters with a reasonably possible unfavorable outcome for which disclosure of a loss contingency is required. No assurances can be given as to the outcome of any pending legal proceedings.\nHurricane Loss Contingencies\nMany of our hotels in Florida were affected by Hurricanes Helene and Milton, which made landfall in September and October 2024, respectively. Due to evacuation mandates and/or loss of commercial power, \nfour\n of our properties in Florida were temporarily closed, \nthree\n of which have reopened. The most significant damage sustained during the storms occurred at The Don CeSar, which closed on September 25, 2024, following a mandatory evacuation order prior to the landfall of Hurricane Helene. The Don CeSar sustained extensive damage due to storm surge, which flooded the lower level of the hotel, including the fitness center, \ntwo\n food and beverage (\"F&B\") outlets, retail outlets and the resort's beach club. Remediation efforts are underway, and we currently expect a phased reopening of the hotel beginning late in the first quarter of 2025. Limited property damage was reported at the other Florida properties within our consolidated portfolio.\nWe are still evaluating the complete scope of property damage and business interruption loss at our Florida properties. At The Don CeSar, our current estimate of the book value of the property and equipment written off and remediation costs is approximately $\n51\n million, for which we have recorded a corresponding insurance receivable of $\n51\n million. We believe our insurance coverage should be sufficient to cover substantially all of the property damage and the near-term loss of business in excess of our insurance deductibles; therefore, we have not recorded any loss related to The Don CeSar on the consolidated statements of operations as of December 31, 2024. However, for certain of our other properties, we have recorded a loss of $\n6\n million related to property damage and remediation costs for which we will not be filing an insurance claim. The loss is included in net gain on insurance settlements on our consolidated statements of operations as of December 31, 2024. \nIn September 2022, the majority of our hotels in Florida were affected by Hurricane Ian. The most significant damage sustained during the storm occurred at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa. The Hyatt Regency Coconut Point reopened to guests in November 2022, with the final phase of reconstruction, the resort's waterpark, completed in June 2023. On July 6, 2023, The Ritz-Carlton, Naples reopened its guestrooms, suites and amenities, including the new tower expansion and completed the final restoration step of bringing the permanent central energy plant online in April 2024. We have received the final total settlement of $\n308\n million of insurance proceeds related to claims resulting from Hurricane Ian. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, $\n19\n million and $\n80\n million, respectively, was recognized as a gain on business interruption, and $\n72\n million and $\n3\n million, respectively, was recognized as a gain on property insurance, which are both included in net gain on insurance settlements on our consolidated statements of operations. \nMaui Wildfires\nWe recognized $\n21\n million of business interruption proceeds in 2024 representing the final settlement from claims resulting from the August 2023 wildfires in Maui. This is included in net gain on insurance settlements on our consolidated statements of operations. There was no property damage caused by the event.\nTax Indemnification Agreements\nBecause of certain federal and state income tax considerations of the former owners of \ntwo\n hotels currently owned by Host L.P., we have agreed to restrictions on selling such hotels, or repaying or refinancing mortgage debt, for varying periods. One of these agreements expires in 2028 and the other in 2031.\n113\nTable of Contents\nItem 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nItem 9A.
