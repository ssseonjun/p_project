Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation . We may incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely affect business and profitability .\n The ability of suppliers to deliver materials, parts, components and manufacturing equipment to our manufacturing facilities, and our ability to manufacture without disruption, could affect our business performance . Significant shortages, supplier capacity constraints or production disruptions, price increases, duties, tariffs or other government actions could increase our operating costs, disrupt our operations and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products .\n Certain members of management, directors and shareowners own stock in UTC, Carrier and Otis and as a result may face actual or potential conflicts of interest . If we are required to pay UTC and/or Otis under these indemnities, our financial results could be negatively impacted . The market price and trading volume of our common stock may fluctuate significantly .\n Anti-takeover provisions could enable our Board of Directors to resist a takeover attempt by a third party and limit the power of our shareowners . Natural disasters, epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition . Uncertainty in U.S. trade policy, including changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions .\n 50% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2024, are derived from international operations . As a result, changes in local and regional economic conditions, including fluctuating exchange rates, may adversely affect demand for our products and profits generated by our non-U.S. operations . The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, including tariffs, could adversely affect our competitive position .\n We expect that sales to emerging markets will continue to account for a significant portion of our sales . Emerging markets present many risks, including cultural differences, compliance risks, economic and government instability, exchange rate fluctuations and the imposition of foreign exchange and capital controls . We are party to joint ventures and other strategic relationships, which may not be successful and may expose us to unique risks .\n Some of our strategic relationships engage in manufacturing and/or product development . Loss of a key channel partner, or a significant downturn could adversely affect our results of operations in a particular period .

The effects of climate events could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials and by increasing insurance and other operating costs . We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain that could result in higher prices for our products .\n Increased public awareness and concern about climate events may continue to generate more international, regional and/or national requirements to curtail the use of high global warming potential refrigerants . In some instances, these requirements may render our existing technology, particularly some of our HVAC and refrigeration products, non-compliant or obsolete .\n At the same time, U.S. energy and climate policy may not align with trends . Inconsistent international, regional and/or national requirements associated with climate regulations also create economic and regulatory uncertainty . There is also regulatory and budgetary uncertainty associated with government incentives, which, if discontinued or materially reduced, could adversely impact the demand for energy-efficient buildings and homes .\n There can be no assurance of the extent to which such contracts, credits, offsets, products, operations or technologies will be available or effective in reducing emissions or energy intensity . If we are unable to make substantial progress toward or meet these goals, then we could incur adverse publicity and reaction from investors, activist groups or other stakeholders .\n Sales to residential HVAC customers tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the year .

We also may incur - and have incurred - unanticipated costs or expenses, including asset impairment and other charges . In connection with certain acquisitions including the acquisition of the VCS Business, we have disclosed and may from time to time disclose, unaudited pro forma financial information .\n As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately $12.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding indebtedness . The success of future acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures will depend on the satisfaction of conditions precedent to such transactions . We may incur additional debt in the future, which could adversely affect our business and profitability .\n Our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, regulatory factors, and other factors beyond our control .
