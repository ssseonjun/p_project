  "item1_summary": " BMS expects that sales of its branded products like Orencia, Eliquis and Opdivo will decline after the loss of market exclusivity for such products . There is a high rate of failure inherent in the research and development process for new drugs . BMS has experienced setbacks and may continue to do so .\n New products could be delayed due to changes in approval process . Changes could be caused by changes to the law or changes to existing products . The company says it cannot predict when or when new products will be released . It is not certain if the new products are ready to be released in the U.S. and will not be available for purchase .\n The public announcement of data from our clinical studies, or those of our competitors, or news of any developments related to our, or our competitors’, products or late-stage compounds may cause significant volatility in our stock price . Failure to maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications for existing products can have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flow, financial condition and prospects .\n In some countries, including certain EU member states, basic patent protections for our products may not exist . The scope of our patent rights, if any, varies from country to country and may also be dependent on the availability of meaningful legal remedies in a country . Failure to obtain or maintain patent and other intellectual property rights could result in a rapid loss of sales for any affected products which could be material to us .\n Generic and biosimilar product manufacturers as well as other groups seeking financial gain are also seeking to challenge patents before they expire . We have faced and may continue to face earlier-than-expected competition for any products at any time . Patents covering our key products have been, and are likely to continue to be, subject to validity, enforceability and infringement challenges in patent litigations .\n Generic entry for Revlimid in the UK began on January 18, 2022, and in various other European countries on February 18 . In the U.S., following patent settlements, certain companies have begun marketing generic lenalidomide pursuant to volume-limited licenses . Lower-priced generics or biosimilars for BMS biologic products or competing biologics could negatively impact our volumes and prices .\n There is no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full time period that appears in the estimates disclosed in this 2024 Form 10-K or that we assume when we provide our financial guidance . We cannot predict whether the Trump administration will finalize the draft framework or if the government will propose other drug pricing policy changes .\n We could experience difficulties, delays and disruptions in our supply chain as well as in the manufacturing, distribution and sale of our products . We cannot predict with accuracy the timing or impact of the introduction of competitive products that treat diseases and conditions like those treated by our products and product candidates . New products may have lower prices, superior efficacy (benefit) or safety (risk) profiles .\n Failure of a third-party manufacturer to supply us with bulk active or finished product on time . Construction or regulatory approval delays for new facilities or expansion of existing facilities . Manufacturing processes for novel cell-based therapies, such as CAR-T cell therapies, are still evolving, and our processes may be more complicated or more expensive .\n We may face challenges with sourcing raw materials and supplies for clinical and, if approved, commercial manufacturing . Logistical and shipment delays and other factors not in our control could prevent or delay the delivery of our product candidates and marketed products to patients . Even slight deviations at any point in the production process for our CAR-T cell therapies could result in loss of product or regulatory remedial action .\n Current or future lawsuits, claims, proceedings and government investigations could preclude or delay commercialization of our products . A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject us to significant damages and/or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale, or use of the affected product or products . Licensing agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms .\n We are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations . The costs of compliance with such laws or the negative results of non-compliance could adversely affect our business, our operating results and our financial condition . In addition, the healthcare industry is highly regulated and subject to frequent changes, including as a result of new judicial or governmental decisions .\n There is an increased focus by foreign, federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative . Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant penalties, including potential exclusion from federal healthcare programs, and reputational harm . We cannot predict how other future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business .\n We expect to experience or be subject to increased restrictions, compliance and assurance costs, recurring investments in data gathering and reporting systems, and legal expenses related to such new or changing legal or regulatory requirements . Implementation of our environmental, social and governance aspirational goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, and depends in part on third-party performance or data that is outside of our control .\n Changes in tax laws and regulations can and do occur. Significant judgment is required for determining the Company’s tax liabilities . Future earnings could be negatively impacted if our tax strategies are ineffective or by further changes in tax legislation . Failure of third parties to meet contractual, regulatory and other obligations could adversely affect our business .\n Using these third parties poses a number of risks, such as: they may not perform to our standards or legal requirements . They may not produce reliable results, they might not perform in a timely manner, they may experience a cyber attack or business disruption . Some third parties are located in markets subject to political and social risks, corruption, infrastructure problems and natural disasters .\n Pharmaceutical products receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration . Additional clinical trials, head-to-head studies, real-world data analyses, adverse events reports following the use of our products may result in product label changes or other measures that could reduce the product's market acceptance and result in declining revenues . We could suffer financial and reputational harm or other negative outcomes .\n New information added to a product’s label can affect its risk-benefit profile, leading to potential voluntary or mandatory recalls, withdrawals or declining revenue, as well as legal claims . The illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or unregistered versions of our products could have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings, reputation and business .\n The prevalence of counterfeit medicines is an industry-wide issue due to the adoption of e-commerce . The internet exposes patients to greater risk as it is a preferred vehicle for dangerous counterfeit offers and scams because of the anonymity it affords counterfeiters . The inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of social media could cause brand damage or information leakage .\n We rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, including internet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and tools . Cybersecurity risks continue to develop, including as a result of threat actors increasingly targeting employees and supply chains . There can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will prevent breakdowns or incidents to our or our third-party vendors’ systems .\n A significant breakdown, invasion, corruption, destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems or leak or theft of proprietary, confidential or personal information could negatively impact operations . There is no assurance that our continuing efforts will prevent breakdowns or incidents to our or our third-party providers’ systems or databases that could adversely affect our business . The regulatory landscape related to AI remains uncertain, and we may be required to devote significant resources to comply with developing laws and address ethical concerns .\n We expect Eliquis, Opdivo, Orencia and Yervoy to represent a significant percentage of our revenue, earnings and cash flows during the next few years . A reduction in revenue from any of these products due to loss of market exclusivity or other factors could adversely impact our earnings . In addition, in the U.S., most of our products are distributed through wholesalers .\n Third-party royalties represent a significant percentage of our pretax income and operating cash flow . Pretax income generated from royalties was approximately $2.4 billion in 2024 . Failure to execute our business strategy or to identify and effectively manage acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions could adversely impact our growth and profitability .\n Our strategy is focused on delivering innovative, transformational medicines to patients in a focused set of disease areas . To support future revenue growth and maintain an adequate pipeline, we have acquired, or in-licensed, a number of assets . We expect to continue to support our pipeline with compounds or products obtained through licensing and acquisitions .\n We may not be successful in separating underperforming or non-strategic assets . The value of those securities will fluctuate and may depreciate in value . We might also incur asset impairment charges related to acquisitions or divestitures that reduce our earnings . Nonperformance by us could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition or reputation .\n If the execution or implementation of acquisitions, divestitures, alliances, joint ventures and other portfolio actions is not successful, it could adversely impact our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations . Failure to attract and retain a highly qualified workforce could affect our ability to successfully develop and commercialize products . Pursuit of strategic transaction opportunities in the future may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, and could result in increased leverage and/or a downgrade of our credit ratings .\n Global economic and political risks pose significant challenges to a company’s growth and profitability . We generated approximately 29% of our revenues outside of the U.S. in 2024 . A global economic downturn could create or amplify a variety of risks to our business and could negatively affect our growth . We have significant indebtedness that could have negative consequences .\n The COVID-19 pandemic affected demand for some of our products driven by lower patient starts and visits, and we would expect any future pandemics to have a similar effect . The results of our operations could be negatively impacted by any member country exiting the eurozone monetary union or EU . We also have exposure to customer credit risks in Europe, South America and other markets .\n We cannot predict or reasonably estimate the impact of any potential long-term changes to the healthcare industry from global economic and political events, including any future pandemics . Changes in the healthcare system could impose additional burdens on clinical trials . We may also experience additional pricing pressures, shifts in the U.S. payer channel mix and/or increased governmental regulation .\n The declaration, amount and timing of any dividends fall within the discretion of our Board . A reduction or elimination of our dividend payments or dividend program could adversely affect our stock price . The IRA imposes a non-deductible 1% excise tax on our net repurchases of shares after December 31, 2022 . It is possible that global economic and political events, including changes to the geopolitical relationship between the U.S. and China, other geopolitical events and conflicts, could exacerbate any of the other risks .\n Our amended bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain lawsuits between us and our stockholders . This could limit the ability to obtain a forum that it finds favorable for such lawsuits and make it more costly for stockholders to bring such lawsuits, which may have the effect of discouraging such lawsuits .\n This forum selection provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the Securities Act of 1933 or Exchange Act . The provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers and other employees, which may discourage lawsuits .\n The Company employs robust cybersecurity and data privacy programs that are designed to assess, identify and manage material risks from cybersecurity threats . The risk of a court declining to enforce the forum selection provision contained in our amended bylaws is low, if a court were to find the provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings .\n Our employees are exposed to data-driven cybersecurity awareness campaigns and annual training in order to keep pace with industry standards . In many regions, our employees receive a monthly snapshot of their cyber behaviors and are given a rating for their cyber vigilance . In the event of a cybersecurity incident, our incident response team refers to our CIRP and existing management internal controls and disclosure processes .\n We perform multiple tabletop exercises across various levels of the Company each year to test our incident response procedures, enhance our resiliency . We recognize that third parties that provide services to the Company can be subject to cybersecurity incidents that could impact the Company . We also conduct tabletop exercises to identify improvement opportunities in our supply chain resilience .\n We face risks of incidents, whether through cyber attacks or cyber intrusions through the Cloud, the Internet, phishing attempts, ransomware and other forms of malware, email attachments, extortion, and other scams . We make efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information technology systems, these systems are subject to the risk of a cybersecurity incident or disruption ."
