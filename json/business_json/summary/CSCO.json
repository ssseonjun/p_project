  "item1_summary": " Some of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area . New ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed . As we expand into new markets, we will face competition not only from our existing competitors . We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products .\n The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability . We must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies . We face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology . Excess inventory may harm our gross margins, and inventory held by distributors could affect our results of operations .\n We have in the past and may in the future increase our efforts in procuring components or enter additional purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers . If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins . AI algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed, AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving .\n Our obligations to comply with the evolving legal and regulatory landscape could entail significant costs or limit our ability to incorporate certain AI capabilities into our offerings . Our financial performance may be negatively impacted by demand for, and costs to deliver, our software subscription offerings; and interruptions or performance problems associated with these offerings may negatively impact our business and financial results .\n To generate sales growth for our software subscription offerings, we need to convince potential customers to purchase new licenses or subscriptions . Failure to do so could result in decreased revenue, reduced sales, increased churn or otherwise negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition . We have experienced, and may in the future experience, interruptions in service, storage failures, and other performance-related problems due to a variety of factors .\n We make significant investments to increase or maintain capacity and to develop and implement new technologies in our infrastructure and operations . We may not be successful in developing or implementing these technologies . We are also subject to the risk of performance-related problems or interruption of the services provided by third-party providers on which we rely .\n The process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, is complex and uncertain . If we fail to accurately predict customers’ changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed . We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products the market will accept .\n There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify new product and services opportunities, develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely manner . Success depends on several factors, including proper product and service definition, component costs and timely completion and introduction of these products . The products and technologies in our other pr. ner in which customers wish to consume them will not render our products obsolete or noncompetitive .\n Changes in industry structure and market conditions could lead to charges related to discontinuances of certain of our products or businesses, asset impairments and workforce reductions or restructurings . oduct categories and key priority areas may not prove to have the market success we anticipate, and we may not successfully identify and invest in other emerging or new products and services .\n dwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings . Our restructuring activities, including any related charges and the impact of the related headcount restructurings, could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition . Over the long term we intend to invest in engineering, sales, service and marketing activities, and in key priority areas .\n Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: Difficulties or delays in integrating the operations (including IT security), systems, technologies, products, and personnel of the acquired companies . Acquisitions have in the past and may in the future also cause us to:Issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders’ percentage ownership. Use a substantial portion of our cash resources, or incur debt. Use additional debt to pay for an acquisition. Record goodwill and intangible assets that are subject to impairment testing on a regular basis .\n Mergers and acquisitions of high-technology companies are inherently risky and subject to many factors outside of our control . Failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could materially harm our business and operating results . Risks described with respect to new product development also apply to acquisitions . Entrance into new or developing markets exposes us to additional competition and will likely increase demands on our service and support operations .\n ete infrastructure deployments may require greater levels of service, support, and financing than we have provided in the past . Entry into other markets has subjected and will subject us to additional risks, including the effects of general market conditions and reduced consumer confidence . There can be no assurance we will realize the expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from joint ventures .\n Product quality problems could lead to reduced revenue, gross margins, and net income . An inability to cure a product defect or bug could result in the failure of a product line, temporary or permanent withdrawal from a product or market, damage to our reputation, inventory costs, product reengineering expenses or legal liability . Political or economic changes in a specific country or region could harm our operating results and financial condition .\n Our growth depends in part on our increasing sales into emerging countries . We also depend on non-U.S. operations of our contract manufacturers . Our business in emerging countries in the aggregate experienced a decline in orders in certain prior periods . There can be no assurance that our investments in these countries will be successful .\n Most of our sales are on an open credit basis, with typical payment terms of 30 days in the United States . There can be no assurance that programs we have in place to monitor and mitigate credit risks will be effective . In the past, there have been significant bankruptcies among customers both on open credit and with loan or lease financing arrangements .\n We are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates . Our investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize . We could lose our entire investment in these companies, we could lose their entire investment .\n An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the cost of buying goods in foreign currencies . Failure to meet key objectives could increase risk to those in the U.S. may also increase the risk of foreign currency exchange rates . The loss of key staff members could also be a problem for the company's ability to meet its goals .\n Claims, litigation and governmental investigations may arise from a wide variety of business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases, significant business transactions, warranty or product claims, employment practices, and regulation . An unfavorable resolution of claims, litigation or governmental investigations could materially harm our business, operating results, or financial condition . An inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future; or delays in hiring required personnel, particularly in engineering and sales fields, could make it difficult to meet key objectives .\n Our operating results may be negatively impacted and damage to our reputation may occur due to the production and sale of counterfeit versions of our products . Changes in our provision for income taxes or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our income tax returns could negatively impact our results . We work diligently with law enforcement authorities in various countries to block the manufacture of counterfeit goods and to interdict their sale .\n The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), an international association comprised of 38 countries, including the United States, has made changes, including a minimum tax rate of 15% in each taxing jurisdiction . There can be no assurance that these changes and any contemplated changes if finalized, once adopted, will not have an adverse impact on our provision for income taxes .\n Our business and operations are especially subject to the risks of earthquakes, floods, and other natural catastrophic events . Global climate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more frequently and/or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, changing precipitation, and flooding . The occurrence of any such event in the future could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition .\n As of the end of fiscal 2025, there are $24.8 billion in unsecured notes outstanding . There can be no assurance that any future debt will be used to repay the money owed to the U.S. government . The U.N. sanctions could also have a negative impact on the economy .\n Our reputation and/or business could be negatively impacted by matters relating to environmental, social, and governance . We are subject to evolving and sometimes conflicting, laws, regulations, policies, and investor and other stakeholder expectations . We could fail to achieve, or be perceived to fail, our 2040 net zero goal or other initiatives, goals, or commitments .\n There can be no assurance that any of these patents or other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or that our rights will, in fact, provide competitive advantages to us . Many key aspects of our technology are governed by industry-wide standards, which are usable by all market entrants . The outcome of any actions taken in these foreign countries may be different than if such actions were determined under the laws of the U.S.\n It is not possible to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components will infringe on the patent rights of others . We are not dependent on any individual patents or group of patents for particular segments of the market . We may be found to be at a disadvantage to others who need not be able to create innovative products that have been successful .\n There can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms and conditions, if at all, or that our indemnification by our suppliers will be adequate to cover our costs if a claim were brought directly against us or our customers . Resistance even to unmeritorious claims could damage customer relationships . Our exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions .\n It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of these products . There can be no assurance that the necessary licenses would be available on acceptable terms . The inclusion in our commercial offerings of software or other intellectual property licensed from third parties on a nonexclusive basis could limit our ability to protect our proprietary rights in our products .\n Cyber-related events have caused, and in the future could result in, compromise to, or the disruption of access to, the operation of our solutions and IT environment . These attacks and the exploitation of vulnerabilities in our solutions will continue and may intensify during periods of diplomatic or armed conflict or other geopolitical tensions . The emergence and maturation of AI capabilities has led to new and/or more effective methods of cyber attacks .\n The products and services (together, our ‘solutions”) we sell to customers, and the cloud-based services operated or enabled by us, inevitably contain vulnerabilities . The occurrence of a cyber attack, data breach or other incident could subject us to direct or indirect liability to our customers, data subjects, suppliers, business partners, employees, and others .\n Vulnerabilities can persist even after we have issued security updates if we have not identified and addressed the root cause of a particular vulnerability, if customers have not installed the most recent updates . Customers may also desire to test security updates before they can be deployed which can delay implementation . When customers do not deploy security updates in a timely manner, use solutions that are end of life and no longer receive security updates, decide not to upgrade to the latest versions of our solutions containing security updates .\n Our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect and appropriately use data could result in claims of legal and/or regulatory action against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business . Global privacy and data protection-related laws and regulations, including cybersecurity laws, are evolving, extensive, and complex . We rely on third-party providers of software (including open source) and cloud-based services .\n Our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially harmed by evolving regulatory uncertainty or obligations applicable to our products and services . Our actual or perceived failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to claims of liability, or give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation, and/ or otherwise negatively impact our business .\n Government and other customers' procurement policies, priorities, regulations, technology initiatives and/or other obligations often give rise to evolving privacy, cybersecurity, operational resilience, data governance, or other requirements . Failure or delay in meeting and maintaining compliance with such requirements could negatively impact our business, including by limiting our ability to sell products and services directly or indirectly, to public sector, critical infrastructure .\n The stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many technology companies, in particular, and that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies . We recognize the critical importance of maintaining the trust and confidence of our customers, employees, and other stakeholders . To help mitigate the cybersecurity risks that we face, we maintain processes for identifying, assessing, and managing such risks .\n S&TO actively monitors for and evaluates cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats, and incidents observable on the Internet and the dark web . The company partners with Cisco’s Talos Threat Intelligence Group and third parties, including governments and peer companies, to share and receive threat intelligence and other information . We strive to embed security into our products and services through the Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL)\n S&TO engages third parties in connection with our cybersecurity risk management processes, including cybersecurity consultants and auditors . The Chief Security and Trust Officer provides regular reports on the status of cybersecurity risks, priorities, and focus areas to our executive leadership team . The Board of Directors oversees risks related to cybersecurity threats to our business directly and through its Audit Committee .\n As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not believe our business, operating results, or financial condition have been materially affected by cybersecurity risks, including as a result of previously identified cybersecurity incidents .
