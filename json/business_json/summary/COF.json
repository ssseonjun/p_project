We have elected to exclude certain elements of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) from our regulatory capital as permitted for a Category III institution . The Federal Reserve, OCC, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, “Federal Banking Agencies’) adopted a final rule that provides banking institutions an optional five-year transition period to phase in the impact of the CECL standard .\n January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021, electing banking institutions were permitted to add back to their regulatory capital an amount equal to the sum of the after-tax “day 1” CECL adoption impact and 25% of the increase in the allowance since the adoption of the standard . The following table summarizes the capital impact delay and phase in period on our regulatory capital from 2020 to 2025 .\n Capital Ratios under Basel III standardized approach subject to the applicable transition provisions, the regulatory minimum capital adequacy ratios and the applicable well-capitalized standard for each ratio as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 . Capital requirements that are not applicable are denoted by “N/A.” Capital Ratio.\n As of December 31, 2024, funds available for dividend payments  were $8.9 billion . There can be no assurance that we will declare and pay any dividends to stockholders . We are restricted from paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock in excess of $0.60 per share per quarter . The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share for the years .\n The “two-class” method was used in the application of “Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The computation of the basic and diluted earnings per share per share was based on the use of the two-class method as described in ‘Note 1’s summary of significant accounting policies.’ The computation is based on net income from continuing operations, income from discontinued operations and income from other sources .\n Capital One has active stock-based compensation plan available for the issuance of shares to employees and directors . As of December 31, 2024, under the Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive plan (“2004 Plan”), under the 2004 Plan, we are authorized to issue  around 19.6 million common shares in various forms .\n Performance Share Units and Restricted Stock Units are share-settled awards that do not contain performance conditions and are granted to certain employees at no cost to the recipient . RSUs are subject to forfeiture until certain restrictions have lapsed, including continued employment for a specified period of time . PSUs generally vest over three years from the date of grant; some PSUs cliff vest on or shortly after the third anniversary of the grant date .\n The value of RSUs and PSUs will equal the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and the expense is recognized over the vesting period . Certain PSUs have discretionary vesting conditions and are remeasured at fair value each reporting period . As of December 31, 2024, the unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs is $414. s outstanding .\n The exercise price of stock options will equal the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant . Options generally become exercisable over glygly three years, beginning on the first anniversary of grant; however, some option grants cliff vest on or shortly after the first or third anniversary of the grant date . Capital One Financial Corporation granted no stock options in 2024, 2023 and 2022 .\n All full-time and part-time associates over the age of 18 are eligible to participate .

There was no meaningful prior service cost recognized in the company’s pension plans .\n Current income tax expense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liability . Income tax benefits are recognized when, based on their technical merits, they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination .\n The following table presents the reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax . n for income taxes attributable to continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 .

Nearly all these earnings are considered by management to be invested indefinitely . The fair value accounting guidance provides a three-level fair value hierarchy for classifying financial instruments .\n The accounting guidance for fair value measurements requires that we maximize use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in determining fair value . The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:Level 1:Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities .Level 3: Valuation is generated from techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market .\n The following describes the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis . The determination of the leveling of financial instruments in fair value hierarchy is performed at the end of each reporting period . For the majority of securities in other investment categories, we utilize multiple vendor pricing services to obtain fair value measurements . RMBS and CMBS are generally classified as Level 2 or 3 .\n Capital One Financial Corporation (COF) provides detailed information on the pricing methodology and assumptions used to value the securities . The company uses exchange-traded and OTC derivatives to manage its interest rate, foreign currency and commodity risk exposures . The majority of our derivatives do not have readily available quoted market prices, therefore, we value them using vendor-based models .\n We typically classify derivatives as Level 2 when significant inputs can be observed in a liquid market and the model itself does not require significant judgment . When instruments are traded in less liquid markets and significant inputs are unobservable, such as interest rate swaps whose remaining terms do not correlate with market observable interest rate yield curves . We consider the impact of credit risk valuation adjustments when measuring the fair value of derivative contracts .\n The following table displays our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 . We offer a voluntary non-qualified deferred compensation plan to eligible associates . The plan assets, which consist of those publicly traded mutual funds, are classified as Level 1 .\n Derivative assets are netting of derivative assets and liabilities, and related payables and receivables for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty . Non-performance risk is included in the measurement of derivative asset and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, and is recorded through non-interest income in the consolidated statements of income . Capital One Financial Corporation (COF)\n The table below presents a reconciliation for all assets and liabilities measured and recognized at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 .

The Company provides a detailed description of the Company's financial results . The financial statements are presented at the bottom of the page . The company provided a detailed account of each of its financial statements. The Company provided a comprehensive account of the company’s financial transactions. The net result was $1.1 billion .\n Securities available for sale are included in net securities gains (losses) and retained interests in securitizations . Losses on derivatives are included as a component of net interest income or non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income . Derivial assets and liabilities of $683.683.million and $712.614.million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 and $828.28.million as of Dec. 31, 2023 and  Dec. 1, 2022 .\n An increase in the discount rate, default rates, loss severity or credit spreads, in isolation, would result in a decrease in the fair value measurement . In isolation, an increase in default rates would generally be accompanied by decrease in recovery rates, slower prepayment rates and increase in liquidity spreads . The fair value of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a given change in another input .\n Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements (Dollars in millions) \"Phenomenon\" is based on the use of mortgage securitization structures in which we have retained intereveloped interests in securitizations . Quantitative information are calculated by using the product of the input multiplied by the relative fair value of the instruments . Average weighted averages are calculated by using product of input multiplied by the product of input to the input and the relative fair value of the instruments .\n The following describes the valuation techniques used in estimating the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis . The fair value is determined using appraisal values that are obtained from independent appraisers, broker pricing opinions or other available market information, adjusted for the estimated cost to sell . It is not meaningful to present a consolidated weighted average for the significant unobservable inputs .\n Other assets subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements include equity investments accounted for under the measurement alternative, other repossessed assets and long-lived assets held for sale . Fair value adjustments to these loans are recorded in other non-interest income in our consolidated statements of income . The fair value is determined based on the appraisal value, listing price of the property or collateral provided by independent appraisers .\n As of December 31, 2024, other assets included investments accounted for under measurement alternative of $.71.million and repossessed assets of $.-62.6 million . As of Dec. 31, 2023, other . assets included . investments accounted . for $-46.2 million, repossess assets  of $-45.5 million and long-lived assets held for sale and right-of-use assets totaling $123 million .
