Robinson,” “the company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) is one of the largest global logistics providers in the world, with consolidated total revenues of $17.7 billion in 2024. We deliver logistics like no one else. Companies around the world look to us to reimagine supply chains, advance freight technology and solve logistics challenges\n—\nfrom the simple to the complex. We are grounded in our\n \npromise to deliver exceptional customer success, using our expertise, scale and tailored solutions to help customers navigate increasingly complex global supply chains.\nOperating throughout North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, South America, and the Middle East, we help ensure the seamless delivery of goods across industries and continents. Our global suite of multimodal logistics services brings together the expertise of our people with custom technology differentiated by one of the largest datasets on shipments, routings, and carriers in the world. \nThe Robinson Operating Model is the foundation of our strategy, execution, and accountability throughout the organization. Rooted in Lean principles, it has elevated our team and leaders to focus on accelerated opportunity identification and operational effectiveness in delivering value to our customers. Leveraging our rich datasets supported by the framework of the Robinson Operating Model, our culture has embraced a disciplined approach to continuous improvement and speed of decision making.\nAs one of the world’s largest logistics platforms, our proprietary technology connects \n83,000 \ncustomers and \n450,000 \ncarriers. We work closely with a global network of transportation companies, including contracted motor carriers, railroads, and ocean and air carriers. We utilize those relationships to efficiently and cost-effectively arrange the transport of our customers’ freight. In 2024, our customers trusted us to manage approximately \n37 million\n shipments and \n$23 billion\n in freight. As an integral part of our transportation services, we also provide a wide range of value-added logistics services, such as freight consolidation, drop trailer, cross-border logistics, customs brokerage and trade compliance, supply chain consulting and design, and fully managed third-party logistics (“3PL”) and fourth-party logistics (“4PL”) solutions.\nO\nur global team of supply chain experts, differentiated technology, and integrated product portfolio across ocean, air, rail, and truck shipping bring unique value to the marketplace. Our global perspective across all links in the supply chain are critical in supporting shippers through market volatility and global supply chain disruptions. We are also a key driver of digital transformation in our industry. Our innovations with artificial intelligence (“\nAI\n”), machine learning, and data science benefit our customers and help power our growth strategy. We are expanding the use of generative AI in our industry, creating proprietary technology to perform work that defied automation for decades. Our customers get better service, faster speed-to-market and more cost savings, while our people are freed from repetitive, mundane tasks so they can focus on more strategic work. Our enhancements to our dynamic costing and pricing models are key contributors to expanding our operating margins and growing volume and market share.\nIn addition to transportation and logistics services, we also provide sourcing services under the trade name Robinson Fresh\n®\n (“Robinson Fresh”). Our sourcing services consist primarily of the buying, selling, and/or marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other value-added perishable items. The foundation for much of our logistics expertise can be traced to this original business, founded in 1905, which gives us significant experience in handling produce and temperature controlled commodities. We supply fresh produce through a network of independent produce growers and suppliers. Our customers include grocery retailers, restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers. In many cases, we also arrange the logistics and transportation of the products we sell and provide related supply chain services, such as replenishment, category management, and managed procurement services. We have developed proprietary brands of produce and have exclusive licensing agreements to distribute fresh and value-added produce under recognized consumer brand names. The produce for these brands is sourced through a preferred grower network and packed to order through contract packing agreements. We have instituted quality assurance and monitoring procedures with each of these preferred growers.\nSegment information. \nWe have two reportable segments, North American Surface Transportation (“NAST”) and Global Forwarding, with our remaining operating segments reported as All Other and Corporate. The All Other and Corporate segment includes Robinson Fresh, Managed Solutions, Other Surface Transportation outside of North America, and other miscellaneous revenues and unallocated corporate expenses. See additional disclosure in Note 8, \nSegment Reporting\n, to our consolidated financial statements. \nNAST provides transportation and logistics services across North America through a network of offices in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The primary services provided by NAST include truckload and less than truckload (“LTL”) transportation brokerage services.\n3\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Forwarding provides transportation and logistics services through an international network of offices in North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, South America, and the Middle East and also contracts with independent agents worldwide. The primary services provided by Global Forwarding include ocean freight services, air freight services, and customs brokerage. \nRobinson Fresh provides sourcing services that primarily include the buying, selling, and/or marketing of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other value-added perishable items. Robinson Fresh sources products from around the world. \nIn November 2024, we launched C.H. Robinson Managed Solutions™ to address a growing gap in the marketplace for shippers wanting seamless access to 4PL services, 3PL, managed transportation and Transportation Management Services (“TMS”) technology from one provider. Consulting services, logistics optimization, and day-to-day logistics management services formerly offered through our TMC division are now offered through Managed Solutions.\nOther Surface Transportation revenues are primarily earned by our Europe Surface Transportation operating segment. Europe Surface Transportation provides transportation and logistics services, including truckload and LTL transportation services, across Europe. The sale of our Europe Surface Transportation business was announced in July 2024 and closed in February 2025.\nSales\nTransportation and Logistics Services\nC.H. Robinson provides freight transportation and related logistics and supply chain services. Our services range from commitments on a specific shipment to much more comprehensive and integrated relationships. We execute these services by investing in and retaining talented employees, developing innovative proprietary systems and processes, and utilizing a network of contracted transportation providers, including, but not limited to, contracted motor carriers, railroads, and ocean and air carriers. We make a profit that is driven by the value we provide our customers and the resulting difference between what we charge to our customers for the totality of services provided to them and what we pay to the transportation providers to transport the freight. \nWe provide the following transportation and logistics services:\n•\nTruckload: Through our contracts with motor carriers, we have access to dry vans, temperature controlled vans, flatbeds, and bulk capacity. Through the use of our proprietary Navisphere platform\n®\n, we connect our customers with contracted motor carriers that specialize in their transportation lanes and product types, and we help contracted motor carriers optimize the usage of their equipment. \n•\nLTL: LTL transportation involves the shipment of single or multiple pallets of freight. We primarily focus on shipments of a single pallet or larger, although we handle any size shipment. Through our contracts with motor carriers and the use of Navisphere, we consolidate freight and freight information to provide our customers with a single source of information on their freight. In many instances, we consolidate partial shipments for several customers into full truckloads.\n•\nOcean: As a licensed Non-Vessel Operating Common Carrier (“NVOCC”) and freight forwarder, we consolidate shipments, determine routing, select ocean carriers, contract for ocean shipments, and/or provide for local pickup and delivery of shipments.\n•\nAir: As a certified Indirect Air Carrier (“IAC”) and freight forwarder, we organize air shipments and provide door-to-door service.\n•\nCustoms: Our customs brokers are licensed and regulated by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and other authoritative governmental agencies to assist importers and exporters in meeting regulatory and operational requirements governing imports and exports. \n•\nOther Logistics Services: We provide intermodal transportation service, which is the shipment of freight in containers or trailers by a combination of truck and rail. In addition, we provide fee-based Managed Solutions, warehousing services, and other services.\nCustomers communicate their freight needs, typically on an order-by-order basis, to the C.H. Robinson team responsible for their account, either directly or through highly automated connections established between Navisphere and the customers’ transportation management system. The C.H. Robinson team then ensures all necessary information regarding each shipment is available in Navisphere. We utilize the information from Navisphere and other available sources to select the best contracted carrier based on factors such as their service score, equipment availability, freight rates, and other relevant factors. \n4\nTable of Contents\nOnce the contracted carrier is selected, we receive the contracted carrier’s commitment to provide the transportation. During the time when a shipment is executed, we connect frequently, either electronically or manually, with the contracted carrier to track the status of the shipment to meet the unique needs of our customers. \nFor most of our transportation and logistics services, we are a service provider. By accepting the customer’s order, we accept certain responsibilities for transportation of the shipment from origin to destination. The carrier’s contract is with us, not the customer, and we are responsible for prompt payment of freight charges. In cases where we have agreed to pay for claims for damage to freight while in transit, we pursue reimbursement from the contracted carrier for the claims. In our Managed Solutions business, we are often acting as the shipper’s agent. In those cases, the carrier’s contract is typically with the customer, and we collect a fee for our services.\nAs a result of our logistics capabilities, our technology, our global suite of services, and integrated modes of transportation, some of our customers have us handle all, or a substantial portion, of their freight transportation needs. Our employees price our services to provide a profit to us for the totality of services performed for the customer. Our services to the customer may be priced on a spot market, or transactional basis, or prearranged contractual rates. Most of our contractual rate commitments are for one year or less and allow for renegotiation. As is typical in the transportation industry, most of these contracts do not include specific volume commitments. When we enter into prearranged rate agreements for truckload services with our customers, we usually have fuel surcharge agreements that allow for fuel to primarily act as a pass-through cost, in addition to the underlying linehaul portion of the rate.\nWe purchase most of our truckload services from our contracted truckload carriers on a spot market, or transactional basis, even when we are working with the customer on a contractual basis. In some cases, we may get advance commitments from one or more contracted motor carriers to transport contracted shipments for the length of our customer contract or to provide transportation services within dense transportation lanes. In those cases, where we have prearranged rates with contracted motor carriers, there is typically a calculated fuel surcharge based on a mutually agreed-upon formula.\nWhile providing day-to-day transportation services, our employees often identify opportunities for additional logistics services as they become more familiar with our customers’ daily operations and the nuances of our customers’ supply chains. We offer a wide range of logistics services on a global basis that reduce or eliminate supply chain inefficiencies. We analyze customers’ transportation rate structures, modes of shipping, and carrier selection. We identify opportunities to consolidate shipments for cost savings. We suggest ways to improve operating and shipping procedures and manage claims. We help customers minimize storage through transloading, crossdocking, drop trailer and other flow-through operations. Many of these services are provided in connection with providing the freight transportation, based on the nature of the customer relationship. Our breadth of value-added services also includes supply chain consulting and design, emissions analytics, customs brokerage and compliance, project logistics, warehousing, and cargo insurance—for which we are usually paid separately. \nWe have broadened our relationship with many of our customers by emphasizing integrated logistics solutions, resulting in our management of a greater portion of their supply chains. We often serve our customers through specially created teams and through multiple locations. Our transportation and logistics services are provided to numerous international customers through our worldwide network. \nTransportation services accounted for approximately 95 percent of adjusted gross profits in 2024 and 2023 and 97 percent of adjusted gross profits in 2022. Adjusted gross profits is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated as total revenues less the total of purchased transportation and related services and the cost of purchased products sourced for resale. For additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, \nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n. \nThe table below shows our adjusted gross profits by transportation mode, for the years ended December 31 (in thousands):\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2021\n2020\nTruckload\n$\n1,072,691 \n$\n1,039,079 \n$\n1,561,310 \n$\n1,280,629 \n$\n1,071,873 \nLTL\n572,169 \n550,373 \n632,116 \n523,365 \n457,290 \nOcean\n519,970 \n420,883 \n729,839 \n711,223 \n350,094 \nAir\n135,901 \n123,470 \n198,166 \n225,286 \n151,443 \nCustoms\n107,480 \n97,096 \n107,691 \n100,539 \n87,095 \nOther Logistics Services\n225,599 \n255,735 \n251,547 \n210,958 \n195,159 \nTotal\n$\n2,633,810 \n$\n2,486,636 \n$\n3,480,669 \n$\n3,052,000 \n$\n2,312,954 \n5\nTable of Contents\nSourcing\nSince we were founded in 1905, we have been in the business of sourcing fresh produce. Much of our logistics expertise can be traced to our significant experience in handling produce and other perishable commodities. Because of its perishable nature, produce must be rapidly packaged, carefully transported within tight timetables, usually in temperature controlled equipment, and quickly distributed to replenish high-turnover inventories maintained by our customers. In many instances, we consolidate an individual customer’s produce orders into truckload quantities at the point of origin and arrange for transportation of the truckloads, often to multiple destinations. Our sourcing customer base includes grocery retailers, restaurants, foodservice distributors, and produce wholesalers.\nOur sourcing services include inventory forecasting and replenishment, brand management, and category development services. We have various national and regional branded produce programs, including both proprietary brands and nationally licensed brands. These programs contain a wide variety of high quality, fresh bulk, and value-added fruits and vegetables. These brands have expanded our market presence and relationships with many of our retail customers. We have also instituted quality assurance and monitoring programs as part of our branded and preferred grower programs. Sourcing accounted for approximately five percent of our adjusted gross profits in 2024 and 2023 and three percent of our adjusted gross profits in 2022.\n \nCustomer Relationships\nWe work to establish long-term relationships with our customers and to increase the amount of business done with each customer by providing them with a full range of logistics services and people on whom they can rely. During 2024, we served 83,000 customers worldwide, ranging from Fortune 100 companies to small businesses in a wide variety of industries. During 2024, our largest customer accounted for approximately two percent of our consolidated total revenues. \nWe seek additional business from existing customers and pursue new customers based on our knowledge of the marketplace, our unique information advantage, and the range of logistics services we can provide. We believe our account management disciplines, expertise, tailored solutions, and technology enable our employees to better serve our customers by combining a broad knowledge of logistics and market conditions with a deep, data-driven, understanding of the specific supply chain issues facing individual customers and specific industries. \nMarkets and Resources\nCompetition\n \nThe transportation services industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete against traditional and non-traditional logistics companies, including transportation providers that own equipment, third-party freight brokers, technology matching services, internet freight brokers, carriers offering logistics services, on-demand transportation service providers, NVOCCs, IACs, and freight forwarders. We also buy from and sell transportation services to companies that compete with us.\nIn our sourcing business, we compete with produce brokers, produce growers, produce marketing companies, produce wholesalers, and foodservice buying groups. We also buy from and sell produce to companies that compete with us.\n6\nTable of Contents\nWe often compete with respect to price, scope of services, or a combination thereof, but believe that our most significant competitive advantages are:\n•\nPeople and relationships: Our knowledgeable, dedicated, and empowered people act as an extension of our customers’ teams to innovate and execute their supply chain strategies. Our large number of unique, strong relationships provide global connections and valuable market knowledge;\n•\nGlobal suite of services: A wide and integrated selection of services and products provide our customers with consistent capacity and service levels; \n•\nScale: Our customers leverage our significant capacity, broad procurement options, global data insights, and substantial shipment volumes for better efficiency, service, and marketplace advantages; \n•\nData, products, and technology: The combination of our expertise, scale and tailored solutions gives our technology an edge.

Generative AI is especially powerful in our hands, helping us unlock the value in our vast amount of unstructured data and create new proprietary technology that leads the industry forward. We use our data and data analysts to drive smarter solutions and products for our customers. Our proprietary Navisphere platform provides agility, flexibility, global visibility, easy integration, broad connectivity, and advanced security;\n•\nNetwork: Our combination of global capability, regional and local expertise, and scale gives our customers a strategic advantage in supply chain execution; \n•\nProcess: Proven processes and tailored solutions combine strategy with practical experience for customized action plans that succeed in the real world; and\n•\nStability: Our customers and our contract carriers rely on us to support critical elements of their business. Our financial strength, discipline, and consistent track record of success are a key foundation of our ability to sustainably meet their needs.\nProprietary Information Technology and Intellectual Property \nOur technology brings the value of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, and analytics to our customers in order to help solve their most complex logistics challenges and drive the industry forward. With a\npproximately 900 data scientists, engineers, and developers, we continue to make smart, talent-focused investments globally in this critical area and continue to build the next generation of tools and processes that change how supply chains function.\nOur operations primarily use Navisphere, our global, multimodal transportation management system. It is essential for serving our customers and contract carriers and for managing our business. Most of our global network operates on Navisphere, using it to match customer needs with supplier capabilities, to collaborate, and to access centralized support resources to complete all facets of a transaction. In 2024, we managed approximately 37 million shipments for 83,000 customers utilizing the more than 450,000 contract carriers on our platform. \nNavisphere and our other technology help our employees service customer orders, select the optimal mode of transportation, build and consolidate shipments, identify appropriate carriers, and manage exceptions, all based on customer-specific service parameters. Our data estate and scale provide our organization with the business intelligence to support decision-making in all areas of our business.\nNavisphere gives customers one place to purchase, manage, and track their freight transportation around the world. It allows them to communicate worldwide with parties in their supply chain across languages, currencies, and continents. Navisphere also offers sophisticated business analytics, artificial intelligence, and data-driven tools to improve supply chain performance and meet increasing customer demands, including the following:\n•\nOur advanced visibility tools allow our customers to see their freight across all modes and services globally in a single view. Details of shipment contents, shipment status, disruptions to shipments, and resulting adjustments to estimated time of arrival using artifi\ncial intelligence are provided for the customer to manage their supply chain exceptions. Collaboration, intelligent notifications, and performance scorecards allow customers to manage their supply chain and identify inefficiencies.\n•\nNavisphere Insight™ uses data science to turn customers’ raw freight data into valuable insights, surfacing trends in transportation performance and spend that can be used for decision-making in real time or over time. Analysis is provided down to the shipment and order level.\n7\nTable of Contents\n•\nNavisphere Optimizer™ helps customers minimize the travel time, distance, and total miles of their freight, while maximizing their trailer utilization and savings. It is used during the transportation planning process and dynamically selects the right route with the right mode and right carrier on the right day.\nNavisphere is also integrated into 38 third-party transportation management systems and/or enterprise resource planning systems, allowing our dynamic pricing engine to directly deliver real-time quotes to customers when they have freight to be picked up or delivered. This eliminates the need for our customers to shop around and provides them an automated solution.\nEnhancements to our dynamic costing and pricing models allow us to react to market signals more quickly and accurately. Through a combination of more inputs, an upgraded algorithm, and greater configurability, these proprietary data science models serve to optimize our purchasing of shipping capacity and the price we offer our customers.\nWe continue to drive digital transformation in our industry. Using generative AI and large language models, we have created proprietary technology that automates steps across the lifecycle of a shipment: from giving customers a price quote, to accepting a load, to setting appointments for pickup and delivery, to checking on the load in transit. Transactions are performed in seconds, giving customers greater efficiency, speed-to-market, and cost savings while improving employee productivity, as measured by shipments per person per day.\nSome of the other industry-first tools we’ve launched include:\n•\nProcure IQ\n®\n, which uses algorithms built by our data scientists and the largest freight shipment dataset in the industry to show shippers the optimal way to purchase transportation in each of their shipping lanes;\n•\nEmissions IQ\n®\n, which gives shippers instant visibility into their carbon emissions and surfaces opportunities for reduction; and\n•\nMarket Rate IQ™, which reveals the patterns in a shipper’s spot freight that they could change to increase savings. \nNavisphere Carrier™ (\n“\nNavisphere Carrier”) provides contracted motor carriers access to the functionality necessary to efficiently manage their relationships with C.H. Robinson. Contracted motor carriers can search and book available freight, provide online status updates, keep track of receivables, and upload scanned documentation. Many of our contracted motor carriers’ favorite features of Navisphere Carrier are also available through our Navisphere Carrier mobile application for Android\n®\n and iOS\n®\n mobile operating systems. \nFreightquote\n®\n by C.H. Robinson (“Freightquote”) is a web-based, mobile-responsive offering designed to streamline the shipping process for small business customers, allowing the booking of freight without any shipping knowledge or expertise. Freightquote’s small business customers can go online with their smart phone, tablet, or computer to book their LTL or truckload freight, track shipments, get proactive notifications, and pay for transportation services with a credit card.\nWe rely on a combination of cybersecurity, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and nondisclosure and non-competition agreements to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology. Additionally, we have numerous registered trademarks, trade names, and logos in the United States and internationally.
