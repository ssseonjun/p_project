LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are not party to, and our property is not the subject of, any material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our businesses), including environmental proceedings described in Item 103(c)(3) of SEC Regulation S-K, except for the matters described in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements or referred to in “Part I –",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.” We aim to finance our capital expenditures for PP&E and investments in a manner that will maintain our investment-grade credit ratings and capital structure, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so.\nRate Base\nFor SDG&E and SoCalGas, rate base is the value of assets on which SDG&E and SoCalGas are permitted to earn a specified rate of return in accordance with rules set by regulatory agencies, including the CPUC and the FERC (for SDG&E), which is calculated using a 13-month average in accordance with CPUC methodology as adopted in rate-setting proceedings. The following table summarizes the weighted-average rate base for SDG&E and SoCalGas for the last three years. \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  98\nTable of Contents\nWEIGHTED-AVERAGE RATE BASE\n(Dollars in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSDG&E\n$\n16,842 \n$\n15,220 \n$\n13,780 \nSoCalGas\n12,446 \n11,671 \n10,494 \nThe increase in weighted-average rate base reflects the significant capital investments that SDG&E and SoCalGas have made in transmission and distribution safety and reliability. We expect the weighted-average rate base to continue to increase in 2025 based on our expected capital investments. \nFor Oncor, rate base represents the total invested capital, as adjusted in accordance with PUCT rules, at the end of the previous calendar year as reported in the Earnings Monitoring Report filed with the PUCT on an annual basis. Oncor’s regulatory rate base as reported in these filings as of December 31, 2023 and 2022 was $23.1 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively. As calculated on a similar basis, its estimated regulatory rate base at December 31, 2024 was $26.6 billion. The increase in rate base reflects the significant capital investments that Oncor has made in its transmission and distribution system, and we expect rate base to continue to increase in 2025 based on Oncor’s expected capital investments.\nCapital Stock Transactions\nSempra \nCash provided by issuances of common stock was:\n▪\n$1,219 million in 2024 \n▪\n$145 million in 2023 \n▪\n$4 million in 2022 \nCash used for repurchases of common stock was:\n▪\n$43 million in 2024 \n▪\n$32 million in 2023 \n▪\n$478 million in 2022 \nWe discuss the issuances and repurchases of common stock in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nSempra \nSempra paid cash dividends of:\n▪\n$1,499 million for common stock and $44 million for preferred stock in 2024 \n▪\n$1,483 million for common stock and $44 million for preferred stock in 2023 \n▪\n$1,430 million for common stock and $44 million for preferred stock in 2022 \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  99\nTable of Contents\nDIVIDENDS PER SHARE ON SEMPRA COMMON STOCK\n(As approved by our board of directors)\nOn February 24, 2025, our board of directors declared a dividend of $0.645 per share on our common stock and a dividend of $24.375 per share on our series C preferred stock, both payable on April 15, 2025. \nAll declarations of dividends on our common stock and preferred stock are made at the discretion of the board of directors. While we view dividends as an integral component of shareholder return, the amount of future dividends will depend on earnings, cash flows, financial and legal requirements, and other relevant factors at that time. As a result, Sempra’s dividends on common stock and preferred stock declared on a historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations. \nSDG&E\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, SDG&E paid common stock dividends to Enova Corporation and Enova Corporation paid corresponding dividends to Sempra of $225 million, $100 million and $100 million, respectively. SDG&E’s dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations. Rather, SDG&E’s common stock dividends in the next few years may be impacted as available cash is used to maintain its authorized capital structure while supporting its capital investment program.\nEnova Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra, owns all of SDG&E’s outstanding common stock. Accordingly, dividends paid by SDG&E to Enova Corporation and dividends paid by Enova Corporation to Sempra are eliminated in Sempra’s consolidated financial statements.\nSoCalGas\nIn 2024 and 2023, SoCalGas paid common stock dividends to Pacific Enterprises and Pacific Enterprises paid corresponding dividends to Sempra of $200 million and $100 million, respectively. SoCalGas did not declare or pay common stock dividends in 2022. SoCalGas’ dividends on common stock declared on an annual historical basis may not be indicative of future declarations. Rather, SoCalGas’ common stock dividends in the next few years may be impacted as available cash is used to maintain its authorized capital structure while supporting its capital investment program.\nPacific Enterprises, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra, owns all of SoCalGas’ outstanding common stock. Accordingly, dividends paid by SoCalGas to Pacific Enterprises and dividends paid by Pacific Enterprises to Sempra are eliminated in Sempra’s consolidated financial statements.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  100\nTable of Contents\nDividend Restrictions\nThe board of directors for each of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas has the discretion to determine whether to declare and, if declared, the amount of any dividends by each such entity. The CPUC’s regulation of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ capital structures limits the amounts that are available for loans and dividends to Sempra. At December 31, 2024, based on these regulations, Sempra could have received combined loans and dividends of approximately $672 million from SDG&E and $457 million from SoCalGas. In addition, the terms of Sempra’s series C preferred stock limit Sempra’s ability to declare dividends on its common stock under certain circumstances.\nWe provide additional information about dividend restrictions in “Restricted Net Assets” in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and in Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCapitalization\nOur total capitalization, which is the sum of total debt and equity, and our debt-to-capitalization ratio, which is calculated as total debt as a percentage of total capitalization, was as follows:\nTOTAL CAPITALIZATION AND DEBT-TO-CAPITALIZATION RATIO\n(Dollars in millions)\nTotal capitalization\nDebt-to-capitalization ratio\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nSempra\n$\n73,636 \n$\n64,730 \n49 \n%\n48 \n%\nSDG&E\n21,041 \n19,796 \n50 \n50 \nSoCalGas\n16,602 \n15,167 \n51 \n51 \nIn 2024 compared to 2023, Sempra’s total capitalization increased by $8.9 billion (14%) due to:\n▪\nincrease in long-term debt\n▪\nincrease in equity primarily from comprehensive income exceeding dividends, issuances of common stock and contributions from NCI\nOffset by:\n▪\ndecrease in short-term debt\n▪\ndistributions to NCI\nIn 2024 compared to 2023, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ total capitalization increased by $1.2 billion (6%) and $1.4 billion (9%), respectively, due to increases in equity from comprehensive income exceeding dividends and increases in debt.\n \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nManagement views the accounting estimates that we describe below as critical because their application is the most relevant, judgmental and/or material to our financial position and results of operations, and/or because they require the use of material judgments and estimates. We discuss critical accounting estimates that are material to our financial statements with the Audit Committee of Sempra’s board of directors.\nREGULATORY ACCOUNTING\nSempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas\nAs regulated entities, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ customer rates, as set and monitored by regulators, are designed to recover the cost of providing service and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investments. SDG&E and SoCalGas assess probabilities of future rate recovery associated with regulatory account balances at the end of each reporting period and whenever new and/or unusual events occur, such as:\n▪\nchanges in the regulatory and political environment or the utility’s competitive position\n▪\nissuance of a regulatory commission order\n▪\npassage of new legislation\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  101\nTable of Contents\nTo the extent that circumstances associated with regulatory balances change, the regulatory balances are evaluated and adjusted if appropriate.\nSignificant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets and revenues subject to refund, as well as the existence and amount of regulatory liabilities. Adverse regulatory or legislative actions could materially impact the amounts of our regulatory assets and liabilities and could materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. Specifically, if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, all or part of the associated regulatory assets would need to be written off against current period earnings, or adverse regulatory or legislative actions could give rise to material new or higher regulatory liabilities. We discuss details of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ regulatory assets and liabilities and additional factors that management considers when assessing probabilities associated with regulatory balances in Notes 1, 4, 14 and 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nINCOME TAXES\nSempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas\nOur income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management judgments and estimates. Amounts of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as current and noncurrent accruals, involve judgments and estimates of the timing and probability of recognition of income and deductions by taxing authorities. When we evaluate the anticipated resolution of income tax issues, we consider:\n▪ past resolutions of the same issue or similar issues\n▪ the status of any income tax examination in progress\n▪ positions taken by taxing authorities with other taxpayers with similar issues\nThe likelihood of deferred income tax recovery is based on analyses of the deferred income tax assets and our expectation of future taxable income, based on our strategic planning. Should a change in facts or circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the ultimate realizability of a deferred tax asset, we would record or adjust the related valuation allowance in the period that the change in facts and circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes.\nActual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts because of:\n▪ future impacts of various items, including changes in tax laws, regulations, interpretations and rulings\n▪ our financial condition in future periods\n▪ the resolution of various income tax issues between us and taxing and regulatory authorities\nUnrecognized income tax benefits involve management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of the benefit being sustained. The final resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in adjustments to recorded amounts and may affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe discuss these matters and additional information related to accounting for income taxes, including uncertainty in income taxes, in Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nPENSION AND PBOP PLANS\nSempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas\nTo measure our pension and PBOP obligations, costs and liabilities, we rely on several assumptions. We consider current market conditions, including interest rates, in making these assumptions. We review these assumptions annually and update when appropriate. \nThe critical assumptions used to develop the required estimates include the following key factors: \n▪\ndiscount rates\n▪\nexpected return on plan assets\n▪\nhealth care cost trend rates\n▪\ninterest crediting rate on cash balance accounts\n▪\nmortality rate\n▪\nrate of compensation increases\n▪\ntermination and retirement rates\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  102\nTable of Contents\n▪\nutilization of postretirement welfare benefits\n▪\npayout elections (lump sum or annuity)\n▪\nlump sum interest rates\nThe actuarial assumptions we use may differ materially from actual results due to: \n▪\nreturn on plan assets\n▪\nchanging market and economic conditions\n▪\nhigher or lower withdrawal rates\n▪\nlonger or shorter participant life spans\n▪\nmore or fewer lump sum versus annuity payout elections made by plan participants\n▪\nhigher or lower retirement rates\nChanges in the estimated costs or timing of pension and PBOP, or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates (primarily the discount rate and expected return on plan assets), as well as changes in the circumstances associated with rate recovery, could have a material effect on the recorded expenses and liabilities. The following tables summarize the impact to our projected benefit obligation for pension and accumulated benefit obligation for PBOP at December 31, 2024, and 2024 net periodic benefit costs, in each case if the discount rate or expected return on plan assets were changed by 1%.\nIMPACT DUE TO INCREASE/DECREASE IN DISCOUNT RATE\n(Dollars in millions)\nSempra\nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\nIncrease \nDecrease\nIncrease\nDecrease\nIncrease\nDecrease\nPension:\n(Decrease) increase to projected benefit obligation,\nnet\n$\n(292)\n$\n(379)\n$\n(38)\n$\n59 \n$\n(241)\n$\n304 \n(Decrease) increase to net periodic benefit cost\n(1)\n16 \n2 \n(1)\n(4)\n17 \nPBOP:\n(Decrease) increase to accumulated benefit\nobligation, net\n(67)\n94 \n(9)\n22 \n(56)\n69 \n(Decrease) increase to net periodic benefit cost\n(6)\n7 \n(1)\n1 \n(4)\n5 \nIMPACT DUE TO INCREASE/DECREASE IN RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS \n(Dollars in millions)\nSempra\nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\nIncrease\nDecrease\nIncrease\nDecrease\nIncrease\nDecrease\nPension:\n(Decrease) increase to net periodic benefit cost\n$\n(39)\n$\n39 \n$\n(9)\n$\n9 \n$\n(28)\n$\n28 \nPBOP:\n(Decrease) increase to net periodic benefit cost\n(12)\n12 \n(1)\n1 \n(10)\n10 \nFor SDG&E and SoCalGas plans, the effects of the assumptions on earnings are expected to be recovered in rates and therefore are offset in regulatory accounts. We provide details of our pension and PBOP plans in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSONGS ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nSempra, SDG&E \nSDG&E’s legal AROs related to the decommissioning of SONGS are estimated based on a site-specific study performed no less than every three years. The estimate of the obligations includes: \n▪ estimated decommissioning costs, including labor, equipment, material and other disposal costs \n▪ inflation adjustment applied to estimated cash flows \n▪ discount rate based on a credit-adjusted risk-free rate \n▪ actual decommissioning costs, progress to date and expected duration of decommissioning activities \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  103\nTable of Contents\nSDG&E’s nuclear decommissioning expenses are subject to rate recovery and, therefore, rate-making accounting treatment is applied to SDG&E’s nuclear decommissioning activities. SDG&E recognizes a regulatory asset, or liability, to the extent that its SONGS ARO exceeds, or is less than, the amount collected from customers and the amount earned in SDG&E’s NDT.\nSDG&E’s ARO related to the decommissioning of SONGS was $471 million as of December 31, 2024, based on the decommissioning cost study prepared in 2024. Changes in the estimated costs, execution strategy or timing of decommissioning, or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates, could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission this facility, which could have a material effect on the recorded liability.\nThe following table illustrates the increase to SDG&E’s and Sempra’s ARO liability if the cost escalation rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant:\nINCREASE TO ARO AND REGULATORY ASSET\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nUniform increase in escalation percentage of 1%\n$\n62\nThe increase in the ARO liability driven by an increase in the cost escalation rate would result in a decrease in the regulatory liability for recoveries in excess of ARO liabilities. We provide additional detail in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIMPAIRMENT TESTING OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS\nSempra \nWhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset’s carrying amount may not be recoverable, we consider if the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. If so, we estimate the fair value of the asset to determine the extent to which carrying value exceeds fair value. For such an estimate, we may consider data from multiple valuation methods, including data from market participants. We exercise judgment to estimate the future cash flows and the useful life of a long-lived asset and to determine our intent to use the asset. Our intent to use or dispose of a long-lived asset is subject to re-evaluation and can change over time. If such an impairment test is required, the fair value of a long-lived asset can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions. Critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include:\n▪\nconsideration of market transactions\n▪\nfuture cash flows\n▪\nthe appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, including the impacts of country risk and entity risk\nWe discuss impairment of long-lived assets in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL\nSempra \nWhen determining if goodwill is impaired, the fair value of the reporting unit can vary if differing estimates and assumptions are used in the valuation techniques applied as indicated by changing market or other conditions. As a result, recognizing a goodwill impairment may or may not be required. When we perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, we exercise judgment to develop estimates of the fair value of the reporting unit and compare that to its carrying value. Our fair value estimates are developed from the perspective of a knowledgeable market participant. We consider observable transactions in the marketplace for similar investments, if available, as well as an income-based approach such as a discounted cash flow analysis. A discounted cash flow analysis may be based directly on anticipated future revenues and expenses and may be performed based on free cash flows generated within the reporting unit. Critical assumptions that affect our estimates of fair value may include:\n▪\nconsideration of market transactions\n▪\nfuture cash flows\n▪\nprojected revenue and expense growth rates\n▪\nthe appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate, including the impacts of country risk, customer creditworthiness and entity risk\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  104\nTable of Contents\nHistorically, we determined based on a quantitative goodwill impairment test that the estimated fair values of our reporting units in Mexico, to which goodwill was allocated, were substantially above their respective carrying values as of October 1, our annual goodwill impairment testing date. Upon performing a qualitative analysis as of October 1, 2024, we determined that it was not more likely than not that the fair value of such reporting units was less than their respective carrying values. Our goodwill impairment test is determined based on assumptions existing as of that point in time. Changes in the business (such as loss of future cash flows from customer disputes, renegotiation of customer contracts or the macroeconomic environment, including rising interest rates) may result in us having to perform an interim goodwill impairment test, which could result in an impairment of our goodwill.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nWe discuss the recent accounting pronouncements that have had or may have a significant effect on our financial statements and/or disclosures in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the risk of erosion of our cash flows, earnings, asset values or equity due to adverse changes in commodity market prices, interest rates and foreign currency and inflation rates.\nMARKET RISK POLICIES\nSempra has policies governing its market risk management and trading activities. Sempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra Infrastructure maintain separate risk management committees, organizations and processes to provide oversight of these activities for their respective businesses. The committees consist of senior officers who establish policy, oversee energy risk management activities, and monitor the results of trading and other activities to help ensure compliance with our energy risk management and trading policies. These activities include, but are not limited to, monitoring of market positions that create credit, liquidity and market risk. The respective oversight organizations and committees are independent from energy procurement departments.\nAlong with other tools, we use VaR and liquidity metrics to measure our exposure to market risk associated with commodity portfolios. VaR is an estimate of the potential loss on a position or portfolio of positions over a specified holding period, based on normal market conditions and within a given statistical confidence interval. We use a variance-covariance VaR model at a 95% confidence level. A liquidity metric is intended to monitor the amount of financial resources needed for meeting potential margin calls as forward market prices move. VaR and liquidity risk metrics are independently verified by the respective risk management oversight organizations.\nSDG&E and SoCalGas use natural gas derivatives and SDG&E uses electricity derivatives to manage natural gas and electric price risk associated with servicing load requirements. The use of natural gas and electricity derivatives is subject to certain limitations imposed by company policy and regulatory requirements. SDG&E’s risk management and transacting activity plans for electricity derivatives are also required to be filed with, and have been approved by, the CPUC. SoCalGas is also subject to certain regulatory requirements and thresholds related to natural gas procurement under the GCIM. We discuss revenue recognition in Note 3 and additional market-risk information regarding derivative instruments in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe have exposure to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency and inflation rates. The following discussion of these primary market-risk exposures as of December 31, 2024 includes a discussion of how these exposures are managed.\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK\nMarket risk related to physical commodities is created by volatility in the prices and basis of certain commodities. Our various subsidiaries are exposed, in varying degrees, to commodity price risk, primarily in the natural gas and electricity markets. Our policy is to manage this risk within a framework that considers the specific markets and operating and regulatory environments of each subsidiary.\nSempra Infrastructure is exposed to commodity price risk indirectly through its LNG, natural gas pipelines and storage, and power-generating assets. Sempra Infrastructure has utilized and may continue to utilize commodity contracts, including physical \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  105\nTable of Contents\nand financial derivatives, in an effort to mitigate these risks and optimize the value of these assets. These transactions are typically priced based on market indices but may also include fixed price purchases and sales of commodities. Any residual exposure is monitored as described above. Some of these derivatives that we use as economic hedges do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, or hedge accounting is not elected, and as a result, the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recorded in earnings. Consequently, significant changes in commodity prices have in the past and could in the future result in earnings volatility as the economic offset of these derivatives may not be recorded at fair value. A significant decrease in the fair value of these economic hedges could also result in higher collateral requirements, which could negatively impact our liquidity and our ability to continue to mitigate our commodity risk exposure. We try to structure our hedging transactions with the objective that over time (i) realized gains and losses on our economic hedges would be largely offset by gains and losses related to our purchases or sales of natural gas and (ii) we would realize the economic benefit we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction.\nA hypothetical 10% change in commodity prices would have resulted in a change in the fair value of our commodity-based natural gas and electricity derivatives of $13 million and $14 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The impact of a change in energy commodity prices on our commodity-based derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled and does not typically include the generally offsetting impact of our underlying asset positions.\nSDG&E and SoCalGas separately manage risk within the parameters of their market risk management frameworks. In addition, their market-risk exposure is limited due to CPUC-authorized rate recovery of the costs of commodity purchases, interstate and intrastate transportation, and storage activity. However, SoCalGas may, at times, be exposed to market risk as a result of the GCIM, which rewards or penalizes the utility for commodity costs below or above certain benchmarks. The one-day VaR for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ commodity positions were both $2 million at December 31, 2024 and $2 million and $4 million, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates primarily from our short- and long-term debt. Subject to regulatory constraints, we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to moderate our exposure to interest rate changes and to lower our overall cost of borrowing.\nThe table below shows the nominal amount of our debt:\nNOMINAL AMOUNT OF DEBT\n(1)\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nSempra \nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\nSempra \nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\nShort-term:\nSempra California\n$\n1,454 \n$\n417 \n$\n1,037 \n$\n947 \n$\n— \n$\n947 \nOther \n562 \n— \n— \n1,397 \n— \n— \nLong-term:\nSempra California fixed-rate\n$\n16,309 \n$\n8,950 \n$\n7,359 \n$\n15,109 \n$\n8,350 \n$\n6,759 \nSempra California variable-rate\n— \n— \n— \n400 \n400 \n— \nOther fixed-rate\n15,527 \n— \n— \n11,317 \n— \n— \nOther variable-rate\n1,063 \n— \n— \n890 \n— \n— \n(1)\n    After the effects of interest rate swaps. Before reductions for unamortized discount and debt issuance costs and excluding finance lease obligations.\nAn interest rate risk sensitivity analysis measures interest rate risk by calculating the estimated changes in earnings attributable to common shares (but disregarding capitalized interest and impacts on equity earnings from debt at our equity method investees) that would result from a hypothetical change in market interest rates. Earnings attributable to common shares are affected by changes in interest rates on short-term debt and variable-rate long-term debt. If weighted-average interest rates on short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 increased or decreased by 10%, the change in earnings attributable to common shares over the 12-month period ending December 31, 2025 would be approximately $7 million. If interest rates increased or decreased by 10% on all variable-rate long-term debt at December 31, 2024, after considering the effects of interest rate swaps, the change in earnings attributable to common shares over the 12-month period ending December 31, 2025 would be approximately $3 million.\nWe provide further information about debt and interest rate swap transactions in Notes 6 and 9, respectively, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  106\nTable of Contents\nWe also are subject to the effect of interest rate fluctuations on the assets of our pension plans, PBOP plans, and SDG&E’s NDT. However, we expect the effects of these fluctuations, as they relate to Sempra California, to be reflected in future rates\n.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK AND INFLATION EXPOSURE\nWe discuss our foreign currency exchange rate risk and inflation exposure in “Part II – Item 7. MD&A – Impact of Foreign Currency and Inflation Rates on Results of Operations.”\nThe hypothetical effect for every 10% appreciation in the U.S. dollar against the Mexican peso, in which we have operations and investments, are as follows:\nHYPOTHETICAL EFFECTS FROM 10% STRENGTHENING OF U.S. DOLLAR \n(1)\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nHypothetical effects\nSempra:\nTranslation of 2024 earnings to U.S. dollars\n(2)\n$\n(2)\nTransactional exposure\n(3)\n151 \nTranslation of net assets of foreign subsidiaries and investment in foreign entities\n(4)\n(18)\n(1)\n    After the effects of foreign currency derivatives.\n(2)\n    \nAmount represents the impact to earnings for a change in the average exchange rate throughout the reporting period.\n(3)\n    Amount primarily represents the effects of currency exchange rate movement from December 31, 2024 on monetary assets and liabilities and remeasurement of non-U.S. deferred income tax balances at our Mexican subsidiaries.\n(4)\n    Amount represents the effects of currency exchange rate movement from December 31, 2024 that would be recorded to OCI at the end of the reporting period.\nMonetary assets and liabilities at our Mexican subsidiaries and JVs that are denominated in U.S. dollars may fluctuate significantly throughout the year. These monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for Mexican inflation for Mexican income tax purposes. Based on a net monetary liability position of $4.5 billion, including those related to our investments in JVs, at December 31, 2024, the hypothetical effect of a 10% increase in the Mexican inflation rate is approximately $89 million lower earnings attributable to common shares as a result of higher income tax expense for our consolidated entities, as well as lower equity earnings for our JVs.\nIn 2024 and 2023, SDG&E and SoCalGas experienced inflationary pressures from increases in various costs, including the cost of natural gas, electric fuel and purchased power, labor, materials and supplies, as well as availability of labor and materials. During this period, Sempra Texas Utilities experienced increased costs, including labor and contractor-related costs as well as higher insurance premiums, and does not have specific regulatory mechanisms that allow for recovery of higher non-reconcilable costs due to inflation; rather, recovery is limited to rate updates through capital trackers and base rate reviews, which may result in partial non-recovery due to the regulatory lag. If such costs continue to be subject to significant inflationary pressures and we are not able to fully recover such higher costs in rates or there is a delay in recovery, these increased costs may have a significant effect on Sempra’s, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nIn 2024 and 2023, Sempra Infrastructure experienced inflationary pressures from increases in various costs, including the cost of labor, materials and supplies. Sempra Infrastructure generally secures long-term contracts that are U.S. dollar-denominated or referenced and are periodically adjusted for market factors, including inflation, and Sempra Infrastructure generally enters into lump-sum contracts for its large construction projects in which much of the risk during construction is absorbed or hedged by the EPC contractor. If additional costs become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully recover such higher costs through contractual adjustments for inflation, which may have a significant effect on Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. \nITEM 8.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nSempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas\n \nSempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in their respective reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to the management of each company, including each respective principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating these controls and procedures, the management of each company recognizes that any system of controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives; therefore, the management of each company applies judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas, each such company’s management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on these evaluations, the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas concluded that their respective company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date.\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nSempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas\nThe respective management of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). \nUnder the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officers and principal financial officers of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas, each such company’s management evaluated the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \nInternal Control \n–\n Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on these evaluations, each company’s management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. Deloitte & Touche LLP audited the effectiveness of each company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, as stated in their reports, which are included in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nThere have been no changes in Sempra’s, SDG&E’s or SoCalGas’ internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, any such company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  108\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Sempra:\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Sempra and subsidiaries (“Sempra”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, Sempra maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of Sempra and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. \nBasis for Opinion \nSempra’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Sempra’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Sempra in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n \n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Diego, California\n \nFebruary 25, 2025\n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  109\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholder and Board of Directors of San Diego Gas & Electric Company:\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (“SDG&E”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS\nSECURITIES AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UNDER EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS\nSempra has LTIPs that permit the grant of a wide variety of equity and equity-based incentive awards to directors, officers and key employees. At December 31, 2024, outstanding awards consisted of stock options and RSUs held by 457 employees.\nThe following table sets forth information regarding our equity compensation plans at December 31, 2024.\nEQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS\n(1)\nEquity compensation plans approved by shareholders\nNumber of shares to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights\n(2)\nWeighted-average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights\n(3)\nNumber of additional shares remaining available for future issuance\n(4)\nSempra:\n2013 LTIP\n272,728 \n$\n53.38 \n— \n2019 LTIP\n4,206,750 \n$\n70.52 \n7,628,467 \n(1)\n    Excludes dividend equivalents.\n(2)    \nThe 2013 LTIP consists of 272,728 options to purchase shares of our common stock, all of which were granted at an exercise price equal to 100% of the grant date fair market value of the shares subject to the option. The 2019 LTIP consists of 1,757,938 options to purchase shares of our common stock, all of which were granted at an exercise price equal to 100% of the grant date fair market value of the shares subject to the option, 1,905,724 performance-based RSUs and 543,088 service-based RSUs. Each performance-based RSU granted under the 2019 LTIP represents the right to receive from 0% to 200% of the shares of our common stock represented by the RSUs, depending on the degree to which applicable performance conditions are satisfied. For purposes of this table, the number of shares of common stock shown to be subject to each performance-based RSU is 100% of the shares represented by the RSUs, which assumes performance conditions are satisfied at the target level.\n(3)\n    \nRepresents the weighted-average exercise price of the 272,728 and 1,757,938 outstanding options to purchase shares of our common stock under the 2013 LTIP and the 2019 LTIP, respectively.\n(4)\n    \nThe number of shares available for future issuance is increased by the number of shares to which each participant would otherwise be entitled that are withheld or surrendered to satisfy the exercise price or to satisfy tax withholding obligations relating to any plan awards, and is also increased by the number of shares subject to awards that expire or are forfeited, canceled or otherwise terminated without the issuance of shares. No new awards may be granted under the 2013 LTIP.\nWe provide additional discussion of share-based compensation in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT\nThe information required by Item 403 of SEC Regulation S-K, as required by this item, is incorporated by reference from “Share Ownership” in the proxy statement to be filed for the May 2025 annual meeting of shareholders for Sempra and from the information statement to be filed for the June 2025 annual meeting of shareholders for SoCalGas.

As a matter of good corporate governance, each of the Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas boards of directors reviewed the performance of Deloitte & Touche LLP and appointed them as the independent registered public accounting firm for each of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas, respectively. Sempra’s board of directors has determined that each member of its Audit Committee is an independent director and is financially literate, and that Mr. Jack T. Taylor, who chairs the committee, and Ms. Jennifer M. Kirk, who is a member of the committee, are audit committee financial experts as defined by the rules of the SEC.\nExcept where pre-approval is not required by SEC rules, Sempra’s Audit Committee pre-approves all audit, audit-related and permissible non-audit services provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP for Sempra and its subsidiaries, including all services provided by Deloitte & Touche LLP for Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas in 2024 and 2023. The committee’s pre-approval policies and procedures provide for the general pre-approval of specific types of services and give detailed guidance to management as to the services that are eligible for general pre-approval, and they require specific pre-approval of all other permitted services. For both types of pre-approval, the committee considers whether the services to be provided are consistent with maintaining the firm’s independence. The committee’s policies and procedures also delegate authority to the Chair of the \n2024 Form 10-K\n \n|  114\nTable of Contents\ncommittee to address any requests for pre-approval of services between committee meetings, with any pre-approval decisions to be reported to the committee at its next scheduled meeting.\nPART IV.\nITEM 15.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Sempra as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”).\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), Sempra’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 25, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on Sempra’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\n \nThese financial statements are the responsibility of Sempra’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on Sempra’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to Sempra in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Accounting – Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements \nCritical Audit Matter Description\nSempra is subject to rate regulation by regulators and commissions in various jurisdictions (collectively, the “Commissions”) that have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric and gas transmission and distribution companies in those jurisdictions. Management has determined it meets the requirements under U.S. GAAP to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory orders and future actions by the Commissions on the financial statements. Management’s judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) potential refunds to customers. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-2\nTable of Contents\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation and the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n▪\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n▪\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for Sempra and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates, or of a future reduction in rates, based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. \n▪\nWe evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n▪\nWe evaluated Sempra’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Diego, California\nFebruary 25, 2025\nWe have served as Sempra’s auditor since 1935.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-3\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholder and Board of Directors of San Diego Gas & Electric Company:\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n \nWe have audited the accompanying balance sheets of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (“SDG&E”) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), changes in shareholder’s equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on SoCalGas’ financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to SoCalGas in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Accounting – Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nSoCalGas is subject to rate regulation by regulators and commissions in various jurisdictions (collectively, the “Commissions”) that have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of gas transmission and distribution companies in those jurisdictions. Management has determined it meets the requirements under U.S. GAAP to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation. Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of regulatory orders and future actions by the Commissions on the financial statements. Management’s judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) potential refunds to customers. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-6\nTable of Contents\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the application of specialized rules to account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation and the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n▪\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n▪\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for SoCalGas and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates, or of a future reduction in rates, based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. \n▪\nWe evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n▪\nWe evaluated SoCalGas’ disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nSan Diego, California\nFebruary 25, 2025\nWe have served as SoCalGas’ auditor since 1937.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-7\nTable of

of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1. \nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA\nPRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION\nSempra\nSempra’s Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Sempra, a California-based holding company, and its consolidated entities, which invest in, develop and operate energy infrastructure in North America, and provide electric and gas services to customers. Sempra has \nthree\n operating and reportable segments, which we describe in Note 16. All references in these Notes to our reportable segments are not intended to refer to any legal entity with the same or similar name.\nSDG&E\nSDG&E’s common stock is wholly owned by Enova Corporation, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra. SDG&E is a regulated public utility that provides electric service to San Diego and southern Orange counties and natural gas service to San Diego County. SDG&E has \none\n operating and reportable segment.\nSoCalGas\nSoCalGas’ common stock is wholly owned by Pacific Enterprises, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Sempra. SoCalGas is a regulated public natural gas distribution utility, serving customers throughout most of Southern California and part of central California. SoCalGas has \none\n operating and reportable segment.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThis is a combined report of Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas. We provide separate information for SDG&E and SoCalGas as required. We have eliminated intercompany accounts and transactions within Sempra’s consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of the Financial Statements\nWe have prepared our financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. This requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, including the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Although we believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, actual amounts ultimately may differ significantly from those estimates.\nSubsequent Events\nWe evaluated events and transactions that occurred after December 31, 2024 through the date the financial statements were issued, and in the opinion of management, the accompanying financial statements reflect all adjustments and disclosures necessary for a fair presentation.\nREGULATED OPERATIONS\nSDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ accounting policies and financial statements reflect the application of U.S. GAAP provisions governing rate-regulated operations and the policies of the CPUC and the FERC. Under these provisions, a regulated utility records regulatory assets, which are generally costs that would otherwise be charged to expense, if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, the utility will recover those assets from customers. To the extent that recovery is no longer probable, the related regulatory assets are written off. Regulatory liabilities generally represent amounts collected from customers in advance of the actual expenditure by the utility. If the actual expenditures are less than amounts previously collected from customers, the excess would be refunded to customers, generally by reducing future rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities may also arise from other transactions such as unrealized losses and/or gains on fixed-price contracts and other derivatives or certain deferred income tax benefits that are passed through to customers in future rates. In addition, SDG&E and SoCalGas record regulatory liabilities when the CPUC or, in the case of SDG&E, the FERC, requires a refund to be made to customers or has required that a gain or other transaction of net allowable costs be given to customers over future periods.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-27\nTable of Contents\nDetermining probability of recovery of regulatory assets requires judgment by management and may include, but is not limited to, consideration of:\n▪\nthe nature of the event giving rise to the assessment\n▪\nexisting statutes and regulatory code\n▪\nlegal precedents\n▪\nregulatory principles and analogous regulatory actions\n▪\ntestimony presented in regulatory hearings\n▪\nregulatory orders\n▪\na commission-authorized mechanism established for the accumulation of costs\n▪\nstatus of applications for rehearings or state court appeals\n▪\nspecific approval from a commission\n▪\nhistorical experience\nOur Sempra Texas Utilities segment is comprised of our equity method investments in Oncor Holdings, which owns an \n80.25\n% interest in Oncor, and Sharyland Holdings, which owns \n100\n% of Sharyland Utilities. Oncor and Sharyland Utilities are regulated electric transmission and distribution utilities in Texas and their rates are regulated by the PUCT and, in the case of Oncor, certain cities and are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and earnings oversight. Oncor and Sharyland Utilities prepare their financial statements in accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP governing rate-regulated operations. \nSempra Infrastructure’s natural gas distribution utility, Ecogas, also applies U.S. GAAP provisions governing rate-regulated operations, including the same evaluation of probability of recovery of regulatory assets described above. Certain business activities at Sempra Infrastructure are regulated by the CRE and the FERC and meet the regulatory accounting requirements of U.S. GAAP.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nWe measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, primarily NDT and benefit plan trust assets and derivatives. We also measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis in certain circumstances.\nA fair value measurement reflects the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best available information. These assumptions include the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique (such as a pricing model) and the risks inherent in the inputs to the model. Also, we consider an issuer’s credit standing when measuring its liabilities at fair value.\nWe establish a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1 –\n Pricing inputs are unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis. Our Level 1 financial instruments primarily consist of listed equities, short-term investments, and U.S. government treasury securities, primarily in the NDT and benefit plan trusts, and exchange-traded derivatives.\nLevel 2\n – Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date. Level 2 includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies. These models are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including:\n▪\nquoted forward prices for commodities\n▪\ntime value\n▪\ncurrent market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments\n▪\nvolatility factors\n▪\nother relevant economic measures\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-28\nTable of Contents\nSubstantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument and can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. Our financial instruments in this category include listed equities, domestic corporate bonds, municipal bonds and other foreign bonds, primarily in the NDT and benefit plan trusts, and non-exchange-traded derivatives such as interest rate instruments and over-the-counter forwards and options.\nLevel 3\n – Pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources. These inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value from the perspective of a market participant. Our Level 3 financial instruments consist of CRRs and, until December 31, 2022, fixed-price electricity positions, at SDG&E and the Support Agreement at Sempra Infrastructure.\nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nWe consolidate a VIE if we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE. Our determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary is based on qualitative and quantitative analyses, which assess:\n▪\nthe purpose and design of the VIE; \n▪\nthe nature of the VIE’s risks and the risks we absorb; \n▪\nthe power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE; and \n▪\nthe obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE. \nWe will continue to evaluate our VIEs for any changes that may impact our determination of whether an entity is a VIE and if we are the primary beneficiary.\nSDG&E\nSDG&E’s power procurement is subject to reliability requirements that may require SDG&E to enter into various PPAs that include variable interests. SDG&E evaluates the respective entities to determine if variable interests exist and, based on the qualitative and quantitative analyses described above, if SDG&E, and indirectly Sempra, is the primary beneficiary.\nSDG&E has agreements under which it purchases power generated by facilities for which it supplies all of the natural gas to fuel the power plant (i.e., tolling agreements). SDG&E’s obligation to absorb natural gas costs may be a significant variable interest. In addition, SDG&E has the power to direct the dispatch of electricity generated by these facilities. Based on our analysis, the ability to direct the dispatch of electricity may have the most significant impact on the economic performance of the entity owning the generating facility because of the associated exposure to the cost of natural gas, which fuels the plants, and the value of electricity produced. To the extent that SDG&E (1) is obligated to purchase and provide fuel to operate the facility, (2) has the power to direct the dispatch, and (3) purchases all of the output from the facility for a substantial portion of the facility’s useful life, SDG&E may be the primary beneficiary of the entity owning the generating facility. SDG&E determines if it is the primary beneficiary in these cases based on a qualitative approach in which it considers the operational characteristics of the facility, including its expected power generation output relative to its capacity to generate and the financial structure of the entity, among other factors. If SDG&E determines that it is the primary beneficiary, SDG&E and Sempra consolidate the entity that owns the facility as a VIE. \nIn addition to tolling agreements, other variable interests involve various elements of fuel and power costs, and other components of cash flows expected to be paid to or received by our counterparties. In most of these cases, the expectation of variability is not substantial, and SDG&E generally does not have the power to direct activities, including the operation and maintenance activities of the generating facility, that most significantly impact the economic performance of the other VIEs. If our ongoing evaluation of these VIEs were to conclude that SDG&E becomes the primary beneficiary and consolidation by SDG&E becomes necessary, the effects could be significant to the financial position and liquidity of SDG&E and Sempra.\nSDG&E determined that none of its PPAs and tolling agreements resulted in SDG&E being the primary beneficiary of a VIE at December 31, 2024 and 2023. PPAs and tolling agreements that relate to SDG&E’s involvement with VIEs are primarily accounted for as finance leases. The carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities under these contracts are included in PP&E, net, and finance lease liabilities with balances of $\n1,138\n million and $\n1,166\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. SDG&E recovers costs incurred on PPAs, tolling agreements and other variable interests through CPUC-approved long-term power procurement plans. SDG&E has no residual interest in the respective entities and has not provided or guaranteed any debt or equity support, liquidity arrangements, performance guarantees or other commitments associated with these contracts other than the purchase commitments described in Note 15. As a result, SDG&E’s potential exposure to loss from its variable interest in these VIEs is not significant.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-29\nTable of Contents\nOther Sempra\nOncor Holdings \nOncor Holdings is a VIE. Sempra is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because of the structural and operational ring-fencing and governance measures in place that prevent us from having the power to direct the significant activities of Oncor Holdings. As a result, we do not consolidate Oncor Holdings and instead account for our ownership interest as an equity method investment. See Note 5 for additional information about our equity method investment in Oncor Holdings and restrictions on our ability to influence its activities. Our maximum exposure to loss, which fluctuates over time, from our interest in Oncor Holdings does not exceed the carrying value of our investment, which was $\n15,400\n million and $\n14,266\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nCameron LNG JV\nCameron LNG JV is a VIE principally due to contractual provisions that transfer certain risks to customers. Sempra is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of Cameron LNG JV, including LNG production and operation and maintenance activities at the liquefaction facility. Therefore, we account for our investment in Cameron LNG JV under the equity method. The carrying value of our investment was $\n1,149\n million and $\n1,008\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss, which fluctuates over time, includes the carrying value of our investment and our obligation under the SDSRA, which we discuss in Note 5. \nCFIN\nAs we discuss in Note 5, in July 2020, Sempra entered into a Support Agreement for the benefit of CFIN, which is a VIE. Sempra is not the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we do not have the power to direct the most significant activities of CFIN, including modification, prepayment, and refinance decisions related to the financing arrangement with external lenders and Cameron LNG JV’s \nfour\n project owners as well as the ability to determine and enforce remedies in the event of default. The conditional obligations of the Support Agreement represent a variable interest that we measure at fair value on a recurring basis (see Note 10). Sempra’s maximum exposure to loss under the terms of the Support Agreement is $\n979\n million. \nECA LNG Phase 1\nECA LNG Phase 1 is a VIE because its total equity at risk is not sufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We expect that ECA LNG Phase 1 will require future capital contributions or other financial support to finance the construction of the facility. Sempra is the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we have the power to direct the activities related to the construction and future operation and maintenance of the liquefaction facility. As a result, we consolidate ECA LNG Phase 1. Sempra consolidated $\n1,758\n million and $\n1,580\n million of assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisting primarily of PP&E, net, attributable to ECA LNG Phase 1 that could be used only to settle obligations of this VIE and that are not available to settle obligations of Sempra, and $\n1,080\n million and $\n1,029\n million of liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisting primarily of long-term debt attributable to ECA LNG Phase 1 for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Sempra. Additionally, as we discuss in Note 6, IEnova and TotalEnergies SE have provided guarantees for \n83.4\n% and \n16.6\n%, respectively, of the loan facility supporting construction of the liquefaction facility. \nPort Arthur LNG\nPort Arthur LNG is a VIE because its total equity at risk is not sufficient to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support. We expect that Port Arthur LNG will require future capital contributions or other financial support to finance the construction of the PA LNG Phase 1 project. Sempra is the primary beneficiary of this VIE because we have the power to direct the activities related to the construction and future operation and maintenance of the liquefaction facility. As a result, we consolidate Port Arthur LNG. Sempra consolidated $\n6,419\n million and $\n3,927\n million of assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisting primarily of PP&E, net, attributable to Port Arthur LNG that could be used only to settle obligations of this VIE and that are not available to settle obligations of Sempra, and $\n1,584\n million and $\n600\n million of liabilities at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, consisting primarily of long-term debt and accounts payable attributable to Port Arthur LNG for which creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of Sempra.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-30\nTable of Contents\nCASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH\nCash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.\nRestricted cash includes: \n▪\ncertain funds at Port Arthur LNG for which withdrawals and usage are dictated by its debt agreements\n▪\nfunds held as collateral in lieu of a customer’s letters of credit associated with its LNG storage and regasification agreement\n▪\nfunds denominated in U.S. dollars and Mexican pesos to pay for rights-of-way and other costs pursuant to trust agreements related to pipeline projects \n▪\nfunds held in a delisting trust for the purpose of purchasing the remaining publicly owned IEnova shares\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported on Sempra’s Consolidated Balance Sheets to the sum of such amounts reported on Sempra’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nRECONCILIATION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND RESTRICTED CASH\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nSempra:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,565\n \n$\n236\n \nRestricted cash, current\n21\n \n49\n \nRestricted cash, noncurrent\n3\n \n104\n \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n$\n1,589\n \n$\n389\n \nCREDIT LOSSES\nWe are exposed to credit losses from financial assets measured at amortized cost, including trade and other accounts receivable, amounts due from unconsolidated affiliates, our net investment in sales-type leases and a note receivable. We are also exposed to credit losses from off-balance sheet arrangements through Sempra’s guarantee related to Cameron LNG JV’s SDSRA, which we discuss in Note 5.\nWe regularly monitor and evaluate credit losses and record allowances for expected credit losses, if necessary, for trade and other accounts receivable using a combination of factors, including past-due status based on contractual terms, trends in write-offs, the age of the receivables and customer payment patterns, historical and industry trends, counterparty creditworthiness, economic conditions and specific events, such as bankruptcies, pandemics and other factors. We write off financial assets measured at amortized cost in the period in which we determine they are not recoverable. We record recoveries of amounts previously written off when it is known that they will be recovered.\nAfter considering the past-due status of receivables, payment history and other customer-specific information, in 2024 and 2023, Sempra recorded a provision for expected credit losses of $\n53\n million and $\n52\n million, respectively, on a customer’s past due account balance.\nThe implementation of customer assistance programs and higher 2023 winter season customer billings have resulted in certain SDG&E and SoCalGas customers exhibiting slower payment and higher levels of nonpayment than has been the case historically. \nSDG&E and SoCalGas have regulatory mechanisms to recover credit losses and thus record changes in the allowances for credit losses related to Accounts Receivable – Trade that are probable of recovery in regulatory accounts.

We have policies governing the management of credit risk that are administered by the respective credit departments at each of the Registrants and overseen by their separate risk management committees.\nThis oversight includes calculating current and potential credit risk on a regular basis and monitoring actual balances in comparison to approved limits. We establish credit limits based on risk and return considerations under terms customarily available in the industry. We avoid concentration of counterparties whenever possible, and we believe our credit policies significantly reduce overall credit risk. These policies include an evaluation of:\n▪\nprospective counterparties’ financial condition (including credit ratings)\n▪\ncollateral requirements\n▪\nthe use of standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty\n▪\ndowngrade triggers\nWe believe that we have provided adequate reserves for counterparty nonperformance in our allowances for credit losses.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-33\nTable of Contents\nTRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES\nWe summarize amounts due from and to unconsolidated affiliates at the Registrants in the following table.\nAMOUNTS DUE FROM (TO) UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nSempra:\n \n \nTax sharing agreement with Oncor Holdings\n$\n8\n \n$\n25\n \nVarious affiliates\n5\n \n6\n \nTotal due from unconsolidated affiliates – current\n$\n13\n \n$\n31\n \nTAG Pipelines – \n5.5\n% Note due January 9, 2024\n(1)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n5\n)\nTotal due to unconsolidated affiliates – current\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n5\n)\nTAG Pipelines\n(1)\n:\n5.5\n% Note due January 14, 2025\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n24\n)\n5.5\n% Note due July 16, 2025\n—\n \n(\n23\n)\n5.5\n% Note due January 14, 2026\n(\n8\n)\n(\n20\n)\n5.5\n% Note due July 14, 2026\n(\n12\n)\n(\n11\n)\n5.5\n% Note due January 19, 2027\n(\n15\n)\n(\n14\n)\n5.5\n% Note due July 21, 2027\n(\n19\n)\n(\n17\n)\n5.5\n% Note due January 19, 2028\n(\n48\n)\n—\n \n5.5\n% Note due July 18, 2028\n(\n41\n)\n—\n \nTAG Norte – \n5.74\n% Note due December 17, 2029\n(1)\n(\n209\n)\n(\n198\n)\nTotal due to unconsolidated affiliates – noncurrent\n$\n(\n352\n)\n$\n(\n307\n)\nSDG&E:\n \n \nSempra\n$\n(\n42\n)\n$\n(\n44\n)\nSoCalGas\n(\n14\n)\n(\n21\n)\nVarious affiliates\n(\n3\n)\n(\n8\n)\nTotal due to unconsolidated affiliates – current\n$\n(\n59\n)\n$\n(\n73\n)\nIncome taxes due from Sempra\n(2)\n$\n38\n \n$\n246\n \nSoCalGas:\n \n \nSDG&E\n$\n14\n \n$\n21\n \nVarious affiliates\n2\n \n1\n \nTotal due from unconsolidated affiliates – current\n$\n16\n \n$\n22\n \nSempra\n$\n(\n38\n)\n$\n(\n38\n)\nTotal due to unconsolidated affiliates – current\n$\n(\n38\n)\n$\n(\n38\n)\nIncome taxes due (to) from Sempra\n(2)\n$\n(\n6\n)\n$\n6\n \n(1)\n    U.S. dollar-denominated loans at fixed interest rates.

Such amounts are eliminated in consolidation at Sempra.\nSDG&E and SoCalGas charge one another, as well as other Sempra affiliates, for shared asset depreciation. SoCalGas and SDG&E record revenues and the affiliates record corresponding amounts to O&M. Such amounts are eliminated in consolidation at Sempra.\nSDG&E has a \n20\n-year contract that commenced in June 2015 for up to \n155\n MW of renewable power supplied from the ESJ wind power generation facility, a consolidated subsidiary of Sempra. A second \n20\n-year contract between SDG&E and ESJ for up to \n108\n MW of renewable power supplied from the same facility commenced in January 2022. Such amounts are eliminated in consolidation at Sempra.\nThe natural gas supply for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ core natural gas customers is purchased by SoCalGas as a combined procurement portfolio managed by SoCalGas. Core customers are primarily residential and small commercial and industrial customers. This core gas procurement function is considered a shared service; therefore, SoCalGas records revenues net of costs in cost of sales. Such amounts are eliminated in consolidation at Sempra.\nSoCalGas provides natural gas transportation and storage services to SDG&E and charges SDG&E for such services monthly. SoCalGas records revenues and SDG&E records a corresponding amount to cost of sales. Such amounts are eliminated in consolidation at Sempra.\nSoCalGas provides transportation services to Ecogas. SoCalGas records revenues and Ecogas records a corresponding amount to cost of sales. Such amounts are eliminated in consolidation at Sempra.\nSoCalGas and Sempra Infrastructure may buy and sell natural gas from and to each other in open market transactions to help satisfy supply needs. SoCalGas records revenues and costs in cost of sales. Sempra Infrastructure records revenues and costs in revenues. Such amounts are eliminated in consolidation at Sempra.\nSempra Infrastructure has agreements with Cameron LNG JV to provide certain business services and project development services related to the Cameron LNG Phase 2 project.\nSempra Infrastructure provides maintenance and administrative services to TAG Pipelines.

SDG&E and SoCalGas receive allocations of GHG allowances on behalf of their customers at no cost and purchase any additional allowances required. We record purchased and allocated GHG allowances at the lower of weighted-average cost or market. We measure the compliance obligation, which is based on emissions, at the carrying value of allowances held plus the fair value of additional allowances necessary to satisfy the obligation. SDG&E and SoCalGas balance costs and revenues associated with the GHG program through regulatory balancing accounts. Sempra Infrastructure records the cost of GHG obligations in cost of sales. We remove the assets and liabilities from the balance sheets as the allowances are surrendered.\nWILDFIRE FUND\nIn July 2019, the Wildfire Legislation was signed into law to address certain issues related to catastrophic wildfires in California and their impact on electric IOUs. Investor-owned gas distribution utilities such as SoCalGas are not covered by this legislation. The issues addressed include wildfire mitigation, cost recovery standards and requirements, a wildfire fund, a cap on liability, and the establishment of a wildfire safety board.\nThe Wildfire Legislation established a revised legal standard for the recovery of wildfire costs (Revised Prudent Manager Standard) and established a fund (the Wildfire Fund) designed to provide liquidity to SDG&E, PG&E and Edison to pay IOU wildfire-related claims in the event that the governmental agency responsible for determining causation determines the applicable IOU’s equipment caused the ignition of a wildfire, primary insurance coverage is exceeded and certain other conditions are satisfied. A primary purpose of the Wildfire Fund is to pool resources provided by shareholders and ratepayers of the IOUs and make those resources available to reimburse the IOUs for third-party wildfire claims incurred after July 12, 2019, the effective date of the Wildfire Legislation, subject to certain limitations.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-36\nTable of Contents\nAn IOU may seek payment from the Wildfire Fund for settled or adjudicated third-party damage claims arising from certain wildfires that exceed, in aggregate in a calendar year, the greater of $\n1.0\n billion or the IOU’s required amount of insurance coverage as recommended by the Wildfire Fund’s administrator. Wildfire claims approved by the Wildfire Fund’s administrator will be paid by the Wildfire Fund to the IOU to the extent funds are available. These utilized funds will be subject to review by the CPUC, which will make a determination as to the degree an IOU’s conduct related to an ignition of a wildfire was prudent or imprudent. The Revised Prudent Manager Standard requires that the CPUC apply clear standards when reviewing wildfire liability losses paid when determining the reasonableness of an IOU’s conduct related to an ignition. Under this standard, the conduct under review related to the ignition may include factors within and beyond the IOU’s control, including humidity, temperature and winds. Costs and expenses may be allocated for cost recovery in full or in part. Also, under this standard, an IOU’s conduct will be deemed reasonable if a valid annual safety certification is in place at the time of the ignition, unless a serious doubt is raised, in which case the burden shifts to the utility to dispel that doubt. The IOUs will receive an annual safety certification from OEIS if they meet various requirements.\nIf an IOU has maintained a valid annual safety certification, to the extent it is found to be imprudent, claims will be reimbursable by the IOU to the Wildfire Fund up to a cap based on the IOU’s rate base. The aggregate requirement to reimburse the Wildfire Fund over a trailing three calendar year period is capped at \n20\n% of the equity portion of an IOU’s electric transmission and distribution rate base in the year of the prudency determination. Based on its 2024 rate base, the liability cap for SDG&E is approximately $\n1.4\n billion, which is adjusted annually. The liability cap will apply on a rolling three-year basis so long as future annual safety certifications are received and the Wildfire Fund has not been terminated, which could occur if funds are exhausted. Amounts in excess of the liability cap and amounts that are determined to be prudently incurred do not need to be reimbursed by an IOU to the Wildfire Fund. The Wildfire Fund does not have a specified term and coverage will continue until the assets of the Wildfire Fund are exhausted and the Wildfire Fund is terminated, in which case, the remaining funds, if any, will be transferred to California’s general fund to be used for fire risk mitigation programs.\nIn October 2024, the OEIS approved an update to SDG&E’s 2023-2025 wildfire mitigation plan, which is effective until the OEIS approves a new plan. In December 2024, SDG&E received its annual wildfire safety certification from the OEIS.\nThe Wildfire Fund was initially funded up to $\n10.5\n billion by a loan from the California Surplus Money Investment Fund. The loan is financed through a DWR bond, which was put in place in October 2020 and is securitized through a dedicated surcharge on ratepayers’ bills attributable to the DWR. In October 2019, the CPUC adopted a decision authorizing a non-bypassable charge to be collected by the IOUs to support the anticipated DWR bond issuance authorized by AB 1054. The CPUC decision also determined that ratepayers of non-participating electrical corporations shall not pay the non-bypassable charge. \nThe Wildfire Fund was also funded by initial shareholder contributions from the IOUs totaling $\n7.5\n billion. SDG&E’s share was $\n322.5\n million. The IOUs are also required to make annual shareholder contributions to the Wildfire Fund with an aggregate value of $\n3\n billion over a \n10\n-year period starting in 2019. SDG&E’s share is $\n129\n million. The contributions are not subject to rate recovery.\nWildfire Fund Asset and Obligation\nIn 2019, SDG&E recorded both a Wildfire Fund asset and a related obligation for its commitment to make shareholder contributions of $\n451.5\n million to the Wildfire Fund. SDG&E paid its initial shareholder contribution of $\n322.5\n million to the Wildfire Fund in September 2019. SDG&E funded this contribution with proceeds from an equity contribution from Sempra. SDG&E expects to continue to make annual shareholder contributions of $\n12.9\n million through December 31, 2028. SDG&E is accreting the present value of the Wildfire Fund obligation until the liability is settled. \nSDG&E is amortizing the Wildfire Fund asset on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit, as adjusted for utilization by the IOUs. In 2024, SDG&E revised its estimate of the period of benefit from \n15\n years to \n25\n years. The estimated period of benefit of the Wildfire Fund asset is based on several assumptions, including, but not limited to: \n▪\nhistorical wildfire experience of each IOU in California, including frequency and severity of the wildfires\n▪\nthe value of property potentially damaged by wildfires\n▪\nthe effectiveness of wildfire risk mitigation efforts by each IOU \n▪\nliability cap of each IOU\n▪\nIOU prudency determination levels\n▪\nFERC jurisdictional allocation levels\n▪\ninsurance coverage levels\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-37\nTable of Contents\nThe use of different assumptions, or changes to the assumptions used, could have a significant impact on the estimated period of benefit of the Wildfire Fund asset. SDG&E periodically evaluates the estimated period of benefit of the Wildfire Fund asset based on actual experience and changes in these assumptions. SDG&E recognizes a reduction of its Wildfire Fund asset and records a charge against earnings in the period when there is a reduction of the available coverage due to recoverable claims from any of the participating IOUs. Wildfire claims that are recoverable from the Wildfire Fund, net of anticipated or actual reimbursement to the Wildfire Fund by the responsible IOU, decrease the Wildfire Fund asset and remaining available coverage. \nThe following table summarizes the location of balances related to the Wildfire Fund on Sempra’s and SDG&E’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWILDFIRE FUND \n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31,\nLocation\n2024\n2023\nWildfire Fund asset:\nCurrent\nPrepaid Expenses\n$\n14\n \n$\n28\n \nNoncurrent\nWildfire Fund\n262\n \n269\n \nWildfire Fund obligation:\nCurrent\nOther Current Liabilities\n13\n \n13\n \nNoncurrent\nDeferred Credits and Other\n31\n \n42\n \nNOTE RECEIVABLE\nIn November 2021, Sempra loaned $\n300\n million to KKR Pinnacle in exchange for an interest-bearing promissory note that is due in full no later than October 2029 and bears compound interest at \n5\n% per annum, which may be paid quarterly or added to the outstanding principal at the election of KKR Pinnacle. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Other Long-Term Assets includes $\n349\n million and $\n332\n million, respectively, of outstanding principal, compounded interest and unamortized transaction costs, net of allowance for credit losses, on Sempra’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. \nLONG-LIVED ASSETS\nWe test long-lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may affect the recoverability or the estimated useful lives of long-lived assets. Long-lived assets include intangible assets subject to amortization, but do not include investments in unconsolidated entities. A long-lived asset may be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset. If that comparison indicates that the asset’s carrying value may not be recoverable, the impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset. This evaluation is performed at the lowest level for which separately identifiable cash flows exist.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of acquired companies measured at the time of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized, but we test it for impairment annually on October 1 or whenever events or changes in circumstances necessitate an evaluation. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, we record a goodwill impairment loss as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nFor our annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first make a qualitative assessment of whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount before applying the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we elect to perform the qualitative assessment, we evaluate relevant events and circumstances, including but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors and the overall financial performance of the reporting unit. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, we determine that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If, after performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, we determine that goodwill is impaired, we record the amount of goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill.\nGoodwill of $\n1,602\n million at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 primarily relates to the 2016 acquisitions of IEnova Pipelines and the Ventika wind power generation facilities at Sempra Infrastructure.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-38\nTable of Contents\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther Intangible Assets included on Sempra’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows: \nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nAmortization period\n(years)\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nSempra:\nRenewable energy transmission and consumption permits\n15\n to \n19\n$\n169\n \n$\n169\n \nO&M agreement\n23\n66\n \n66\n \nESJ PPA\n14\n190\n \n190\n \nOther\n10\n to indefinite\n15\n \n15\n \n \n440\n \n440\n \nLess accumulated amortization:\nRenewable energy transmission and consumption permits\n(\n68\n)\n(\n59\n)\nO&M agreement\n(\n20\n)\n(\n17\n)\nESJ PPA\n(\n51\n)\n(\n37\n)\nOther\n(\n9\n)\n(\n9\n)\n \n(\n148\n)\n(\n122\n)\n \n$\n292\n \n$\n318\n \nOther Intangible Assets at December 31, 2024 primarily include:\n▪\nrenewable energy transmission and consumption permits granted by the CRE at the Ventika wind power generation facilities, Don Diego Solar and Border Solar;\n▪\na favorable O&M agreement acquired in connection with the acquisition of Ductos y Energéticos del Norte, S. de R.L. de C.V.; and\n▪\nthe relative fair value of the PPA that was acquired in connection with the acquisition of ESJ.\nIntangible assets subject to amortization are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense for intangible assets was $\n26\n million (including $\n13.5\n million recorded against revenues) in each of 2024, 2023, and 2022. We estimate amortization expense for each of the next five years to be approximately $\n26\n million per year (including $\n13.5\n million per year recorded against revenues).\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-39\nTable of Contents\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nPP&E is recorded at cost and primarily represents the buildings, equipment, other facilities and information systems used by SDG&E and SoCalGas to provide natural gas and electric utility services, and by Other Sempra businesses in their operations, including construction work in progress, leasehold improvements and other equipment. Our PP&E costs include labor, materials and contract services and expenditures for replacement parts incurred during a major maintenance outage of a plant. In addition, the cost of utility plant at our rate-regulated businesses and PP&E under regulated projects that meet the regulatory accounting requirements of U.S. GAAP includes AFUDC. The cost of PP&E for our non-regulated projects includes capitalized interest. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.

Each segment has its own service agreement with the CFE. Following the start of commercial operations of the Guaymas-El Oro segment, Sempra Infrastructure reported damage to the pipeline in the Yaqui territory that has made that section inoperable since August 2017 because it was not able to be repaired due to legal challenges, which were resolved in March 2023, by some members of the Yaqui tribe. Sempra Infrastructure and the CFE have agreed to an amendment to their transportation services agreement and to re-route the portion of the pipeline that is in the Yaqui territory, whereby the CFE would pay for the re-routing with a new tariff. This amendment will terminate if certain conditions are not met, and Sempra Infrastructure retains the right to terminate the transportation services agreement and seek to recover its reasonable and documented costs and lost profit. Sempra Infrastructure continues to acquire and pursue the necessary rights-of-way and permits for the portion of the pipeline that needs to be re-routed. At December 31, 2024, Sempra Infrastructure had $\n401\n million in PP&E, net, related to the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline, which could be subject to impairment if Sempra Infrastructure is unable to re-route a portion of the pipeline and resume operations or if Sempra Infrastructure terminates the contract and is unable to obtain recovery.\nDepreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method over the asset’s estimated composite useful life, the CPUC-prescribed period for SDG&E and SoCalGas, or the remaining term of the site leases, whichever is shortest.\n \nDEPRECIATION EXPENSE\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra\n$\n2,409\n \n$\n2,202\n \n$\n1,995\n \nSDG&E\n1,216\n \n1,092\n \n977\n \nSoCalGas\n903\n \n833\n \n755\n \nACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nSDG&E:\nAccumulated depreciation:\nNatural gas operations\n$\n1,121\n \n$\n1,048\n \nElectric transmission, distribution and generation\n(1)\n6,930\n \n6,321\n \nTotal SDG&E\n8,051\n \n7,369\n \nSoCalGas:\nAccumulated depreciation:\nNatural gas operations\n8,315\n \n7,835\n \nOther non-utility\n15\n \n17\n \nTotal SoCalGas\n8,330\n \n7,852\n \nOther Sempra:\nAccumulated depreciation \n–\n other\n(2)\n2,579\n \n2,314\n \nTotal Sempra \n$\n18,960\n \n$\n17,535\n \n(1)\n    Includes $\n338\n at December 31, 2024 related to SDG&E’s \n86\n% interest in the Southwest Powerlink transmission line, jointly owned by SDG&E and other utilities.\n(2)\n    Includes $\n75\n and $\n82\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of accumulated depreciation for utility plant at Ecogas.\n \nSDG&E and SoCalGas finance construction projects with debt and equity funds.

We also record a liability if a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement exists and can be reasonably estimated but performance is conditional upon a future event. We record the estimated retirement cost using the present value of the obligation at the time the asset is placed into service and recognize that cost over the life of the related asset by depreciating the asset retirement cost and accreting the obligation until the liability is settled. Our rate-regulated entities record regulatory assets or liabilities as a result of the timing difference between the recognition of costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP and costs recovered through the rate-making process.\nWe have recorded AROs related to various assets, including:\nSDG&E and SoCalGas\n▪\nfuel and storage tanks\n▪\nnatural gas transmission and distribution systems\n▪\nhazardous waste storage facilities\n▪\nasbestos-containing construction materials\nSDG&E\n▪\nnuclear power facilities\n▪\nelectric transmission and distribution systems\n▪\nenergy storage systems\n▪\npower generation plants\nSoCalGas\n▪\nunderground natural gas storage facilities and wells\nOther Sempra\n▪\nLNG terminal\n▪\nnatural gas transportation and distribution systems\n▪\nLPG storage facilities\n▪\nrefined products terminals\n▪\npower generating plants \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-42\nTable of Contents\nThe changes in AROs are as follows:\nCHANGES IN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nSempra\nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at January 1\n(1)\n$\n3,831\n \n$\n3,712\n \n$\n3,538\n \n$\n894\n \n$\n887\n \n$\n890\n \n$\n2,847\n \n$\n2,743\n \n$\n2,582\n \nAccretion expense\n156\n \n148\n \n141\n \n37\n \n37\n \n37\n \n114\n \n106\n \n101\n \nLiabilities incurred\n—\n \n18\n \n21\n \n—\n \n15\n \n6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPayments\n(\n65\n)\n(\n62\n)\n(\n57\n)\n(\n57\n)\n(\n59\n)\n(\n54\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nRevisions\n3\n \n15\n \n69\n \n26\n \n14\n \n8\n \n(\n23\n)\n1\n \n63\n \nBalance at December 31\n(1)\n$\n3,925\n \n$\n3,831\n \n$\n3,712\n \n$\n900\n \n$\n894\n \n$\n887\n \n$\n2,930\n \n$\n2,847\n \n$\n2,743\n \n(1)\n    Current portion of the ARO for Sempra is included in Other Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCONTINGENCIES\nWe accrue losses for the estimated impacts of various conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes.

A REC, and its associated attributes and benefits, can be sold separately from the underlying physical electricity associated with a renewable-based generation source in certain markets.\nRetail sellers of electricity obtain RECs through renewable energy PPAs, internal generation or separate purchases in the market to comply with the RPS Program established by the governmental agencies. RECs provide documentation for the generation of a unit of renewable energy that is used to verify compliance with the RPS Program. The cost of RECs at SDG&E, which is recoverable in rates, is recorded in Cost of Electric Fuel and Purchased Power on the Statements of Operations.\nOPERATION AND MAINTENANCE EXPENSES\nOperation and Maintenance includes O&M and general and administrative costs, consisting primarily of personnel costs, purchased materials and services, insurance, rent, provisions for expected credit losses and litigation expense (except for litigation expense included in Aliso Canyon Litigation and Regulatory Matters).\nLEGAL FEES\nLegal fees that are associated with a past event for which a liability has been recorded are accrued when it is probable that fees also will be incurred and amounts are estimable.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND TRANSACTIONS\nOur natural gas distribution utility in Mexico, Ecogas, uses its local currency as its functional currency. The assets and liabilities of its foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates at the end of the reporting period, and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the year. The resulting noncash translation adjustments do not enter into the calculation of earnings or retained earnings but are reflected in OCI and AOCI.\nCash flows of this consolidated foreign subsidiary are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. We report the effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances held in foreign currencies in Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash on Sempra’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. \nForeign currency transaction gains (losses), net, are included in Other Income, Net, on Sempra’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-46\nTable of Contents\nOTHER INCOME, NET\nOther Income, Net, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations consists of the following:\nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra:\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction\n$\n150\n \n$\n140\n \n$\n143\n \nInvestment gains (losses), net\n(1)\n36\n \n28\n \n(\n42\n)\nGains on interest rate and foreign exchange instruments, net\n2\n \n4\n \n11\n \nForeign currency transaction (losses) gains, net\n(2)\n(\n16\n)\n2\n \n(\n24\n)\nNon-service components of net periodic benefit cost\n(\n101\n)\n(\n106\n)\n(\n59\n)\nInterest on regulatory balancing accounts, net\n75\n \n79\n \n26\n \nSundry, net\n(\n10\n)\n(\n16\n)\n(\n31\n)\nTotal\n$\n136\n \n$\n131\n \n$\n24\n \nSDG&E:\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction\n$\n73\n \n$\n86\n \n$\n88\n \nNon-service components of net periodic benefit cost\n4\n \n(\n19\n)\n(\n11\n)\nInterest on regulatory balancing accounts, net\n23\n \n42\n \n18\n \nSundry, net\n(\n10\n)\n(\n12\n)\n(\n3\n)\nTotal\n$\n90\n \n$\n97\n \n$\n92\n \nSoCalGas:\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction\n$\n72\n \n$\n54\n \n$\n55\n \nNon-service components of net periodic benefit cost\n(\n86\n)\n(\n80\n)\n(\n42\n)\nInterest on regulatory balancing accounts, net\n52\n \n37\n \n8\n \nSundry, net\n(\n13\n)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n29\n)\nTotal\n$\n25\n \n$\n(\n4\n)\n$\n(\n8\n)\n(1)\n    \nRepresents net investment gains (losses) on dedicated assets in support of our executive retirement and deferred compensation plans.

The IRA also provided an election that permits ITCs related to standalone energy storage projects to be returned to utility customers over a period that is shorter than the life of the applicable asset.\nUnder the regulatory accounting treatment required for flow-through temporary differences, the Registrants recognize:\n▪\nregulatory assets to offset deferred income tax liabilities if it is probable that the amounts will be recovered from customers; and\n▪\nregulatory liabilities to offset deferred income tax assets if it is probable that the amounts will be returned to customers.\nWhen there are uncertainties related to potential income tax benefits, the position we take must have at least a more-likely-than-not chance of being sustained (based on the position’s technical merits) upon challenge by the respective authorities in order to qualify for recognition. The term “more-likely-than-not” means a likelihood of more than 50%. Otherwise, we may not recognize any of the potential tax benefit associated with the position. We recognize a benefit for a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not criterion at the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon its effective resolution.\nUnrecognized income tax benefits involve management’s judgment regarding the likelihood of the benefit being sustained. The final resolution of uncertain tax positions could result in adjustments to recorded amounts and may affect our ETR.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-47\nTable of Contents\nWe accrue income tax to the extent we intend to repatriate cash to the U.S. from our continuing international operations. We currently do not record deferred income taxes for other basis differences between financial statement and income tax investment amounts in non-U.S. subsidiaries because they are indefinitely reinvested. We recognize income tax expense for basis differences related to global intangible low-taxed income as a period cost if and when incurred. \nWe recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes in income tax expense.\nWe provide additional information about income taxes in Note 7.\nRESTRICTED NET ASSETS\nSempra\nAs we discuss below, SDG&E, SoCalGas and certain Other Sempra entities have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Sempra by dividend, advance or loan as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators. Additionally, certain Other Sempra entities are subject to various financial and other covenants and other restrictions contained in debt and credit agreements (described in Note 6) and in other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Sempra. At December 31, 2024, Sempra was in compliance with all covenants related to its debt agreements.\nAt December 31, 2024, the amount of restricted net assets of consolidated entities of Sempra that may not be distributed to Sempra in the form of a loan or dividend is $\n17.9\n billion. Additionally, the amount of restricted net assets of our unconsolidated entities is $\n16.3\n billion. Although the restrictions cap the amount of funding that the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Sempra, we do not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on our ability to access cash to pay dividends and fund operating needs.\nAs we discuss in Note 5, $\n2.9\n billion of Sempra’s retained earnings represents undistributed earnings of equity method investments at December 31, 2024.\nSDG&E and SoCalGas\nThe CPUC’s regulation of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ capital structures limits the amounts available for dividends and loans to Sempra. At December 31, 2024, Sempra could have received combined loans and dividends of approximately $\n672\n million from SDG&E and approximately $\n457\n million from SoCalGas.\nThe payment and amount of future dividends by SDG&E and SoCalGas are at the discretion of their respective boards of directors. The following restrictions limit the amount of retained earnings that may be paid as common stock dividends or loaned to Sempra from either utility:\n▪\nThe CPUC requires that SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ common equity ratios be no lower than one percentage point below the CPUC-authorized percentage of each entity’s authorized capital structure. The authorized percentage at December 31, 2024 is \n52\n% at both SDG&E and SoCalGas.\n▪\nSDG&E and SoCalGas each have a revolving credit line that requires it to maintain a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization (as defined in the agreements) of no more than \n65\n%, as we discuss in Note 6.\nBased on these restrictions, at December 31, 2024, SDG&E’s restricted net assets were $\n10.0\n billion, and SoCalGas’ restricted net assets were $\n7.7\n billion, which could not be transferred to Sempra.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-48\nTable of Contents\nOther Sempra\nSempra owns a \n100\n% interest in Oncor Holdings, which owns an \n80.25\n% interest in Oncor. As we discuss in Note 5, we account for our investment in Oncor Holdings under the equity method. Significant restrictions at Oncor that limit the amount that may be paid as dividends to Sempra include:\n▪\nIn connection with ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments, Oncor may not pay any dividends or make any other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if a majority of its independent directors or a minority member director determines that it is in the best interests of Oncor to retain such amounts to meet expected future requirements.\n▪\nOncor must remain in compliance with its debt-to-equity ratio established by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes and may not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if that payment would cause it to exceed its PUCT authorized debt-to-equity ratio. Oncor’s authorized regulatory capital structure is \n57.5\n% debt to \n42.5\n% equity at December 31, 2024.\n▪\nIf the credit rating on Oncor’s senior secured debt by any of the Rating Agencies falls below BBB (or the equivalent), Oncor will suspend dividends and other distributions (except for contractual tax payments), unless otherwise allowed by the PUCT. At December 31, 2024, all of Oncor’s senior secured ratings were above BBB.\n▪\nOncor’s revolving credit lines and certain of its other debt agreements require it to maintain a consolidated senior debt-to-capitalization ratio of no more than \n65\n% and observe certain affirmative covenants. At December 31, 2024, Oncor was in compliance with these covenants.\nBased on these restrictions, at December 31, 2024, Oncor’s restricted net assets were $\n15.6\n billion, which could not be transferred to its owners.\nSempra owns a \n50\n% interest in Sharyland Holdings, which owns a \n100\n% interest in Sharyland Utilities. Significant restrictions related to this equity method investment include:\n▪\nSharyland Utilities may not pay dividends or make other distributions (except for contractual payments) without the consent of the JV partner.\n▪\nSharyland Utilities must remain in compliance with the capital structure established by the PUCT for ratemaking purposes and may not pay dividends or other distributions (except for contractual tax payments) if that payment would cause its debt to exceed \n60\n% of its capital structure.\n▪\nSharyland Utilities has a revolving credit line and three senior notes that require it to maintain a consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio of no more than \n70\n% and observe certain customary reporting requirements and other affirmative covenants. At December 31, 2024, Sharyland Utilities was in compliance with these and all other covenants.\nBased on these restrictions, at December 31, 2024, Sharyland Utilities’ restricted net assets were $\n136\n million, which could not be transferred to its owners.\nSignificant restrictions at Sempra Infrastructure include:\n▪\nPartnerships and JVs at Sempra Infrastructure may not pay dividends or make other distributions (except for contractual payments) without the consent of the partners.\n▪\nSempra Infrastructure has an equity method investment in Cameron LNG JV, which has debt agreements that require the establishment and funding of project accounts to which the proceeds of loans, project revenues and other amounts are deposited and applied in accordance with the debt agreements. The debt agreements require the JV to maintain reserve accounts in order to pay the project debt service, and also contain restrictions related to the payment of dividends and other distributions to the members of the JV. \nPursuant to the transfer restriction agreement under the debt agreements, Sempra must retain at least \n10\n% of the indirect fully diluted economic and beneficial ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV. In addition, at all times, a Sempra controlled (but not necessarily wholly owned) subsidiary must directly own \n50.2\n% of the membership interests of Cameron LNG JV.\nTo support Cameron LNG JV’s obligations under its debt agreements, Cameron LNG JV has granted security over all of its assets, subject to customary exceptions, and all equity interests in Cameron LNG JV were pledged to HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as security trustee for the benefit of all of Cameron LNG JV’s creditors. As a result, an enforcement action by the lenders taken in accordance with the finance documents could result in the exercise of such security interests by the lenders and the loss of ownership interests in Cameron LNG JV by Sempra and the other project partners. \nUnder these restrictions, net assets of Cameron LNG JV of approximately $\n443\n million were restricted at December 31, 2024.\n▪\nMexico requires domestic corporations to maintain minimum legal reserves as a percentage of capital stock, resulting in restricted net assets of $\n185\n million at Sempra Infrastructure’s consolidated Mexican subsidiaries at December 31, 2024.\n▪\nIEnova has restrictions under trust agreements related to pipeline projects to pay for rights-of-way and other costs. Under these restrictions, net assets totaling $\n3\n million were restricted at December 31, 2024.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-49\nTable of Contents\n▪\nTAG Norte, a \n50\n% owned and unconsolidated JV of Sempra Infrastructure, has a long-term debt agreement that requires it to maintain a reserve account to pay the projects’ debt. Under these restrictions, net assets totaling $\n126\n million were restricted at December 31, 2024.\n▪\nPort Arthur LNG has a \nseven-year\n term loan facility agreement and working capital credit facility agreement that require consent of a trustee for the withdrawal or transfer of cash. Under these restrictions, net assets totaling $\n19\n million were restricted at December 31, 2024.\nNOTE 2. \nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nWe describe below recent accounting pronouncements that have had or may have a significant effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or disclosures.\nASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures”: \nASU 2023-07 revises reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. In addition, public entities are required to disclose the title and position of the CODM and explain how the CODM uses the reported measures of profit or loss to assess segment performance. The standard also requires interim disclosure of certain segment-related disclosures that previously were required only on an annual basis. ASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. We adopted the standard on December 31, 2024 and revised our segment reporting disclosures in Note 16 on a retrospective basis.\nASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”: \nASU 2023-09 improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring disaggregated information about each Registrant’s ETR reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. For each annual period, each Registrant will be required to disclose specific categories in the rate reconciliation and provide additional information for reconciling items that meet a quantitative threshold (if the effect of those reconciling items is equal to or greater than 5% of the amount computed by multiplying pretax income or loss by the applicable statutory income tax rate). ASU 2023-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. We plan to adopt the standard on December 31, 2025 and are currently evaluating the effect of the standard on our financial reporting. \nASU 2024-03, “Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses”: \nASU 2024-03 mandates detailed disclosures on the disaggregation of income statement expenses. Public business entities are required to disclose in the notes to financial statements the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included in each relevant expense caption. The standard also requires disclosure of the amount, and a qualitative description of, other items remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated. ASU 2024-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted, and entities may adopt the standard on either a prospective or retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the effect of the standard on our financial reporting and have not yet selected the year in which we will adopt the standard.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-50\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 3. \nREVENUES\nThe following tables disaggregate our revenues from contracts with customers by major service line and market.

We also provide other midstream and renewable energy-related services. We assess our revenues on a contract-by-contract basis as well as a portfolio basis to determine the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty, if any, of revenues being recognized.\nWe generally recognize revenues when performance of the promised commodity or service is provided to customers and invoices are issued for an amount that reflects the consideration we are entitled to in exchange for those services. We consider the delivery and transmission of natural gas and electricity and providing of natural gas storage services as ongoing and integrated services. Generally, natural gas or electricity services are received and consumed by the customer simultaneously. Performance obligations related to these services are satisfied over time and represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customers. We recognize revenue based on units delivered, as the satisfaction of respective performance obligations can be directly measured by the amount of natural gas or electricity delivered to the customer. In most cases, the right to consideration from the customer directly corresponds to the value transferred to the customer and we recognize revenue in the amount that we have the right to invoice. \nThe payment terms in customer contracts vary. Typically, we have an unconditional right to customer payments, which are due after the performance obligation to the customer is satisfied. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is typically between 10 and 90 days.\nWe exclude sales and usage-based taxes from revenues. In addition, SDG&E and SoCalGas pay franchise fees to operate in various municipalities. SDG&E and SoCalGas bill these franchise fees to their customers based on a CPUC-authorized rate. These franchise fees, which are required to be paid regardless of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ ability to collect from customers, are accounted for on a gross basis and reflected in utilities revenues from contracts with customers and operating expense.\nUtilities Revenues\nUtilities revenues represent the majority of our consolidated revenues from contracts with customers and include:\n▪\nThe transmission, distribution and storage of natural gas at:\n◦\nSDG&E \n◦\nSoCalGas\n◦\nSempra’s Ecogas\n▪\nThe generation, transmission and distribution of electricity at SDG&E.\nUtilities revenues are derived from and recognized upon the delivery of natural gas or electricity services to customers. Amounts that we bill customers are based on tariffs set by regulators within the respective state or country. For SDG&E and SoCalGas, amounts that we bill to customers also include adjustments for previously recognized regulatory revenues.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-52\nTable of Contents\nSDG&E, SoCalGas and Ecogas recognize revenues based on regulator-approved revenue requirements, which allow the utilities to recover their reasonable operating costs and provides the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investments. While SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ revenues are not affected by actual sales volumes, the pattern of their revenue recognition during the year is affected by seasonality. SDG&E and SoCalGas recognize annual authorized revenue from customers using seasonal factors established in applicable proceedings. This generally results in a significant portion of operating revenues being recognized in the third quarter of each year for SDG&E and in the first and fourth quarters of each year for SoCalGas. \nSDG&E has an arrangement to provide the California ISO with the ability to control its high-voltage transmission lines for prices approved by the FERC. Revenue is recognized over time as access is provided to the California ISO.\nFactors that can affect the amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows include weather, seasonality and timing of customer billings and collections, which may result in unbilled revenues that can vary significantly from month to month and generally approximate one-half month’s deliveries.\nSDG&E and SoCalGas recognize revenues from the sale of allocated California GHG emission allowances at quarterly auctions administered by CARB. GHG allowances are delivered to CARB in advance of the quarterly auctions, and SDG&E and SoCalGas have the right to payment when the GHG allowances are sold at auction. GHG revenue is recognized on a point in time basis within the quarter the auction is held. SDG&E and SoCalGas balance costs and revenues associated with the GHG program through regulatory balancing accounts.\nEnergy-Related Businesses Revenues\nRevenues at Sempra Infrastructure typically represent revenues from long-term, U.S. dollar-based contracts with customers for the sale of natural gas and LNG, as well as storage and transportation of natural gas. Invoiced amounts are based on the volume of natural gas delivered and contracted prices.\nWe generate pipeline transportation revenues from firm agreements, under which customers pay a fee for reserving transportation capacity. Revenue is recognized when the volumes are delivered to the customers’ agreed upon delivery point. We recognize revenues for our stand-ready obligation to provide capacity and transportation services throughout the contractual delivery period, as the benefits are received and consumed simultaneously as customers utilize pipeline capacity for the transport and receipt of natural gas and LPG. Invoiced amounts are based on a variable usage fee and a fixed capacity charge, adjusted for the Consumer Price Index, the effects of any foreign currency impacts and the actual quantity of commodity transported.\nSempra Infrastructure develops, invests in and operates solar and wind facilities that have long-term PPAs to sell the electricity and the related green energy attributes they generate to customers, generally load serving entities, industrial and other customers. Load serving entities will sell electric service to their end-users and wholesale customers immediately upon receipt of our power delivery, and industrial and other customers immediately consume the electricity to run their facilities, and thus, we recognize the revenue under the PPAs as the electricity is generated and delivered. We invoice customers based on the volume of energy delivered at rates pursuant to the PPAs.\nTdM is a natural gas-fired power plant that generates revenues from selling electricity and/or resource adequacy to the California ISO and to governmental, public utility and wholesale power marketing entities as the power is delivered at the interconnection point. \nWe recognize storage revenue from firm capacity reservation agreements, under which we collect a fee for reserving storage capacity for customers in our storage facilities. Under these firm agreements, customers pay a monthly fixed reservation fee based on the storage capacity reserved rather than the actual volumes stored. For the fixed-fee component, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract. We bill customers for any capacity used in excess of the contracted capacity and such revenues are recognized in the month of occurrence. We also recognize revenue for interruptible storage services.\nSempra Infrastructure sells natural gas to the CFE and other customers under supply agreements. Sempra Infrastructure recognizes the revenue from the sale of natural gas upon transfer of the natural gas via pipelines to customers at the agreed upon delivery points, and in the case of the CFE, at its thermoelectric power plants. \nRemaining Performance Obligations    \nWe do not disclose information about remaining performance obligations for (a) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, (b) variable consideration recognized at the amount at which we have the right to invoice for services performed, or (c) variable consideration allocated to wholly unsatisfied performance obligations.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-53\nTable of Contents\nFor contracts greater than one year, at December 31, 2024, we expect to recognize revenue related to the fixed fee component of the consideration as shown below. Sempra’s remaining performance obligations primarily relate to capacity agreements for natural gas storage and transportation at Sempra Infrastructure and transmission line projects at SDG&E. SoCalGas did not have any remaining performance obligations for contracts greater than one year at December 31, 2024.\nREMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\n(Dollars in millions)\nSempra\n(1)\nSDG&E\n2025\n$\n403\n \n$\n4\n \n2026\n284\n \n4\n \n2027\n285\n \n4\n \n2028\n239\n \n4\n \n2029\n211\n \n4\n \nThereafter\n2,101\n \n52\n \nTotal revenues to be recognized\n$\n3,523\n \n$\n72\n \n(1)    \nExcludes intercompany transactions.\n \nContract Liabilities from Revenues from Contracts with Customers\nFrom time to time, we receive payments in advance of satisfying the performance obligations associated with customer contracts.

In December 2024, Sempra Infrastructure and the customer agreed to modify their LNG storage and regasification agreement by reducing the remaining term of the agreement from approximately \nthree years\n to \none year\n, now expiring in December 2025. As a result of the modification, Sempra Infrastructure will recognize approximately $\n107\n million, which the customer paid in advance, in revenue over the remaining one-year term. The net effect to our contract liabilities is reflected in “contract modification” in the table above.\nAs we discuss in Note 1 in “Property, Plant and Equipment,” Sempra Infrastructure and the CFE have agreed to an amendment to their transportation services agreement for the Guaymas-El Oro segment of the Sonora pipeline. Sempra Infrastructure determined that the amended transportation services agreement met the definition of a lease. In December 2023, Sempra reclassified $\n61\n million from contract liabilities to other noncurrent liabilities, both within Deferred Credits and Other on Sempra’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-54\nTable of Contents\nReceivables from Revenues from Contracts with Customers\nThe table below shows receivable balances, net of allowances for credit losses, associated with revenues from contracts with customers on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRECEIVABLES FROM REVENUES FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nSempra:\nAccounts receivable – trade, net\n(1)\n$\n1,787\n \n$\n1,951\n \nAccounts receivable – other, net\n12\n \n15\n \nDue from unconsolidated affiliates – current\n(2)\n4\n \n4\n \nOther long-term assets\n(3)\n18\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n1,821\n \n$\n1,970\n \nSDG&E:\nAccounts receivable – trade, net\n(1)\n$\n774\n \n$\n870\n \nAccounts receivable – other, net\n11\n \n13\n \nDue from unconsolidated affiliates – current\n(2)\n6\n \n6\n \nOther long-term assets\n(3)\n4\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n795\n \n$\n889\n \nSoCalGas:\nAccounts receivable – trade, net\n$\n932\n \n$\n985\n \nAccounts receivable – other, net\n1\n \n2\n \nOther long-term assets\n(3)\n14\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n947\n \n$\n987\n \n(1)\n     \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, includes $\n144\n \nand $\n148\n, respectively, of receivables due from customers that were billed on behalf of CCAs, which are not included in revenues.\n(2)\n     \nAmount is presented net of amounts due to unconsolidated affiliates on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, when right of offset exists.\n(3)\n     \nIn January 2024, the CPUC directed SDG&E and SoCalGas to offer long-term repayment plans to eligible residential customers with past-due balances.\nREVENUES FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\nCertain of our revenues are derived from sources other than contracts with customers and are accounted for under other accounting standards outside the scope of ASC 606.\nUtilities Regulatory Revenues\nAlternative Revenue Programs\nWe recognize revenues from alternative revenue programs when the regulator-specified conditions for recognition have been met and adjust these revenues as they are recovered or refunded through future utility service.\nDecoupled Revenues.\n As we discuss above, the regulatory framework requires SDG&E and SoCalGas to recover authorized revenue based on estimated annual demand forecasts approved in regular proceedings before the CPUC. However, actual demand for natural gas and electricity will generally vary from CPUC-approved forecasted demand due to the impacts from weather volatility, energy efficiency programs, rooftop solar and other factors affecting consumption. The CPUC regulatory framework provides for SDG&E and SoCalGas to use a “decoupling” mechanism, which allows SDG&E and SoCalGas to record revenue shortfalls or excess revenues resulting from any difference between actual and forecasted demand to be recovered or refunded in authorized revenue in a subsequent period based on the nature of the account.\nIncentive Mechanisms.\n SoCalGas is subject to the GCIM and is eligible for financial awards or subject to financial penalties depending on its performance in relation to specific benchmarks.\nIncentive awards are included in revenues when we receive required CPUC approval of the award, the timing of which may not be consistent from year to year. We would record penalties for results below the specified benchmarks against revenues when we believe it is probable that the CPUC would assess a penalty.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-55\nTable of Contents\nOther Cost-Based Regulatory Recovery\nThe CPUC, and the FERC as it relates to SDG&E, authorize SDG&E and SoCalGas to collect, or in the case of CPUC programmatic activities, to apply for additional, revenue requirements beyond base rates from customers for certain operating and capital related costs (depreciation, taxes and return on rate base), including for: \n▪\ncosts to purchase natural gas and electricity; \n▪\ncosts associated with administering public purpose, demand response, environmental compliance, and customer energy efficiency programs; \n▪\nother programmatic activities, such as gas distribution, gas transmission, gas storage integrity management and wildfire mitigation; and\n▪\ncosts associated with third party liability insurance premiums.\nAuthorized costs are recovered as the commodity or service is delivered. To the extent authorized amounts collected vary from actual costs, the differences are generally recovered or refunded in a subsequent period based on the nature of the balancing account mechanism. In general, the revenue recognition criteria for balanced costs billed to customers are met when the costs are incurred. Because these costs are substantially recovered in rates through a balancing account mechanism, changes in these costs are reflected as changes in revenues. The CPUC and the FERC may impose various review procedures before authorizing recovery or refund of amounts accumulated for authorized programs, including limitations on the program’s total cost, revenue requirement limits or reviews of costs for reasonableness. These procedures could result in delays or disallowances of recovery from customers.\nWe discuss balancing accounts and their effects further in Note 4.\nOther Revenues\nSempra Infrastructure generates lease revenues from certain of its natural gas and ethane pipelines, compressor stations, LPG storage facilities, a rail facility and refined products terminals. We discuss the recognition of lease income in Note 15.\nSempra Infrastructure has an agreement with Tangguh PSC to supply LNG to the ECA Regas Facility. Under the terms of the agreement, Tangguh PSC must either deliver the contracted number of cargoes or pay a diversion fee for non-delivery of LNG cargoes.\nSempra Infrastructure also recognizes other revenues associated with derivatives related to the sales of natural gas and electricity under short-term and long-term contracts and into the spot market and other competitive markets. Revenues include the net realized gains and losses on physical and derivative settlements and net unrealized gains and losses from the change in fair values of these derivatives.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-56\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 4. \nREGULATORY MATTERS\nREGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nWe show the details of regulatory assets and liabilities in the following table and discuss them below. With the exception of regulatory balancing accounts, we generally do not earn a return on our regulatory assets until a related cash expenditure has been made. Upon the occurrence of a cash expenditure associated with a regulatory asset, the related amounts are recoverable through a regulatory account mechanism for which we earn a return authorized by applicable regulators, which generally approximates the three-month commercial paper rate. The periods during which we recognize a regulatory asset while we do not earn a return vary by regulatory asset.\nREGULATORY ASSETS (LIABILITIES) AT DECEMBER 31\n(Dollars in millions)\nSempra\nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nFixed-price contracts and other derivatives\n$\n53\n \n$\n215\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n42\n \n$\n201\n \nDeferred income taxes recoverable in rates\n1,689\n \n1,142\n \n802\n \n626\n \n817\n \n430\n \nPension and PBOP plan obligations\n(\n458\n)\n(\n212\n)\n(\n2\n)\n48\n \n(\n456\n)\n(\n260\n)\nEmployee benefit costs\n19\n \n24\n \n3\n \n3\n \n16\n \n21\n \nRemoval obligations\n(\n3,295\n)\n(\n3,082\n)\n(\n2,676\n)\n(\n2,468\n)\n(\n619\n)\n(\n614\n)\nEnvironmental costs\n149\n \n139\n \n115\n \n105\n \n34\n \n34\n \nSunrise Powerlink fire mitigation\n124\n \n124\n \n124\n \n124\n \n—\n \n—\n \nRegulatory balancing accounts\n(1)(2)\n:\nCommodity – electric\n(\n313\n)\n(\n233\n)\n(\n313\n)\n(\n233\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nCommodity – gas, including transportation\n(\n47\n)\n(\n259\n)\n86\n \n52\n \n(\n133\n)\n(\n311\n)\nSafety and reliability\n820\n \n959\n \n227\n \n207\n \n593\n \n752\n \nPublic purpose programs\n(\n439\n)\n(\n273\n)\n(\n219\n)\n(\n144\n)\n(\n220\n)\n(\n129\n)\n2024 GRC retroactive impacts\n631\n \n—\n \n277\n \n—\n \n354\n \n—\n \nWildfire mitigation plan\n808\n \n685\n \n808\n \n685\n \n—\n \n—\n \nLiability insurance premium\n(\n24\n)\n113\n \n(\n15\n)\n90\n \n(\n9\n)\n23\n \nOther balancing accounts\n158\n \n373\n \n(\n51\n)\n(\n152\n)\n209\n \n525\n \nOther regulatory assets (liabilities), net\n(2)\n164\n \n(\n10\n)\n87\n \n49\n \n79\n \n(\n58\n)\nTotal\n$\n39\n \n$\n(\n295\n)\n$\n(\n736\n)\n$\n(\n994\n)\n$\n707\n \n$\n614\n \n(1)\n    At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the noncurrent portion of regulatory balancing accounts – net undercollected for Sempra was $\n1,731\n and $\n1,913\n, respectively, for SDG&E was $\n873\n and $\n950\n, respectively, and for SoCalGas was $\n858\n and $\n963\n, respectively.\n(2)\n    Includes regulatory assets earning a return authorized by applicable regulators, which generally approximates the three-month commercial paper rate.\nRegulatory Assets Not Earning a Return\n▪\nRegulatory assets arising from fixed-price contracts and other derivatives are offset by corresponding liabilities arising from purchased power and natural gas commodity and transportation contracts. The regulatory asset is increased/decreased based on changes in the fair market value of the contracts. It is also reduced as payments are made for commodities and services under these contracts. The related amounts are recovered in rates once these contracts are settled, generally within \nfour years\n.\n▪\nDeferred income taxes recoverable/refundable in rates are based on current regulatory ratemaking and income tax laws. SDG&E, SoCalGas and Sempra Infrastructure expect to recover/refund net regulatory assets/liabilities related to deferred income taxes over the lives of the assets, ranging from \n5\n to \n69\n years, that give rise to the related accumulated deferred income tax balances. Regulatory assets and liabilities include excess deferred income taxes resulting from statutory income tax rate changes and certain income tax benefits and expenses associated with flow-through items, which we discuss in Note 7. \n▪\nRegulatory assets/liabilities related to pension and PBOP plan obligations are offset by corresponding liabilities/assets. The assets are recovered in rates as the plans are funded.\n▪\nThe regulatory asset related to employee benefit costs represents our liability associated with long-term disability insurance that will be recovered from customers in future rates as expenditures are made.\n▪\nRegulatory liabilities from removal obligations represent cumulative amounts collected in rates for future asset removal costs in excess of cumulative amounts incurred (or paid).\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-57\nTable of Contents\n▪\nRegulatory assets related to environmental costs represent the portion of our environmental liability recognized at the end of the period in excess of the amount that has been recovered through rates charged to customers. We expect this amount to be recovered in future rates as expenditures are made. \n▪\nThe regulatory asset related to Sunrise Powerlink fire mitigation is offset by a corresponding liability for the funding of a trust to cover the mitigation costs. SDG&E expects to recover the regulatory asset in rates as the trust is funded over a remaining \n45\n-year period.\nRegulatory Assets Earning a Return\n▪\nOver- and undercollected regulatory balancing accounts and other regulatory assets, net, reflect the difference between customer billings and recorded or CPUC-authorized amounts. Depreciation, taxes and return on rate base may also be included in certain accounts. Amounts in the balancing accounts are recoverable (receivable) or refundable (payable) in future rates, subject to CPUC approval. The adopted revenue requirements in the 2024 GRC FD were placed into rates on February 1, 2025 and the incremental revenue requirements associated with the period from January 1, 2024 through January 31, 2025 are being recovered in rates over an 18-month period that began on February 1, 2025. SDG&E and SoCalGas periodically make requests to the CPUC to true up their revenue requirement for amounts accumulated in the regulatory balancing accounts and in other regulatory assets, net. The CPUC may impose various review procedures before authorizing recovery or refund of amounts accumulated for authorized programs, including limitations on the program’s total cost, revenue requirement limits or reviews of costs for reasonableness. These procedures could result in delays or disallowances of recovery from customers.\nAmortization expense on certain regulatory assets for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n14\n million, $\n12\n million and $\n11\n million, respectively, at Sempra, $\n7\n million, $\n6\n million and $\n5\n million, respectively, at SDG&E, and $\n7\n million, $\n6\n million and $\n6\n million, respectively, at SoCalGas.\nCPUC GRC\nThe CPUC uses GRCs to set revenues to allow SDG&E and SoCalGas to recover their reasonable operating costs and to provide the opportunity to realize their authorized rates of return on their investments. In December 2024, the CPUC approved an FD in the 2024 GRC for SDG&E and SoCalGas that authorizes SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ revenue requirements for 2024 and attrition year adjustments for 2025 through 2027, inclusively.\nThe GRC FD adopts a 2024 revenue requirement of $\n2,699\n million for SDG&E’s combined operations ($\n2,193\n million for its electric operations and $\n506\n million for its natural gas operations). SDG&E’s authorized 2024 combined revenue requirement represents an increase of $\n189\n million (\n7.5\n%) over its authorized 2023 combined revenue requirement. In connection with SDG&E’s election to change its tax accounting method for gas repairs expenditures, the 2024 combined revenue requirement increase is net of $\n68\n million of income tax benefits for 2023 and 2024 to be flowed through to customers. The GRC FD also specifies an increase in SDG&E’s 2025, 2026, and 2027 combined revenue requirements of $\n147\n million (\n5.45\n%), $\n119\n million (\n4.17\n%) and $\n122\n million (\n4.11\n%), respectively, over the preceding year’s combined revenue requirement. The 2025, 2026 and 2027 revenue requirements will be updated to implement a previously authorized change in the cost of capital, which we describe below, that adjusted SDG&E’s rate of return to \n7.45\n%.\nThe GRC FD adopts a 2024 revenue requirement of $\n3,806\n million for SoCalGas. SoCalGas’ authorized 2024 revenue requirement represents an increase of $\n324\n million (\n9.3\n%) over its authorized 2023 revenue requirement. In connection with SoCalGas’ election to change its tax accounting method for gas repairs expenditures, the 2024 revenue requirement increase is net of $\n202\n million of income tax benefits for 2023 and 2024 to be flowed through to customers. The GRC FD also specifies an increase in SoCalGas’ 2025, 2026, and 2027 revenue requirements of $\n190\n million (\n5.00\n%), $\n116\n million (\n2.91\n%) and $\n120\n million (\n2.92\n%), respectively, over the preceding year’s revenue requirement. The 2025, 2026 and 2027 revenue requirements will be updated to implement a previously authorized change in the cost of capital, which we describe below, that adjusted SoCalGas’ rate of return to \n7.49\n%.\nThe GRC provides SDG&E and SoCalGas with numerous mechanisms to seek cost recovery of specified projects and programs. We expect that the requests for cost recovery of these projects and programs, which remain subject to CPUC approval, will result in additional amounts of authorized revenue requirement that are not included in the amounts described above.\nSince the GRC FD is effective retroactive to January 1, 2024, SDG&E and SoCalGas recorded the retroactive impacts in the fourth quarter of 2024. \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-58\nTable of Contents\n2024 GRC Track 2\nIn October 2023, SDG&E submitted a separate request to the CPUC in its 2024 GRC, known as a Track 2 request. This request seeks review and recovery of $\n1.5\n billion of wildfire mitigation plan costs incurred from 2019 through 2022 that were in addition to amounts authorized in the 2019 GRC and not addressed in the 2024 GRC FD. SDG&E expects to receive a proposed decision for its Track 2 request in the first half of 2025.\nRevenue requirements associated with the Track 2 request have been recorded in a regulatory account. In February 2024, the CPUC approved an interim cost recovery mechanism that permits SDG&E to recover in rates $\n194\n million and $\n96\n million of this regulatory account balance in 2024 and 2025, respectively. Such recovery of SDG&E’s wildfire mitigation plan regulatory account balance will be subject to refund, contingent on the reasonableness review decision for its Track 2 request. \n2024 GRC Track 3\nSDG&E expects to submit in the first half of 2025 an additional request to the CPUC in its 2024 GRC, known as a Track 3 request, for review and recovery of wildfire mitigation plan costs incurred in 2023. The GRC FD expanded the scope of the Track 3 filing to include review of SoCalGas’ and SDG&E’s Pipeline Safety Enhancement Plan costs incurred from 2015 to 2020, inclusively. \nCPUC COST OF CAPITAL\nA CPUC cost of capital proceeding every three years determines a utility’s authorized capital structure and authorized return on rate base. The CCM applies in the interim years and considers changes in the cost of capital based on changes in interest rates based on the applicable utility bond index published by Moody’s (CCM benchmark rate) for each 12-month period ending September 30 (the measurement period). The index applicable to SDG&E and SoCalGas is based on each utility’s credit rating. The CCM benchmark rate is the basis of comparison to determine if the CCM is triggered in each measurement period, which occurs if the change in the applicable Moody’s utility bond index relative to the CCM benchmark rate is larger than plus or minus \n1.00\n% for the measurement period. Alternatively, each of SDG&E and SoCalGas is permitted to file a cost of capital application to have its cost of capital determined in lieu of the CCM in an interim year in which an extraordinary or catastrophic event materially impacts its cost of capital and affects utilities differently than the market as a whole.\nThe CPUC-approved cost of capital for SDG&E and SoCalGas that became effective on January 1, 2020 remained in effect through December 31, 2022. The CPUC subsequently approved the cost of capital for SDG&E and SoCalGas that became effective on January 1, 2023 and was to remain in effect through December 31, 2025, subject to the CCM. The CCM was triggered for SDG&E and SoCalGas for the measurement period ending September 30, 2023, and in December 2023, the CPUC approved updated authorized rates of return effective January 1, 2024.\nIn October 2023, the CPUC issued a ruling to initiate a second phase of the 2023-2025 cost of capital proceeding to evaluate potential modifications to the CCM. In October 2024, the CPUC issued an FD to modify the CCM. The FD updates the upward or downward adjustment to authorized ROE, if the CCM is triggered, from \n50\n% to \n20\n% of the change in the benchmark rate during the measurement period. The FD adopted this change effective January 1, 2025, reducing both SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ ROE by \n42\n bps to \n10.23\n% and \n10.08\n%, respectively, and allowing SDG&E and SoCalGas to update their respective costs of preferred equity and debt for 2025.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-59\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the cost of capital for SDG&E and SoCalGas.

In December 2024, the FERC issued an order, which SDG&E has appealed, finding that SDG&E is not eligible for the California ISO adder and that the TO5 adder refund provision has been triggered, requiring SDG&E to refund customers the California ISO adder retroactively from June 1, 2019. As a result of the FERC order, SDG&E recorded a charge of $\n120\n million ($\n89\n million after tax) with $\n94\n million in Electric Revenues and $\n26\n million in Other Income, Net, on the SDG&E and Sempra Consolidated Statements of Operations in the year ended December 31, 2024. \nTO6 Filing\nIn June 2024, SDG&E exercised its right to terminate the TO5 settlement. Accordingly, in October 2024, SDG&E submitted its TO6 filing to the FERC, requested to be effective January 1, 2025, and subject to refund. SDG&E’s TO6 filing proposes, among other items, an increase to SDG&E’s currently authorized base ROE from \n10.10\n% to \n11.75\n% plus the California ISO adder, for a total ROE of \n12.25\n%. In December 2024, the FERC accepted SDG&E’s TO6 filing but suspended the effective date to June 1, 2025 and disallowed the inclusion of the California ISO adder, which SDG&E has appealed.\nNOTE 5. \nSEMPRA – INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES\nWe generally account for investments under the equity method when we have significant influence over, but do not have control of, these entities. Equity earnings and losses, both before and net of income tax, are combined and presented as Equity Earnings on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Distributions received from equity method investees are classified in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as either a return on investment in operating activities or a return of investment in investing activities based on the “nature of the distribution” approach. \nOur equity method investments include various domestic and foreign entities. Our domestic equity method investees are typically partnerships that are pass-through entities for income tax purposes and therefore they do not record income tax. Sempra’s income tax on earnings from these equity method investees, other than Oncor Holdings as we discuss below, is included in Income Tax Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Our foreign equity method investees are generally corporations whose operations are taxable on a standalone basis in the countries in which they operate, and we recognize our equity in such income or loss net of investee income tax. See Note 7 for information on how equity earnings and losses before income taxes are factored into the calculations of our pretax income or loss and ETR.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-60\nTable of Contents\nWe provide the carrying values of our investments and earnings on these investments by segment in the following tables. \nEQUITY METHOD AND OTHER INVESTMENTS\n(1) \n(Dollars in millions)\nPercent ownership\nInvestment balance\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nSempra Texas Utilities:\nOncor Holdings\n(2)\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n$\n15,400\n \n$\n14,266\n \nSempra Texas Utilities:\nSharyland Holdings\n(3)\n50\n \n%\n50\n \n%\n$\n122\n \n$\n114\n \nSempra Infrastructure:\n \nCameron LNG JV\n(4)\n50.2\n \n50.2\n \n1,149\n \n1,008\n \nIMG\n(5)\n40\n \n40\n \n723\n \n620\n \nTAG Norte\n(6)\n50\n \n50\n \n539\n \n501\n \nSegment totals\n2,533\n \n2,243\n \nParent and other – Other\n1\n \n1\n \nTotal\n$\n2,534\n \n$\n2,244\n \n(1)\n    All amounts are before NCI, where applicable.\n(2)\n    The carrying value of our equity method investment is $\n2,884\n and $\n2,870\n higher than the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to $\n2,868\n of equity method goodwill and $\n69\n in basis differences in AOCI, offset by $\n53\n and $\n67\n at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, due to a tax sharing liability to TTI under a tax sharing agreement.\n(3)\n    The carrying value of our equity method investment is $\n41\n higher than the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee due to equity method goodwill. \n(4)\n    The carrying value of our equity method investment is $\n257\n and $\n262\n higher than the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, primarily due to guarantees, interest capitalized on the investment prior to the JV commencing its operations, and amortization of guarantee fees and capitalized interest thereafter.\n(5)\n    \nThe carrying value of our equity method investment is $\n5\n higher than the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee due to guarantees.\n(6)\n    The carrying value of our equity method investment is $\n130\n higher than the underlying equity in the net assets of the investee due to equity method goodwill.\nEARNINGS FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\n(1)\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nEARNINGS RECORDED BEFORE INCOME TAX\n(2)\n:\n \n \n \nSempra Texas Utilities:\nSharyland Holdings\n$\n8\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n7\n \nSempra Infrastructure:\n \nCameron LNG JV\n(3)\n576\n \n586\n \n659\n \nSegment totals\n584\n \n593\n \n666\n \nParent and other – RBS Sempra Commodities LLP\n19\n \n40\n \n—\n \n \n603\n \n633\n \n666\n \nEARNINGS RECORDED NET OF INCOME TAX:\n \n \n \nSempra Texas Utilities:\nOncor Holdings\n780\n \n694\n \n735\n \nSempra Infrastructure:\n \n \n \nIMG\n136\n \n40\n \n68\n \nTAG Norte\n90\n \n114\n \n29\n \nSegment totals\n1,006\n \n848\n \n832\n \nTotal\n$\n1,609\n \n$\n1,481\n \n$\n1,498\n \n(1)\n    All amounts are before NCI, where applicable.\n(2)\n    We provide our ETR calculation in Note 7.\n(3)\n    Includes $\n9\n and $\n12\n of basis differences in equity earnings related to AOCI in 2023 and 2022, respectively\n. \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-61\nTable of Contents\nWe provide the contributions to and distributions from our investments by segment in the following tables.\nEXPENDITURES FOR INVESTMENTS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra Texas Utilities:\nOncor Holdings\n$\n972\n \n$\n363\n \n$\n341\n \nSharyland Holdings\n4\n \n4\n \n5\n \n976\n \n367\n \n346\n \nSempra Infrastructure:\nCameron LNG JV\n12\n \n15\n \n30\n \n12\n \n15\n \n30\n \nTotal\n$\n988\n \n$\n382\n \n$\n376\n \nDISTRIBUTIONS FROM INVESTMENTS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra Texas Utilities:\nOncor Holdings\n(1)\n$\n616\n \n$\n441\n \n$\n340\n \nSharyland Holdings\n4\n \n4\n \n5\n \n620\n \n445\n \n345\n \nSempra Infrastructure:\nCameron LNG JV\n453\n \n456\n \n509\n \nIMG\n33\n \n11\n \n—\n \nTAG Norte\n62\n \n36\n \n32\n \n548\n \n503\n \n541\n \nSegment totals\n1,168\n \n948\n \n886\n \nParent and other – RBS Sempra Commodities LLP\n9\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n1,177\n \n$\n948\n \n$\n886\n \n(1)\n    Includes a $\n13\n noncash return on investment in 2024.

Sempra does not control Oncor Holdings or Oncor, and the ring-fencing measures, governance mechanisms and commitments in effect limit our ability to direct the management, policies and operations of Oncor Holdings and Oncor, including the deployment or disposition of their assets, declarations of dividends, strategic planning and other important corporate issues and actions. We also have limited representation on the Oncor Holdings and Oncor boards of directors. \nOncor is a domestic partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and is not included in the consolidated income tax return of Sempra. Rather, only our pretax equity earnings from our investment in Oncor Holdings (a disregarded entity for tax purposes) are included in our consolidated income tax return. A tax sharing agreement with TTI, Oncor Holdings and Oncor provides for the calculation of an income tax liability substantially as if Oncor Holdings and Oncor were taxed as corporations and requires tax payments determined on that basis. While partnerships are not subject to income taxes, in consideration of the tax sharing agreement and Oncor being subject to the provisions of U.S. GAAP governing rate-regulated operations, Oncor recognizes amounts determined under cost-based regulatory rate-setting processes (with such costs including income taxes), as if it were taxed as a corporation. As a result, since Oncor Holdings consolidates Oncor, we recognize equity earnings from our investment in Oncor Holdings net of its recorded income tax.\n \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-62\nTable of Contents\nWe provide summarized income statement and balance sheet information for Oncor Holdings in the following table.\nSUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION – ONCOR HOLDINGS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating revenues\n$\n6,082\n \n$\n5,586\n \n$\n5,243\n \nOperating expenses\n(\n4,318\n)\n(\n4,026\n)\n(\n3,682\n)\nIncome from operations\n1,764\n \n1,560\n \n1,561\n \nInterest expense\n(\n653\n)\n(\n536\n)\n(\n445\n)\nIncome tax expense\n(\n217\n)\n(\n192\n)\n(\n203\n)\nNet income\n957\n \n849\n \n893\n \nNCI held by TTI\n(\n192\n)\n(\n170\n)\n(\n179\n)\nEarnings attributable to Sempra \n(1)\n765\n \n679\n \n714\n \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nCurrent assets\n$\n1,638\n \n$\n1,431\n \nNoncurrent assets\n38,697\n \n34,649\n \nCurrent liabilities\n2,183\n \n1,625\n \nNoncurrent liabilities\n21,958\n \n19,727\n \nNCI held by TTI\n3,689\n \n3,338\n \n(1)    \nExcludes adjustments to equity earnings related to amortization of a tax sharing liability associated with a tax sharing agreement and changes in basis differences in AOCI within the carrying value of our equity method investment.\nSHARYLAND HOLDINGS\n \nWe account for our \n50\n% ownership interest in Sharyland Holdings, a JV with SU Investment Partners, L.P. that owns a \n100\n% interest in Sharyland Utilities, as an equity method investment.\nCAMERON LNG JV\nCameron LNG JV is a JV between Sempra and three project partners, TotalEnergies SE, Mitsui & Co., Ltd., and Japan LNG Investment, LLC, a company jointly owned by Mitsubishi Corporation and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha. We account for SI Partners’ \n50.2\n% investment in Cameron LNG JV under the equity method.\nSempra Promissory Note for SDSRA Distribution\n \nCameron LNG JV’s debt agreements require Cameron LNG JV to maintain the SDSRA, which is an additional reserve account beyond the Senior Debt Service Accrual Account, where funds accumulate from operations to satisfy senior debt obligations due and payable on the next payment date. Both accounts can be funded with cash or authorized investments. In June 2021, Sempra Infrastructure received a distribution of $\n165\n million based on its proportionate share of the SDSRA, for which Sempra provided a promissory note and letters of credit to secure a proportionate share of Cameron LNG JV’s obligation to fund the SDSRA. Sempra’s maximum exposure to loss is replenishment of the amount withdrawn by Sempra Infrastructure from the SDSRA, or $\n165\n million. We recorded a guarantee liability of $\n22\n million in June 2021, with an associated carrying value of $\n18\n million at December 31, 2024, for the fair value of the promissory note, which is being reduced over the duration of the guarantee through Sempra Infrastructure’s investment in Cameron LNG JV. The guarantee will terminate upon full repayment of Cameron LNG JV’s debt, scheduled to occur in 2039, or replenishment of the amount withdrawn by Sempra Infrastructure from the SDSRA.\nSempra Support Agreement for CFIN\nIn July 2020, CFIN entered into a financing arrangement with Cameron LNG JV’s \nfour\n project owners and received aggregate proceeds of $\n1.5\n billion from \ntwo\n project owners and from external lenders on behalf of the other \ntwo\n project owners (collectively, the affiliate loans), based on their proportionate ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV. CFIN used the proceeds from the affiliate loans to provide a loan to Cameron LNG JV. The affiliate loans mature in 2039. Principal and interest are paid from Cameron LNG JV’s project cash flows from its three-train natural gas liquefaction facility. Cameron LNG JV used the proceeds from its loan to return equity to its project owners. \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-63\nTable of Contents\nSempra Infrastructure’s $\n753\n million proportionate share of the affiliate loans, based on SI Partners’ \n50.2\n% ownership interest in Cameron LNG JV, was funded by external lenders comprised of a syndicate of \neight\n banks (the bank debt) to whom Sempra has provided a guarantee pursuant to a Support Agreement under which: \n▪\nSempra has severally guaranteed repayment of the bank debt plus accrued and unpaid interest if CFIN fails to pay the external lenders; \n▪\nthe external lenders may exercise an option to put the bank debt to Sempra Infrastructure upon the occurrence of certain events, including a failure by CFIN to meet its payment obligations under the bank debt; \n▪\nthe external lenders will put some or all of the bank debt to Sempra Infrastructure on the fifth, tenth, or fifteenth anniversary date of the affiliate loans, except the portion of the debt owed to any external lender that has elected not to participate in the put option three months prior to the respective anniversary date;\n▪\nSempra Infrastructure also has a right to call the bank debt back from, or to refinance the bank debt with, the external lenders at any time; and\n▪\nthe Support Agreement will terminate upon full repayment of the bank debt, including repayment following an event in which the bank debt is put to Sempra Infrastructure. \nIn exchange for this guarantee, the external lenders pay a guarantee fee that is based on the credit rating of Sempra’s long-term senior unsecured non-credit enhanced debt rating, which guarantee fee Sempra Infrastructure recognizes as interest income as earned. Sempra’s maximum exposure to loss is the bank debt plus any accrued and unpaid interest and related fees, subject to a liability cap of \n130\n% of the bank debt, or $\n979\n million. We measure the Support Agreement at fair value, net of related guarantee fees, on a recurring basis (see Note 10). At December 31, 2024, the fair value of the Support Agreement was $\n25\n million, of which $\n7\n million is included in Other Current Assets and $\n18\n million is included in Other Long-Term Assets on Sempra’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nIMG \nSI Partners’ has a \n40\n% interest in IMG, a JV with a subsidiary of TC Energy Corporation, and accounts for its interest as an equity method investment. IMG owns and operates the Sur de Texas-Tuxpan natural gas marine pipeline, which is fully contracted under a \n35\n-year natural gas transportation service contract with the CFE.\nTAG NORTE\nSI Partners’ has a \n50\n% beneficial ownership interest in TAG Norte, a JV with TETL JV Mexico Norte, S. de R.L. de C.V. and Bravo N Mergeco, S. de R.L. de C.V. that owns a \n50\n% interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline. SI Partners accounts for its \n50\n% interest in TAG Norte as an equity method investment.\nRBS SEMPRA COMMODITIES LLP\nRBS Sempra Commodities LLP is a United Kingdom limited liability partnership formed by Sempra and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (RBS) in 2008 to own and operate the commodities-marketing businesses previously operated through wholly owned subsidiaries of Sempra. We and RBS sold substantially all of the partnership’s businesses and assets in four separate transactions completed in 2010 and 2011. Since 2011, our investment balance has reflected our share of the remaining partnership assets, including amounts retained by the partnership to help offset unanticipated future general and administrative costs necessary to complete the dissolution of the partnership and the distribution of the partnership’s remaining assets, if any. We accounted for our investment in RBS Sempra Commodities LLP under the equity method.\nIn 2018, we fully impaired our remaining equity method investment in RBS Sempra Commodities LLP. In 2023, we reduced our previously recorded estimate of losses by $\n40\n million based on a settlement that fully resolved legal matters that we discuss in “Legal Proceedings – Other Sempra” in Note 15. In 2024, we substantially completed the dissolution of the partnership, at which time we recorded $\n19\n million ($\n16\n million after tax) in Equity Earnings on Sempra’s Consolidated Statement of Operations. \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-64\nTable of Contents\nSUMMARIZED FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nWe present summarized financial information below, aggregated for all other equity method investments (excluding Oncor Holdings and RBS Sempra Commodities LLP) for the periods in which we were invested in the entities.

No single lender has greater than a \n6\n% share in any facility.\n▪\nSempra’s, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ facilities provide for the issuance of $\n200\n million, $\n100\n million and $\n150\n million, respectively, of letters of credit. Subject to obtaining commitments from existing or new lenders and satisfaction of other specified conditions, Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas each has the right to increase its letter of credit commitment to up to $\n500\n million, $\n250\n million and $\n250\n million, respectively.\n▪\nBorrowings bear interest at a benchmark rate plus a margin that varies with the borrower’s credit rating.\n▪\nEach borrower must maintain a ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization (as defined in each of the applicable credit facilities) of no more than \n65\n% at the end of each quarter. At December 31, 2024, each Registrant was in compliance with this ratio under its respective credit facility.\nSI Partners and IEnova have \nthree\n combined lines of credit, reflected in the table above, that require borrowings to be issued in U.S. dollars only and include the following principal terms:\n▪\nBorrowings on the $\n500\n million revolving credit facility bear interest at a per annum rate equal to term SOFR plus \n80\n bps (including a credit adjustment spread).\n▪\nThe $\n1.0\n billion facility provides for borrowings of up to $\n1.0\n billion through a syndicate of \n12\n lenders available to SI Partners and up to $\n910\n million through a syndicate of \n11\n lenders available to IEnova, subject to a combined borrowing limit of $\n1.0\n billion. This facility: \n◦\nCharges interest on borrowings at a benchmark rate plus a margin that varies with SI Partners’ credit rating (plus a term SOFR credit adjustment spread of \n10\n bps in all tenors).\n◦\nProvides for issuance of up to $\n200\n million of letters of credit, subject to a combined letter of credit commitment of $\n200\n million, which can be issued in U.S. dollars or Mexican pesos, and which reduces available unused credit.\n◦\nIncludes a $\n100\n million swingline loan sub-limit, whereby any outstanding amounts would reduce available unused credit. No swingline loan borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2024.\n◦\nGives either SI Partners or IEnova the right to increase the total facility to $\n1.5\n billion, subject to lender approval, with borrowings of up to $\n1.5\n billion through a syndicate of \n12\n lenders available to SI Partners and up to $\n1,365\n million through a syndicate of \n11\n lenders available to IEnova. \n▪\nBorrowings on the $\n1.5\n billion revolving credit facility, with borrowings of up to $\n1.5\n billion through a syndicate of \n12\n lenders available to SI Partners and up to $\n1,365\n million through a syndicate of \n11\n lenders available to IEnova, subject to a combined borrowing limit of $\n1.5\n billion, bear interest at a per annum rate equal to term SOFR plus \n90\n bps (including a credit adjustment spread).\nAdditionally, the \nthree\n lines of credit that are shared by SI Partners and IEnova require that SI Partners maintain a ratio of consolidated adjusted net indebtedness to consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in each credit facility) of no more than \n5.25\n to 1.00 at the end of each quarter. At December 31, 2024, SI Partners was in compliance with this ratio.\nPort Arthur LNG has a working capital facility agreement, reflected in the table above, that permits borrowings of up to $\n200\n million, which bear interest by reference to term SOFR plus the applicable margin and a credit adjustment spread. The credit facility also provides for the issuance of up to $\n200\n million of letters of credit, which reduces available unused credit.\nUncommitted Line of Credit\nECA LNG Phase 1 has an uncommitted line of credit with an aggregate capacity of $\n100\n million that expires in August 2026.

As a result, changes in the relative size of these items compared to pretax income, from period to period, can cause variations in the ETR. Items subject to flow-through treatment include:\n▪\nrepairs expenditures related to certain utility plant fixed assets\n▪\nthe equity component of AFUDC, which is non-taxable\n▪\ncost of removal related to certain utility plant assets\n▪\nutility self-developed software expenditures\n▪\ndepreciation related to certain utility plant assets\n▪\nstate income taxes\nAFUDC related to equity recorded for regulated construction projects at Sempra Infrastructure has similar flow-through treatment.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-74\nTable of Contents\nWe present in the table below reconciliations of net U.S. statutory federal income tax rates to our ETRs. \nRECONCILIATION OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATES TO EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra:\nU.S. federal statutory income tax rate\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\nValuation allowances\n14\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\nUtility depreciation\n4\n \n3\n \n4\n \nNon-U.S. earnings taxed at rates different from the U.S. statutory income tax rate\n(2)\n1\n \n1\n \n3\n \nState income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit\n1\n \n1\n \n1\n \nOutside basis differences\n—\n \n—\n \n6\n \nRemeasurement of deferred taxes\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n3\n)\nTax credits\n(\n1\n)\n(\n5\n)\n(\n1\n)\nUtility self-developed software expenditures\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \nAllowance for equity funds used during construction\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nAmortization of excess deferred income taxes\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\nResolution of prior years’ income tax items\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nNoncontrolling interests\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \nUtility repairs expenditures\n(\n8\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n5\n)\nForeign exchange and inflation effects\n(1)\n(\n14\n)\n9\n \n9\n \nOther, net\n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nEffective income tax rate\n8\n \n%\n15\n \n%\n28\n \n%\nSDG&E:\nU.S. federal statutory income tax rate\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\nDepreciation\n5\n \n5\n \n3\n \nState income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit\n3\n \n2\n \n4\n \nSelf-developed software expenditures\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \nResolution of prior years’ income tax items\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\nAmortization of excess deferred income taxes\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nTax credits\n(\n1\n)\n(\n16\n)\n—\n \nRepairs expenditures\n(\n9\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n5\n)\nOther, net\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n—\n \nEffective income tax rate\n15\n \n%\n(\n3\n)\n%\n17\n \n%\nSoCalGas:\nU.S. federal statutory income tax rate\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\n21\n \n%\nDepreciation\n5\n \n5\n \n5\n \nNondeductible expenditures\n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \nState income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\n2\n \nAmortization of excess deferred income taxes\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nAllowance for equity funds used during construction\n(\n2\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n2\n)\nSelf-developed software expenditures\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\n—\n \nResolution of prior years’ income tax items\n(\n3\n)\n(\n6\n)\n—\n \nRepairs expenditures\n(\n14\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n6\n)\nOther, net\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n1\n)\nEffective income tax rate\n3\n \n%\n(\n1\n)\n%\n19\n \n%\n(1)\n    \nDue to fluctuation of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.

As of December 31, 2024, it is not reasonably possible this matter could be resolved within the next 12 months. We have included an increase in unrecognized income tax benefits in the reconciliation above.\nIn April 2023, the IRS issued Revenue Procedure 2023-15, which provides a safe harbor method of accounting for gas repairs expenditures. SDG&E and SoCalGas elected this change in tax accounting method in Sempra’s consolidated 2023 income tax return filing and recorded additional income tax benefits of $\n34\n million and $\n97\n million, respectively, in 2023. Additionally, SoCalGas updated its assessment of prior years’ unrecognized income tax benefits and recorded an income tax benefit of $\n43\n million in 2023 for previously unrecognized income tax benefits pertaining to gas repairs expenditures. Sempra elected this change in tax accounting method in its consolidated 2023 income tax return filing.\nSempra, SDG&E, and SoCalGas record regulatory liabilities for benefits that will be flowed through to customers in the future.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-80\nTable of Contents\nIt is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months, unrecognized income tax benefits could decrease due to the following:\nPOSSIBLE DECREASES IN UNRECOGNIZED INCOME TAX BENEFITS WITHIN 12 MONTHS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra:\n \nPotential resolution of audit issues with various U.S. federal, state and local\nand non-U.S. taxing authorities\n$\n15\n \n$\n242\n \n$\n8\n \nSDG&E:\n \nPotential resolution of audit issues with various U.S. federal, state and local\ntaxing authorities\n$\n6\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n6\n \nSoCalGas:\n \nPotential resolution of audit issues with various U.S. federal, state and local\ntaxing authorities\n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \nAmounts accrued for interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits are included in Income Tax Expense (Benefit) on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Sempra accrued $\n15\n million at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and negligible amounts in 2024, $\n2\n million in 2023 and negligible amounts in 2022 on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for interest and penalties. SDG&E and SoCalGas each accrued negligible amounts for interest expense and penalties at December 31, 2024 and 2023 on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and recorded negligible amounts for interest expense and penalties on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.\nINCOME TAX AUDITS\nSempra is subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. We remain subject to examination for U.S. federal tax years after 2020. We are subject to examination by major state tax jurisdictions for tax years after 2012. Certain major non-U.S. income tax returns for tax years 2013 through the present are open to examination.\nSDG&E and SoCalGas are subject to U.S. federal income tax and state income tax. They remain subject to examination for U.S. federal tax years after 2020 and state tax years after 2012.\nIn addition, Sempra has filed protests to contest proposed state audit adjustments for tax years 2009 through 2012. The pre-2013 tax years for our major state tax jurisdictions are closed to new issues; therefore, no additional tax may be assessed by the taxing authorities for these tax years.\nSI Partners has filed an administrative appeal to contest a tax assessment issued by the Servicio de Administración Tributaria for tax year 2016. In 2023, we increased unrecognized income tax benefits in the table above, and will have the opportunity to contest any unresolved issues through the Mexican courts.\nNOTE 8. \nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nFor our employee benefit plans, we:\n▪\nrecognize an asset for a plan’s overfunded status or a liability for a plan’s underfunded status in the balance sheet;\n▪\nmeasure a plan’s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the fiscal year; and\n▪\nrecognize changes in the funded status of pension and PBOP plans in the year in which the changes occur. Generally, those changes are reported in OCI and as a separate component of shareholders’ equity.\nThe detailed information presented below covers the employee benefit plans of primarily Sempra and its consolidated entities.\nSempra has funded and unfunded noncontributory traditional defined benefit and cash balance plans, including separate plans for SDG&E and SoCalGas, which collectively cover all eligible employees. Pension benefits under the traditional defined benefit plans are based on service and final average earnings, while the cash balance plans provide benefits using a career average earnings methodology.\nIEnova has an unfunded noncontributory defined benefit plan covering all employees that provides defined benefits to retirees based on date of hire, years of service and final average earnings.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-81\nTable of Contents\nSempra also has PBOP plans, including separate plans for SDG&E and SoCalGas, which collectively cover all domestic and certain foreign employees. The life insurance plans are both contributory and noncontributory, and the health care plans are contributory. Participants’ contributions are adjusted annually. PBOP plans include medical benefits. \nPension and PBOP costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. We review these assumptions on an annual basis and update them as appropriate. We consider current market conditions, including interest rates, in making these assumptions.\nDEDICATED ASSETS IN SUPPORT OF CERTAIN BENEFITS PLANS\nIn support of its Supplemental Executive Retirement, Cash Balance Restoration and Deferred Compensation Plans, Sempra maintains dedicated assets, including a Rabbi Trust and investments in life insurance contracts, which totaled $\n585\n million and $\n549\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nPENSION AND PBOP PLANS\nOncor\nIn 2024 and 2023, we had $\n34\n million and $\n38\n million, respectively, in AOCI representing an actuarial loss related to Oncor’s pension plans. \nBenefit Obligations and Assets\nThe following three tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ projected benefit obligations and the fair value of assets during 2024 and 2023, and a statement of the funded status at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nPROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION, FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND FUNDED

Plans” and updates to census data.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-83\nTable of Contents\nPension Plans\n▪\nIn 2024, actuarial gains were driven by an increase in discount rates at SoCalGas and SDG&E, offset by updated census data at SoCalGas and SDG&E.\n▪\nIn 2023, actuarial losses were driven by a decrease in discount rates at SoCalGas and SDG&E, an increase in the interest crediting rate for cash balance plans at SDG&E and SoCalGas and updated census data at Sempra and SDG&E. These actuarial losses were partially offset by actuarial gains at SoCalGas due to a change in the rates to convert traditional pension benefits to lump-sums.\nPBOP Plans\n▪\nIn 2024, actuarial gains were driven by an increase in discount rates at SoCalGas, partially offset by an increase in the 2025 expected healthcare costs at SoCalGas.\n▪\nIn 2023, actuarial losses were driven by a decrease in discount rates at SoCalGas and SDG&E.\nNet Assets and Liabilities\nThe assets and liabilities of the pension and PBOP plans are affected by changing market conditions as well as when actual plan experience is different than assumed. Such events result in investment gains and losses, which we defer and recognize in pension and PBOP costs over a period of years. Our funded pension and PBOP plans use the asset smoothing method, except for those at SDG&E. This method develops an asset value that recognizes realized and unrealized investment gains and losses over a three-year period. This adjusted asset value, known as the market-related value of assets, is used in conjunction with an expected long-term rate of return to determine the expected return-on-plan-assets component of net periodic benefit cost. SDG&E does not use the asset smoothing method but rather recognizes realized and unrealized investment gains and losses during the current year.\nThe 10% corridor accounting method is used at Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas. Under the corridor accounting method, if as of the beginning of a year unrecognized net gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market-related value of plan assets, the excess is amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants (or, for plans where participants are substantially inactive employees, the average remaining lifetime of all participants or the period for which benefits will be paid, whichever is shorter). The asset smoothing and 10% corridor accounting methods help mitigate volatility of net periodic benefit costs from year to year.\nDefined benefit pension and PBOP plans with an aggregated overfunded status are recognized as an asset and with an aggregated underfunded status are recognized as a liability; unrecognized changes in these assets and/or liabilities are normally recorded in AOCI on the balance sheet. SDG&E and SoCalGas record regulatory assets and liabilities that offset the funded pension and PBOP plans’ assets or liabilities, as these costs are expected to be recovered in future utility rates based on decisions by regulatory agencies. \nSDG&E and SoCalGas record annual pension and PBOP net periodic benefit costs equal to the contributions to their qualified plans as authorized by the CPUC. The annual contributions to the pension plans are the greater of:\n▪\na minimum required funding amount as required by the IRS;\n▪\nthe amount required to maintain an 85% Adjusted Funding Target Attainment Percentage as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, as amended; or\n▪\nbeginning January 1, 2024 and for the duration of the 2024 GRC cycle, a fixed amount equal to the estimated annual service cost as defined by U.S. GAAP plus one year of a seven-year amortization of the unfunded projected benefit obligation of the pension plan as of January 1, 2024, and limited to an annual amount that keeps the fair value of the pension plan assets from exceeding 110% of the pension benefit obligation of the plan. \nThe annual contributions to PBOP plans are equal to the lesser of the maximum tax-deductible amount or the net periodic benefit cost calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP for pension and PBOP plans but not less than benefits paid directly by the employer (such as benefits paid to key employees). Any differences between booked net periodic benefit cost and amounts contributed to the pension and PBOP plans for SDG&E and SoCalGas are disclosed as regulatory adjustments in accordance with U.S. GAAP for rate-regulated entities.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-84\nTable of Contents\nThe net (liability) asset is included in the following categories on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPENSION AND PBOP OBLIGATIONS, NET OF PLAN ASSETS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nPension\nPBOP\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nSempra:\n \n \n \n \nNoncurrent assets\n$\n6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n507\n \n$\n485\n \nCurrent liabilities\n(\n50\n)\n(\n44\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nNoncurrent liabilities\n(\n160\n)\n(\n399\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n8\n)\nNet recorded (liability) asset\n$\n(\n204\n)\n$\n(\n443\n)\n$\n498\n \n$\n476\n \nSDG&E:\n \n \n \n \nNoncurrent assets\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n10\n \nCurrent liabilities\n(\n7\n)\n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nNoncurrent liabilities\n(\n28\n)\n(\n79\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nNet recorded (liability) asset\n$\n(\n35\n)\n$\n(\n81\n)\n$\n11\n \n$\n10\n \nSoCalGas:\n \n \n \n \nNoncurrent assets\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n486\n \n$\n469\n \nCurrent liabilities\n(\n17\n)\n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nNoncurrent liabilities\n(\n45\n)\n(\n231\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nNet recorded (liability) asset\n$\n(\n62\n)\n$\n(\n233\n)\n$\n486\n \n$\n469\n \nAmounts recorded in AOCI, net of income tax effects and amounts recorded as regulatory assets, are as follows.\nAMOUNTS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\n(Dollars in millions)\nPension\nPBOP\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nSempra:\n \n \n \n \nNet actuarial (loss) gain\n$\n(\n120\n)\n$\n(\n124\n)\n$\n14\n \n$\n13\n \nPrior service cost\n(\n9\n)\n(\n6\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n(\n129\n)\n$\n(\n130\n)\n$\n14\n \n$\n13\n \nSDG&E:\n \n \n \n \nNet actuarial loss\n$\n(\n12\n)\n$\n(\n8\n)\n \n \nTotal\n$\n(\n12\n)\n$\n(\n8\n)\nSoCalGas:\n \n \n \n \nNet actuarial loss\n$\n(\n14\n)\n$\n(\n10\n)\n \n \nPrior service cost\n(\n3\n)\n(\n2\n)\n \n \nTotal\n$\n(\n17\n)\n$\n(\n12\n)\n \n \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-85\nTable of Contents\nSempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas each have a funded pension plan. \nThe following table shows the obligations of funded pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.\nOBLIGATIONS OF FUNDED PENSION PLANS\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nSempra:\n \n \nProjected benefit obligation\n$\n2,752\n \n$\n2,925\n \nAccumulated benefit obligation\n2,542\n \n2,712\n \nFair value of plan assets\n2,724\n \n2,664\n \nSDG&E:\nProjected benefit obligation\n$\n793\n \n$\n781\n \nAccumulated benefit obligation\n755\n \n746\n \nFair value of plan assets\n787\n \n726\n \nSoCalGas:\n \n \nProjected benefit obligation\n$\n1,959\n \n$\n1,944\n \nAccumulated benefit obligation\n1,787\n \n1,771\n \nFair value of plan assets\n1,937\n \n1,744\n \nWe also have unfunded pension plans at Sempra, SDG&E, SoCalGas and IEnova.

This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flows to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of corporate bonds with a Bloomberg Composite of AA or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plans’ projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected. \nWe develop the discount rate assumptions for the plans at IEnova by constructing a synthetic government zero coupon bond yield curve from the available market data, based on duration matching, and we add a risk spread to allow for the yields of high-quality corporate bonds. Such method is required when there is no deep market for high quality corporate bonds.\nExpected return on plan assets is based on the weighted average of the plans’ target investment allocation as of the measurement date and the expected returns for those asset types.\nInterest crediting rate is based on an average 30-year Treasury bond from the month of November of the preceding year.\nWe amortize prior service cost using straight line amortization over average future service (or average expected lifetime for plans where participants are substantially inactive employees), which is an alternative method allowed under U.S. GAAP.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-88\nTable of Contents\nThe significant assumptions affecting projected benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost are as follows:\nWEIGHTED-AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION\n \nPension\nPBOP\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nSempra:\n \n \n \n \nDiscount rate\n5.74\n \n%\n5.31\n \n%\n5.75\n \n%\n5.34\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate\n(1)(2)\n4.54\n \n4.66\n \n4.54\n \n4.66\n \nRate of compensation increase\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\nSDG&E:\n \n \n \n \nDiscount rate\n5.75\n \n%\n5.30\n \n%\n5.75\n \n%\n5.30\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate\n(1)(2)\n4.54\n \n4.66\n \n4.54\n \n4.66\n \nRate of compensation increase\n3.50\n-\n10.00\n3.50\n-\n10.00\n3.50\n-\n10.00\n3.50\n-\n10.00\nSoCalGas:\n \n \n \n \nDiscount rate\n5.70\n \n%\n5.25\n \n%\n5.75\n \n%\n5.35\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate\n(1)(2)\n4.54\n \n4.66\n \n4.54\n \n4.66\n \nRate of compensation increase\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n(1)\n    Interest crediting rate for pension benefits applies only to funded cash balance plans.\n(2)    \nInterest crediting rate for PBOP applies only to interest bearing health retirement accounts at SDG&E and SoCalGas.\nWEIGHTED-AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST\n \nPension\nPBOP\nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscount rate\n5.31\n \n%\n5.63\n \n%\n3.04\n \n%\n5.34\n \n%\n5.65\n \n%\n3.04\n \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n6.56\n \n6.48\n \n6.27\n \n5.90\n \n5.51\n \n4.77\n \nInterest crediting rate\n(1)(2)\n4.66\n \n3.99\n \n1.94\n \n4.66\n \n3.99\n \n1.94\n \nRate of compensation increase\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\nSDG&E:\n \n \n \n \nDiscount rate\n5.30\n \n%\n5.60\n \n%\n2.99\n \n%\n5.30\n \n%\n5.65\n \n%\n3.05\n \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n6.25\n \n6.00\n \n5.50\n \n5.88\n \n5.52\n \n4.80\n \nInterest crediting rate\n(1)(2)\n4.66\n \n3.99\n \n1.94\n \n4.66\n \n3.99\n \n1.94\n \nRate of compensation increase\n3.50\n-\n10.00\n3.50\n-\n10.00\n3.50\n-\n10.00\n3.50\n-\n10.00\n3.50\n-\n10.00\n3.50\n-\n10.00\nSoCalGas:\n \n \n \n \nDiscount rate\n5.25\n \n%\n5.60\n \n%\n3.04\n \n%\n5.35\n \n%\n5.65\n \n%\n3.05\n \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n6.75\n \n6.75\n \n6.75\n \n5.86\n \n5.47\n \n4.71\n \nInterest crediting rate\n(1)(2)\n4.66\n \n3.99\n \n1.94\n \n4.66\n \n3.99\n \n1.94\n \nRate of compensation increase\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n2.70\n-\n10.00\n(1)    \nInterest crediting rate for pension benefits applies only to funded cash balance plans.\n(2)    \nInterest crediting rate for PBOP applies only to interest bearing health retirement accounts at SDG&E and SoCalGas.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-89\nTable of Contents\nHealth Care Cost Trend Rates\nAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts that Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas report for the health care plan costs.

We maintain additional trusts, as we discuss below, for certain of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ PBOP plans. Other than through indexing and certain collective investment strategies, the trusts do not invest in securities of Sempra.\nThe current asset allocation objective for the pension master trust is to protect the funded status of the plans while generating sufficient returns to cover future benefit payments and accruals. A portion of the pension master trust is invested in accordance with plan specific de-risking glidepaths designed to reduce the assets’ exposure to risk as the plans become better funded. We assess the portfolio performance by comparing actual returns with relevant benchmarks.\n \nThe target asset allocations for Sempra’s pension plans are between return-seeking assets (i.e., generally, equity securities, diversified real assets, high-yield fixed income securities and other instruments with a similar risk profile) and risk-mitigating assets (i.e., generally, government and corporate fixed income securities) as follows:\nTARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS FOR PENSION PLANS \n(Dollars in millions)\nSempra\nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\nReturn-seeking assets\n34\n \n%\n42\n \n%\n49\n \n%\nRisk-mitigating assets\n66\n \n%\n58\n \n%\n51\n \n%\nWe maintain asset allocations at strategic levels within reasonable bands of variance. The asset allocations are reviewed by our Plan Funding Committee and our Pension and Benefits Investment Committee (the Committees) on a regular basis to help ensure that plan assets are positioned to meet plan obligations. When evaluating strategic asset allocations, the Committees consider many variables, including:\n▪\nlong-term cost\n▪\nvariability and level of contributions\n▪\nfunded status\n▪\na range of expected outcomes over varying confidence levels\nIn accordance with the Sempra pension investment guidelines, derivative financial instruments may be used by the pension master trust’s equity and fixed income portfolio investment managers to equitize cash, hedge certain exposures, and as substitutes for certain types of fixed income securities.\nRate of Return Assumption\nThe expected return on plan assets in our pension and PBOP plans is based on the weighted average of the plans’ target investment allocations to specific asset classes as of the measurement date. We expect a return of between \n4\n% and \n12\n% on return-seeking assets and between \n2\n% and \n6\n% for risk-mitigating assets. Certain trusts that hold assets for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ PBOP plans are subject to taxation, which impacts the expected after-tax return on plan assets.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-90\nTable of Contents\nConcentration of Risk\nPlan assets are diversified across global equity and bond markets, and concentration of risk in any one economic, industry, maturity or geographic sector is limited.\nInvestment Strategy for Sempra’s, SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ PBOP Plans\nSempra’s PBOP plan is funded by cash contributions from Sempra. SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ PBOP plans are funded by cash contributions from SDG&E and SoCalGas and their current retirees. The assets of these plans are placed into the pension master trust and other Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trusts. Specific target asset allocations are periodically reviewed to help ensure that plan assets are positioned to meet plan obligations.\n \nThe target asset allocations for the PBOP plans are between return-seeking assets and risk-mitigating assets as follows:\nTARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS FOR PBOP PLANS\n(Dollars in millions)\nSempra\nSDG&E and SoCalGas\nAssets held in pension master trust\nAssets held in pension master trust \nAssets held in Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association trusts\nReturn-seeking assets\n74\n \n%\n38\n \n%\n30\n \n%\nRisk-mitigating assets\n26\n \n%\n62\n \n%\n70\n \n%\nFair Value of Pension and PBOP Plan Assets\nWe classify the investments in Sempra’s pension master trust and the trusts for SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ PBOP plans based on the fair value hierarchy, except for certain investments measured using NAV as a practical expedient for fair value.\nThe following are descriptions of the valuation methods and assumptions we use to estimate the fair values of investments held by pension and PBOP plan trusts.\nEquity Securities\n – Equity securities are valued using quoted prices listed on nationally recognized securities exchanges.\nRegistered Investment Companies\n – Investments in mutual funds sponsored by a registered investment company are valued based on exchange listed prices. Where the value is a quoted price in an active market, the investment is classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Other investments are valued under a discounted cash flow approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks. \nFixed Income Securities\n – Certain fixed income securities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the security is traded. Other fixed income securities are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings. When quoted prices are not available for identical or similar securities, the security is valued under a discounted cash flow approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable, such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain high yield fixed-income securities are valued by applying a price adjustment to the bid side to calculate a mean and ask value. Adjustments can vary based on maturity, credit standing, and reported trade frequencies. The bid to ask spread is determined by the investment manager based on the review of the available market information.\nCommon/Collective Trusts\n – Investments in common/collective trust funds are valued based on the NAV of units owned, which is based on the current fair value of the funds’ underlying assets.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n – Futures contracts that are publicly traded in active markets are valued at closing prices as of the last business day of the year. Forward currency contracts are valued at the prevailing forward exchange rate of the underlying currencies, and unrealized gain (loss) is recorded daily. Fixed income futures and options are marked to market daily. Equity index futures contracts are valued at the last sales price quoted on the exchange on which they primarily trade.\nWhile management believes the valuation methods described above are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nWe provide more discussion of fair value measurements in Notes 1 and 10. The following tables set forth by level within the fair value hierarchy a summary of the investments in our pension and PBOP plan trusts measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\n2024 Form 10-K  |

Our principal exposures are commodity market risk, benchmark interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate exposures. Our use of derivatives for these risks is integrated into the economic management of our anticipated revenues, anticipated expenses, assets and liabilities. Derivatives may be effective in mitigating these risks (1) that could lead to declines in anticipated revenues or increases in anticipated expenses, or (2) that could cause our asset values to fall or our liabilities to increase. Accordingly, our derivative activity summarized below generally represents an impact that is intended to offset associated revenues, expenses, assets or liabilities that are not included in the tables below.\nIn certain cases, we apply the normal purchase or sale exception to contracts that otherwise would have been accounted for as derivative instruments and have other commodity contracts that are not derivatives. These contracts are not recorded at fair value and are therefore excluded from the disclosures below.\nIn all other cases, we record derivatives at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We may have derivatives that are (1) cash flow hedges, (2) fair value hedges, or (3) undesignated. Depending on the applicability of hedge accounting and, for SDG&E and SoCalGas and other operations subject to regulatory accounting, the requirement to pass impacts through to customers, the impact of derivative instruments may be offset in OCI (cash flow hedges), on the balance sheet (regulatory offsets), or recognized in earnings (fair value hedges and undesignated derivatives not subject to rate recovery). We classify cash flows from the (1) principal settlements of cross-currency swaps that hedge exposure related to Mexican peso-denominated debt and amounts related to terminations or early settlements of interest rate swaps as financing activities, (2) principal settlements of interest rate swaps associated with capitalized interest costs incurred to finance capital projects as investing activities, and (3) settlements of other derivative instruments as operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nHEDGE ACCOUNTING\nWe may designate a derivative as a cash flow hedging instrument if it effectively converts anticipated cash flows associated with revenues or expenses to a fixed dollar amount. We may utilize cash flow hedge accounting for derivative commodity instruments, foreign currency instruments and interest rate instruments. Designating cash flow hedges is dependent on the business context in which the instrument is being used, the effectiveness of the instrument in offsetting the risk of variability of future cash flows of a given revenue or expense item, and other criteria.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-99\nTable of Contents\nENERGY DERIVATIVES\nOur market risk is primarily related to natural gas and electricity price volatility and the specific physical locations where we transact. We use energy derivatives to manage these risks. The use of energy derivatives in our various businesses depends on the particular energy market, and the operating and regulatory environments applicable to the business, as follows:\n▪\nSDG&E and SoCalGas use natural gas derivatives and SDG&E uses electricity derivatives, for the benefit of customers, with the objective of managing price risk and basis risk, and stabilizing and lowering natural gas and electricity costs. These derivatives include fixed-price natural gas and electricity positions, options, and basis risk instruments, which are either exchange-traded or over-the-counter financial instruments, or bilateral physical transactions. This activity is governed by risk management and transacting activity plans limited by company policy. SDG&E’s risk management and transacting activity plans for electricity derivatives are also required to be filed with, and have been approved by, the CPUC. SoCalGas is also subject to certain regulatory requirements and thresholds related to natural gas procurement under the GCIM. Natural gas and electricity derivative activities are recorded as commodity costs that are offset by regulatory account balances and are recovered in rates. Net commodity cost impacts on the Consolidated Statements of Operations are reflected in Cost of Natural Gas or in Cost of Electric Fuel and Purchased Power.\n▪\nSDG&E is allocated and may purchase CRRs, which serve to reduce the regional electricity price volatility risk that may result from local transmission capacity constraints. Unrealized gains and losses do not impact earnings, as they are offset by regulatory account balances. Realized gains and losses associated with CRRs, which are recoverable in rates, are recorded in Cost of Electric Fuel and Purchased Power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n▪\nSempra Infrastructure may use natural gas and electricity derivatives, as appropriate, in an effort to optimize the earnings of its assets which support the following businesses: LNG, natural gas pipelines and storage, and power generation. Gains and losses associated with undesignated derivatives are recognized in Energy-Related Businesses Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n▪\nFrom time to time, our various businesses, including SDG&E and SoCalGas, may use other derivatives to hedge exposures such as GHG allowances.\nThe following table summarizes net energy derivative volumes.\nNET ENERGY DERIVATIVE VOLUMES\n(Quantities in millions)\n \nDecember 31,\nCommodity\nUnit of measure\n2024\n2023\nSempra:\nNatural gas\nMMBtu\n637\n \n361\n \nElectricity\nMWh\n—\n \n1\n \nCongestion revenue rights\nMWh\n27\n \n36\n \nSDG&E:\nNatural gas\nMMBtu\n16\n \n17\n \nCongestion revenue rights\nMWh\n27\n \n36\n \nSoCalGas:\nNatural gas\nMMBtu\n347\n \n268\n \nINTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES\nWe are exposed to interest rates primarily as a result of our current and expected use of financing. SDG&E and SoCalGas, as well as Sempra and its other subsidiaries and JVs, periodically enter into interest rate derivative agreements intended to moderate our exposure to interest rates and to lower our overall costs of borrowing. In addition, we may utilize interest rate swaps, typically designated as cash flow hedges, to lock in interest rates on outstanding debt or in anticipation of future financings.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-100\nTable of Contents\nIn March 2023, Port Arthur LNG entered into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps maturing in 2048, which were designated as cash flow hedges. On September 30, 2024, Port Arthur LNG voluntarily de-designated those interest rate swaps that begin hedging interest payments in March 2026 to provide for future financing flexibility. At the time of de-designation, $\n40\n million of deferred gains related to the de-designated notional amount were included in AOCI, which will remain in AOCI until the hedged interest payments impact net income or such hedged interest payments become probable of not occurring. In October 2024, Port Arthur LNG received a cash settlement of $\n46\n million, net of transaction costs, for the termination of $\n1.0\n billion of the notional amount of both the designated and de-designated interest rate swaps, with the associated deferred gains remaining in AOCI. On December 31, 2024, Port Arthur LNG voluntarily de-designated the remaining interest rate swaps, which are currently hedging interest payments until March 2026. At the time of de-designation, $\n37\n million of deferred gains related to the de-designated notional amount were included in AOCI, which will remain in AOCI until either the hedged interest payments impact net income or such hedged interest payments become probable of not occurring.\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of our interest rate derivatives, excluding those in our equity method investments.\nINTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nNotional amount\nMaturities\nNotional amount\nMaturities\nSempra:\n \n \n \n \nCash flow hedges\n(1)\n$\n271\n \n2025-2034\n$\n4,451\n \n2024-2048\nUndesignated derivatives\n3,189\n \n2025-2048\n—\n \n— \n(1)\n    At December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash flow hedges accrued interest based on a notional amount of $\n271\n and $\n488\n, respectively.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES\nWe may utilize cross-currency swaps to hedge exposure related to Mexican peso-denominated debt at our Mexican subsidiaries and JVs. These cash flow hedges exchange our Mexican peso-denominated principal and interest payments into the U.S. dollar and swap Mexican fixed interest rates for U.S. fixed interest rates. From time to time, Sempra Infrastructure and its JVs may use other foreign currency derivatives to hedge exposures related to cash flows associated with revenues from contracts denominated in Mexican pesos that are indexed to the U.S. dollar.\nIn May 2024, Oncor entered into cross-currency swaps designated as fair value hedges intended to offset foreign currency exchange rate risk related to its Euro-denominated debt.\nWe are also exposed to exchange rate movements at our Mexican subsidiaries and JVs, which have U.S. dollar-denominated cash balances, receivables, payables and debt (monetary assets and liabilities) that give rise to Mexican currency exchange rate movements for Mexican income tax purposes. They also have deferred income tax assets and liabilities denominated in the Mexican peso, which must be translated to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. In addition, monetary assets and liabilities and certain nonmonetary assets and liabilities are adjusted for Mexican inflation for Mexican income tax purposes. We may utilize foreign currency derivatives as a means to manage the risk of exposure to significant fluctuations in our income tax expense and equity earnings from these impacts; however, we generally do not hedge our deferred income tax assets and liabilities or for inflation.\nThe following table presents the notional amounts of our foreign currency derivatives, excluding those in our equity method investments.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVES\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nNotional amount\nMaturities\nNotional amount\nMaturities\nSempra:\n \n \n \n \nForeign currency derivatives\n$\n162\n \n2025-2026\n$\n176\n \n2024-2025\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-101\nTable of Contents\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheets reflect the offsetting of net derivative positions and cash collateral with the same counterparty when a legal right of offset exists. \nThe following tables provide the fair values of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, including the amount of cash collateral receivables that were not offset because the cash collateral was in excess of liability positions.

NCI) related to cash flow hedges will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged items affect earnings. SoCalGas expects that $\n1\n million of losses, net of income tax benefit, that are currently recorded in AOCI related to cash flow hedges will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months as the hedged items affect earnings. Actual amounts ultimately reclassified into earnings depend on the interest rates in effect when derivative contracts mature.\nAt December 31, 2024, \nt\nhe maximum length of time over which Sempra is hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions, excluding those forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments, is approximately \none\n year.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-104\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the effects of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nUNDESIGNATED DERIVATIVE IMPACTS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \n \nPretax gain (loss) on derivatives recognized in earnings\n \n \nYears ended December 31,\nLocation\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra:\n \n \n \n \nCommodity contracts not subject\nto rate recovery\nRevenues: Energy-related\nbusinesses\n$\n223\n \n$\n919\n \n$\n(\n1,116\n)\nCommodity contracts subject\nto rate recovery\nCost of natural gas\n(\n56\n)\n(\n288\n)\n(\n56\n)\nCommodity contracts subject\nto rate recovery\nCost of electric fuel\nand purchased power\n(\n41\n)\n15\n \n202\n \nInterest rate instruments\nInterest expense\n243\n \n(\n47\n)\n33\n \nTotal\n \n$\n369\n \n$\n599\n \n$\n(\n937\n)\nSDG&E:\n \n \n \n \nCommodity contracts subject\nto rate recovery\nCost of electric fuel\nand purchased power\n$\n(\n41\n)\n$\n15\n \n$\n202\n \nSoCalGas:\n \n \n \n \nCommodity contracts subject\nto rate recovery\nCost of natural gas\n$\n(\n56\n)\n$\n(\n288\n)\n$\n(\n56\n)\nCREDIT RISK RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES\nFor Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas, certain of our derivative instruments contain credit limits which vary depending on our credit ratings. Generally, these provisions, if applicable, may reduce our credit limit if a specified credit rating agency reduces our ratings. In certain cases, if our credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, the counterparty to these derivative liability instruments could request immediate payment or demand immediate and ongoing full collateralization.\nFor Sempra, the total fair value of this group of derivative instruments in a liability position at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n122\n million and $\n215\n million, respectively. For SoCalGas, the total fair value of this group of derivative instruments in a liability position at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n42\n million and $\n210\n million, respectively. SDG&E had a negligible amount of derivative instruments in a liability position at December 31, 2024 and no such instruments at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, if the credit ratings of Sempra or SoCalGas were reduced below investment grade, $\n120\n million and $\n42\n million, respectively, of additional assets could be required to be posted as collateral for these derivative contracts.\nFor Sempra, SDG&E and SoCalGas, some of our derivative contracts contain a provision that would permit the counterparty, in certain circumstances, to request adequate assurance of our performance under the contracts. Such additional assurance, if needed, is not material and is not included in the amounts above.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-105\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 10. \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASURES\nThe tables below set forth our financial assets and liabilities, by level within the fair value hierarchy, that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nWe classify financial assets and liabilities in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair-valued assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy.\nThe determination of fair values, shown in the tables below, incorporates various factors, including but not limited to, the credit standing of the counterparties involved and the impact of credit enhancements (such as cash deposits, letters of credit and priority interests).\nOur financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis in the tables below include the following:\n▪\nNuclear decommissioning trusts reflect the assets of SDG&E’s NDT, excluding accounts receivable and accounts payable. A third-party trustee values the trust assets using prices from a pricing service based on a market approach. We validate these prices by comparison to prices from other independent data sources. Securities are valued using quoted prices listed on nationally recognized securities exchanges or based on closing prices reported in the active market in which the identical security is traded (Level 1). Other securities are valued based on yields that are currently available for comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings (Level 2).\n▪\nFor commodity contracts, interest rate instruments and foreign exchange instruments, we primarily use a market or income approach with market participant assumptions to value these derivatives. Market participant assumptions include those about risk, and the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation techniques. These inputs can be readily observable, market corroborated, or generally unobservable. We have exchange-traded derivatives that are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for the identical instruments (Level 1). We also may have other commodity derivatives that are valued using industry standard models that consider quoted forward prices for commodities, time value, current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments, volatility factors, and other relevant economic measures (Level 2). Level 3 recurring items relate to CRRs and, until December 31, 2022, fixed-price electricity positions, at SDG&E, as we discuss below in “Level 3 Information – SDG&E.” We further discuss derivative assets and liabilities in Note 9.\n▪\nRabbi Trust investments include short-term investments that consist of money market and mutual funds that we value using a market approach based on closing prices reported in the active market in which the identical security is traded (Level 1).\n▪\nAs we discuss in Note 5, in July 2020, Sempra entered into a Support Agreement for the benefit of CFIN. We measure the Support Agreement, which includes a guarantee obligation, a put option and a call option, net of related guarantee fees, at fair value on a recurring basis. We use a discounted cash flow model to value the Support Agreement, net of related guarantee fees. Because some of the inputs that are significant to the valuation are less observable, the Support Agreement is classified as Level 3, as we describe below in “Level 3 Information – Other Sempra.”\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-106\nTable of Contents\nRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASURES\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nFair value at December 31, 2024\n \nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel

the fair value of CRRs and fixed-price electricity positions are reviewed and compared with market conditions to determine reasonableness.\nCRRs are recorded at fair value based almost entirely on the most current auction prices published by the California ISO, an objective source. Annual auction prices are published once a year, typically in the middle of November, and are the basis for valuing CRRs settling in the following year. \nFor the CRRs settling from January 1 to December 31, the auction price inputs, at a given location, were in the following ranges for the years indicated below:\nCONGESTION REVENUE RIGHTS AUCTION PRICE INPUTS\nSettlement year\nPrice per MWh\nMedian price per MWh\n2025\n$\n(\n7.38\n)\nto\n$\n15.54\n \n$\n0.01\n \n2024\n(\n3.69\n)\nto\n9.55\n \n(\n0.44\n)\n2023\n(\n3.09\n)\nto\n10.71\n \n(\n0.56\n)\nThe impact associated with discounting is not significant. Because these auction prices are a less observable input, these instruments are classified as Level 3. The fair value of these instruments is derived from auction price differences between two locations. Positive values between two locations represent expected future reductions in congestion costs, whereas negative values between two locations represent expected future charges. Valuation of our CRRs is sensitive to a change in auction price. If auction prices at one location increase (decrease) relative to another location, this could result in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. We summarize CRR volumes in Note 9.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-109\nTable of Contents\nLong-term, fixed-price electricity positions in 2022 that were valued using significant unobservable data were classified as Level 3 because the contract terms related to a delivery location or tenor for which observable market rate information was not available. The fair value of the net electricity positions classified as Level 3 was derived from a discounted cash flow model using market electricity forward price inputs. The range and weighted-average price of these inputs at December 31, 2022 were $\n33.45\n to $\n274.70\n and $\n85.64\n, respectively.\nRealized gains and losses associated with CRRs and long-term, fixed-price electricity positions, which are recoverable in rates, are recorded in Cost of Electric Fuel and Purchased Power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because unrealized gains and losses are recorded as regulatory assets and liabilities, they do not affect earnings.\nOther Sempra \nThe table below sets forth reconciliations of changes in the fair value of Sempra’s Support Agreement for the benefit of CFIN classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nLEVEL 3 RECONCILIATIONS\n(Dollars in millions)\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at January 1\n$\n23\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n7\n \nRealized and unrealized gains (losses), net\n(1)\n11\n \n15\n \n19\n \nSettlements\n(\n9\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n9\n)\nBalance at December 31\n(2)\n$\n25\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n17\n \nChange in unrealized gains relating to instruments still held at December 31\n$\n8\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n18\n \n(1)\n    Net gains are included in Interest Income and net losses are included in Interest Expense on Sempra’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(2)\n    Balance at December 31, 2024 and 2023 includes $\n7\n in Other Current Assets, and $\n18\n and $\n16\n, respectively, in Other Long-Term Assets on Sempra’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe fair value of the Support Agreement, net of related guarantee fees, is based on a discounted cash flow model using a probability of default and survival methodology. Our estimate of fair value considers inputs such as third-party default rates, credit ratings, recovery rates, and risk-adjusted discount rates, which may be readily observable, market corroborated or generally unobservable inputs. Because CFIN’s credit rating and related default and survival rates are unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation, the Support Agreement, net of related guarantee fees, is classified as Level 3. We assigned CFIN an internally developed credit rating of A3 and relied on default rate data published by Moody’s to assign a probability of default. A hypothetical change in the credit rating up or down one notch could result in a significant change in the fair value of the Support Agreement.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-110\nTable of Contents\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe fair values of certain of our financial instruments (cash, current and noncurrent accounts receivable, amounts due to/from unconsolidated affiliates with original maturities of less than 90 days, dividends and accounts payable due in one year or less, short-term debt and customer deposits) approximate their carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these instruments.

At December 31, 2024 and 2023, SDG&E had \nno\n preferred stock outstanding. The rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions for any new series of preferred stock would be established by each company’s board of directors at the time of issuance. We discuss SoCalGas preferred stock below.\nOn May 2, 2024, Sempra filed an amendment to its amended and restated articles of incorporation to implement the revocation of the series A preferred stock and series B preferred stock, all of which had previously been converted to Sempra common stock, thereby decreasing the number of authorized shares of series A preferred stock from \n17,250,000\n to \nzero\n and series B preferred stock from \n5,750,000\n to \nzero\n. Effective as of May 2, 2024, each such series of stock is no longer an authorized series of Sempra’s capital stock. \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-111\nTable of Contents\nSEMPRA SERIES C PREFERRED STOCK\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, Sempra had \n900,000\n shares of \n4.875\n% fixed-rate reset cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock, series C (series C preferred stock) outstanding.\nLiquidation Preference\nEach share of series C preferred stock has a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\n plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) on such share.\nRedemption at the Option of Sempra\nThe shares of series C preferred stock are perpetual and have no maturity date. However, we may, at our option, redeem the series C preferred stock in whole or in part, from time to time, on any day during the period from and including the July 15 immediately preceding October 15, 2025 and October 15 of every fifth year after 2025 through and including such October 15 at a redemption price in cash equal to $\n1,000\n per share. Additionally, in the event that a credit rating agency then publishing a rating for us makes certain amendments, clarifications or changes to the criteria it uses to assign equity credit to securities such as the series C preferred stock (Ratings Event), we may redeem the series C preferred stock, in whole but not in part, at any time within 120 days after the conclusion of any review or appeal process instituted by us following the occurrence of the Ratings Event or, if no such review or appeal process is available or sought, the occurrence of such Ratings Event, at a redemption price in cash equal to $\n1,020\n per share (\n102\n% of the liquidation preference per share).\nDividends\nDividends on the series C preferred stock, when, as and if declared by our board of directors or an authorized committee thereof, are payable in cash, on a cumulative basis, semi-annually in arrears. Dividends on the series C preferred stock will be cumulative whether or not:\n▪\nwe have earnings;\n▪\nthe payment of such dividends is then permitted under California law;\n▪\nsuch dividends are authorized or declared; and\n▪\nany agreements to which we are a party prohibit the current payment of dividends, including any agreement relating to our indebtedness.\nWe accrue dividends on the series C preferred stock on a monthly basis. The dividend rate from and including June 19, 2020 to, but excluding, October 15, 2025 is \n4.875\n% per annum of the $\n1,000\n liquidation preference per share. The dividend rate will reset on October 15, 2025 and on October 15 of every fifth year after 2025 and, for each five-year period following such reset dates, will be a per annum rate equal to the Five-year U.S. Treasury Rate (as defined in the certificate of determination of preferences of the series C preferred stock) as of the second business day prior to such reset date, plus a spread of \n4.550\n%, of the $\n1,000\n liquidation preference per share.\nVoting Rights\nThe holders of series C preferred stock do not have any voting rights, except with respect to any authorization, creation or increase in the authorized amount of any class or series of capital stock ranking senior to the series C preferred stock, certain amendments to the terms of the series C preferred stock, in certain other limited circumstances and as otherwise specifically required by California law. In addition, whenever dividends on any shares of series C preferred stock have not been declared and paid or have been declared but not paid for three or more dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the authorized number of directors on our board of directors will automatically be increased by two and the holders of the series C preferred stock, voting together as a single class with holders of any and all other outstanding series of preferred stock of equal rank having similar voting rights, will be entitled to elect two directors who satisfy certain requirements to fill such two newly created directorships. This voting right will terminate when all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the series C preferred stock have been paid in full and, upon such termination and the termination of the same voting rights of all other holders of outstanding series of preferred stock that have such voting rights, the term of office of each director elected pursuant to such rights will terminate and the authorized number of directors will automatically decrease by two, subject to the revesting of such rights in the event of each subsequent nonpayment. \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-112\nTable of Contents\nRanking\nThe series C preferred stock ranks, with respect to dividend rights and distribution rights upon our liquidation, winding-up or dissolution:\n▪\nsenior to our common stock and each other class or series of our capital stock established in the future, unless the terms of such capital stock expressly provide otherwise;\n▪\non parity with each class or series of our capital stock established in the future, if the terms of such capital stock provide that it ranks on parity with the series C preferred stock;\n▪\njunior to each class or series of our capital stock established in the future, if the terms of such capital stock provide that it ranks senior to the series C preferred stock;\n▪\njunior to our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities; and\n▪\nstructurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries and capital stock of our subsidiaries held by third parties.\nSOCALGAS PREFERRED STOCK\nSoCalGas is authorized to issue up to an aggregate of \n11,000,000\n shares of preferred stock, series preferred stock and preference stock. \nThe table below presents preferred stock outstanding at SoCalGas: \nPREFERRED STOCK OUTSTANDING\n(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n$\n25\n par value, authorized \n1,000,000\n shares:\n6\n% Series, \n79,011\n shares outstanding\n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \n6\n% Series A, \n783,032\n shares outstanding\n19\n \n19\n \nSoCalGas - Total preferred stock\n22\n \n22\n \nLess: \n50,970\n shares of the \n6\n% Series outstanding owned by Pacific Enterprises\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nSempra - Total preferred stock of subsidiary\n$\n20\n \n$\n20\n \nNone of SoCalGas’ outstanding preferred stock is callable, and no shares are subject to mandatory redemption.\nAll outstanding shares have \none\n vote per share, cumulative preferences as to dividends and liquidation preferences of $\n25\n per share plus any unpaid dividends.\nIn addition to the outstanding preferred stock above, SoCalGas’ articles of incorporation authorize \n5,000,000\n shares of series preferred stock and \n5,000,000\n shares of preference stock, both without par value and with cumulative preferences as to dividends and liquidation value. The preference stock would rank junior to all series of preferred stock and series preferred stock. Other rights and privileges of any new series of such stock would be established by the SoCalGas board of directors at the time of issuance.\nThe preferred stock at SoCalGas is presented at Sempra as NCI.

The shares may be offered and sold in amounts and at times to be determined by us from time to time. The agents will be entitled to a commission that will not exceed \n1.0\n% of the gross sales price of all shares sold through it as agent pursuant to the Sales Agreement. \nUnder the ATM program, we may enter into separate forward sale agreements with affiliates of the agents as forward purchasers. We expect to fully physically settle each forward sale agreement, if any. However, we will generally have the right, subject to certain exceptions, to elect to cash settle or net share settle all or any portion of our obligations under any such forward sale agreement. If we enter into a forward sale agreement with any forward purchaser, we expect that such forward purchaser (or its affiliate) will attempt to borrow from third parties and sell, through the relevant agent acting as sales agent for such forward purchaser, shares of our common stock to hedge such forward purchaser’s exposure under such forward sale agreement. We will not receive any proceeds from any sale of shares borrowed by a forward purchaser (or its affiliate) and sold through a forward seller. The forward seller will receive a commission, in the form of a reduction to the initial forward price under the related forward sale agreement, at a mutually agreed rate that will not exceed (subject to certain exceptions) \n1.0\n% of the volume-weighted average of the gross sales price per share of all of the borrowed shares of Sempra common stock sold through such forward seller.\nWe intend to use a substantial portion of the net proceeds we receive from the issuance and sale by us of any shares of our common stock to or through the agents and any net proceeds we receive through the settlement of any forward sale agreements with the forward purchasers for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to partly finance anticipated increases to our long-term capital plan and to repay outstanding commercial paper and potentially other indebtedness. At December 31, 2024, approximately $\n2.7\n billion of common stock remained available for sale under the ATM program, which reflects the forward sale agreement that we describe below.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-114\nTable of Contents\nNovember 2024 Forward Sale Agreement\nIn November 2024, we entered into a forward sale agreement under the ATM program with Bank of America, N.A. as forward purchaser for the sale of \n2,909,274\n shares of Sempra common stock. The shares offered pursuant to the forward sale agreement were borrowed by the forward purchaser and therefore are not newly issued shares. We did not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to the forward sale agreement.\nAt December 31, 2024, a total of \n2,909,274\n shares of Sempra common stock remain subject to future settlement under this forward sale agreement, which may be settled on one or more dates specified by us occurring no later than June 30, 2026, which is the final settlement date under the agreement. At the initial forward price of $\n92.1546\n per share, we expect that the net proceeds from the full physical settlement of the forward sale agreement would be approximately $\n268\n million (net of sales commissions of approximately $\n2\n million, but before deducting equity issuance costs, and subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the forward sale agreements). Although we expect to settle the forward sale agreement entirely by the physical delivery of shares of our common stock in exchange for cash proceeds, we may, subject to certain conditions, elect cash settlement or net share settlement for all or a portion of our obligations under the forward sale agreement. The forward sale agreement is also subject to acceleration by the forward purchaser upon the occurrence of certain events.\nNovember 2023 Common Stock Offering and Forward Sale Agreements\nIn November 2023, we completed the offering of \n19,242,010\n shares of our common stock, \nno\n par value, in a registered public offering at $\n70.00\n per share ($\n68.845\n per share after deducting underwriting discounts), \n17,142,858\n shares of which were pursuant to forward sale agreements with an affiliate of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and an affiliate of Citigroup Global Markets Inc. (the November 2023 forward purchasers). The shares offered pursuant to the forward sale agreements were borrowed by the underwriters and therefore are not newly issued shares. The underwriters of the offering partially exercised the option we granted them and purchased \n2,099,152\n shares of common stock directly from us solely to cover overallotments. We received net proceeds of $\n144\n million (net of underwriting discounts and equity issuance costs of $\n3\n million) from the sale of shares to cover overallotments. We did not initially receive any proceeds from the sale of shares pursuant to the forward sale agreements. We used the net proceeds from the sale of the overallotment shares to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including to partly finance our long-term capital plan and to repay commercial paper and other indebtedness.\nIn December 2024, upon full physical settlement of the forward sale agreements from our November 2023 offering, we received net proceeds of $\n1.2\n billion (net of underwriting discounts and equity issuance costs of $\n20\n million) from the issuance of \n17,142,858\n shares of Sempra common stock at a forward price of $\n69.2195\n per share. We expect to use the net proceeds from our common stock issued pursuant to the forward sale agreements to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including to partly finance our long-term capital plan and to repay commercial paper and other indebtedness.\nCOMMON STOCK REPURCHASES\nOn July 6, 2020, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock at any time and from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed the lesser of $\n2.0\n billion or amounts spent to purchase no more than \n25,000,000\n shares. \nOn January 11, 2022, we entered into an ASR program under which we prepaid $\n200\n million to repurchase shares of our common stock in a share forward transaction. A total of \n2,945,512\n shares were purchased under this program at an average price of $\n67.90\n per share. The total number of shares purchased was determined by dividing the $\n200\n million purchase price by the arithmetic average of the volume-weighted average trading prices of shares of our common stock during the valuation period of January 12, 2022 through February 11, 2022, minus a fixed discount. The ASR program was completed on February 11, 2022. \nOn April 6, 2022, we entered into an ASR program under which we prepaid $\n250\n million to repurchase shares of our common stock in a share forward transaction. A total of \n2,943,914\n shares were purchased under this program at an average price of $\n84.92\n per share. The total number of shares purchased was determined by dividing the $\n250\n million purchase price by the arithmetic average of the volume-weighted average trading prices of shares of our common stock during the valuation period of April 7, 2022 through April 25, 2022, minus a fixed discount. The ASR program was completed on April 25, 2022. \nAs of February 25, 2025, a maximum of $\n1.25\n billion and no more than \n19,632,529\n shares may yet be purchased under the July 6, 2020 repurchase authorization. \nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, we withheld \n689,303\n shares for $\n43\n million, \n412,594\n shares for $\n32\n million and \n406,512\n shares for $\n28\n million, respectively, of our common stock that would otherwise be issued to LTIP participants and individuals exercising stock options in 2024 who do not elect otherwise upon the vesting of RSUs and exercise of stock options in an amount sufficient to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding requirements. Such share withholding is considered a share repurchase for accounting purposes. The repurchases do not fall under the July 6, 2020 repurchase authorization.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-115\nTable of Contents\nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nOwnership interests in a consolidated entity that are held by unconsolidated owners are accounted for and reported as NCI.\nThe following table summarizes net income attributable to Sempra and transfers (to) from NCI, which shows the effects of changes in Sempra’s ownership interest in its subsidiaries on Sempra’s shareholders’ equity.\nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEMPRA AND TRANSFERS (TO) FROM NCI\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2023\n2022\nSempra:\nNet income attributable to Sempra\n$\n3,075\n \n$\n2,139\n \nTransfers (to) from NCI:\n(Decrease) increase in shareholders’ equity for sales of NCI\n(\n49\n)\n710\n \nNet transfers (to) from NCI\n(\n49\n)\n710\n \nChange from net income attributable to Sempra and transfers (to) from NCI\n$\n3,026\n \n$\n2,849\n \nSI Partners\nSale of NCI to ADIA\nIn June 2022, Sempra and ADIA consummated the transaction contemplated under a purchase and sale agreement dated December 21, 2021 (the ADIA Purchase Agreement). Pursuant to the ADIA Purchase Agreement, ADIA acquired Class A Units representing a \n10\n% NCI in SI Partners for a purchase price of $\n1.7\n billion, including post-closing adjustments. As a result of this sale to ADIA, we recorded a $\n709\n million increase in equity held by NCI and an increase in Sempra’s shareholders’ equity of $\n710\n million, net of $\n12\n million in transaction costs and $\n300\n million income tax expense. Transaction costs include $\n10\n million paid to ADIA for reimbursement of certain expenses that ADIA incurred in connection with closing the transaction.\nSale of NCI to KKR Pinnacle \nIn connection with the October 2021 sale of NCI to KKR Pinnacle, KKR Pinnacle was entitled to a $\n200\n million credit from Sempra to be applied to capital calls once an LNG project reached a positive final investment decision and met certain projected internal rates of return. In 2023, KKR Pinnacle used $\n200\n million of this credit to fund its share of contributions to SI Partners. As a result, we recorded a $\n200\n million increase in equity held by NCI and a decrease in Sempra’s shareholders’ equity of $\n145\n million, net of a tax benefit.\nSI Partners Subsidiaries\nSale of NCI to KKR Denali\nIn September 2023, a subsidiary of SI Partners completed the sale of a \n60\n% interest in an SI Partners subsidiary (resulting in a \n42\n% NCI in the PA LNG Phase 1 project) to KKR Denali for aggregate cash consideration of $\n976\n million, including post-closing adjustments. As a result of this sale, we recorded a $\n1.0\n billion increase in equity held by NCI and a decrease in Sempra’s shareholders’ equity of $\n61\n million, including $\n11\n million in transaction costs and net of a $\n23\n million tax benefit.\nSI Partners’ and KKR Denali’s subsidiaries have made capital contribution commitments to fund their respective equity share of the equity funding amount of anticipated development costs of the PA LNG Phase 1 project, except in certain budget overrun scenarios. \nSale of NCI to ConocoPhillips Affiliate\nIn March 2023, a subsidiary of SI Partners completed the sale of a \n30\n% interest in an SI Partners subsidiary (resulting in a \n30\n% NCI in the PA LNG Phase 1 project) to an affiliate of ConocoPhillips for aggregate cash consideration of $\n254\n million, including post-closing adjustments. As a result of this sale, we recorded a $\n234\n million increase in equity held by NCI and an increase in Sempra’s shareholders’ equity of $\n12\n million, net of $\n3\n million in transaction costs and $\n5\n million in tax expense. \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-116\nTable of Contents\nSI Partners’ subsidiary and the ConocoPhillips affiliate have made certain customary capital contribution commitments to fund their respective pro rata equity share of the total anticipated capital calls for the equity portion of the anticipated development costs of the PA LNG Phase 1 project. In addition, both SI Partners and ConocoPhillips provided guarantees relating to their respective affiliate’s commitment to make its pro rata equity share of capital contributions to fund \n110\n% of the development budget of the PA LNG Phase 1 project, in an aggregate amount of up to $\n9.0\n billion.

These fully vested RSUs are included in weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic EPS because there are no conditions under which the corresponding shares will not be issued.\n(2)\n    \nDue to market fluctuations of both Sempra common stock and the comparative indices used to determine the vesting percentage of our total shareholder return performance-based RSUs, which we discuss in Note 13, dilutive RSUs may vary widely from period-to-period.\n \nThe potentially dilutive impact from stock options and RSUs is calculated under the treasury stock method. Under this method, proceeds based on the exercise price and unearned compensation are assumed to be used to repurchase shares on the open market at the average market price for the period, reducing the number of potential new shares to be issued and sometimes causing an antidilutive effect.\n The computation of diluted EPS for 2024, 2023 and 2022 excludes potentially dilutive shares related to stock options and RSUs of \n747,724\n, \n502,942\n and \n173,064\n, respectively, because to include them would be antidilutive for the period. However, these shares could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future.\nThe potentially dilutive impact from the forward sale of our common stock pursuant to the forward sale agreements that we discuss above is reflected in our diluted EPS calculation using the treasury stock method. We anticipate there will be a dilutive effect on our EPS when the average market price of our common stock shares is above the applicable adjusted forward price, subject to increase or decrease based on the overnight bank funding rate, less a spread, and subject to decrease by amounts related to expected dividends on shares of our common stock during the term of the forward sale agreements. Additionally, if we decide to physically settle or net share settle the forward sale agreements, delivery of our shares to the forward purchasers on any such physical settlement or net share settlement of the forward sale agreements would result in dilution to our EPS.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-117\nTable of Contents\nNOTE 13. \nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nSEMPRA EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS\nSempra has share-based compensation plans intended to align employee and shareholder objectives related to the long-term growth of Sempra. The plans permit a wide variety of share-based awards, including:\n▪\nnonqualified stock options\n▪\nincentive stock options\n▪\nrestricted stock awards\n▪\nrestricted stock units\n▪\nstock appreciation rights\n▪\nperformance awards\n▪\nstock payments\n▪\ndividend equivalents\nEligible employees, including those from SDG&E and SoCalGas, participate in Sempra’s share-based compensation plans as a component of their compensation package.\nIn the three years ended December 31, 2024, Sempra had the following types of equity awards outstanding:\n▪\nNonqualified Stock Options\n: Options to purchase common stock have an exercise price equal to the market price of the common stock at the date of grant, are service-based, become exercisable over a \nthree\n-year period and expire \n10\n years from the date of grant. Unvested option awards are subject to forfeiture following a termination of employment, except where the retirement criteria under such awards have been met and subject to certain other exceptions described below.\n▪\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\n: These RSU awards generally vest in Sempra common stock at the end of \nthree\n-year performance periods based on Sempra’s total return to shareholders relative to that of specified market indices or based on the compound annual growth rate of Sempra’s EPS. The comparative market indices for the awards that vest based on total return to shareholders are the S&P 500 Utilities Index (excluding water companies) and the S&P 500 Index. Awards issued in 2024 are based on the percentile ranking of the compound annual growth rate of Sempra’s adjusted EPS relative to the compound annual growth rate of S&P 500 Utilities Index (excluding water companies) peer companies. For awards issued in 2022 and 2023, we use long-term analyst consensus growth estimates for S&P 500 Utilities Index peer companies (excluding water companies) to develop our targets for awards that vest based on EPS growth. If Sempra’s total return to shareholders or EPS growth is below the target levels but above threshold performance levels, shares are subject to partial vesting on a pro rata basis. If Sempra’s total return to shareholders or EPS growth exceeds target levels, up to an additional \n100\n% of the granted RSUs may be issued. These RSU awards are subject to forfeiture prior to vesting following a termination of employment, except where the retirement criteria under such awards have been met and subject to certain other exceptions described below.\n▪\nService-Based Restricted Stock Units:\n RSUs may also be service-based; these generally vest ratably over \nthree\n-year service periods. These awards are subject to earlier forfeiture upon termination of employment, subject to certain exceptions described below.\nFor awards that would otherwise be forfeited upon termination of employment, the Compensation and Talent Development Committee of Sempra’s board of directors may waive the forfeiture requirement and, with respect to options and service-based RSUs, may accelerate vesting. Awards are also subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances upon a change in control under the applicable LTIP, in accordance with severance pay agreements or to the extent otherwise required by the terms of the applicable award. Dividend equivalents on shares subject to RSUs are reinvested to purchase additional common shares that become subject to the same vesting conditions as the RSUs to which the dividends relate.\nSHARE-BASED AWARDS AND COMPENSATION EXPENSE\nAt December 31, 2024, \n15,400,000\n common shares were authorized, and \n7,628,467\n common shares were available for future grants of share-based awards. \nOur practice is to satisfy share-based awards by issuing new shares rather than by open-market purchases.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-118\nTable of Contents\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the date of grant. We recognize compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate (based on historical experience) and recognize the compensation costs for nonqualified stock options and RSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally \nthree\n years. However, for awards granted to retirement-eligible participants, the expense is recognized over the initial year in which the award was granted as the award requires service through the end of the year in which it was granted. For awards granted to participants who become eligible for retirement during the requisite service period, the expense is recognized over the period between the date of grant and the later of the end of the year in which the award was granted or the date the participant first becomes eligible for retirement. Substantially all awards outstanding are classified as equity instruments; therefore, we recognize additional paid in capital as we recognize the compensation expense associated with the awards. We recognize in earnings the tax benefits (or deficiencies) resulting from tax deductions that are in excess of (or less than) tax benefits related to compensation cost recognized for share-based payments. \nSempra subsidiaries record an expense for the plans to the extent that subsidiary employees participate in the plans and/or the subsidiaries are allocated a portion of the Sempra plans’ corporate staff costs. \nTotal share-based compensation expense for all of Sempra’s share-based awards was comprised as follows:\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra:\nShare-based compensation expense, before income taxes\n(1)\n$\n77\n \n$\n71\n \n$\n61\n \nIncome tax benefit\n(1)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n17\n)\n$\n68\n \n$\n62\n \n$\n44\n \nCapitalized share-based compensation cost\n$\n13\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n11\n \nExcess income tax (benefit) deficiency\n(\n9\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n3\n)\nSDG&E:\nShare-based compensation expense, before income taxes\n$\n12\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n11\n \nIncome tax benefit\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n3\n)\n$\n10\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n8\n \nCapitalized share-based compensation cost\n$\n7\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n6\n \nExcess income tax (benefit) deficiency\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \nSoCalGas:\nShare-based compensation expense, before income taxes\n$\n20\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n17\n \nIncome tax benefit\n(\n4\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n5\n)\n$\n16\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n12\n \nCapitalized share-based compensation cost\n$\n6\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n5\n \nExcess income tax (benefit) deficiency\n(\n2\n)\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(1)\n    Includes activity of awards issued from the IEnova 2013 LTIP, which settled in cash upon vesting based on the price of IEnova’s common stock.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-119\nTable of Contents\nSEMPRA NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS\nWe use a Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of each nonqualified stock option grant. The use of a valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions about selected model inputs. Expected volatility is calculated based on a blend of the historical and implied volatility of Sempra’s common stock price. The average expected term for options is based on the vesting schedule, contractual term of the option, expected employee exercise and post-termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term estimated at the date of the grant.\n In 2024, 2023 and 2022, Sempra’s board of directors granted \n414,812\n, \n326,574\n and \n439,796\n nonqualified stock options, respectively, that become exercisable over a \nthree\n-year period. The weighted-average per-share fair value for options granted was $\n16.43\n, $\n17.50\n and $\n10.99\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nTo calculate this fair value, we used the Black-Scholes model with the following weighted-average assumptions:\nKEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED\n \nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra:\nStock price volatility\n26.49\n \n%\n27.35\n \n%\n26.08\n \n%\nExpected term\n5.36\n years\n5.36\n years\n5.36\n years\nRisk-free rate of return\n3.90\n \n%\n3.89\n \n%\n1.40\n \n%\nAnnual dividend yield\n3.14\n \n%\n2.98\n \n%\n3.33\n \n%\nThe following table shows a summary of nonqualified stock options at December 31, 2024 and activity for the year then ended:\nNONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS\n \nCommon shares under options\nWeighted- average exercise price\nWeighted- average remaining contractual term (in years)\nAggregate intrinsic value \n(in millions)\nSempra:\nOutstanding at January 1, 2024\n1,759,798\n \n$\n65.99\n \nGranted\n414,812\n \n$\n75.82\n \nExercised\n(\n23,713\n)\n$\n62.87\n \nWithheld related to net settlement\n(\n120,231\n)\n$\n62.87\n \nOutstanding at December 31, 2024\n2,030,666\n \n$\n68.22\n \n6.78\n$\n40\n \nVested or expected to vest at December 31, 2024\n2,030,666\n \n$\n68.22\n \n6.78\n$\n40\n \nExercisable at December 31, 2024\n1,251,544\n \n$\n64.45\n \n5.81\n$\n29\n \nThe aggregate intrinsic value at December 31, 2024 is the total of the difference between Sempra’s closing common stock price and the exercise price for all in-the-money options.

Edison, the majority owner and operator of SONGS, notified SDG&E that it had reached a decision to permanently retire SONGS and seek approval from the NRC to start the decommissioning activities for the entire facility. SONGS is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC and the CPUC.\nSDG&E, and each of the other owners, holds its undivided interest as a tenant in common in the property. Each owner is responsible for financing its share of costs. SDG&E’s share of operating expenses is included in Sempra’s and SDG&E’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNUCLEAR DECOMMISSIONING AND FUNDING\nAs a result of Edison’s decision to permanently retire SONGS Units 2 and 3, Edison began the decommissioning phase of the plant. Major decommissioning work began in 2020. We expect the majority of the decommissioning work to be completed around 2030. Decommissioning of Unit 1, removed from service in 1992, is largely complete. The remaining work for Unit 1 will be completed once Units 2 and 3 are dismantled and the spent fuel is removed from the site. The spent fuel is currently being stored on-site, until the DOE identifies an ISFSI and puts in place a program for the fuel’s disposal, as we discuss below. SDG&E is responsible for approximately \n20\n% of the total decommissioning cost.\nIn accordance with state and federal requirements and regulations, SDG&E has assets held in the NDT to fund its share of decommissioning costs for SONGS Units 1, 2 and 3. Amounts that were collected in rates for SONGS’ decommissioning are invested in the NDT, which is comprised of externally managed trust funds. Amounts held by the NDT are invested in accordance with CPUC regulations. SDG&E classifies debt and equity securities held in the NDT as available-for-sale. The NDT assets are presented on the Sempra and SDG&E Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value with the offsetting credits recorded in noncurrent Regulatory Liabilities.\nExcept for the use of funds for the planning of decommissioning activities or NDT administrative costs, CPUC approval is required for SDG&E to access the NDT assets to fund SONGS decommissioning costs for Units 2 and 3. In January 2025, the CPUC granted SDG&E authorization to access NDT funds of up to $\n66\n million for forecasted 2025 costs.\nIn September 2020, the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury published final regulations that clarify the definition of “nuclear decommissioning costs,” which are costs that may be paid for or reimbursed from a qualified trust fund. The final regulations adopted most of the provisions of the proposed regulations issued in December 2016. The final regulations apply to taxable years ending on or after September 4, 2020 and confirm that the definition of “nuclear decommissioning costs” includes amounts related to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at both on-site and off-site ISFSIs. \nThe final regulations also clarify that costs incurred for ISFSIs that may be or are expected to be reimbursed by the DOE may be paid or reimbursed from a qualified trust fund. Accordingly, the final regulations allow SDG&E the option to access qualified trust funds to recover spent fuel storage costs before Edison reaches final settlement with the DOE regarding the DOE’s reimbursement of these costs. Historically, the DOE’s reimbursements of spent fuel storage costs have not resulted in timely or complete recovery of these costs. We discuss the DOE’s responsibility for spent nuclear fuel below. \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-122\nTable of Contents\nNuclear Decommissioning Trusts\nThe following table shows the fair values and gross unrealized gains and losses for the securities held in the NDT on the Sempra and SDG&E Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The ARO for Units 2 and 3 reflects the acceleration of the start of decommissioning of these units as a result of the early closure of the plant. We expect SDG&E’s undiscounted SONGS decommissioning payments to be $\n89\n million in 2025, $\n57\n million in 2026, $\n37\n million in 2027, $\n25\n million in 2028, $\n11\n million in 2029, and $\n870\n million thereafter.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-123\nTable of Contents\nU.S. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY NUCLEAR FUEL DISPOSAL\nSpent nuclear fuel from SONGS is currently stored on-site in an ISFSI licensed by the NRC. The ISFSI will operate until 2054, when it is assumed that the DOE will have taken custody of all the SONGS spent fuel. The ISFSI would then be decommissioned, and the site restored to its original environmental state. Until then, SONGS owners are responsible for interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at SONGS.\nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 made the DOE responsible for accepting, transporting, and disposing of spent nuclear fuel. However, it is uncertain when the DOE will begin accepting spent nuclear fuel from SONGS. This delay will lead to increased costs for spent fuel storage. In November 2019, Edison filed a claim for spent fuel management costs in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for the time period from January 2017 through July 2018, which is pending approval. Additionally, in July 2024, Edison filed a claim for spent fuel management costs in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for the time period from August 2018 through December 2021, which is pending approval. SDG&E will continue to support Edison in its pursuit of claims on behalf of the SONGS co-owners against the DOE for its failure to timely accept the spent nuclear fuel.\nNUCLEAR INSURANCE\nSDG&E and the other owners of SONGS have insurance to cover claims from nuclear liability incidents arising at SONGS. Currently, this insurance provides $\n500\n million in coverage limits, the maximum amount available, including coverage for acts of terrorism. In addition, the Price-Anderson Act provides an additional $\n60\n million of coverage. If a nuclear liability loss occurs at SONGS and exceeds the $\n500\n million insurance limit, this additional coverage would be available to provide a total of $\n560\n million in coverage limits per incident. \nThe SONGS owners have nuclear property damage insurance of $\n130\n million, which exceeds the minimum federal requirement of $\n50\n million. This insurance coverage is provided through NEIL. The NEIL policies have specific exclusions and limitations that can result in reduced coverage. Insured members as a group are subject to retrospective premium assessments to cover losses sustained by NEIL under all issued policies. SDG&E could be assessed a negligible amount for retrospective premiums based on overall member claims.\nThe nuclear property insurance program includes an industry aggregate loss limit for non-certified acts of terrorism (as defined by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act) of $\n3.24\n billion. This is the maximum amount that will be paid to insured members who suffer losses or damages from these non-certified terrorist acts.\nNOTE 15. \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe accrue losses for a legal proceeding when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. However, the uncertainties inherent in legal proceedings make it difficult to reasonably estimate the costs and effects of resolving these matters. Accordingly, actual costs incurred may differ materially from amounts accrued, may exceed, and in some cases have exceeded, applicable insurance coverage and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Unless otherwise indicated, we are unable to reasonably estimate possible losses or a range of losses in excess of any amounts accrued.\nAt December 31, 2024, loss contingency accruals for legal matters that are probable and estimable were $\n41\n million for Sempra, including $\n26\n million for SoCalGas. We discuss our policy regarding accrual of legal fees in Note 1.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-124\nTable of Contents\nSDG&E\nCity of San Diego Franchise Agreement\nIn 2021, \ntwo\n lawsuits were filed in the California Superior Court challenging various aspects of the natural gas and electric franchise agreements granted by the City of San Diego to SDG&E. Both lawsuits ultimately sought to void the franchise agreements. In one of the cases, judgment was granted in favor of SDG&E and the City of San Diego. In November 2024, the Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court judgment in favor of SDG&E and the City of San Diego. The plaintiff in that case has further appealed. In the second case, the court ruled in favor of SDG&E and the City of San Diego, upholding all terms of the franchise agreements, except for the two-thirds City Council vote requirement for termination if the City decides to terminate under certain circumstances. Under the court’s ruling, the City can instead terminate on a majority vote, so long as it satisfies repayment provisions under the franchise agreements. Both sides have appealed the ruling.\nSoCalGas\nAliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility Gas Leak\nFrom October 23, 2015 through February 11, 2016, SoCalGas experienced a natural gas leak from \none\n of the injection-and-withdrawal wells, SS25, at its Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility in Los Angeles County.\nIn September 2021, SoCalGas and Sempra entered into an agreement with counsel to resolve approximately \n390\n lawsuits including approximately \n36,000\n plaintiffs (the Individual Plaintiffs) then pending against SoCalGas and Sempra related to the Leak for a payment of up to $\n1.8\n billion. Over \n99\n% of the Individual Plaintiffs participated and submitted valid releases, and SoCalGas paid $\n1.79\n billion in 2022 under the agreement. The Individual Plaintiffs who did not participate in the settlement (the Non-Settling Individual Plaintiffs) are able to continue to pursue their claims. As of February 19, 2025, there are approximately \n520\n plaintiffs who are either new plaintiffs or Non-Settling Individual Plaintiffs.\nThe new plaintiffs’ cases and Non-Settling Individual Plaintiffs’ cases are coordinated before a single court in the Los Angeles County Superior Court for pretrial management under a consolidated master complaint filed in November 2017, with one plaintiff’s case proceeding under a separate complaint. Both the consolidated master complaint and the separate complaint assert negligence, negligence per se, strict liability, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress and fraudulent concealment. The consolidated master complaint asserts additional causes of action for private and public nuisance (continuing and permanent), trespass, inverse condemnation, loss of consortium and wrongful death against SoCalGas and Sempra. The separate complaint asserts an additional cause of action for assault and battery. Both complaints seek compensatory and punitive damages for personal injuries, lost wages and/or lost profits, costs of future medical monitoring, and attorneys’ fees. The consolidated master complaint also seeks property damage and diminution in property value, injunctive relief and civil penalties.\nSoCalGas recorded total charges of $\n259\n million ($\n199\n million after tax) in the year ended December 31, 2022 in Aliso Canyon Litigation and Regulatory Matters on the SoCalGas and Sempra Consolidated Statements of Operations related to the litigation and regulatory proceedings associated with the Leak.\nAliso Canyon Natural Gas Storage Facility Regulatory Proceeding – Resolved\nIn February 2017, the CPUC opened proceeding SB 380 OII to determine the feasibility of minimizing or eliminating the use of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility while still maintaining energy and electric reliability for the region, but excluding issues with respect to air quality, public health, causation, culpability or cost responsibility regarding the Leak. The first phase of the proceeding established a framework for the hydraulic, production cost and economic modeling assumptions for the potential reduction in usage or elimination of the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility, as well as evaluating the impacts of reducing or eliminating the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility using the established framework and models. The next phase of the proceeding included engaging a consultant to analyze alternative means for meeting or avoiding the demand for the facility’s services if it were eliminated in either the 2027 or 2035 timeframe, and to address potential implementation of alternatives to the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility if the CPUC determines that the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility should be permanently closed. The CPUC also added all California IOUs as parties to the proceeding and encouraged all load-serving entities in the Los Angeles Basin to join the proceeding. \nIn December 2024, the CPUC approved an FD in the SB 380 OII finding that the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility is currently necessary for natural gas and electric reliability and affordable rates and closed the OII. Among other things, and subject to future CPUC biennial reviews and potential additional proceedings, the FD authorizes the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility to continue operating and sets the maximum working natural gas storage level at \n68.6\n bcf.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-125\nTable of Contents\nOther Sempra\nEnergía Costa Azul\nWe describe below certain land disputes and permit challenges affecting our ECA Regas Facility. Certain of these land disputes involve land on which portions of the ECA LNG liquefaction facilities under construction and in development are expected to be situated or on which portions of the ECA Regas Facility that would be necessary for the operation of such ECA LNG liquefaction facilities are situated. One or more unfavorable final decisions on these disputes or challenges could materially adversely affect our existing natural gas regasification operations and proposed natural gas liquefaction projects at the site of the ECA Regas Facility and have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects.\nLand Disputes.\n Sempra Infrastructure has been engaged in a long-running land dispute with a claimant relating to property adjacent to its ECA Regas Facility that allegedly overlaps with land owned by the ECA Regas Facility (the facility, however, is not situated on the land that is the subject of this dispute), as follows:\n▪\nThe claimant to the adjacent property filed complaints in the federal Agrarian Court challenging the refusal of SEDATU in 2006 to issue title to him for the disputed property. In November 2013, the federal Agrarian Court ordered that SEDATU issue the requested title to the claimant and cause it to be registered. Both SEDATU and Sempra Infrastructure challenged the ruling due to lack of notification of the underlying process. In May 2019, a federal court in Mexico reversed the ruling and ordered a retrial. In November 2024, the plaintiff withdrew the lawsuit and the case was dismissed, definitively resolving this matter.\n▪\nIn a separate proceeding, the claimant filed suit to reinitiate an administrative procedure at SEDATU to obtain the property title that, as described above, had previously been issued in a ruling by the federal Agrarian Court and subsequently reversed by a federal court in Mexico. In April 2021, the proceeding in the Agrarian Court concluded with the court ordering that the administrative procedure be restarted. The administrative procedure at SEDATU may continue if SEDATU decides to reopen the matter.\nIn addition, a plaintiff filed a claim in the federal Agrarian Court that seeks to annul the property title for a portion of the land on which the ECA Regas Facility is situated and to obtain possession of a different parcel that allegedly overlaps with the site of the ECA Regas Facility. The proceeding, which seeks an order that SEDATU annul the ECA Regas Facility’s competing property title, was initiated in 2006 and, in July 2021, a decision was issued in favor of the ECA Regas Facility. The plaintiff appealed and, in February 2022, the appellate court confirmed the ruling in favor of the ECA Regas Facility and dismissed the appeal. The plaintiff filed a federal appeal against the appellate court ruling. In August 2024, the Federal Collegiate Circuit Court ruled in favor of the ECA Regas Facility. In November 2024, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the Mexican Supreme Court.\nEnvironmental and Social Impact Permits. \nSeveral administrative challenges are pending before Mexico’s Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (the Mexican environmental protection agency) and Federal Tax and Administrative Courts, seeking revocation of the environmental impact authorization issued to the ECA Regas Facility in 2003. These cases generally allege that the conditions and mitigation measures in the environmental impact authorization are inadequate and challenge findings that the activities of the terminal are consistent with regional development guidelines.\nIn 2018 and 2021, \nthree\n related claimants filed separate challenges in the federal district court in Ensenada, Baja California seeking revocation of the environmental and social impact permits issued by each of ASEA and SENER to ECA LNG authorizing natural gas liquefaction activities at the ECA Regas Facility, as follows:\n▪\nIn the first case, the court issued a provisional injunction against the permits in September 2018. In December 2018, ASEA approved modifications to the environmental permit that facilitate the development of the proposed natural gas liquefaction facility in two phases. In May 2019, the court canceled the provisional injunction. The claimant appealed the court’s decision to cancel the injunction but was not successful. The lower court’s ruling was favorable to the ECA Regas Facility, as the court determined that no harm has been caused to the plaintiff and dismissed the lawsuit. The claimant appealed and the appellate court’s ruling is pending.\n▪\nIn the second case, the initial request for a provisional injunction against the permits was denied. That decision was reversed on appeal in January 2020, resulting in the issuance of a new injunction against the permits that were issued by ASEA and SENER. This injunction has uncertain application absent clarification by the court. The claimants petitioned the court to rule that construction of natural gas liquefaction facilities violated the injunction and, in February 2022, the court ruled in favor of the ECA Regas Facility, holding that the natural gas liquefaction construction activities did not violate the injunction. The claimants appealed this ruling but were not successful. The lower court’s ruling was favorable to the ECA Regas Facility, as the court determined that no harm has been caused to the plaintiffs and dismissed the lawsuit. The claimants appealed and the appellate court’s ruling is pending.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-126\nTable of Contents\n▪\nIn the third case, a group of residents filed a complaint in June 2021 against various federal and state authorities alleging deficiencies in the public consultation process for the issuance of the permits. The request for an initial injunction was denied. The claimants appealed this ruling but were not successful. The lower court’s ruling was favorable to the ECA Regas Facility, as the court determined that no harm has been caused to the plaintiffs and dismissed the lawsuit. The claimants appealed and the appellate court’s ruling is pending.\nPort Arthur LNG\nThe PA LNG Phase 1 project holds two Clean Air Act Prevention of Significant Deterioration permits issued by the TCEQ, which we refer to as the “2016 Permit” and the “2022 Permit.” The 2022 Permit also governs emissions for the proposed PA LNG Phase 2 project. In November 2023, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision to vacate and remand the 2022 Permit to the TCEQ for additional explanation of the agency’s permit decision. In February 2024, the court withdrew its opinion and referred the case to the Supreme Court of Texas to resolve the question of the appropriate standard to be applied by the TCEQ. In February 2025, the Supreme Court of Texas adopted Port Arthur LNG’s interpretation of the standard. Port Arthur LNG continues to litigate this matter before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which will apply the standard adopted by the Supreme Court of Texas. The 2022 Permit is effective during the pending litigation. The 2016 Permit was not the subject of, and is unaffected by, the pending litigation of the 2022 Permit. Construction of the PA LNG Phase 1 project is proceeding uninterrupted under existing permits, and we do not currently anticipate the pending litigation to materially impact the PA LNG Phase 1 project cost, schedule or expected commercial operations at this stage.\nLitigation Related to Regulatory and Other Actions by the Mexican Government\nAmendments to Mexico’s Electricity Industry Law.\n In March 2021, the Mexican government published a decree with amendments to Mexico’s Electricity Industry Law that include some public policy changes, including establishing priority of dispatch for CFE plants over privately owned plants. The decree further purports to permit the CRE to revoke self-supply permits granted under the former electricity law, which were grandfathered when the new Electricity Industry Law was enacted, if it considers them to have been obtained improperly. According to the decree, these amendments were to become effective in March 2021, and SENER, the CRE and Centro Nacional de Control de Energía (Mexico’s National Center for Energy Control) were to have 180 calendar days to modify, as necessary, all resolutions, policies, criteria, manuals and other regulations applicable to the power industry to conform with this decree. Numerous legal actions were taken against the decree, which resulted in Mexican courts issuing a suspension of the decree later in March 2021. \nIn April 2022, the Mexican Supreme Court resolved an action of unconstitutionality filed by a group of senators against the amended Electricity Industry Law. The super majority needed to find the amendment unconstitutional was not reached and the proceeding was therefore dismissed, leaving the amended Electricity Industry Law in place. However, the Court nevertheless found certain of the amendments, including the priority of dispatch for the CFE and other provisions that granted preference to the CFE over private companies, were invalid. \nIn January 2024, the Second Chamber of the Mexican Supreme Court definitively resolved an amparo in a separate case brought by a third party and ruled that certain provisions of the amendments of the Electricity Industry Law are unconstitutional, including the priority of dispatch for the CFE and other provisions that granted preference to the CFE over private companies. The Court also dismissed an amparo relating to the provision of the decree applicable to self-supply permits granted under the former electricity law, and established that its decision applies generally over all participants.\nSempra Infrastructure filed \nthree\n lawsuits challenging the amendments to the Electricity Industry Law, including one concerning the provision permitting revocation of self-supply permits deemed improperly obtained. In each of them, Sempra Infrastructure obtained a favorable judgment in the lower court, all of which were challenged by the CRE. Following the criteria established by the Mexican Supreme Court, in July 2024, the Second Collegiate Court reversed the lower court’s decision and definitively dismissed one of the lawsuits filed by Sempra Infrastructure regarding the provision permitting revocation of self-supply permits. Consequently, the CRE may be required to seek to revoke such self-supply permits, under a legal standard that is ambiguous and not well defined under the law. Sempra Infrastructure supplies power pursuant to self-supply permits, and would be permitted to file amparos challenging the constitutionality of any such action. If such self-supply permits are revoked, it may result in increased costs for Sempra Infrastructure and for its power consumers, adversely affect our ability to develop new projects, result in decreased revenues and cash flows, and negatively impact our ability to recover the carrying values of our investments in Mexico, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Sempra’s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and/or prospects. Final resolution regarding the two remaining lawsuits is still pending.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-127\nTable of Contents\nRBS Sempra Commodities LLP – Resolved\nAs we discuss in Note 5, Sempra held an equity method investment in RBS Sempra Commodities LLP, a limited liability partnership that was substantially liquidated in 2024. In 2015, liquidators filed a claim in the High Court of Justice against The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (now NatWest Markets plc, our partner in the JV) and Mercuria Energy Europe Trading Limited (the Defendants) on behalf of 10 companies (the Liquidating Companies) that engaged in carbon credit trading via chains that included a company that traded directly with RBS Sempra Energy Europe, a subsidiary of RBS Sempra Commodities LLP. The claim alleged that the Defendants’ participation in the purchase and sale of carbon credits resulted in the Liquidating Companies’ carbon credit trading transactions creating a VAT liability they were unable to pay, and that the Defendants were liable to provide for equitable compensation due to dishonest assistance and compensation under the U.K. Insolvency Act of 1986. Trial on the matter was held in 2018. In March 2020, the High Court of Justice rendered its judgment mostly in favor of the Liquidating Companies. The Defendants appealed and, in May 2021, the Court of Appeal set aside the High Court of Justice’s decision and ordered a retrial. In July 2022, the Supreme Court of the U.K. denied the Liquidating Companies application for permission to appeal the Court of Appeal’s decision. In January 2024, the parties settled the Liquidating Companies’ claim against the Defendants, which fully resolved these matters.\nOrdinary Course Litigation\nWe are also defendants in ordinary routine litigation incidental to our businesses, including personal injury, employment litigation, product liability, property damage and other claims. Juries have demonstrated an increasing willingness to grant large awards, including punitive damages, in these types of cases.\nLEASES\nA lease exists when a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception of the contract.\nSome of our lease agreements contain nonlease components, which represent activities that transfer a separate good or service to the lessee. \nAs the lessee for both operating and finance leases, we have elected to combine lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for real estate, fleet vehicles, aircraft, power generating facilities and pipelines, whereby fixed or in-substance fixed payments allocable to the nonlease component are accounted for as part of the related lease liability and ROU asset. As the lessor, we have elected to combine lease and nonlease components as a single lease component for refined products terminals if the timing and pattern of transfer of the lease and nonlease components are the same and the lease component would be classified as an operating lease if accounted for separately.\nLessee Accounting\nWe have operating and finance leases for real and personal property (including office space, land, fleet vehicles, aircraft, tugboats, machinery and equipment, warehouses and other operational facilities) and PPAs with renewable energy, energy storage and peaker plant facilities.\nSome of our leases include options to extend the lease terms for up to \n25\n years, or to terminate the lease within \none year\n. Our lease liabilities and ROU assets are based on lease terms that may include such options when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the option.\nCertain of our contracts are short-term leases, which have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease commencement. We do not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset arising from short-term leases for all existing classes of underlying assets. In such cases, we recognize short-term lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our short-term lease costs for the period reasonably reflect our short-term lease commitments.\nCertain of our leases contain escalation clauses requiring annual increases in rent ranging from \n2\n% to \n5\n% or based on the Consumer Price Index. The rentals payable under these leases may increase by a fixed amount each year or by a percentage of a base year. Variable lease payments that are based on an index or rate are included in the initial measurement of our lease liability and ROU asset based on the index or rate at lease commencement and are not remeasured because of changes to the index or rate. Rather, changes to the index or rate are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nSimilarly, PPAs for the purchase of renewable energy at SDG&E require lease payments based on a stated rate per MWh produced by the facilities, and we are required to purchase substantially all the output from the facilities. SDG&E is required to pay additional amounts for capacity charges and actual purchases of energy that exceed the minimum energy commitments. Under these contracts, we do not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset for leases for which there are no fixed lease payments. \n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-128\nTable of Contents\nRather, these variable lease payments are recognized separately as variable lease costs. SDG&E estimates these variable lease payments to be $\n296\n million in 2025, $\n290\n million in 2026, $\n289\n million in 2027, $\n290\n million in 2028, $\n289\n million in 2029 and $\n1.9\n billion thereafter.\nAs of the lease commencement date, we recognize a lease liability for our obligation to make future lease payments, which we initially measure at present value using our incremental borrowing rate at the date of lease commencement, unless the rate implicit in the lease is readily determinable. We determine our incremental borrowing rate based on the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. We also record a corresponding ROU asset, initially equal to the lease liability and adjusted for lease payments made at or before lease commencement, lease incentives, and any initial direct costs. We test ROU assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may affect the recoverability or the estimated useful lives of the ROU assets.\nFor our operating leases, our non-regulated entities recognize a single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the lease term in operating expenses. SDG&E and SoCalGas recognize this single lease cost on a basis that is consistent with the recovery of such costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP governing rate-regulated operations.\nFor our finance leases, the interest expense on the lease liability and amortization of the ROU asset are accounted for separately. Our non-regulated entities use the effective interest rate method to account for the imputed interest on the lease liability and amortize the ROU asset on a straight-line basis over the lease term. SDG&E and SoCalGas recognize amortization of the ROU asset on a basis that is consistent with the recovery of such costs in accordance with U.S. GAAP governing rate-regulated operations.\nOur leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees, restrictions or covenants.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-129\nTable of Contents\nClassification of ROU assets and lease liabilities and the weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate associated with operating and finance leases are summarized in the table below.\nLESSEE INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Dollars in millions)\nSempra\nSDG&E\nSoCalGas\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nROU assets:\nOperating leases:\nROU assets\n$\n1,177\n$\n723\n$\n795\n$\n368\n$\n18\n$\n29\nFinance leases:\nPP&E\n1,626\n1,585\n1,426\n1,412\n200\n173\nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n311\n)\n(\n246\n)\n(\n221\n)\n(\n179\n)\n(\n90\n)\n(\n66\n)\nPP&E, net\n1,315\n1,339\n1,205\n1,233\n110\n107\nTotal ROU assets\n$\n2,492\n$\n2,062\n$\n2,000\n$\n1,601\n$\n128\n$\n136\nLease liabilities:\nOperating leases:\nOther current liabilities\n(1)\n$\n91\n$\n70\n$\n68\n$\n50\n$\n8\n$\n10\nDeferred credits and other\n(2)\n1,019\n599\n734\n325\n9\n18\n1,110\n669\n802\n375\n17\n28\nFinance leases:\nCurrent portion of long-term debt and finance leases\n65\n64\n42\n41\n23\n23\nLong-term debt and finance leases\n1,250\n1,276\n1,163\n1,192\n87\n84\n1,315\n1,340\n1,205\n1,233\n110\n107\nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n2,425\n$\n2,009\n$\n2,007\n$\n1,608\n$\n127\n$\n135\nWeighted-average remaining lease term (in years):\nOperating leases\n13\n13\n12\n10\n2\n3\nFinance leases\n14\n15\n15\n16\n6\n6\nWeighted-average discount rate:\nOperating leases\n(3)\n6.10\n \n%\n6.64\n \n%\n5.06\n \n%\n4.52\n \n%\n4.70\n \n%\n4.54\n \n%\nFinance leases\n13.71\n \n%\n13.80\n \n%\n14.11\n \n%\n14.18\n \n%\n5.35\n \n%\n4.94\n \n%\n(1)    \nIncludes $\n43\n and $\n18\n related to PPAs at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, at both Sempra and SDG&E. \n(2)    \nIncludes $\n627\n and $\n208\n related to PPAs at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, at both Sempra and SDG&E. \n(3)    \nWeighted-average discount rate related to PPAs at December 31, 2024 and 2023 is \n5.04\n% and \n4.19\n%, respectively, at both Sempra and SDG&E.

In 2024, SoCalGas prepaid $\n1\n million and expects the future minimum lease payments to be $\n8\n million in 2028, $\n9\n million in 2029 and $\n134\n million thereafter (through expiration in 2041).\nSempra Infrastructure has entered into a lease agreement for tugboat services for the PA LNG Phase 1 project that it expects will commence in 2027. Sempra Infrastructure expects the future minimum lease payments to be $\n10\n million in 2027, $\n12\n million, in each of 2028 and 2029 and $\n198\n million thereafter (through expiration in 2047, exclusive of certain renewal options) and total future minimum fixed payments for operation and maintenance services to be $\n184\n million.\nLessor Accounting\nSempra Infrastructure is a lessor for certain of its natural gas and ethane pipelines, compressor stations, LPG storage facilities, a rail facility and refined products terminals, which we account for as operating or sales-type leases. These leases expire at various dates from 2025 through 2042.\nOver the lease term, we monitor the underlying assets in operating leases for impairment, and we evaluate the net investment in sales-type leases for expected credit losses. Sempra Infrastructure expects to continue to derive value from the underlying assets associated with its pipelines following the end of their respective lease terms based on the expected remaining useful life, expected market conditions and plans to re-market and re-contract the underlying assets.\nGenerally, we recognize operating lease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term, and sales-type lease income based on the effective interest method over the lease term. Certain of our leases contain rate adjustments or are based on foreign currency exchange rates that may result in lease payments received that vary in amount from one period to the next. In addition to minimum fixed payments, our refined products terminals receive variable lease payments for barrels delivered that exceed minimum delivery requirements.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-132\nTable of Contents\nLESSOR INFORMATION\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nSempra – Assets subject to operating leases:\nProperty, plant and equipment: \nPipelines and storage\n$\n1,313\n \n$\n1,304\n \nRefined products terminals \n623\n \n621\n \nOther\n77\n \n77\n \nTotal\n2,013\n \n2,002\n \nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n605\n)\n(\n539\n)\nProperty, plant and equipment, net\n$\n1,408\n \n$\n1,463\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nSempra – Maturity analysis of lease payments:\nOperating leases\nSales-type leases\n2025\n$\n318\n \n$\n17\n \n2026\n272\n \n9\n \n2027\n269\n \n—\n \n2028\n268\n \n—\n \n2029\n246\n \n—\n \nThereafter\n2,324\n \n—\n \nTotal undiscounted cash flows\n$\n3,697\n \n26\n \nLess: present value of lease payments (recognized as lease receivable)\n(1)\n(\n23\n)\nDifference between undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows\n$\n3\n \n(1)     \nIncludes $\n15\n in Other Current Assets and $\n8\n in Other Long-Term Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLESSOR INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(Dollars in millions)\nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra – Sales-type leases:\nInterest income\n$\n5\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n8\n \nTotal revenues from sales-type leases\n(1)\n$\n5\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n8\n \nSempra – Operating leases:\nFixed lease payments\n$\n340\n \n$\n321\n \n$\n290\n \nVariable lease payments\n38\n \n34\n \n10\n \nTotal revenues from operating leases\n(1)\n$\n378\n \n$\n355\n \n$\n300\n \nDepreciation expense\n$\n73\n \n$\n62\n \n$\n54\n \n(1)     \nIncluded in Revenues: Energy-Related Businesses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nCONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS\nNatural Gas Contracts\nSoCalGas procures natural gas for both SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ core customers in a combined portfolio.

SDG&E is required to pay additional amounts for actual purchases of energy that exceed the minimum energy commitments. SDG&E estimates these variable payments to be $\n79\n million in each of 2025 and 2026, $\n80\n million in each of 2027 through 2029 and $\n440\n million thereafter. Total fixed and variable payments under PPAs not accounted for as leases for Sempra and SDG&E were $\n326\n million in 2024, $\n325\n million in 2023 and $\n297\n million in 2022. \nConstruction and Development Projects\nSDG&E\nAt December 31, 2024, SDG&E has commitments to make future payments of $\n133\n million for construction projects that include:\n▪\n$\n100\n million related to construction supply agreements;\n▪\n$\n19\n million related to spent fuel management at SONGS; and\n▪\n$\n14\n million for infrastructure improvements for electric transmission and distribution systems.\nSDG&E expects future payments under these contractual commitments to be $\n115\n million in 2025, $\n1\n million in each of 2026 through 2028, $\n2\n million in 2029 and $\n13\n million thereafter.\nOTHER COMMITMENTS\nSDG&E\nWe discuss nuclear insurance and nuclear fuel disposal related to SONGS in Note 14.\nFire Mitigation Fund\nIn connection with the completion of the Sunrise Powerlink project in 2012, the CPUC required that SDG&E establish a fire mitigation fund to minimize the risk of fire as well as reduce the potential wildfire impact on residences and structures near the Sunrise Powerlink. The future payments for these contractual commitments, for which a liability has been recorded, are expected to be $\n4\n million per year in 2025 through 2029 and $\n264\n million thereafter, subject to escalation of \n2\n% per year, ending in 2069. At December 31, 2024, the present value of these future payments of $\n124\n million has been recorded as a regulatory asset as the amounts represent a cost that we expect will be recovered from customers in the future.\nFranchise Agreements\n \nIn July 2021, SDG&E’s natural gas and electric franchise agreements for the City of San Diego went into effect. These franchise agreements provide SDG&E the opportunity to serve the City of San Diego for a period of \n20\n years, consisting of \n10\n-year agreements that will automatically renew for an additional \n10\n years unless the City Council voids the automatic renewals. At December 31, 2024, SDG&E has commitments to make future principal and interest payments as consideration for the franchise agreements of $\n14\n million in 2025, $\n4\n million in 2026, $\n2\n million in each of 2027 through 2029 and $\n45\n million thereafter. The consideration paid will not be recovered from customers and will be amortized over 20 years.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-135\nTable of Contents\nOther Sempra\nAdditional consideration for a 2006 comprehensive legal settlement with California to resolve the Continental Forge litigation included an agreement that, for a period of \n18\n years beginning in 2011, Sempra Infrastructure would sell to SDG&E and SoCalGas, subject to annual CPUC approval, up to \n500\n MMcf per day of regasified LNG from Sempra Infrastructure’s ECA Regas Facility that is not delivered or sold in Mexico at the price indexed to the California border minus $\n0.02\n per MMBtu. There are no specified minimums required, and to date, Sempra Infrastructure has not been required to deliver any natural gas pursuant to this agreement.\nENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\nOur operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws. We also are subject to regulations related to hazardous wastes, air and water quality, land use, solid waste disposal and the protection of wildlife. These laws and regulations require that we investigate and correct the effects of the release or disposal of materials at sites associated with our past and our present operations. These sites include those at which we have been identified as a PRP under the federal Superfund laws and similar state laws.\nIn addition, we are required to obtain numerous governmental permits, licenses and other approvals to construct facilities and operate our businesses. The related costs of environmental monitoring, pollution control equipment, cleanup costs, and emissions fees are significant. Increasing national and international concerns regarding global warming and mercury, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions could result in requirements for additional pollution control equipment or significant emissions fees or taxes that could adversely affect Sempra Infrastructure. SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ costs to operate their facilities in compliance with these laws and regulations generally have been recovered in customer rates.\nWe disclose any proceeding under environmental laws to which a government authority is a party when the potential monetary sanctions, exclusive of interest and costs, exceed the lesser of $\n1\n million or \n1\n% of current assets, which was $\n53\n million for Sempra, $\n13\n million for SDG&E and $\n16\n million for SoCalGas at December 31, 2024.\nOther Environmental Issues\nWe generally capitalize the significant costs we incur to mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination or extend the life, increase the capacity, or improve the safety or efficiency of property used in current operations. \nThe following table shows our capital expenditures (including construction work in progress) in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations:\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES\n(Dollars in millions)\n \nYears ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nSempra\n$\n65\n \n$\n107\n \n$\n87\n \nSDG&E\n23\n \n29\n \n31\n \nSoCalGas\n42\n \n78\n \n56\n \nWe have not identified any significant environmental issues outside the U.S.\nAt SDG&E and SoCalGas, costs that relate to current operations or an existing condition caused by past operations are generally recorded as a regulatory asset due to the probability that these costs will be recovered in rates.\nThe environmental issues currently facing us, except for those resolved during the last three years, include (1) investigation and remediation of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ manufactured-gas sites, (2) cleanup of third-party waste-disposal sites used by SDG&E and SoCalGas at which we have been identified as a PRP and (3) mitigation of damage to the marine environment caused by the cooling-water discharge from SONGS.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-136\nTable of Contents\nThe table below shows the status at December 31, 2024 of SDG&E’s and SoCalGas’ manufactured-gas sites and the third-party waste-disposal sites for which we have been identified as a PRP:\nSTATUS OF ENVIRONMENTAL SITES\n \n# Sites\ncomplete\n(1)\n# Sites\nin process\nSDG&E:\nManufactured-gas sites\n3\n \n—\n \nThird-party waste-disposal sites\n2\n \n1\n \nSoCalGas:\nManufactured-gas sites\n39\n \n3\n \nThird-party waste-disposal sites\n5\n \n2\n \n(1)\n    There may be ongoing compliance obligations for completed sites, such as regular inspections, adherence to land use covenants and water quality monitoring.\nWe record environmental liabilities when our liability is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated.

Sempra has the following \nthree\n operating and reportable segments, which are managed separately based on services provided, geographic location and regulatory framework:\n▪\nSempra California \nprovides natural gas and electric service to Southern California and part of central California through Sempra’s wholly owned subsidiaries, SDG&E and SoCalGas, which are regulated public utilities. \n▪\nSempra Texas Utilities \nholds our equity method investment in Oncor Holdings, which owns an \n80.25\n% interest in Oncor, a regulated electric transmission and distribution utility serving customers in the north-central, eastern, western and panhandle regions of Texas; and our equity method investment in Sharyland Holdings, which owns Sharyland Utilities, a regulated electric transmission utility serving customers near the Texas-Mexico border. \n▪\nSempra Infrastructure\n includes the operating companies of SI Partners, in which Sempra Infrastructure owns a \n70\n% interest, as well as a holding company and certain services companies. Sempra Infrastructure develops, builds, operates and invests in energy infrastructure to help provide safe, sustainable and reliable access to cleaner energy in markets in the U.S., Mexico and globally. \nSempra’s CODM, who is its chief executive officer, uses segment earnings attributable to common shares predominantly in the annual financial planning process to assess financial performance. Sempra’s CODM prioritizes resource allocation to each segment in a manner that aligns with Sempra’s capital expenditures plan, which is focused on safety, reliability and modernization of its segments’ infrastructure while supporting customer affordability; investing in incremental infrastructure growth projects with attractive risk-adjusted returns; maintaining a strong balance sheet; and returning cash to shareholders.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 1. Sempra accounts for intersegment sales as if the sales were to third parties, that is, at current market prices. The cost of common services shared by the reportable segments is assigned directly or allocated based on various cost factors, depending on the nature of the service provided. Parent and other allocates depreciation expense to the reportable segments without allocating the related depreciable assets to those reportable segments. Interest income and interest expense are recorded on intersegment loans. We have eliminated intersegment accounts and transactions within Sempra’s consolidated financial statements. Amounts labeled as “Parent and other,” which does not meet the definition of an operating or reportable segment, consist primarily of activities of parent organizations.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-138\nTable of Contents\nThe following tables present selected information by segment and reconciliations of assets, capital expenditures for PP&E, and earnings attributable to common shares to Sempra’s consolidated totals.\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\nASSETS\nSempra California\n$\n56,116\n \n$\n53,430\n \nSempra Texas Utilities\n15,534\n \n14,392\n \nSempra Infrastructure\n22,954\n \n19,430\n \nSegment totals\n94,604\n \n87,252\n \nParent and other\n2,622\n \n967\n \nIntersegment eliminations\n(1)\n(\n1,071\n)\n(\n1,038\n)\nTotal Sempra\n$\n96,155\n \n$\n87,181\n \nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\nSempra Texas Utilities\n$\n15,522\n \n$\n14,380\n \nSempra Infrastructure\n2,411\n \n2,129\n \nSegment totals/Total Sempra\n$\n17,933\n \n$\n16,509\n \nGEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nUnited States\n$\n52,952\n \n$\n46,935\n \nMexico\n8,485\n \n8,024\n \nRest of the world\n—\n \n1\n \nTotal Sempra\n$\n61,437\n \n$\n54,960\n \nYears ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nSempra California\n$\n4,753\n \n$\n4,560\n \n$\n4,466\n \nSempra Infrastructure\n3,459\n \n3,832\n \n884\n \nSegment totals\n8,212\n \n8,392\n \n5,350\n \nParent and other\n3\n \n5\n \n7\n \nTotal Sempra\n$\n8,215\n \n$\n8,397\n \n$\n5,357\n \nGEOGRAPHIC LOCATION OF REVENUES\n(2)\nUnited States\n$\n11,623\n \n$\n14,973\n \n$\n13,015\n \nMexico\n1,562\n \n1,747\n \n1,424\n \nTotal Sempra\n$\n13,185\n \n$\n16,720\n \n$\n14,439\n \n(1)     \nPrimarily includes an intersegment loan from Sempra Infrastructure to Parent and other related to deferred income taxes.\n(2)     \nAmounts are based on where the revenue originated, after intersegment eliminations.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  F-139\nTable of Contents\nSEGMENT INFORMATION (CONTINUED) \n(Dollars in millions)\nSempra California\nSempra Texas Utilities\n(1)\nSempra Infrastructure\nSempra\nYear ended December 31, 2024\nRevenues\n$\n11,382\n \n$\n1,882\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n(\n2,133\n)\n(\n297\n)\nInterest income\n14\n \n25\n \nInterest expense\n(2)\n(\n848\n)\n243\n \nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n(\n184\n)\n164\n \nEquity earnings\n—\n \n$\n788\n \n802\n \nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n638\n)\nOther segment items\n(3)\n(\n6,385\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n1,270\n)\nSegment earnings attributable to common shares\n$\n1,846\n \n$\n781\n \n$\n911\n \n$\n3,538\n \nParent and other\n(\n721\n)\nEarnings attributable to common shares\n$\n2,817\n \nYear ended December 31, 2023\nRevenues\n$\n13,761\n \n$\n3,071\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n(\n1,937\n)\n(\n281\n)\nInterest income\n24\n \n43\n \nInterest expense\n(2)\n(\n782\n)\n(\n129\n)\nIncome tax benefit (expense) \n31\n \n(\n673\n)\nEquity earnings\n—\n \n$\n701\n \n740\n \nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n543\n)\nOther segment items\n(3)\n(\n9,350\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n1,351\n)\nSegment earnings attributable to common shares\n$\n1,747\n \n$\n694\n \n$\n877\n \n$\n3,318\n \nParent and other\n(\n288\n)\nEarnings attributable to common shares\n$\n3,030\n \nYear ended December 31, 2022\nRevenues\n$\n12,577\n \n$\n1,919\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n(\n1,743\n)\n(\n268\n)\nInterest income\n11\n \n44\n \nInterest expense\n(\n647\n)\n(\n104\n)\nIncome tax expense\n(\n320\n)\n(\n249\n)\nEquity earnings\n—\n \n$\n742\n \n756\n \nEarnings attributable to noncontrolling interests\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n146\n)\nOther segment items\n(3)\n(\n8,364\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n1,642\n)\nSegment earnings attributable to common shares\n$\n1,514\n \n$\n736\n \n$\n310\n \n$\n2,560\n \nParent and other\n(\n466\n)\nEarnings attributable to common shares\n$\n2,094\n \n(1)\n    Substantially all earnings attributable to common shares are from equity earnings.\n(2)\n    Sempra Infrastructure includes net unrealized gains (losses) from undesignated interest rate swaps related to the PA LNG Phase 1 project.\n(3)\n    Includes cost of natural gas, cost of electric fuel and purchased power, O&M, Aliso Canyon litigation and regulatory matters, franchise fees and other taxes, other income (expense), net, and preferred dividends for Sempra California;

\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nThe condensed financial information of Sempra has been prepared in accordance with SEC Regulation S-X Rule 5-04 and Rule 12-04. We apply the same accounting policies as in the consolidated financial statements of Sempra, except that Sempra accounts for the earnings of its subsidiaries under the equity method in this unconsolidated financial information. This financial information should be read in conjunction with Sempra’s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in this Form 10-K.\nSempra received cash dividends from its subsidiaries totaling $\n908\n million, $\n1.9\n billion and $\n832\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nNOTE 2. \nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nWe describe in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements recent pronouncements that have had or may have a significant effect on Sempra’s results of operations, financial condition, cash flows or disclosures.\nNOTE 3. \nDEBT AND CREDIT FACILITY\nSHORT-TERM DEBT\nCommitted Line of Credit\nAt December 31, 2024, Sempra had capacity of $\n4.0\n billion under a committed line of credit, which provides liquidity and supports its commercial paper program, with available unused credit of $\n4.0\n billion before reductions of any unamortized discounts.\nThe principal terms of Sempra’s committed line of credit include the following:\n▪\nThe facility has a syndicate of \n23\n lenders. No single lender has greater than a \n6\n% share in the facility. \n▪\nThe facility provides for the issuance of $\n200\n million of letters of credit. Subject to obtaining commitments from existing or new lenders and satisfaction of other specified conditions, Sempra has the right to increase its letter of credit commitment to up to $\n500\n million. \nNo\n letters of credit were outstanding at December 31, 2024.\n▪\nBorrowings bear interest at a benchmark rate plus a margin that varies with Sempra’s credit rating.\n▪\nSempra must maintain a ratio of indebtedness to total capitalization (as defined in its credit facility) of no more than \n65\n% at the end of each quarter. At December 31, 2024, Sempra was in compliance with this ratio under its credit facility.\n2024 Form 10-K  |  S-6\nTable of Contents\nLONG-TERM DEBT\nThe following table shows the detail and maturities of uncollateralized long-term debt outstanding.\nLONG-TERM DEBT\n(Dollars in millions)\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n3.30\n% Notes April 1, 2025\n$\n750\n \n$\n750\n \n5.40\n% Notes August 1, 2026\n550\n \n550\n \n3.25\n% Notes June 15, 2027\n750\n \n750\n \n3.40\n% Notes February 1, 2028\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \n3.70\n% Notes April 1, 2029\n500\n \n500\n \n5.50\n% Notes August 1, 2033\n700\n \n700\n \n3.80\n% Notes February 1, 2038\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \n6.00\n% Notes October 15, 2039\n750\n \n750\n \n4.00\n% Notes February 1, 2048\n800\n \n800\n \n4.125\n% (next rate reset on April 1, 2027) Junior Subordinated Notes April 1, 2052\n(1)\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \n6.40\n% (next rate reset on October 1, 2034) Junior Subordinated Notes October 1, 2054\n(1)\n1,250\n \n—\n \n6.875\n% (next rate reset on October 1, 2029) Junior Subordinated Notes October 1, 2054\n(1)\n600\n \n—\n \n6.875\n% (next rate reset on October 1, 2029) Junior Subordinated Notes October 1, 2054\n(1)\n500\n \n—\n \n6.55\n% (next rate reset on April 1, 2035) Junior Subordinated Notes April 1, 2055\n(1)\n600\n \n—\n \n6.625\n% (next rate reset on April 1, 2030) Junior Subordinated Notes April 1, 2055\n(1)\n400\n \n—\n \n5.75\n% Junior Subordinated Notes July 1, 2079\n(1)\n758\n \n758\n \n \n11,908\n \n8,558\n \nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n(\n750\n)\n—\n \nUnamortized discount on long-term debt\n(\n30\n)\n(\n29\n)\nUnamortized debt issuance costs\n(\n100\n)\n(\n68\n)\nTotal long-term debt\n$\n11,028\n \n$\n8,461\n \n(1)    \nCallable long-term debt not subject to make-whole provisions.\nSempra issued the following fixed-to-fixed reset rate junior subordinated notes in 2024:\n▪\nIn March 2024, Sempra issued $\n600\n million aggregate principal amount of \n6.875\n% junior subordinated notes maturing on October 1, 2054, and received proceeds of $\n593\n million (net of debt discount, underwriting discounts and debt issuance costs of $\n7\n million).
