CYBERSECURITY \nRisk management and strategy\nOur corporate information technology, communication networks, enterprise applications, accounting and financial reporting \nplatforms, and related systems, and those that we offer to our tenants are necessary for the operation of our business. We use these \nsystems, among others, to manage our tenant and vendor relationships, for internal communications, for accounting to operate record-\nkeeping function, and for many other key aspects of our business. Our business operations rely on the secure collection, storage, \ntransmission, and other processing of proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data. \nWe have implemented and maintain various information security processes designed to identify, assess and manage material \nrisks from cybersecurity threats to our critical computer networks, third-party hosted services, communications systems, hardware and \nsoftware, and our critical data, including intellectual property, confidential information that is proprietary, strategic or competitive in \nnature, and tenant data (“Information Systems and Data”).  \nWe rely on a multidisciplinary team, including our information security function, legal department, management, and third-party \nservice providers, as described further below, to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity threats and risks. We identify and assess \nrisks from cybersecurity threats by monitoring and evaluating our threat environment and our risk profile using various methods \nincluding, for example, using manual and automated tools, subscribing to reports and services that identify cybersecurity threats, \nanalyzing reports of threats and threat actors, conducting scans of the threat environment, evaluating our industry’s risk profile, utilizing \ninternal and external audits, and conducting threat and vulnerability assessments.  \nDepending on the environment, we implement and maintain various technical, physical, and organizational measures, \nprocesses, standards, and/or policies designed to manage and mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats to our Information \nSystems and Data, including risk assessments,  incident detection and response, vulnerability management, disaster recovery and \nbusiness continuity plans, internal controls within our accounting and financial reporting functions, encryption of data, network security \ncontrols, access controls, physical security, asset management, systems monitoring, vendor risk management program, employee \ntraining, and penetration testing.\n \nWe work with third parties from time to time that assist us to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks, including \nprofessional services firms, consulting firms, threat intelligence service providers, and penetration testing firms.  \nTo operate our business, we utilize certain third-party service providers to perform a variety of functions. We seek to engage \nreliable, reputable service providers that maintain cybersecurity programs.\n \nDepending on the nature of the services provided, the \nsensitivity and quantity of information processed, and the identity of the service provider, our vendor management process may include \nreviewing the cybersecurity practices of such provider, contractually imposing obligations on the provider, conducting security \nassessments, and conducting periodic reassessments during their engagement.\n  \nWe are not aware of any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of any cybersecurity incidents, which have \nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our Company, including our business strategy, results of operations, or \nfinancial condition.
