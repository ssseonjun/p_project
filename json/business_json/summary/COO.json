  "item1_summary": " Current market conditions and recessionary pressures in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business . Any negative impact on economic conditions and international markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition . Ongoing uncertain economic and financial market conditions may also adversely affect the financial condition of our customers, suppliers and other business partners .\n Our global business has been negatively affected by local economic conditions, including inflation, increasing labor costs, recession, and currency exchange rate fluctuations . We cannot guarantee that we will be able to fully absorb any such additional costs or revenue declines in the prices for our products and services . Our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our business .\n More than half of our net sales for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2024, and 2023, were derived from the sale of products outside the United States . We believe that sales outside the U.S. will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales . International operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks .\n Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, UK Bribery Act, international data security and privacy laws, EU MDR and EU IVDR and environmental laws and requirements applicable to our facilities, products or manufacturing processes . The need to engage third-party agents or intermediaries to act on our behalf in certain countries, including in those countries with a high risk of corruption .\n Our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations . Failure to comply with sanctions laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal sanctions, including the imposition of fines and the denial of export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business .\n Future transactions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization and/or impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets . Risks we could face with respect to these acquisitions and other strategic transaction include: Failure to successfully obtain the anticipated revenues, margins and earnings benefits .\n The company faces risks associated with disruption of its manufacturing, distribution and storage operations, including possible failure to develop necessary manufacturing processes, or constrained, idle or excess capacity, which could adversely affect our business . The company’s noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations, including the acquisition of any undisclosed or potential liabilities, contingent liabilities or indemnification obligations of the acquired company .\n CooperVision manufactures molded contact lenses, which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues, primarily at our facilities in Costa Rica, Hungary, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and the United States . We manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets, and certain of our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site . If there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility, it could take a significant amount of time to obtain required regulatory approvals .\n Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing distribution or storage facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business . Cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication . A successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems, or those of our third-party service providers, or cause the   profitability and market share .\n Like many other companies, we experience attempted cybersecurity actions on a frequent basis, and the frequency of such attempts could increase in the future . The techniques used by cybercriminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments .\n There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information . Breach could result in financial, legal, business and reputational harm to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows .\n CooperVision and CooperSurgical are in the midst of a multi-year process of implementing new ERP systems . Implementing a new system is not only costly but complex and difficult . CooperVision: We cannot be assured that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our business in the course of our maintenance, support and/or upgrade of these systems .\n Management concluded our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of October 31, 2024 due to a material weakness in IT general controls for the CooperSurgical operations in the U.S. primarily related to the implementation and maintenance of certain enterprise resource planning systems . The material weakness resulted from not having a sufficient complement of its personnel, inadequate training of personnel and ineffective assessment of the risks related to change management .\n CooperSurgical products are generally purchased by hospitals and surgery centers, OB/GYN medical offices and fertility clinics, and billed to various third-party payors . Changes in the purchasing behavior of such customers or the amount such payors are willing to reimburse our customers for procedures using our products could create additional pricing pressure on us .\n Some of the materials used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products, including MyDay, are supplied by few or sole suppliers . The failure of a key or sole supplier to timely supply of these materials could disrupt our supply of those lenses to the market, which would have a material adverse effect on our supply chain .\n We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and licensing agreements . We have applied for patent protection in the United States, the United Kingdom and other foreign jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products . We cannot be assured that any of our patent applications will be approved .\n CooperVision and CooperSurgical also rely on proprietary technology that is unpatented . It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology . We cannot be assured that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how .\n Our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others . Our competitors in both the United States and foreign countries may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and sell our existing and planned products .\n Arties have made, and may make in the future, claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology . Any claims, even those without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend . Failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of some of our products .\n We face the inherent risk of exposure to legal claims, including negligence, relating to our provision of certain service offerings . These risks may be heightened due to our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts for some of our products and services . We handle some risk with third-party carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations .\n CooperVision's soft contact lens business faces intense competition from competitors' products . Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc., Alcon Inc. and Bausch Health Companies Inc. may have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development budgets, larger sales forces, greater market penetration and/or larger manufacturing volumes .\n The market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel-based products . Failure to respond to competitive pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations . CooperVision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic surgery .\n CooperVision’s failure to adapt to the threats posed by new and emerging distribution models and Internet driven services may have a material adverse impact on our business . Competition in the medical device industry is dynamic and involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations . Some of CooperVision's markets, such as genomics, contraception and cord blood and cord tissue storage, are characterized by rapid technological advancement .\n CooperSurgical has expanded direct-to-consumer products and services . New medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our products . There is also risk that emerging technologies or technology advancements could reduce the medical value of certain of our products, such as cord blood and cord tissue storage, which could adversely affect our business .\n CooperSurgical has historically purchased, leveraged or licensed the technology developments of others . We cannot be assured that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals, certifications or clearances for our new products . Failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes could have a material adverse effect on our business . We and our facilities are subject to a broad range of U.S federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and requirements .\n Future events may give rise to additional compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business . We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements . As a manufacturer of various products, we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters, and we cannot be assured that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred .\n New disclosure standards and rules related to ESG matters have been adopted and may continue to be introduced in various states and other jurisdiction . As the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand, significant effort and expenses could be required to comply with the evolving requirements . As our disclosure obligations increase, third parties may make claims or bring litigation relating to those disclosures which may be costly .\n Concern over climate change or plastics and packaging materials, in particular, may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment . Our reputation, brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to do business with us . Complying with these demands or requirements could cause us to incur additional manufacturing, operating or product development costs .\n Customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business . The success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel . We may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified personnel . Labor shortages and competition for qualified personnel could cause disruptions in our business operations .\n FDA may change premarket clearance and approval policies for drugs and medical devices, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations . FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and products . Any new statutes, regulations or revisions or revisions of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of any future products .\n New and emerging laws may be interpreted to limit access to contraceptive technologies or cryostorage services, which could adversely affect certain aspects of CooperSurgical’s business . The EU landscape concerning medical devices (including IVDs) has recently evolved and may be subject to further developments in 2025 . In the United States, the reversal by the U.S. Supreme Court of Roe v. Wade has raised concerns in the fertility industry .\n The MHRA announced plans for the UK's independent regulatory framework for medical devices in the EU in January 2015 . The new framework will be in place by the end of the next year . The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland differ from those in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) The rules are expected to be implemented by 2025 .\n CooperVision and CooperSurgical are subject to reporting requirements and recalls, even after receiving regulatory clearance, approval or certification . These developments, or the perception that any related developments could occur, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and financial markets, and our business may be impacted and the demand for our products could be depressed . The FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products .\n Recalls of any of our products may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations . A recall could harm our reputation with customers and consumers . Failure to comply with cGMP, QSR and other applicable domestic or international regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations .\n The manufacture of drug-device combination products, such as Paragard, is complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment . Failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability . The FDA issued a final rule to amend the QSR regulations to align more closely with the International Organization for Standardization standards .\n Our manufacturers may experience manufacturing difficulties due to resource constraints or as a result of labor disputes or unstable political environments . Failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance, approval or certification for our products or operations could adversely affect our business . We may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses for products that fail to meet specifications .\n Our medical devices and pharmaceutical products require clearance or approval by the FDA before they can be commercially distributed in the United States . The process of obtaining, renewing and maintaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market product, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time consuming . The FDA and authorities in foreign jurisdictions may change their policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations .\n We have made modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or approval, but we cannot confirm that the FDA will agree with our decisions . We also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our modifications, if required . Failure to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements may significantly and adversely affect our ability to commercialize and generate revenue from our products and product candidates .\n In order to sell our products in the EU, our products must respectively comply with general safety and performance requirements of the EU MDR and the EU IVDR . Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the European Conformity (CE) mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Europe .\n To demonstrate compliance with the general safety and performance requirements we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification . Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market . A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers . If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the . safety and . performance requirements, the manufacturer uses a CE certificate as a basis for its declaration of conformity .\n The EU regulatory landscape concerning medical devices (including IVDs) is evolving and may have a significant effect on the way we conduct our business in the UK . Failure to comply with regulatory requirements (as applicable) could require time and resources to respond to regulatory authorities’ observations and to implement corrective and preventive actions, as appropriate .\n The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in the EU legislation . Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the FDA . Increased regulatory scrutiny of genetic testing may adversely affect our business through increased costs and risks associated with gaining marketing approvals or certifications .\n In vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs) are a type of medical device that can be used in the diagnosis or detection of diseases or other conditions . The FDA considers laboratory developed tests (LDTs) to be a subset of IVDs that are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory . Similar tests are also known as In-House Tests (IH-Tests) in the EU .\n The costs to comply with the FDA LDT regulation and its impact on our business is difficult to predict . In the EU, the definition of an IH-Test as is an IVD that is developed and produced by a laboratory on a non-industrial scale and is provided to health institutions in accordance with Article 5 of the EU IVDR .\n Our clinical laboratories must be certified under CLIA and ISO 15189 in order for us to perform testing on human specimens . The law also requires us to maintain a state laboratory license to conduct testing in that state . In addition, we are subject to the UK Human Fertilization & . Fertility Association (HFEA) regulating IVF .\n In the United States, we provide donor egg and sperm for fertility treatments, in addition to fertility cryopreservation services and newborn stem cell storage . Donated reproductive tissues, including eggs and sperm, as well as cord blood and cord tissue, are regulated to by the FDA as HCT/Ps . Products subject to regulation are not currently required to obtain marketing authorizations, so long as they meet certain criteria set forth in FDA regulations .\n To be regulated as 361 HCT/Ps, these products must meet the FDA’s criteria to be considered “minimally manipulated” and intended for “homologous use,” among other requirements . The FDA could disagree with our determination that these human tissue products are 361 H CT/Ps and could determine that these products are biologics requiring a BLA .\n The ability of the FDA, foreign agencies and notified bodies to review and clear, approve or certify new products can be affected by a variety of factors . Government funding of other government agencies that fund research and development activities is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable . Disruptions may also slow the time necessary for new drugs and medical devices to be reviewed, approved and/or certified by necessary government agencies .\n In the EU, notified bodies must be officially designated to certify products and services in accordance with the EU MDR and EU IVDR . Their designation process, which is significantly stricter under the new Regulations, has experienced considerable delays . The current designated notified bodies are, therefore, facing a backlog of requests, and review times have lengthened .\n Law and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability and integrity of personally identifiable information (PII), including protected health information (PHI) The costs of complying with the requirements of federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to the privacy and security of personal information could materially adversely affect our business .\n We may not be able to prevent incidences of inappropriate use or unauthorized access to PHI by our employees, contractors or external factors, despite the safeguards . We are also subject to various other laws in the United States such as the Federal Trade Commission Act, which requires a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information .\n The Coopers are subject to diverging requirements under EU member state laws and UK law . As these laws develop, we may need to make operational changes to adapt to these diverging rules, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our business . We are also subject to China's Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), which imposes requirements regarding processing PII .\n Each of these constantly evolving laws can be subject to varying interpretations . Failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy or security laws, policies, legal obligations or industry standards may result in governmental enforcement actions and investigations . Such failures could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations . Acquisitions like th.  require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts .\n The ACA made extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the U.S. Among the provisions of the ACA, of greatest importance to the medical device industry and pharmaceutical industry are the following: The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute . The Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation at CMS at CMS will test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending .\n Recent healthcare reform has taken place in foreign countries where we market our products . We expect that additional state, federal and foreign health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, including those initiatives affecting coverage and reiarability, we say . The Cooper Company expects additional state and foreign reform measures to be adopted .\n Health care reform proposals on a state-by-state basis could require us to develop state-specific marketing and sales approaches . Third-party payors increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of health care . Cost controls have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices, this could change in the future .\n We may be subject to various federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback, physician self-referral false claims and physician payment transparency laws and regulations . If we fail to establish and maintain broad coverage and reimbursement for our tests, our ability to generate increased revenue and grow our test volume and customer base could be limited .\n The federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law, generally prohibit entities from billing a patient or the Medicare or Medicaid programs for certain designated health services, including clinical laboratory services . The government may assert that a claim resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act .\n The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 imposes criminal and civil liability for defrauding any healthcare benefit program . The Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the CMS .\n Some state laws require biotechnology companies to comply with the industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance . Federal government price reporting laws require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics to government programs . Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs .\n Exchange rate fluctuations and foreign currency hedges could adversely affect our financial results . We cannot be assured that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws . Changes in these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges .\n We are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt . We may use interest rate swap agreements to fix a portion of our variable-rate debt as further described in Note 13 . Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations . We have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness .\n The company's credit facilities contain financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests . It could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including our obligation to repay our credit facilities under certain circumstances, or refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms .\n The company has a global minimum tax rate of 15% that may adversely affect our provision for income taxes . Tax authorities could challenge our positions related to transfer pricing and intercompany transactions, including the valuation of intangible assets . Tax examinations can result in costly litigation with significant interest and penalties and ultimate settlement can take several years . We have developed and implemented a cybersecurity risk management program .\n We use the Center for Internet Security Critical Security Controls (CIS Controls) and Safeguards as a guide to identify, assess, and manage cybersecurity risks relevant to our business . We have designed and assessed our program based on CIS controls . We also have a cybersecurity incident response plan that includes preparation, identification, notification, containment, analysis, analysis and recovery .\n There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with or effective in protecting our systems and information . A successful cybersecurity attack could interrupt or disrupt our information technology systems, or those of our third-party service providers, or cause the loss of confidential or protected data which could disrupt our business .\n The Board of Directors also receives an annual briefing from our Chief Information Officer, or CIO, on our cybersecurity program, including risks and priorities . The CIO leads a credentialed and experienced Information Security team who has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program . Our Enterprise Risk Leadership Team is responsible for assessing and managing our material enterprise risks ."
