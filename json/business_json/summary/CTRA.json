  "item1_summary": " Risk factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . Low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business . Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGLs that we can produce economically . Higher commodity prices could cause us to experience periods of higher costs .\n Any substantial or extended decline in future commodity prices would have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments . If commodity prices decline significantly for a sustained period of time, the lower prices may cause us to reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures or raise additional capital .\n Drilling for oil and natural gas involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered . The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain . Drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control . In the event that commodity prices decline, there could be a significant revision to the carrying amounts of oil and gas properties in the future .\n The scope and nature of our operations present a variety of significant hazards and risks, including explosions, fires, product spills, and cybersecurity incidents . Our insurance may not cover such liabilities, or be adequate to compensate us for all resulting losses . The occurrence of any event not covered or fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows .\n The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data . The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary . Initial reserves estimates often vary from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered . Any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves .\n Actual future prices and costs may differ from those used in the net present value estimate . Future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable . Unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline . Low commodity prices may further limit the kinds of reserves we can develop and produce economically .\n As of December 31, 2024, approximately 18 percent of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped . Developing PUD reserves requires significant capital expenditures, the estimated future development costs associated with such reserves may not equal our actual costs, development may not occur as scheduled . Future growth prospects depend on our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business .\n The sale of our oil, natural gas and NGL production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability and capacity of gathering, transportation and processing facilities . The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production . Failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives .\n Failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business . Construction of new pipelines and building of required infrastructure may be slow, construction of new pipeline lines could be slow . Such availability and capacity issues may result in increased basis differentials, which became more divergent in 2024 due to constrained pipeline capacity and oversupply in certain geographic areas .\n There may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware . We often assume certain liabilities, and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities . Integration of businesses and properties we have acquired or may in the future acquire could be difficult .\n There can be no assurances that we will be successful in our integration efforts. We have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate. As of December 31, 2024, non-operated wells represented approximately 50 percent of our total owned gross wells . We may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the increase in the size of our business. The company's future success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage our expanded business .\n Many of our properties are in areas that may have been partially depleted or drained by offset (i.e., neighboring) wells . Some of our wells may be adversely affected by actions other operators may take when drilling, completing or operating wells that they own . We have no control over offsetting operators who could take actions such as drilling and completing nearby wells, that could adversely affect our operations .\n Shutting in our wells and damage to our wells from offset completions could result in increased costs and could adversely affect the reserves and re-commenced production from such shut-in wells . Government also may impose new restrictions and regulations affecting our ability to drill, conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, and obtain necessary rights-of-way on federal lands, which could, in turn, result in the loss of federal lands .\n Water is a significant component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes . Severe drought conditions can result in local water districts taking steps to restrict the use of water in their jurisdiction for drilling and fracturing . Water may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling sites, resulting in increased costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition .\n More stringent regulations or legal directives, as well as potential litigation or other developments, related to such disposal activities could materially impact our ability to dispose of produced water, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations . Our business, like the oil and gas industry in general, has become increasingly dependent on data, information systems, and digitally connected infrastructure, including technologies managed by third-party providers .\n Cyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and can include the use of malicious software, phishing scams, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to systems or data . Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information, customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data integrity issues, communication interruption or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations .\n In the event the transportation and marketing of our production, equipment damage, fires, explosions or environmental releases, non-compliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer’s . data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation . As cyber-attackers become more sophisticated, we may be required to . expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business .\n Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we want or need to raise capital, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions . Adverse economic and market conditions could impact our counterparties, including our receivables and our hedging counterparties who may, as a result of such conditions, be unable to perform their obligations .\n If commodity prices deteriorate from current levels, it could lead to reduced revenues, cash flow and earnings . If we fail to make required payments or otherwise default on our debt, the lenders who hold such debt also could accelerate amounts due . A prolonged period of lower commodity prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios .\n While there are many different types of derivatives available, we generally utilize collar, swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively . The CFTC has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for derivatives transactions, including swaps . If we reduce our use of swaps, our results of operations may become more volatile, and our cash flows may be less predictable .\n If any of our counterparties were to default on its obligations under our financial derivative instruments, such a default could (1) have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, (2) result in a larger percentage of our future production being subject to commodity price changes . We will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future .\n The importance of sustainability evaluations is becoming more broadly accepted by investors and stockholders . Low sustainability scores could result in exclusion of our securities from consideration by certain investment funds, engagement by investors seeking to improve such scores and a negative perception of our operations by certain investors . Efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community to generally promote the divestment of fossil fuel equities could limit our ability to access capital markets .\n Federal, state and local laws and regulations, judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development and the use of hydraulic fracturing, could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays . These factors could also cause the permits we need to  to be challenged, withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business .\n Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in fines and penalties . The adoption of legislation restricting emission of greenhouse gases could result in increased costs and reduced demand for oil and gas we produce . The issuance of required permits is not guaranteed and, once issued, permits are subject to renewal . For more information, please read “Other regulations and “Regulation of Natural Gas Production, Gathering and Transportation” in Items 1 and 2 .\n At this time, it is not possible to quantify the impact of such future laws and regulations on our business . Policy and legal risks include actions that seek to lessen activities that contribute to adverse effects of climate change . Policy actions also may include restrictions or bans on oil and gas activities, which could lead to write-downs or impairments of our assets .\n Legal risks include potential lawsuits or regulations regarding the impacts of climate change, failure to adapt to climate change and insufficiency of disclosure around material financial risks . At COP28 in December 2023, more than 190 governments reached a non-binding agreement to transition away from fossil fuels and encourage the growth and expansion of renewable energy .\n The development and use of emerging technologies in renewable energy, battery storage, and energy efficiency may lower demand for oil and gas, resulting in lower prices and revenues, and higher costs . Market risk also may take the form of limited access to capital as investors shift investments to less carbon-intensive industries and alternative energy industries .\n “We have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all,” in this statement . “Our Indebtedness, Hedging Activities and Financial Position’s Financial Position—We have substantial capital requirements’ in this announcement ."
