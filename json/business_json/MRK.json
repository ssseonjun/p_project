    "item1": "Item 1. “Business\n —\n Research and Development” above.\nAcquisitions, Research Collaborations and Licensing Agreements\nMerck continues to remain focused on pursuing opportunities that have the potential to drive both near- and long-term growth. Certain recent transactions are summarized below; additional details are included in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Merck actively monitors the landscape for growth opportunities that meet the Company’s strategic criteria.\nIn December 2024, Merck closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize MK-2010 (LM-299), a novel investigational PD-1/VEGF bispecific antibody from LaNova. Merck recorded a charge of $588 million to \nResearch and development \nexpenses in 2024, or $0.18 per share, for the upfront payment, which was made in January 2025. LaNova is also eligible to receive milestone payments associated with the technology transfer, development, regulatory approval and commercialization of MK-2010 (LM-299) across multiple indications.\nAlso in December 2024, Merck closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize MK-4082 (HS-10535), an investigational preclinical oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist from Hansoh. Merck recorded a charge of $112 million to \nResearch and development \nexpenses in 2024, or $0.04 per share, for the upfront payment, which was made in February 2025. Hansoh is also eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments associated with the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of MK-4082 (HS-10535) as well as tiered royalties on future net sales of MK-4082 (HS-10535), if approved. Under the agreement, Hansoh may co-promote or solely commercialize MK-4082 (HS-10535) in Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macau, subject to certain conditions.\nIn September 2024, Merck acquired MK-1045 (formally CN201), a novel investigational clinical-stage bispecific antibody for the treatment of B-cell associated diseases, from Curon Biopharmaceutical (Curon) for an upfront payment of $700 million. In addition, Curon is eligible to receive future contingent developmental and regulatory milestone payments. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Merck recorded a charge of $750 million (reflecting the upfront payment and other related costs) to \nResearch and development \nexpenses, or $0.29 per share, in 2024 related to the execution of the transaction. In connection with the agreement, Merck is also obligated to pay a third party future contingent developmental, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, as well as tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single-digit rate to a low-double-digit rate on future net sales of MK-1045, if approved.\nIn July 2024, Merck acquired EyeBio, a privately held ophthalmology-focused biotechnology company, for $1.2 billion (including payments to settle share-based equity awards) and also incurred $207 million of transaction costs. The acquisition agreement also provides for former EyeBio shareholders to receive future contingent developmental, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments. EyeBio’s lead candidate, MK-3000 (formerly EYE103), is an investigational, potentially first-in-class tetravalent, tri-specific antibody that acts as an agonist of the Wingless-related integration site signaling pathway, which is in clinical development for the treatment of diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Merck recorded net assets of $21 million, as well as a charge of $1.35 billion to \nResearch and development\n expenses, or $0.52 per share, in 2024 related to the acquisition. Additionally, a $100 million developmental milestone was triggered and paid in 2024 upon initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial evaluating MK-3000 for the treatment of diabetic macular edema, which was also recorded as a charge to \nResearch and development\n expenses ($0.04 per share).\nIn March 2024, Merck acquired Harpoon, a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T-cell engagers designed to harness the power of the body’s immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases for $765 million and also incurred $56 million of transaction costs. Harpoon’s lead candidate, MK-6070 (formerly HPN328), is a T-cell engager targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), an inhibitory \n62\nTable of Content\ns\ncanonical Notch ligand that is expressed at high levels in small-cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. The Company recorded net assets of $165 million, as well as a charge of $656 million to \nResearch and development \nexpenses, or $0.26 per share, in 2024 related to the transaction. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition. In August 2024, Merck and Daiichi Sankyo expanded their existing global co-development and co-commercialization agreement to include MK-6070. Merck recognized income (recorded within \nOther (income) expense, net\n)\n \nof $170 million, or $0.05 per share, due to the receipt of an upfront cash payment from Daiichi Sankyo and has also satisfied a contingent quid obligation from the original collaboration agreement. \nAcquired In-Process Research and Development\nIn connection with business combinations, the Company records the fair value of in-process research projects which, at the time of acquisition, had not yet reached technological feasibility. At December 31, 2024, the balance of in-process research and development (IPR&D) was $430 million, primarily consisting of MK-1026 (nemtabrutinib), $418 million, which is in Phase 3 clinical development.\nThe IPR&D projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the Company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the IPR&D programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates. The time periods to receive approvals from the FDA and other regulatory agencies are subject to uncertainty. Significant delays in the approval process, or the Company’s failure to obtain approval at all, would delay or prevent the Company from realizing revenues from these products. Additionally, if the IPR&D programs require additional clinical trial data than previously anticipated, or if the programs fail or are abandoned during development, then the Company will not recover the fair value of the IPR&D recorded as an asset as of the acquisition date. If such circumstances were to occur, the Company’s future operating results could be adversely affected and the Company may recognize impairment charges, which could be material.\nIn 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded IPR&D impairment charges within \nResearch and development\n expenses of $779 million and $1.6 billion, respectively (see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements). \nAdditional research and development will be required before any of the remaining programs reach technological feasibility. The costs to complete the research projects will depend on whether the projects are brought to their final stages of development and are ultimately submitted to the FDA or other regulatory agencies for approval. \nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures were $3.4 billion in 2024, $3.9 billion in 2023 and $4.4 billion in 2022. Expenditures in the U.S. were $2.4 billion in 2024, $2.5 billion in 2023 and $2.7 billion in 2022. The Company plans to invest approximately $20 billion in capital projects from 2024-2028, more than $11 billion of which relates to investments in the U.S., including expanding manufacturing capacity for oncology, vaccine and animal health products.\nDepreciation expense was $2.1 billion in 2024, $1.8 billion in 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022, of which $1.4 billion in 2024, $1.2 billion in 2023 and $1.3 billion in 2022, related to locations in the U.S. Total depreciation expense in 2024, 2023 and 2022 included accelerated depreciation of $254 million, $140 million and $120 million, respectively, associated with restructuring activities (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements).\nAnalysis of Liquidity and Capital Resources\nMerck’s strong financial profile enables it to fund research and development, finance acquisitions and external alliances, support in-line products and maximize upcoming launches while providing significant cash returns to shareholders.\nSelected Data\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWorking capital\n$\n10,362\n \n$\n6,474 \n$\n11,483 \nTotal debt to total liabilities and equity\n31.7\n \n%\n32.9 \n%\n28.1 \n%\nCash provided by operating activities to total debt\n0.6:1\n0.4:1\n0.6:1\nCash provided by operating activities was $21.5 billion in 2024 compared with $13.0 billion in 2023 reflecting stronger operating performance. Cash provided by operating activities was reduced by upfront, milestone, option and continuation payments related to certain collaborations of $1.1 billion in 2024 compared with $4.2 billion in 2023 (including payments related to the formation of a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo). Cash provided by operating activities in 2023 was also reduced by a payment of $572.5 million for the previously disclosed Zetia antitrust settlement. Cash provided by operating activities continues to be the Company’s primary source of funds to finance \n63\nTable of Content\ns\noperating needs, with excess cash serving as the primary source of funds to finance business development transactions, capital expenditures, dividends paid to shareholders and treasury stock purchases.\nCash used in investing activities was $7.7 billion in 2024 compared with $14.1 billion in 2023. The lower use of cash in investing activities was primarily due to lower cash used for acquisitions, lower capital expenditures, as well as lower purchases of securities and other investments, partially offset by lower proceeds from sales of securities and other investments. \nCash used in financing activities was $7.0 billion in 2024 compared with $4.8 billion in 2023. The higher use of cash in financing activities was primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance debt (see below) and higher dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by lower payments on long-term debt (see below), higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options and lower purchases of treasury stock. \nIn May 2024, MSD Netherlands Capital B.V., a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Merck, completed a registered public offering of €3.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-dominated senior notes. The net cash proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes. In May 2023, the Company issued $6.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes. The Company used a portion of the $5.9 billion net proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the cash consideration paid for the acquisition of Prometheus, including related fees and expenses, and used the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes including to repay commercial paper borrowings and other indebtedness with upcoming maturities.\nIn 2024, the Company’s $750 million, 2.90% notes and the Company’s €500 million, 0.50% euro-denominated notes matured in accordance with their terms and were repaid. In 2023, the Company’s $1.75 billion, 2.80% notes matured in accordance with their terms and were repaid. In 2022, the Company’s $1.25 billion, 2.35% notes and the Company’s $1.0 billion, 2.40% notes matured in accordance with their terms and were repaid. \nThe Company has a $6.0 billion credit facility that matures in May 2028. The facility provides backup liquidity for the Company’s commercial paper borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company has not drawn funding from this facility.\nIn March 2024, the Company filed a securities registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the automatic shelf registration process available to “well-known seasoned issuers” which is effective for three years.\nEffective as of November 3, 2009, the Company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. (MSD) and MSD executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the Company (excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. These guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date.\nIn November 2024, Merck’s Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend, declaring a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share on the Company’s outstanding common stock for the first quarter of 2025 that was paid in January 2025. In January 2025, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.81 per share on the Company’s outstanding common stock for the second quarter of 2025 payable in April 2025. \nIn 2018, Merck’s Board of Directors authorized purchases of up to $10 billion of Merck’s common stock for its treasury. The treasury stock purchase authorization has no time limit and will be made over time in open-market transactions, block transactions on or off an exchange, or in privately negotiated transactions. In 2024, the Company purchased $1.3 billion (approximately 11 million shares) of its common stock for its treasury under this program. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s remaining share repurchase authorization was $2.4 billion. The Company purchased $1.3 billion of its common stock during 2023 under the authorized share repurchase program. The Company did not purchase any shares of its common stock under this program in 2022. In January 2025, Merck’s Board of Directors authorized purchases of up to an additional $10 billion of Merck’s common stock for its treasury. \nThe Company believes it maintains a conservative financial profile. The Company places its cash and investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in its investment policy guidelines. These guidelines also limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not participate in any off-balance sheet arrangements involving unconsolidated subsidiaries that provide financing or potentially expose the Company to unrecorded financial obligations.\nThe Company expects foreseeable liquidity and capital resource requirements to be met through existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from operations, as well as commercial paper borrowings and long-term borrowings if needed. Merck believes that its sources of financing will be adequate to meet its future requirements. The Company’s material cash requirements arising in the normal course of business primarily include:\n64\nTable of Content\ns\nDebt Obligations and Interest Payments —\n See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further detail of the Company’s debt obligations and the timing of expected future principal and interest payments. \nTax Liabilities — \nIn connection with the enactment of the TCJA, the Company is required to pay a one-time transition tax, which the Company has elected to pay over a period of eight years through 2025 as permitted under the TCJA. Additionally, the Company has liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties. See Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements for further information pertaining to the transition tax and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. \nOperating Leases — \nSee Note 9 to consolidated financial statements for further details of the Company’s lease obligations and the timing of expected future lease payments.\nCollaboration-Related Payments —\n At December 31, 2024, the Company has accrued liabilities for contingent sales-based milestone payments related to a collaboration with AstraZeneca where the related sales-based milestones were achieved, but payment was not yet due according to the payment terms. These sales-based milestones were subsequently paid in January 2025. Additionally, the Company has an accrued liability for a future continuation payment related to a collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to these payments.\nPurchase Obligations —\n Purchase obligations are enforceable and legally binding obligations for purchases of goods and services including minimum inventory contracts, research and development and advertising. Purchase obligations also include future inventory purchases the Company has committed to in connection with certain divestitures. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had total purchase obligations of $7.2 billion, of which $2.8 billion is estimated to be payable in 2025.\nFinancial Instruments Market Risk Disclosures\nThe Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.\nA significant portion of the Company’s revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The objectives of and accounting related to the Company’s foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management, and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates.\nThe objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. To achieve this objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than two years into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting exposures, revenue and foreign exchange rate volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. The Company manages its anticipated transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options. \nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or \nOther Comprehensive\n \nIncome (Loss)\n (\nOCI)\n, depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in \nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss \n(\nAOCL)\n and reclassified into \nSales\n when the hedged anticipated revenue is recognized. The amount reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuation of cash flow hedges because it was no longer deemed probable the forecasted hedged transactions would occur was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. For those derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges, but serve as economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded in \nSales\n each period. The cash flows from both designated and non-designated contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\n65\nTable of Content\ns\nBecause Merck principally sells foreign currency in its revenue hedging program, a uniform weakening of the U.S. dollar would yield the largest overall potential loss in the market value of these hedge instruments. The market value of Merck’s hedges would have declined by an estimated $569 million and $754 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, from a uniform 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar. The market value was determined using a foreign exchange option pricing model and holding all factors except exchange rates constant. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck’s major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. \nThe Company manages operating activities and net asset positions at each local subsidiary in order to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange on monetary assets and liabilities. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot rates reported in \nOther (income) expense, net\n. The Company also uses a balance sheet risk management program to mitigate the exposure of such assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. Merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to offset the effects of foreign exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the foreign exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument (primarily the euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and Chinese renminbi). The forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through \nOther (income) expense, net\n. Accordingly, fair value changes in the forward contracts help mitigate the changes in the value of the remeasured assets and liabilities attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except to the extent of the spot-forward differences. These differences are not significant due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which typically have average maturities at inception of less than six months. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nA sensitivity analysis to changes in the value of the U.S. dollar on foreign currency denominated derivatives, investments and monetary assets and liabilities indicated that if the U.S. dollar uniformly weakened by 10% against all currency exposures of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, \nIncome Before Taxes\n would have declined by approximately $239 million and $221 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Because the Company was in a net short (payable) position relative to its major foreign currencies after consideration of forward contracts, a uniform weakening of the U.S. dollar will yield the largest overall potential net loss in earnings due to exchange. This measurement assumes that a change in one foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar would not affect other foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Although not predictive in nature, the Company believes that a 10% threshold reflects reasonably possible near-term changes in Merck’s major foreign currency exposures relative to the U.S. dollar. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \nThe Company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against movements in foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. The unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within \nOCI\n and remain in \nAOCL\n until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. The Company excludes certain portions of the change in fair value of its derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded components). Changes in fair value of the excluded components are recognized in \nOCI\n. The Company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the excluded components on a straight-line basis over the life of the derivative instrument, rather than using the mark-to-market approach. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nForeign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. Certain of the Company’s senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within \nOCI\n.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe Company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. The Company does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal at risk.\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company was a party to six pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of the fixed-rate notes as detailed in the table below.\n66\nTable of Content\ns\n($ in millions)\n2024\nDebt Instrument\nPar Value of Debt\nNumber of Interest Rate Swaps Held\nTotal Swap Notional Amount\n4.50% notes due 2033\n$\n1,500 \n6 \n$\n1,500 \nThe interest rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) swap rate. The fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the SOFR swap rate are recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting fair value changes in the swap contracts. In January 2025, the Company entered into an additional interest rate swap with a notional amount of $250 million related to its 5.00% notes due 2053. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe Company’s investment portfolio includes cash equivalents and short-term investments, the market values of which are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates. The market value of the Company’s medium- to long-term fixed-rate investments is modestly affected by changes in U.S. interest rates. Changes in medium- to long-term U.S. interest rates have a more significant impact on the market value of the Company’s fixed-rate borrowings, which generally have longer maturities. A sensitivity analysis to measure potential changes in the market value of Merck’s investments and debt from a change in interest rates indicated that a one percentage point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have positively affected the net aggregate market value of these instruments by $2.4 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. A one percentage point decrease at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would have negatively affected the net aggregate market value by $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. The fair value of Merck’s debt was determined using pricing models reflecting one percentage point shifts in the appropriate yield curves. The fair values of Merck’s investments were determined using a combination of pricing and duration models.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company’s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities in a business combination (primarily IPR&D, other intangible assets and contingent consideration), as well as subsequent fair value measurements. Additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts, rebates and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-based milestone payments and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates. Application of the following accounting policies result in accounting estimates having the potential for the most significant impact on the financial statements.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nTo determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses, the Company makes certain judgments, which include assessment of the inputs, processes, and outputs associated with the acquired set of activities. If the Company determines that substantially all of the fair value of gross assets included in a transaction is concentrated in a single asset (or a group of similar assets), the assets would not represent a business. To be considered a business, the assets in a transaction need to include an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create outputs. \nIn a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. The fair values of intangible assets are determined utilizing information available near the acquisition date based on expectations and assumptions that are deemed reasonable by management. Given the considerable judgment involved in determining fair values, the Company typically obtains assistance from third-party valuation specialists for significant items. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are generally recognized at fair value. If fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly, the Company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company’s intended use of those assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to \n67\nTable of Content\ns\nrestructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition. \nThe judgments made in determining estimated fair values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company’s results of operations.\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset’s discounted projected net cash flows. The Company’s estimates of market participant net cash flows consider historical and projected pricing, margins and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain additional marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the products; the extent and timing of potential new product introductions by the Company’s competitors; and the life of each asset’s underlying patent and related patent term extension, if any. The net cash flows are then probability-adjusted where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized in the valuation. The probability-adjusted future net cash flows of each product are then discounted to present value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to IPR&D are also determined using an income approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset’s probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages of development of each product and the associated probability of successful completion. The net cash flows are then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&D are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each IPR&D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization. \nCertain of the Company’s business combinations involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment. \nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the acquisition date. \nContingent Sales-Based Milestones\nThe terms of certain business development transactions, including collaborative arrangements, licensing agreements and asset acquisitions, require the Company to make payments contingent upon the achievement of sales-based milestones. Sales-based milestones payable by Merck are accrued and capitalized, subject to cumulative amortization catch-up, when determined by the Company to be probable of being achieved based on future sales forecasts. The amortization catch-up is calculated either from the time of the first regulatory approval for products that were unapproved at the time the transaction was completed or, for new indications of products that were approved prior to the transaction, from the time the transaction was completed. The related intangible asset that is recognized is amortized over its remaining useful life, subject to impairment testing.\nRevenue Recognition\nRecognition of revenue requires evidence of a contract, probable collection of sales proceeds and completion of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. The majority of the Company’s contracts related to the Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n68\nTable of Content\ns\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the Company is entitled to payment. For certain services in the Animal Health segment, revenue is recognized over time, generally ratably over the contract term as services are provided. These service revenues are not material.\nThe nature of the Company’s business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method, although the most likely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts. \nIn the U.S., sales discounts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale, through an intermediary wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of rebates. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. In addition, if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year, sales are recorded net of time value of money discounts, which have not been material. \nThe U.S. provision for aggregate customer discounts covers chargebacks and rebates. Chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The wholesaler then charges the Company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price agreed to between Merck and the customer. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company’s wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. The Company uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. Merck remains committed to the 340B Program and to providing 340B discounts to eligible covered entities. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding 340B legal proceedings.\nSummarized information about changes in the aggregate customer discount accrual related to U.S. sales is as follows:\n($ in millions)\n2024\n2023\nBalance January 1\n$\n2,486\n \n$\n2,918 \nCurrent provision\n13,450\n \n12,540 \nAdjustments to prior years\n(139)\n(70)\nPayments\n(13,334)\n(12,902)\nBalance December 31\n$\n2,463\n \n$\n2,486 \nAccruals for chargebacks are reflected as a direct reduction to accounts receivable and accruals for rebates as current liabilities. The accrued balances relative to these provisions included in \nAccounts receivable\n and \nAccrued and other current liabilities\n were $293 million and $2.2 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and were $188 million and $2.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\nOutside of the U.S., variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebates are a combination of commercially-driven discounts in highly competitive product classes, discounts required to gain or maintain reimbursement, or legislatively mandated rebates. In certain European countries, legislatively mandated rebates are calculated based on an estimate of the government’s total unbudgeted spending and the Company’s specific payback obligation. Rebates may also be required based on specific product sales thresholds. The Company applies an estimated factor against its actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate obligations associated with the sale.\nThe Company maintains a returns policy that allows its U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, three to six months before and 12 months after product expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns. Additionally, the Company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of generic or other competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. The product returns \n69\nTable of Content\ns\nprovision for U.S. pharmaceutical sales as a percentage of U.S. net pharmaceutical sales was 0.8% in 2024, 1.0% in 2023 and 1.1% in 2022. Outside of the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\nMerck’s payment terms for U.S. pharmaceutical customers are typically 36 days from receipt of invoice and for U.S. animal health customers are typically 30 days from receipt of invoice; however, certain products have longer payment terms, including \nKeytruda\n, which has payment terms of 90 days. Payment terms for vaccine sales in the U.S. typically range from 30 days to 60 days. Outside of the U.S., payment terms are typically 30 days to 90 days, although certain markets have longer payment terms.\nThrough its distribution programs with U.S. wholesalers, the Company encourages wholesalers to align purchases with underlying demand and maintain inventories below specified levels. The terms of the programs allow the wholesalers to earn fees upon providing visibility into their inventory levels, as well as by achieving certain performance parameters such as inventory management, customer service levels, reducing shortage claims and reducing product returns. Information provided through the wholesaler distribution programs includes items such as sales trends, inventory on-hand, on-order quantity and product returns.\nInventories Produced in Preparation for Product Launches\nThe Company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches sufficient to support estimated initial market demand. Capitalization of such inventory does not begin until regulatory approval is considered by the Company to be probable. The Company monitors the status of each respective product during the research and regulatory approval process. If the Company is aware of any specific risks or contingencies other than the normal regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during the research process relating to safety, efficacy, manufacturing, marketing or labeling, the related inventory would generally not be capitalized. Expiry dates of the inventory are affected by the stage of completion. The Company manages the levels of inventory at each stage to optimize the shelf life of the inventory in relation to anticipated market demand in order to avoid product expiry issues. For inventories that are capitalized, anticipated future sales and shelf lives support the realization of the inventory value as the inventory shelf life is sufficient to meet initial product launch requirements. Inventories produced in preparation for product launches capitalized at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $412 million and $790 million, respectively.\nContingencies and Environmental Liabilities\nThe Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property, commercial litigation and securities litigation, as well as certain additional matters, including governmental and environmental matters (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. Generally, for product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.\nLegal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of the Company’s legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of legal defense reserves as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 of approximately $225 million and $210 million, respectively, represents the Company’s best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the Company. The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. When a legitimate claim for contribution is asserted, a liability is initially accrued based upon the estimated transaction costs to manage the site. Accruals are adjusted as site investigations, feasibility studies and related cost assessments of remedial techniques are completed, and as the extent to which other potentially responsible parties who may be jointly and severally liable can be expected to contribute is determined.\n70\nTable of Content\ns\nThe Company is also remediating environmental contamination resulting from past industrial activity at certain of its sites and takes an active role in identifying and accruing for these costs. In the past, Merck performed a worldwide survey to assess all sites for potential contamination resulting from past industrial activities. Where assessment indicated that physical investigation was warranted, such investigation was performed, providing a better evaluation of the need for remedial action. Where such need was identified, remedial action was then initiated. As definitive information became available during the course of investigations and/or remedial efforts at each site, estimates were refined and accruals were established or adjusted accordingly. These estimates and related accruals continue to be refined annually.\nThe Company believes that there are no compliance issues associated with applicable environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Expenditures for remediation and environmental liabilities were $4 million in 2024 and are estimated to be $26 million in the aggregate for the years 2025 through 2029. In management’s opinion, the liabilities for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $41 million and $42 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next 15 years. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed approximately $46 million in the aggregate. Management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity for any year.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company expenses all share-based payment awards to employees, including grants of stock options, over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of certain share-based awards using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model which uses both historical and current market data to estimate the fair value. This method incorporates various assumptions such as the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected life of the options. Total pretax share-based compensation expense was $761 million in 2024, $645 million in 2023 and $541 million in 2022. At December 31, 2024, there was $1.1 billion of total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock option, restricted stock unit and performance share unit awards which will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. For segment reporting, share-based compensation costs are unallocated expenses.\nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nNet periodic benefit cost for pension plans totaled $107 million in 2024, $126 million in 2023 and $554 million in 2022. Net periodic benefit credit for other postretirement benefit plans was $84 million in 2024, $61 million in 2023 and $93 million in 2022. Pension and other postretirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is calculated using actuarial assumptions including a discount rate for plan benefit obligations and an expected rate of return on plan assets. The changes in net periodic benefit cost year over year for pension plans are primarily attributable to lower settlement charges incurred by certain plans in 2024 and 2023 compared with 2022, as well as changes in expected returns and the discount rates.\nThe Company reassesses its benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. For both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the discount rate is evaluated on measurement dates and modified to reflect the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed-income debt instruments that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligation as they come due. The discount rates for the Company’s U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans ranged from 5.50% to 5.70% at December 31, 2024, compared with a range of 5.25% to 5.45% at December 31, 2023.\nThe expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid. In developing the expected rate of return, the Company considers long-term compound annualized returns of historical market data, current market conditions and actual returns on the Company’s plan assets. Using this reference information, the Company develops forward-looking return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected long-term rate of return for a target portfolio allocated across these investment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. For 2025, the expected rate of return for the Company’s U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans will be 7.70% compared with 7.75% in 2024. \nThe Company has established investment guidelines for its U.S. pension and other postretirement plans to create an asset allocation that is expected to deliver a rate of return sufficient to meet the long-term obligation of each plan, given an acceptable level of risk. The target investment portfolio of the Company’s U.S. pension and other \n71\nTable of Content\ns\npostretirement benefit plans is allocated 25% to 40% in U.S. equities, 15% to 30% in international equities, 40% to 50% in fixed-income investments, and up to 8% in cash and other investments. The portfolio’s equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the plans’ benefit obligations. The expected annual standard deviation of returns of the target portfolio, which approximates 12%, reflects both the equity allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in which the portfolio invests. For international pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local government rules and regulations. Although a significant percentage of plan assets are invested in U.S. equities, concentration risk is mitigated through the use of strategies that are diversified within management guidelines.\nActuarial assumptions are based upon management’s best estimates and judgment. A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have had an estimated $45 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on the Company’s net periodic benefit cost in 2024. A reasonably possible change of plus (minus) 25 basis points in the expected rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have had an estimated $57 million favorable (unfavorable) impact on Merck’s net periodic benefit cost in 2024. Required funding obligations for 2025 relating to the Company’s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be material. The preceding hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected rate of return assumptions would not impact the Company’s funding requirements.\nNet gain/loss amounts, which primarily reflect differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recorded as a component of \nAOCL\n. Expected returns for pension plans are based on a calculated market-related value of assets. Net gain/loss amounts in \nAOCL\n in excess of certain thresholds are amortized into net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service life of employees. \nRestructuring Costs\nRestructuring costs have been recorded in connection with restructuring program activities. As a result, the Company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans, including future employee termination costs to be incurred in conjunction with involuntary separations when such separations are probable and estimable. When accruing termination costs, the Company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. In connection with these actions, management also assesses the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business. In certain instances, asset lives have been shortened based on changes in the expected useful lives of the affected assets. Severance and employee-related costs, as well as other costs, such as facility shut-down costs, are reflected within \nRestructuring costs\n. Asset-related charges are reflected within \nCost of sales\n, \nSelling, general and administrative\n expenses and \nResearch and development\n expenses depending upon the nature of the asset.\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company assesses changes in economic, regulatory and legal conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets.\nThe Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its long-lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows approach.\nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units and evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Some of the factors considered in the assessment include general macroeconomic conditions, conditions specific to the industry and market, cost factors which could have a significant effect on earnings or cash flows, the overall financial performance of the reporting unit, and whether there have been sustained declines in the Company’s share price. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).\nOther acquired intangible assets (excluding IPR&D) are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When events or \n72\nTable of Content\ns\ncircumstances warrant a review, the Company will assess recoverability from future operations using pretax undiscounted cash flows derived from the lowest appropriate asset groupings. Impairments are recognized in operating results to the extent that the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.\nIPR&D that the Company acquires in conjunction with a business combination represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. The amounts are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. The Company evaluates IPR&D for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist (such as unfavorable clinical trial data, changes in the commercial landscape or delays in the clinical development program and related regulatory filing and approval timelines), by performing a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the IPR&D intangible asset with its carrying value. For impairment testing purposes, the Company may combine separately recorded IPR&D intangible assets into one unit of account based on the relevant facts and circumstances. Generally, the Company will combine IPR&D intangible assets for testing purposes if they operate as a single asset and are essentially inseparable. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.\nThe judgments made in evaluating impairment of long-lived intangibles can materially affect the Company’s results of operations.\nTaxes on Income\nThe Company’s effective tax rate is based on pretax income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates. An estimated effective tax rate for a year is applied to the Company’s quarterly operating results. In the event that there is a significant unusual or one-time item recognized, or expected to be recognized, in the Company’s quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item would be separately calculated and recorded at the same time as the unusual or one-time item. The Company considers the resolution of prior year tax matters to be such items. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s tax provision and in evaluating its tax positions. The recognition and measurement of a tax position is based on management’s best judgment given the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. If the more likely than not threshold is not met in the period for which a tax position is taken, the Company may subsequently recognize the benefit of that tax position if the tax matter is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires, or if the more likely than not threshold is met in a subsequent period (see Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).\nTax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which the Company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. The Company establishes valuation allowances for its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the Company has already taken a deduction on the tax return, but has not yet recognized as expense in the financial statements. \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results\nThis report and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain so-called “forward-looking statements,” all of which are based on management’s current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements. One can identify these forward-looking statements by their use of words such as “anticipates,” “expects,” “plans,” “will,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “projects” and other words of similar meaning, or negative variations of any of the foregoing. One can also identify them by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address the Company’s growth strategy, financial results, product approvals, product potential, development programs, environmental or other sustainability initiatives. One must carefully consider any \n73\nTable of Content\ns\nsuch statement and should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company’s forward-looking statements. These factors include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially.\nThe Company does not assume the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. One should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors, including risk factors, described in the Company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, especially on this Form 10-K and Forms 10-Q and 8-K. In",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this annual report on Form 10-K the Company discusses in more detail various important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results. The Company notes these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete statement of all potential risks or uncertainties. \nItem 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nThe information required by this Item is incorporated by reference to the discussion under “Financial Instruments Market Risk Disclosures” in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n74\nTable of Content\ns\nItem 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.                \n(a)\nFinancial Statements\nThe consolidated balance sheet of Merck & Co., Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income (loss), of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, the notes to consolidated financial statements, and the report dated February 25, 2025 of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, are as follows:\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nMerck & Co., Inc. and Subsidiaries\nYears Ended December 31\n($ in millions except per share amounts)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSales\n$\n64,168\n \n$\n60,115\n \n$\n59,283\n \nCosts, Expenses and Other\nCost of sales\n15,193\n \n16,126\n \n17,411\n \nSelling, general and administrative\n10,816\n \n10,504\n \n10,042\n \nResearch and development\n17,938\n \n30,531\n \n13,548\n \nRestructuring costs\n309\n \n599\n \n337\n \nOther (income) expense, net\n(\n24\n)\n466\n \n1,501\n \n \n44,232\n \n58,226\n \n42,839\n \nIncome Before Taxes\n19,936\n \n1,889\n \n16,444\n \nTaxes on Income\n2,803\n \n1,512\n \n1,918\n \nNet Income\n17,133\n \n377\n \n14,526\n \nLess: Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n16\n \n12\n \n7\n \nNet Income Attributable to Merck & Co., Inc.\n$\n17,117\n \n$\n365\n \n$\n14,519\n \nBasic Earnings per Common Share Attributable to Merck & Co., Inc.

amounts)\n1.   \nNature of Operations\nMerck & Co., Inc. (Merck or the Company) is a global health care company that delivers innovative health solutions through its prescription medicines, including biologic therapies, vaccines and animal health products. The Company’s operations are principally managed on a product basis and include \ntwo\n operating segments, Pharmaceutical and Animal Health, both of which are reportable segments. \nThe Pharmaceutical segment includes human health pharmaceutical and vaccine products. Human health pharmaceutical products consist of therapeutic and preventive agents, generally sold by prescription, for the treatment of human disorders. The Company sells these human health pharmaceutical products primarily to drug wholesalers and retailers, hospitals, government agencies and managed health care providers such as health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers and other institutions. Human health vaccine products consist of preventive pediatric, adolescent and adult vaccines. The Company sells these human health vaccines primarily to physicians, wholesalers, distributors and government entities. \nThe Animal Health segment discovers, develops, manufactures and markets a wide range of veterinary pharmaceutical and vaccine products, as well as health management solutions and services, for the prevention, treatment and control of disease in all major livestock and companion animal species. The Company also offers an extensive suite of digitally connected identification, traceability and monitoring products. The Company sells its products to veterinarians, distributors, animal producers, farmers and pet owners.\n2.    \nSummary of Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation —\n \nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Controlling interest is determined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third-party participating rights or, in the case of variable interest entities, by majority exposure to expected losses, residual returns or both. For those consolidated subsidiaries where Merck ownership is less than 100%, the outside shareholders’ interests are shown as \nNoncontrolling interests\n in equity. Investments in affiliates over which the Company has significant influence but not a controlling interest, such as interests in entities owned equally by the Company and a third party that are under shared control, are carried on the equity method basis.\nAcquisitions —\n \nIn a business combination, the acquisition method of accounting requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded as of the date of the acquisition at their respective fair values with limited exceptions. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies are generally recognized at fair value. If fair value cannot be determined, the asset or liability is recognized if probable and reasonably estimable; if these criteria are not met, no asset or liability is recognized. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accordingly, the Company may be required to value assets at fair value measures that do not reflect the Company’s intended use of those assets. Any excess of the purchase price (consideration transferred) over the estimated fair values of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results of the acquired business are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition. \nIf the Company determines the assets acquired do not meet the definition of a business under the acquisition method of accounting, the transaction will be accounted for as an acquisition of assets rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired in-process research and development (IPR&D) with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the acquisition date.\nForeign Currency Translation —\n \nThe net assets of international subsidiaries where the local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates and results of operations are translated at average exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in \nOther Comprehensive Income (OCI)\n and remain in \nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n (\nAOCL\n) until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. For those subsidiaries that operate in highly inflationary economies and for those subsidiaries where the U.S. dollar has been determined to be the functional currency, non-monetary foreign currency \n79\nTable of Content\ns\nassets and liabilities are translated using historical rates, while monetary assets and liabilities are translated at current rates, with the U.S. dollar effects of rate changes included in \nOther (income) expense, net\n.\nCash Equivalents —\n \nCash equivalents are comprised of certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of less than three months.\nInventories —\n \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The cost of a substantial majority of U.S. human health inventories is determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method for both financial reporting and tax purposes. The cost of all other inventories is determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Inventories consist of currently marketed products, as well as certain inventories produced in preparation for product launches that are considered by the Company to be probable of obtaining regulatory approval. In evaluating the recoverability of inventories produced in preparation for product launches, the Company considers the likelihood that revenue will be obtained from the future sale of the related inventory together with the status of the product during the research and regulatory approval process.\nInvestments —\n Investments in marketable debt securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value. Fair values of the Company’s investments in marketable debt securities are determined using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or quoted prices for similar assets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Changes in fair value that are not impairment related are reported net of taxes in \nOCI\n. The Company considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairments of its investments in marketable debt securities, including the extent to which fair value is less than cost, whether an allowance for credit loss is required, as well as adverse factors that could affect the value of the securities. An impairment has occurred if the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the marketable debt security. If the Company does not intend to sell the impaired debt security, and it is not more likely than not it will be required to sell the debt security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amount of the impairment recognized in earnings, recorded in \nOther (income) expense, net\n, is limited to the portion attributed to credit loss. The remaining portion of the impairment related to other factors is recognized in \nOCI\n. Realized gains and losses for debt securities are included in \nOther (income) expense, net\n.\nInvestments in publicly traded equity securities are reported at fair value as determined using quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or quoted prices for similar assets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Changes in fair value are included in \nOther (income) expense, net\n. Unrealized gains and losses from investments that are directly owned are determined at the end of the reporting period. Gains and losses from ownership interests in investment funds, which are accounted for as equity method investments, are reported on a one quarter lag. Investments in equity securities without readily determinable fair values are recorded at cost, plus or minus subsequent observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments, minus impairments. Such adjustments are recognized in \nOther (income) expense, net\n. Realized gains and losses for equity securities are included in \nOther (income) expense, net\n.\nRevenue Recognition —\n \nRecognition of revenue requires evidence of a contract, probable collection of sales proceeds and completion of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records revenue on a gross basis. The majority of the Company’s contracts related to the Pharmaceutical and Animal Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer and the Company is entitled to payment. The Company recognizes revenue from the sales of vaccines to the U.S. federal government for placement into vaccine stockpiles in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Interpretation,\n Commission Guidance Regarding Accounting for Sales of Vaccines and BioTerror Countermeasures to the Federal Government for Placement into the Pediatric Vaccine Stockpile or the Strategic National Stockpile\n. This interpretation allows companies to recognize revenue for sales of vaccines into U.S. government stockpiles even though these sales might not meet the criteria for revenue recognition under other accounting guidance. For certain services in the Animal Health segment, revenue is recognized over time, generally ratably over the contract term as services are provided. These service revenues are not material.\nThe nature of the Company’s business gives rise to several types of variable consideration including discounts and returns, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method, although the most likely amount method is used for prompt pay discounts. \n80\nTable of Content\ns\nIn the U.S., sales discounts are issued to customers at the point-of-sale, through an intermediary wholesaler (known as chargebacks), or in the form of rebates. Additionally, sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions. Revenues are recorded net of provisions for sales discounts and returns, which are established at the time of sale. In addition, if collection of accounts receivable is expected to be in excess of one year, sales are recorded net of time value of money discounts, which have not been material. \nThe U.S. provision for aggregate customer discounts covering chargebacks and rebates was $\n13.3\n billion in 2024, $\n12.5\n billion in 2023 and $\n12.3\n billion in 2022. Chargebacks are discounts that occur when a contracted customer purchases through an intermediary wholesaler. The wholesaler then charges the Company back for the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contract price agreed to between Merck and the customer. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company’s wholesale customers to contracted customers, as well as estimated wholesaler inventory levels. Rebates are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. The Company uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. The accrued balances relative to the provisions for chargebacks and rebates included in \nAccounts receivable\n and \nAccrued and other current liabilities\n were $\n293\n million and $\n2.2\n billion, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and were $\n188\n million and $\n2.3\n billion, respectively, at December 31, 2023.\nOutside of the U.S., variable consideration in the form of discounts and rebates are a combination of commercially-driven discounts in highly competitive product classes, discounts required to gain or maintain reimbursement, or legislatively mandated rebates. In certain European countries, legislatively mandated rebates are calculated based on an estimate of the government’s total unbudgeted spending and the Company’s specific payback obligation. Rebates may also be required based on specific product sales thresholds. The Company applies an estimated factor against its actual invoiced sales to represent the expected level of future discount or rebate obligations associated with the sale.\nThe Company maintains a returns policy that allows its U.S. pharmaceutical customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date (generally, \nthree\n to \nsix months\n before and \n12\n months after product expiration). The estimate of the provision for returns is based upon historical experience with actual returns. Additionally, the Company considers factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel, product dating and expiration period, whether products have been discontinued, entrance in the market of generic or other competition, changes in formularies or launch of over-the-counter products, among others. Outside of the U.S., returns are only allowed in certain countries on a limited basis.\nMerck’s payment terms for U.S. pharmaceutical customers are typically \n36\n days from receipt of invoice and for U.S. animal health customers are typically \n30\n days from receipt of invoice; however, certain products have longer payment terms, including \nKeytruda (\npembrolizumab\n)\n, which has payment terms of \n90\n days. Payment terms for vaccine sales in the U.S. typically range from \n30\n days to \n60\n days. Outside of the U.S., payment terms are typically \n30\n days to \n90\n days, although certain markets have longer payment terms.\nSee Note 18 for disaggregated revenue disclosures.\nDepreciation —\n \nDepreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets, principally using the straight-line method. For tax purposes, accelerated tax methods are used. The estimated useful lives primarily range from \n25\n to \n45\n years for \nBuildings\n, and from \n3\n to \n15\n years for \nMachinery, equipment and office furnishings\n.\n Depreciation expense was $\n2.1\n billion in 2024, $\n1.8\n billion in 2023 and $\n1.8\n billion in 2022.\nAdvertising and Promotion Costs —\n Advertising and promotion costs are expensed as incurred.\n The Company recorded advertising and promotion expenses of $\n2.4\n billion in 2024, $\n2.3\n billion in 2023 and $\n2.2\n billion in 2022.\nSoftware Capitalization —\n \nThe Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with obtaining or developing internal-use software including external direct costs of material and services, and payroll costs for employees directly involved with the software development. These costs are included in \nProperty, plant and equipment\n. In addition, the Company capitalizes certain costs incurred to implement a cloud computing arrangement \n81\nTable of Content\ns\nthat is considered a service agreement, which are included in \nOther Assets\n. Capitalized software costs are being amortized over periods ranging from \n2\n to \n10\n years, with the longer lives generally associated with enterprise-wide projects implemented over multiple years. Costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and post-implementation stage, as well as maintenance and training costs, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill —\n \nGoodwill represents the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units and evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative fair value test is performed. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is greater than its fair value, a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded for the difference (up to the carrying value of goodwill).\nAcquired Intangibles —\n \nIntangibles acquired in a business combination include product rights, trade names and patents, licenses and other, which are initially recorded at fair value, assigned an estimated useful life, and amortized primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from \n2\n to \n24\n years. The Company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying values of its acquired intangibles may not be recoverable. If such circumstances are determined to exist, an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows of these assets, or appropriate asset groupings, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the carrying value of the intangible asset and its fair value, which is determined based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows.\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development —\n \nIPR&D that the Company acquires in conjunction with a business combination represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. The amounts are capitalized and are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each IPR&D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization. The Company evaluates IPR&D for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators exist, by performing a quantitative test that compares the fair value of the IPR&D intangible asset with its carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in operating results.\nContingent Consideration for Business Combinations —\n \nCertain of the Company’s acquisitions involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. If the transaction is accounted for as a business combination, the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Significant events that increase or decrease the probability of achieving development and regulatory milestones or that increase or decrease projected cash flows will result in corresponding increases or decreases in the fair values of the related contingent consideration obligations.\n \nResearch and Development —\n \nResearch and development is expensed as incurred. Nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities are expensed when the activity has been performed or when the goods have been received rather than when the payment is made. Research and development expenses include restructuring costs and IPR&D impairment charges. In addition, research and development expenses include expense or income related to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration associated with IPR&D assets. Research and development expenses also include upfront and milestone payments related to asset acquisitions and licensing transactions involving clinical development programs that have not yet received regulatory approval.\n \nCollaborative Arrangements —\n \nMerck has entered into collaborative arrangements that provide the Company with varying rights to develop, produce and market products together with its collaborative partners. When Merck is the principal on sales transactions with third parties, the Company recognizes sales, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses on a gross basis. Profit sharing amounts it pays to its collaborative partners are recorded within \nCost of sales\n. When the collaborative partner is the principal on sales transactions with third parties, the Company records profit sharing amounts received from its collaborative partners as alliance revenue \n82\nTable of Content\ns\n(within \nSales\n). Alliance revenue is recorded net of cost of sales and includes an adjustment to share commercialization costs between the partners in accordance with the collaboration agreement. The adjustment is determined by comparing the commercialization costs Merck has incurred directly and reported within \nSelling, general and administrative\n expenses with the costs the collaborative partner has incurred. Research and development costs Merck incurs related to collaborations are recorded within \nResearch and development\n expenses. Cost reimbursements to the collaborative partner or payments received from the collaborative partner to share these costs pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreements are recorded as increases or decreases to \nResearch and development\n expenses. \nIn addition, the terms of the collaboration agreements may require the Company to make payments based upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory approval or commercial milestones. Upfront and milestone payments payable by Merck to collaborative partners prior to regulatory approval are expensed as incurred and included in \nResearch and development\n expenses. Payments due to collaborative partners upon or subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized to \nCost of sales\n over the estimated useful life of the corresponding intangible asset, provided that future cash flows support the amounts capitalized. Sales-based milestones payable by Merck to collaborative partners are accrued and capitalized, subject to cumulative amortization catch-up, when determined by the Company to be probable of being achieved based on future sales forecasts. The amortization catch-up is calculated either from the time of the first regulatory approval for products that were unapproved at the time the collaboration was formed or, for new indications of approved products, from the time of the formation of the collaboration. The related intangible asset that is recognized is amortized to \nCost of sales\n over its remaining useful life, subject to impairment testing.\nShare-Based Compensation —\n \nThe Company expenses all share-based payments to employees over the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair value of the awards.\nRestructuring Costs —\n \nThe Company records liabilities for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in the period in which the liability is incurred. In accordance with existing benefit arrangements, future employee termination costs to be incurred in conjunction with involuntary separations are accrued when such separations are probable and estimable. When accruing these costs, the Company will recognize the amount within a range of costs that is the best estimate within the range. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company recognizes the minimum amount within the range. Costs for one-time termination benefits in which the employee is required to render service until termination in order to receive the benefits are recognized ratably over the future service period.\nContingencies and Legal Defense Costs —\n \nThe Company records accruals for contingencies and legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.\nTaxes on Income —\n \nDeferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting based on enacted tax laws and rates. The Company evaluates tax positions to determine whether the benefits of tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company recognizes the amount of the benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement in the financial statements. For tax positions that are not more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, the Company does not recognize any portion of the benefit in the financial statements. The Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as a component of \nTaxes on Income\n. The Company accounts for the tax effects of the tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) of certain foreign subsidiaries in the income tax provision in the period the tax arises. The Company’s policy for releasing disproportionate income tax effects from \nAOCL\n is to utilize the item-by-item approach.\nReclassifications —\n \nCertain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.\n \nUse of Estimates —\n \nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) and, accordingly, include certain amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Estimates are used when accounting for amounts recorded in connection with acquisitions, including initial fair value determinations of assets and liabilities in a business combination (primarily IPR&D, other intangible assets and contingent consideration), as well as subsequent fair value measurements. Additionally, estimates are used in determining such items as provisions for sales discounts, rebates and returns, depreciable and amortizable lives, recoverability of inventories, including those produced in preparation for product launches, amounts recorded for contingencies, environmental liabilities, accruals for contingent sales-\n83\nTable of Content\ns\nbased milestone payments and other reserves, pension and other postretirement benefit plan assumptions, share-based compensation assumptions, restructuring costs, impairments of long-lived assets (including intangible assets and goodwill) and investments, and taxes on income. Because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards —\n \nIn August 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended guidance that requires a newly formed joint venture to recognize and initially measure its assets and liabilities at fair value upon formation. The amended guidance includes exceptions to fair value measurement that are consistent with the accounting for business combinations guidance. The Company adopted the guidance effective July 1, 2024 on a prospective basis. There was no impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued guidance intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through expanded disclosures for significant segment expenses. The Company adopted the guidance effective for the 2024 annual period. The guidance resulted in incremental disclosures to the Company’s segment reporting disclosures. See Note 18 for further details.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted —\n \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance intended to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and disaggregation of information in the effective income tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disclosures by jurisdiction. The guidance also includes other amendments to improve the effectiveness of income tax disclosures by removing certain previously required disclosures. The guidance is effective for 2025 annual reporting. The guidance will result in incremental disclosures within the footnotes to the Company’s financial statements. \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance intended to improve financial reporting by requiring entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories at interim and annual reporting periods. The guidance is effective for 2027 annual reporting and 2028 interim reporting. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance, which can be applied on a prospective or retrospective basis, will result in incremental disclosures within the footnotes to the Company’s financial statements.\n \n3.    \nAcquisitions, Divestitures, Research Collaborations and Licensing Agreements\nThe Company continues to pursue acquisitions and the establishment of external alliances such as research collaborations and licensing agreements to complement its internal research capabilities. These arrangements often include upfront payments; expense reimbursements or payments to the third party; milestone, royalty or profit share arrangements contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development; and can also include option and continuation payments. The Company also reviews its marketed products and pipeline to examine candidates which may provide more value through out-licensing and, as part of its portfolio assessment process, may also divest certain assets. Pro forma financial information for acquired businesses is not presented if the historical financial results of the acquired entity are not significant when compared with the Company’s financial results.\nRecent Transactions\nIn January 2025, Merck and WuXi Vaccines, a wholly owned subsidiary of WuXi Biologics, entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which Merck will acquire WuXi Vaccines’ facility in Dundalk, Ireland for a payment of approximately $\n440\n million at closing. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition.\n2024 Transactions\nIn December 2024, Merck closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize MK-2010 (LM-299), a novel investigational PD-1/vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) bispecific antibody from LaNova Medicines Ltd (LaNova). Merck recorded a charge of $\n588\n million to \nResearch and development \nexpenses in 2024 for the upfront payment, which was made in January 2025. LaNova is also eligible to receive $\n300\n million upon technology transfer, which is anticipated to be completed in 2025, as well as future contingent developmental milestone payments of up to $\n140\n million, regulatory milestone payments of up to $\n860\n million and sales-based milestone payments of up to $\n1.4\n billion.\nAlso in December 2024, Merck closed an exclusive global license to develop, manufacture and commercialize MK-4082 (HS-10535), an investigational preclinical oral small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist from Hansoh Pharma (Hansoh). Merck recorded a charge of $\n112\n million to \nResearch and development \nexpenses in 2024 for the upfront payment, which was made in February 2025. Hansoh is also eligible to receive future contingent \n84\nTable of Content\ns\ndevelopment-related milestone payments of up to $\n115\n million, regulatory milestone payments of up to $\n315\n million and sales-based milestone payments of up to $\n1.47\n billion, as well as tiered royalties ranging from a high-single-digit rate to a low-double-digit rate on future net sales of MK-4082 (HS-10535), if approved. Under the agreement, Hansoh may co-promote or solely commercialize MK-4082 (HS-10535) in Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macau, subject to certain conditions.\nIn September 2024, Merck acquired MK-1045 (formally CN201), a novel investigational clinical-stage bispecific antibody for the treatment of B-cell associated diseases, from Curon Biopharmaceutical (Curon) for an upfront payment of $\n700\n million. In addition, Curon is eligible to receive future contingent developmental milestone payments of up to $\n300\n million and regulatory milestone payments of up to $\n300\n million. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Merck recorded a charge of $\n750\n million (reflecting the upfront payment and other related costs) to \nResearch and development\n expenses in 2024 related to the execution of the transaction. In connection with the agreement, Merck is also obligated to pay a third party future contingent developmental, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments of up to $\n128\n million in the aggregate, as well as tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single-digit rate to a low-double-digit rate on future net sales of MK-1045, if approved.\nIn July 2024, Merck acquired the aqua business of Elanco Animal Health Incorporated (Elanco aqua business) for total consideration of $\n1.3\n billion. The Elanco aqua business consists of an innovative portfolio of medicines and vaccines, nutritionals and supplements for aquatic species; \ntwo\n related aqua manufacturing facilities in Canada and Vietnam; as well as a research facility in Chile. The acquisition broadens Animal Health’s aqua portfolio with products, such as \nClynav\n, a new generation DNA-based vaccine that protects Atlantic salmon against pancreas disease, and \nImvixa\n, an anti-parasitic sea lice treatment. This acquisition also brings a portfolio of water treatment products for warm water production, complementing Animal Health’s warm water vaccine portfolio. In addition to these products, the DNA-based vaccine technology that is a part of the business has the potential to accelerate the development of novel vaccines to address the unmet needs of the aqua industry. There are no contingent payments associated with the acquisition, which was accounted for as a business combination.\nThe estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Elanco aqua business are as follows:\nJuly 9, 2024\nInventories\n$\n65\n \nProperty, plant and equipment\n66\nProduct rights - \nClynav \n(useful life \n15\n years) \n(1)\n340\nOther product rights (useful lives \n15\n years) \n(1)\n291\nOther assets and liabilities, net\n23\n \nTotal identifiable net assets\n785\n \nGoodwill \n(2)\n518\nConsideration transferred\n$\n1,303\n \n(1)    \nThe estimated fair values of \nClynav\n and other product rights were determined using an income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. The future probability-weighted net cash flows were discounted to present value utilizing a discount rate of \n8.5\n%. Actual cash flows are likely to be different than those assumed. \n(2)    \nThe goodwill recognized is largely attributable to anticipated synergies expected to arise after the acquisition and was allocated to the Animal Health segment. The goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nAlso in July 2024, Merck acquired Eyebiotech Limited (EyeBio), a privately held ophthalmology-focused biotechnology company, for $\n1.2\n billion (including payments to settle share-based equity awards) and also incurred $\n207\n million of transaction costs. The acquisition agreement also provides for former EyeBio shareholders to receive future contingent developmental milestone payments of up to $\n200\n million (of which $\n100\n million was triggered and paid in 2024 as noted below), regulatory milestone payments of up to $\n1.0\n billion and sales-based milestone payments of up to $\n500\n million. EyeBio’s development work focused on candidates for the prevention and treatment of vision loss associated with retinal vascular leakage, a known risk factor for retinal diseases. EyeBio’s lead candidate, MK-3000 (formerly EYE103), is an investigational, potentially first-in-class tetravalent, tri-specific antibody that acts as an agonist of the Wingless-related integration site signaling pathway, which is in clinical development for the treatment of diabetic macular edema and neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition since MK-3000 accounted for substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (excluding cash and deferred income taxes). Merck recorded net assets of $\n21\n million, as well as a charge of $\n1.35\n billion to \nResearch and development\n expenses in 2024 related to the acquisition. Additionally, a $\n100\n million developmental milestone was triggered and paid in 2024 upon initiation of a Phase 2/3 clinical trial \n85\nTable of Content\ns\nevaluating MK-3000 for the treatment of diabetic macular edema, which was also recorded as a charge to \nResearch and development\n expenses.\nAdditionally in July 2024, Merck and Orion Corporation (Orion) announced the mutual exercise of an option to convert the companies’ ongoing co-development and co-commercialization agreement for opevesostat (MK-5684/ODM-208), an investigational cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1) inhibitor in Phase 3 clinical development, and other candidates targeting CYP11A1, into an exclusive global license for Merck. With the exercise of the option, Merck assumed full responsibility for all past and future development and commercialization expenses associated with the candidates covered by the original agreement entered into in 2022 as discussed below. In addition, Orion became eligible to receive developmental milestone payments of up to $\n30\n million, regulatory milestone payments of up to $\n625\n million and sales-based milestone payments of up to $\n975\n million, as well as annually tiered royalties ranging from a low double-digit rate up to a rate in the low twenties on net sales for any commercialized licensed product. Orion retained responsibility for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supply for Merck. No payment was associated with the exercise of the option, which became effective in September 2024. \nAlso in July 2024, Merck notified Kelun-Biotech (a holding subsidiary of Sichuan Kelun Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) it was terminating the license and collaboration agreement entered into in July 2022 in which Merck gained exclusive worldwide rights for the development, manufacture and commercialization of an investigational antibody drug conjugate (ADC) MK-1200 (SKB315) for the treatment of solid tumors. As a result of this termination, which became effective in September 2024, all rights to SKB315 have reverted to Kelun-Biotech.\nIn March 2024, Merck acquired Harpoon Therapeutics, Inc. (Harpoon), a clinical-stage immunotherapy company developing a novel class of T-cell engagers designed to harness the power of the body’s immune system to treat patients suffering from cancer and other diseases for $\n765\n million and also incurred $\n56\n million of transaction costs. Harpoon’s lead candidate, MK-6070 (formerly HPN328), is a T-cell engager targeting delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), an inhibitory canonical Notch ligand that is expressed at high levels in small-cell lung cancer and neuroendocrine tumors. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition since MK-6070 represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (excluding cash and deferred income taxes). Merck recorded net assets of $\n165\n million, as well as a charge of $\n656\n million to \nResearch and development\n expenses in 2024 related to the transaction. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition. In August 2024, Merck and Daiichi Sankyo expanded their existing global co-development and co-commercialization agreement to include MK-6070. See Note 4 for more information on Merck’s collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo.\n2023 Transactions\nIn October 2023, Merck and Daiichi Sankyo entered into a global development and commercialization agreement for \nthree\n of Daiichi Sankyo’s deruxtecan (DXd) ADC candidates: patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) (MK-1022), ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd) (MK-2400) and raludotatug deruxtecan (R-DXd) (MK-5909). See Note 4 for additional information related to this collaboration.\nIn June 2023, Merck acquired Prometheus Biosciences, Inc. (Prometheus), a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering a precision medicine approach for the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapeutic and companion diagnostic products for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. Total consideration paid of $\n11.0\n billion included $\n1.2\n billion of costs to settle share-based equity awards (including $\n700\n million to settle unvested equity awards). Prometheus’ lead candidate, tulisokibart (MK-7240, formerly PRA023), is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed to tumor necrosis factor-like ligand 1A, a target associated with both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis. Tulisokibart is being developed for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases including ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and other autoimmune conditions. Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating tulisokibart for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are underway. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition since tulisokibart accounted for substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (excluding cash and deferred income taxes). Merck recorded net assets of $\n877\n million, including cash of $\n368\n million, investments of $\n296\n million, deferred tax assets of $\n218\n million and other net liabilities of $\n5\n million, as well as a charge of $\n10.2\n billion to \nResearch and development\n expenses in 2023 related to the transaction. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition.\nIn February 2023, Merck and Kelun-Biotech closed a license and collaboration agreement expanding their relationship in which Merck gained exclusive rights for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of up to \nseven\n investigational preclinical ADCs for the treatment of cancer. Kelun-Biotech retained the right to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize certain licensed and option ADCs for Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macau. Merck made an upfront payment of $\n175\n million, which was recorded as a charge to \nResearch and development\n expenses in 2023. In October 2023, Merck notified Kelun-Biotech it was terminating \ntwo\n of the \nseven\n candidates under the agreement. Subsequently, in April 2024, Merck notified Kelun-Biotech it was terminating \none\n additional candidate under the agreement. In July 2024, Merck notified Kelun-Biotech that it was \n86\nTable of Content\ns\nexercising an existing license option for \none\n of the candidates under the agreement, granting Merck a license for the development, manufacture and commercialization worldwide excluding China. There are now \nthree\n candidates licensed under the original agreement and \none\n candidate for which the license option remains unexercised. Merck paid Kelun-Biotech $\n38\n million in connection with the July option exercise, following which Kelun-Biotech remains eligible to receive future contingent payments aggregating up to $\n540\n million in development-related payments, $\n1.5\n billion in regulatory milestones, and $\n3.1\n billion in sales-based milestones, if Kelun-Biotech does not retain Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macau rights for the remaining option ADC and all remaining candidates achieve regulatory approval. In addition, Kelun-Biotech is eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single-digit rate to a low-double-digit rate on future net sales for any commercialized ADC product. Also, in connection with the agreement, Merck invested $\n100\n million in Kelun-Biotech shares in January 2023.\nIn January 2023, Merck acquired Imago BioSciences, Inc. (Imago), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing new medicines for the treatment of myeloproliferative neoplasms and other bone marrow diseases, for $\n1.35\n billion (including payments to settle share-based equity awards) and also incurred approximately $\n60\n million of transaction costs. Imago’s lead candidate, bomedemstat (MK-3543, formerly IMG-7289), which is in Phase 3 clinical development, is an investigational orally available lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor currently being evaluated in multiple clinical trials for the treatment of essential thrombocythemia, myelofibrosis, and polycythemia vera, in addition to other indications. The transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition since bomedemstat represented substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired (excluding cash and deferred income taxes). Merck recorded net assets of $\n219\n million, as well as a charge of $\n1.2\n billion to \nResearch and development\n expenses in 2023 related to the transaction. There are no future contingent payments associated with the acquisition.\n2022 Transactions\nIn October 2022, Merck and Royalty Pharma plc (Royalty Pharma) entered into a funding arrangement under which Royalty Pharma paid Merck $\n50\n million to co-fund Merck’s development costs for a Phase 2b trial of MK-8189, an investigational oral phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) inhibitor, which was being evaluated for the treatment of schizophrenia. As Royalty Pharma was sharing the risk of technical and regulatory success with Merck, the development funding was recognized by Merck as an obligation to perform contractual services. Accordingly, the payment received was recognized by Merck as a reduction to \nResearch and development\n expenses ratably over the estimated Phase 2b research period. In 2024, it was determined the Phase 2b clinical trial for MK-8189 as a monotherapy for acute schizophrenia did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint; therefore, further development in schizophrenia, bipolar, and dementia indications has stopped, and the funding arrangement was terminated.\nIn September 2022, Merck exercised its option to jointly develop and commercialize V940 (mRNA-4157), an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy, pursuant to the terms of an existing collaboration and license agreement with Moderna, Inc. (Moderna). See Note 4 for additional information related to this collaboration.\nIn August 2022, Merck and Orna Therapeutics (Orna), a biotechnology company pioneering a new investigational class of engineered circular RNA (oRNA) therapies, entered into a collaboration agreement to discover, develop, and commercialize multiple programs, including vaccines and therapeutics in the areas of infectious disease and oncology. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment to Orna of $\n150\n million, which was recorded as a charge to \nResearch and development\n expenses in 2022. In addition, Orna is eligible to receive future contingent payments aggregating up to $\n440\n million in development-related payments, $\n675\n million in regulatory milestones, and $\n2.4\n billion in sales-based milestones associated with the progress of the multiple vaccine and therapeutic programs, as well as royalties ranging from a high-single-digit rate to a low-double-digit rate on any approved products derived from the collaboration. Merck also invested $\n100\n million in Orna’s Series B preferred shares in 2022.\nIn July 2022, Merck and Orion Corporation (Orion) announced a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement for Orion’s investigational candidate opevesostat (MK-5684/ODM-208) and other drugs targeting cytochrome P450 11A1 (CYP11A1), an enzyme important in steroid production. Merck made an upfront payment to Orion of $\n290\n million, which was recorded as a charge to \nResearch and development\n expenses in 2022. Orion is responsible for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supply of opevesostat. In addition, the contract provided both parties with an option to convert the initial co-development and co-commercialization agreement into a global exclusive license to Merck, which was mutually exercised in July 2024 (as noted above).\nIn May 2022, in connection with an existing arrangement, Merck exercised its option to obtain an exclusive license outside of Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan for the development, manufacture and commercialization of Kelun-Biotech’s trophoblast antigen 2 (TROP2)-targeting ADC programs, including its lead compound, sacituzumab tirumotecan (MK-2870/SKB-264), which is currently in Phase 3 clinical development. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck and Kelun-Biotech are collaborating on certain early clinical development plans, \n87\nTable of Content\ns\nincluding evaluating the potential of sacituzumab tirumotecan as a monotherapy and in combination with \nKeytruda \nfor advanced solid tumors. Upon option exercise, Merck made a payment of $\n30\n million, which was recorded as a charge to \nResearch and development\n expenses in 2022. Additionally, Merck made an additional payment of $\n25\n million upon technology transfer in 2023. Merck has also made all contingent developmental milestone payments under the agreement, which aggregated $\n90\n million, nearly all of which were paid in 2024 and were recorded to \nResearch and development\n expenses. In addition, Kelun-Biotech is eligible to receive future contingent milestone payments (which include all program compounds) aggregating up to $\n290\n million in first commercial sale milestones, and $\n780\n million in sales-based milestones. The agreement also provides for Merck to pay tiered royalties ranging from a mid-single-digit rate to a low-double-digit rate on future net sales.\nSpin-Off of Organon & Co.\nIn connection with the 2021 spin-off of Organon & Co. (Organon), Merck and Organon entered into a series of interim operating agreements pursuant to which in various jurisdictions where Merck held licenses, permits and other rights in connection with marketing, import and/or distribution of Organon products prior to the separation, Merck continued to market, import and distribute such products on behalf of Organon until such time as the relevant licenses and permits transferred to Organon, with Organon receiving all of the economic benefits and burdens of such activities. As of December 31, 2024, only \none\n jurisdiction remains under an interim operating agreement. Additionally, Merck and Organon entered into a number of manufacturing and supply agreements (MSAs) with terms ranging from \nfour years\n to \nten years\n. The amounts included in the consolidated statement of income for the above MSAs include sales of $\n392\n million, $\n394\n million and $\n383\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and related cost of sales of $\n390\n million, $\n422\n million and $\n404\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amounts due from Organon under all spin-off related agreements were $\n330\n million and $\n632\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are reflected in \nOther current assets\n. The amounts due to Organon under these agreements were $\n113\n million and $\n598\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and are included in \nAccrued and other current liabilities\n.\n4.    \nCollaborative Arrangements\nMerck has entered into collaborative arrangements that provide the Company with varying rights to develop, produce and market products together with its collaborative partners. Both parties in these arrangements are active participants and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities of the collaboration. Merck’s more significant collaborative arrangements are discussed below.\nAstraZeneca PLC\nIn 2017, Merck and AstraZeneca PLC (AstraZeneca) entered into a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize AstraZeneca’s Lynparza (olaparib) for multiple cancer types. Independently, Merck and AstraZeneca are developing and commercializing Lynparza in combinations with their respective PD-1 and PD-L1 medicines, \nKeytruda\n and Imfinzi. The companies are also jointly developing and commercializing AstraZeneca’s Koselugo (selumetinib) for multiple indications. Under the terms of the agreement, AstraZeneca and Merck share the development and commercialization costs for Lynparza and Koselugo monotherapy and non-PD-1/PD-L1 combination therapy opportunities. \nProfits from Lynparza and Koselugo product sales generated through monotherapies or combination therapies are shared equally. AstraZeneca is the principal on Lynparza and Koselugo sales transactions. Merck records its share of Lynparza and Koselugo product sales, net of cost of sales and commercialization costs, as alliance revenue, and its share of development costs associated with the collaboration as part of \nResearch and development\n expenses. Reimbursements received from AstraZeneca for research and development expenses are recognized as reductions to \nResearch and development\n costs.\nAs part of the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment to AstraZeneca and also made payments over a multi-year period for certain license options. In addition, the agreement provides for contingent payments from Merck to AstraZeneca related to the successful achievement of sales-based and regulatory milestones. \n In 2024, sales of Koselugo triggered a $\n100\n million sales-based milestone payment from Merck to AstraZeneca. Accordingly, Merck recorded a $\n100\n million liability (which remained accrued at December 31, 2024 and was subsequently paid in January 2025) and a corresponding increase to the intangible asset related to Koselugo. Merck also recognized $\n48\n million of cumulative amortization catch-up expense related to the recognition of this milestone in 2024. Merck made a sales-based milestone payment to AstraZeneca of $\n400\n million in 2022 (which had been previously accrued for). Additionally, in 2022, Merck determined it was probable that sales of Lynparza in the future would trigger a $\n600\n million sales-based milestone payment from Merck to AstraZeneca. Accordingly, Merck recorded a $\n600\n million liability (which remained accrued at December 31, 2024 and was \n88\nTable of Content\ns\nsubsequently paid in January 2025) and a corresponding increase to the intangible asset related to Lynparza. Merck also recognized $\n250\n million of cumulative amortization catch-up expense related to the recognition of this milestone in 2022. Potential future sales-based milestone payments of $\n2.0\n billion have not yet been accrued as they are not deemed by the Company to be probable at this time.\nLynparza received regulatory approvals triggering capitalized milestone payments from Merck to AstraZeneca of $\n245\n million, $\n105\n million and $\n250\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively (each of which had been previously accrued for). In 2024, the partners agreed that no future regulatory milestone payments from Merck to AstraZeneca are likely under the agreement.\nThe intangible asset balances related to Lynparza (which includes capitalized sales-based and regulatory milestone payments) and Koselugo (which reflects the 2024 capitalized sales-based milestone payment) were $\n1.2\n billion and $\n49\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and are included in \nOther Intangibles, Net\n. The assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives (through 2028 for Lynparza and through 2029 for Koselugo) as supported by projected future cash flows, subject to impairment testing.\nSummarized financial information related to this collaboration is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAlliance revenue - Lynparza\n$\n1,311\n \n$\n1,199\n \n$\n1,116\n \nAlliance revenue - Koselugo\n170\n \n97\n \n54\n \nTotal alliance revenue\n$\n1,481\n \n$\n1,296\n \n$\n1,170\n \nCost of sales \n(1)\n378\n \n311\n \n492\n \nSelling, general and administrative\n165\n \n192\n \n185\n \nResearch and development\n77\n \n79\n \n106\n \nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nReceivables from AstraZeneca included in \nOther current assets\n$\n424\n \n$\n341\n \nPayables to AstraZeneca included in \nAccrued and other current liabilities\n (2)\n713\n \n256\n \nPayables to AstraZeneca included in \nOther Noncurrent Liabilities \n(2)\n—\n \n600\n \n(1)    \nRepresents amortization of capitalized milestone payments.

(Eisai) announced a strategic collaboration for the worldwide co-development and co-commercialization of Lenvima (lenvatinib), an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor discovered by Eisai. Under the agreement, Merck and Eisai are developing and commercializing Lenvima jointly, both as monotherapy and in combination with \nKeytruda\n. Eisai records Lenvima product sales globally (Eisai is the principal on Lenvima sales transactions) and Merck and Eisai share applicable profits equally. Merck records its share of Lenvima product sales, net of cost of sales and commercialization costs, as alliance revenue. Expenses incurred during co-development are shared by the two companies in accordance with the collaboration agreement and reflected in \nResearch and development \nexpenses. Certain expenses incurred solely by Merck or Eisai are not shareable under the collaboration agreement, including costs incurred in excess of agreed upon caps and costs related to certain combination studies of \nKeytruda\n and Lenvima.\nUnder the agreement, Merck made an upfront payment to Eisai and also made payments over a multi-year period for certain option rights. In addition, the agreement provides for contingent payments from Merck to Eisai related to the successful achievement of sales-based and regulatory milestones. \nMerck made sales-based milestone payments to Eisai aggregating $\n125\n million, $\n125\n million and $\n600\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. In 2023, Merck determined it was probable that sales of Lenvima in the future would trigger $\n250\n million of sales-based milestone payments from Merck to Eisai. Accordingly, Merck recorded $\n250\n million of liabilities (of which $\n125\n million was subsequently paid in each of 2024 and 2023 as noted above) and corresponding increases to the intangible asset related to Lenvima. Merck also recognized $\n154\n million of cumulative amortization catch-up expense related to the recognition of these milestones in 2023. Potential future sales-based milestone payments of $\n2.3\n billion have not yet been accrued as they are not deemed by the Company to be probable at this time.\n89\nTable of Content\ns\nIn 2022, Lenvima received regulatory approvals triggering capitalized milestone payments of $\n50\n million from Merck to Eisai. There are no regulatory milestone payments remaining under the agreement.\nThe intangible asset balance related to Lenvima (which includes capitalized sales-based and regulatory milestone payments) was $\n442\n million at December 31, 2024 and is included in \nOther Intangibles, Net\n. The amount is being amortized over its estimated useful life through 2026 as supported by projected future cash flows, subject to impairment testing.\nSummarized financial information related to this collaboration is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAlliance revenue - Lenvima\n$\n1,010\n \n$\n960\n \n$\n876\n \nCost of sales\n (1)\n241\n \n381\n \n212\n \nSelling, general and administrative\n159\n \n189\n \n158\n \nResearch and development\n21\n \n66\n \n136\n \nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nReceivables from Eisai included in \nOther current assets\n$\n257\n \n$\n226\n \nPayables to Eisai included in \nAccrued and other current liabilities\n \n(2)\n—\n \n125\n \n(1)     \nRepresents amortization of capitalized milestone payments.

The two companies have implemented a joint development and commercialization strategy. Under the agreement, Bayer commercializes Adempas in the Americas, while Merck commercializes in the rest of the world. For Verquvo, Merck commercializes in the U.S. and Bayer commercializes in the rest of the world. Both companies share in development costs and profits on sales. Merck records sales of Adempas and Verquvo in its marketing territories, as well as alliance revenue. Alliance revenue represents Merck’s share of profits from sales of Adempas and Verquvo in Bayer’s marketing territories, which are product sales net of cost of sales and commercialization costs. Cost of sales includes Bayer’s share of profits from sales in Merck’s marketing territories. \nIn addition, the agreement provided for contingent payments from Merck to Bayer related to the successful achievement of sales-based milestones. In 2022, Merck made the final $\n400\n million sales-based milestone payment under this collaboration to Bayer. \nThe intangible asset balances related to Adempas (which includes the acquired intangible asset balance, as well as capitalized sales-based milestone payments attributed to Adempas) and Verquvo (which reflects the portion of the final sales-based milestone payment that was attributed to Verquvo) were $\n372\n million and $\n42\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and are included in \nOther Intangibles, Net\n. The assets are being amortized over their estimated useful lives (through 2027 for Adempas and through 2031 for Verquvo) as supported by projected future cash flows, subject to impairment testing.\n90\nTable of Content\ns\nSummarized financial information related to this collaboration is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAlliance revenue - Adempas/Verquvo\n$\n415\n \n$\n367\n \n$\n341\n \nNet sales of Adempas recorded by Merck\n287\n \n255\n \n238\n \nNet sales of Verquvo recorded by Merck\n37\n \n36\n \n22\n \nTotal sales\n$\n739\n \n$\n658\n \n$\n601\n \nCost of sales \n(1)\n244\n \n224\n \n210\n \nSelling, general and administrative\n111\n \n131\n \n153\n \nResearch and development\n102\n \n90\n \n75\n \nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nReceivables from Bayer included in \nOther current assets\n$\n160\n \n$\n156\n \nPayables to Bayer included in\n Accrued and other current liabilities\n82\n \n80\n \n(1)    \nIncludes amortization of intangible assets, cost of products sold by Merck, as well as Bayer’s share of profits from sales in Merck’s marketing territories. \nRidgeback Biotherapeutics LP\nIn 2020, Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP (Ridgeback), a closely held biotechnology company, entered into a collaboration agreement to develop \nLagevrio \n(molnupiravir), an investigational orally available antiviral candidate for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Merck gained exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize \nLagevrio\n and related molecules. Following initial authorizations in certain markets in 2021, \nLagevrio\n has since received multiple additional authorizations.\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Ridgeback received an upfront payment and is eligible to receive future contingent payments dependent upon the achievement of certain developmental and regulatory approval milestones. The agreement also provides for Merck to reimburse Ridgeback for a portion of certain third-party contingent milestone payments and royalties on net sales, which is part of the profit-sharing calculation. Merck is the principal on sales transactions, recognizing sales and related costs, with profit-sharing amounts recorded within \nCost of sales\n. Profits from the collaboration are split equally between the partners. Reimbursements from Ridgeback for its share of research and development costs (deducted from Ridgeback’s share of profits) are reflected as decreases to \nResearch and development\n expenses. \nSummarized financial information related to this collaboration is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet sales of \nLagevrio\n recorded by Merck\n$\n964\n \n$\n1,428\n \n$\n5,684\n \nCost of sales \n(1)\n554\n \n852\n \n3,038\n \nSelling, general and administrative \n57\n \n97\n \n147\n \nResearch and development \n13\n \n60\n \n88\n \nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nPayables to Ridgeback included in \nAccrued and other current liabilities\n \n(2)\n$\n68\n \n$\n113\n \n(1)    \nIncludes cost of products sold by Merck, Ridgeback’s share of profits, royalty expense, amortization of capitalized milestone payments and inventory reserves.\n(2)    \nIncludes accrued royalties. \nDaiichi Sankyo\nIn October 2023, Merck and Daiichi Sankyo entered into a global development and commercialization agreement for \nthree\n of Daiichi Sankyo’s DXd ADC candidates: patritumab deruxtecan (HER3-DXd) (MK-1022), ifinatamab deruxtecan (I-DXd) (MK-2400) and raludotatug deruxtecan (R-DXd) (MK-5909). All \nthree\n potentially first-in-class DXd ADCs are in various stages of clinical development for the treatment of multiple solid tumors both as monotherapy and/or in combination with other treatments. The companies will jointly develop and potentially commercialize these ADC candidates worldwide, except in Japan where Daiichi Sankyo will maintain exclusive rights. Daiichi Sankyo will be solely responsible for manufacturing and supply.\n91\nTable of Content\ns\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Merck made payments to Daiichi Sankyo totaling $\n4.0\n billion in 2023. These payments included $\n1.0\n billion ($\n500\n million each for patritumab deruxtecan and ifinatamab deruxtecan) which may be refundable on a pro-rated basis in the event of early termination of development with respect to either program. In addition, the agreement provided for a continuation payment of $\n750\n million related to patritumab deruxtecan, which Merck paid in October 2024, and a continuation payment of $\n750\n million related to raludotatug deruxtecan due from Merck in October 2025. If Merck does not make the remaining continuation payment for raludotatug deruxtecan, the rights for that program will revert to Daiichi Sankyo and the non-refundable upfront payments already paid will be retained by Daiichi Sankyo. The agreement also provides for contingent payments from Merck to Daiichi Sankyo of up to an additional $\n5.5\n billion for each DXd ADC upon the successful achievement of certain sales-based milestones.\nIn conjunction with this transaction, Merck recorded an aggregate pretax charge of $\n5.5\n billion to \nResearch and development\n expenses in 2023 for the $\n4.0\n billion of upfront payments and the $\n1.5\n billion of continuation payments. Merck determined it was appropriate to expense the $\n1.0\n billion refundable portion of the consideration in 2023 because of the significant number of clinical studies that were underway and planned in the near future, as well as certain studies in advanced stages, making it highly likely that the programs would continue to progress and incur substantial expenses, and therefore the likelihood of the programs terminating before the end of the refundable period was deemed remote. Merck also determined that it was appropriate to expense the continuation payments upon execution of the agreement because such payments do not result in the Company gaining any additional intellectual property rights. In addition, the significant number of ongoing and planned clinical studies and the short-term nature of the option period makes the likelihood of Merck not making these payments remote.\nMerck and Daiichi Sankyo equally share research and development costs, except for raludotatug deruxtecan, where Merck is responsible for \n75\n% of the first $\n2.0\n billion of research and development expenses. Merck includes its share of development costs associated with the collaboration as part of \nResearch and development\n expenses. Following regulatory approval, Daiichi Sankyo will generally record sales worldwide (Daiichi Sankyo will be the principal on sales transactions) and the companies will equally share expenses as well as profits worldwide except for Japan where Daiichi Sankyo retains exclusive rights and Merck will receive a \n5\n% sales-based royalty. Merck will record its share of product sales, net of cost of sales and commercialization costs, as alliance revenue. \nIn August 2024, Merck and Daiichi Sankyo expanded their agreement to include MK-6070, an investigational delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3) targeting T-cell engager, which Merck obtained through its acquisition of Harpoon (see Note 3). The companies are planning to evaluate MK-6070 in combination with ifinatamab deruxtecan in certain patients with SCLC, as well as other potential combinations. Merck received an upfront cash payment of $\n170\n million from Daiichi Sankyo (recorded within \nOther (income) expense, net\n) and has also satisfied a contingent quid obligation from the original collaboration agreement. The companies will jointly develop and commercialize MK-6070 worldwide and share research and development and commercialization expenses. Research and development expenses related to MK-6070 in combination with ifinatamab deruxtecan will be shared in a manner consistent with the original agreement for ifinatamab deruxtecan. Merck will be solely responsible for manufacturing and supply of MK-6070. If approved, Merck will generally record sales for MK-6070 worldwide (Merck will be the principal on sales transactions) and the companies will equally share expenses as well as profits worldwide, except for Japan where Merck retains exclusive rights and Daiichi Sankyo will receive a \n5\n% sales-based royalty.\nSummarized financial information related to this collaboration is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\nSelling, general and administrative\n$\n26\n \n$\n3\n \nResearch and development \n(1)\n351\n \n5,549\n \nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nReceivables from Daiichi Sankyo included in \nOther current assets\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n—\n \nPayables to Daiichi Sankyo included in \nAccrued and other current liabilities \n(2)\n817\n \n800\n \nPayables to Daiichi Sankyo included in \nOther Noncurrent Liabilities \n(2)\n—\n \n750\n \n(1)    \nExpenses in 2023 include the $\n5.5\n billion charge for the upfront and continuing option payments noted above.\n(2)    \nIncludes accrued continuation payment.\n92\nTable of Content\ns\nModerna, Inc.\nIn 2022, Merck exercised its option to jointly develop and commercialize V940 (mRNA-4157), an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy, pursuant to the terms of an existing collaboration and license agreement with Moderna, Inc. (Moderna), which resulted in a $\n250\n million payment that was charged to \nResearch and development\n expenses in 2022. V940 (mRNA-4157) is currently being evaluated in combination with \nKeytruda\n in multiple Phase 3 clinical trials. Merck and Moderna share costs and will share any profits equally under this worldwide collaboration. Merck records its share of development costs associated with the collaboration as part of \nResearch and development\n expenses. Any reimbursements received from Moderna for research and development expenses are recognized as reductions to\n Research and development \ncosts. Merck has also capitalized certain of the shared costs, mainly related to facility costs, which aggregated $\n198\n million at December 31, 2024 and will be amortized over the assets’ estimated useful lives. \nSummarized financial information related to this collaboration is as follows:\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nSelling, general and administrative \n$\n16\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n—\n \nResearch and development \n(1)\n358\n \n218\n \n288\n \nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nPayables to Moderna included in \nAccrued and other current liabilities\n$\n57\n \n$\n63\n \n(1)\n    Expenses in 2022 include the $\n250\n million option exercise payment noted above.\nBristol-Myers Squibb Company\nReblozyl (luspatercept-aamt) is a first-in-class erythroid maturation recombinant fusion protein that is being commercialized through a global collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS). Reblozyl is approved in the U.S., Europe, and certain other markets for the treatment of anemia in certain rare blood disorders and is also being evaluated for additional indications for hematology therapies. BMS is the principal on sales transactions for Reblozyl; however, Merck co-promotes Reblozyl (and may co-promote any future products approved under this collaboration) in North America, which is reimbursed by BMS. Merck receives tiered royalties ranging from \n20\n% to \n24\n% based on sales levels. This royalty will be reduced by \n50\n% upon the earlier of patent expiry or generic entry on an indication-by-indication basis in each market. Additionally, Merck is eligible to receive future contingent sales-based milestone payments of up to $\n80\n million. Alliance revenue related to this collaboration (recorded within \nSales\n) consists of royalties and, for 2022, also includes the receipt of a regulatory approval milestone payment of $\n20\n million. Merck recorded alliance revenue related to this collaboration of $\n371\n million in 2024, $\n212\n million in 2023 and $\n166\n million in 2022.\n5.    \nRestructuring\nIn January 2024, the Company approved a new restructuring program (2024 Restructuring Program) intended to continue the optimization of the Company’s Human Health global manufacturing network as the future pipeline shifts to new modalities and also optimize the Animal Health global manufacturing network to improve supply reliability and increase efficiency. The actions contemplated under the 2024 Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2031, with the cumulative pretax costs to be incurred by the Company to implement the program estimated to be approximately $\n4.0\n billion. Approximately \n60\n% of the cumulative pretax costs will be non-cash, relating primarily to the accelerated depreciation of facilities to be closed or divested. The remainder of the costs will result in cash outlays, relating primarily to facility shut-down costs. The Company recorded total pretax costs of $\n888\n million and $\n190\n million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, related to the 2024 Restructuring Program, bringing total cumulative pretax costs incurred through December 31, 2024 to $\n1.1\n billion. \nIn 2019, Merck approved a global restructuring program (2019 Restructuring Program) as part of a worldwide initiative focused on optimizing the Company’s manufacturing and supply network, as well as reducing its global real estate footprint. The Company recorded total pretax costs of $\n743\n million in 2023 and $\n666\n million in 2022 related to the 2019 Restructuring Program. The actions under the 2019 Restructuring Program were substantially complete at the end of 2023 and, as of January 1, 2024, any remaining activities are being accounted for as part of the 2024 Restructuring Program.\nFor segment reporting, restructuring charges are unallocated expenses.\n93\nTable of Content\ns\nThe following table summarizes the charges related to the restructuring programs by type of cost:\nAccelerated\nDepreciation\nSeparation\nCosts\nOther Exit Costs\nTotal\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n2024 Restructuring Program\nCost of sales\n$\n254\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n241\n \n$\n495\n \nSelling, general and administrative\n—\n \n—\n \n83\n \n83\n \nResearch and development\n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \nRestructuring costs\n—\n \n122\n \n187\n \n309\n \n$\n254\n \n$\n122\n \n$\n512\n \n$\n888\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n2024 Restructuring Program\nCost of sales\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n62\n \n$\n62\n \nRestructuring costs\n—\n \n115\n \n13\n \n128\n \n—\n \n115\n \n75\n \n190\n \n2019 Restructuring Program\nCost of sales\n131\n \n—\n \n18\n \n149\n \nSelling, general and administrative\n9\n \n—\n \n113\n \n122\n \nResearch and development\n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \nRestructuring costs\n—\n \n339\n \n132\n \n471\n \n \n140\n \n339\n \n264\n \n743\n \n$\n140\n \n$\n454\n \n$\n339\n \n$\n933\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2022\n \n \n \n \n2019 Restructuring Program\nCost of sales\n$\n72\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n133\n \n$\n205\n \nSelling, general and administrative\n19\n \n—\n \n75\n \n94\n \nResearch and development\n29\n \n—\n \n1\n \n30\n \nRestructuring costs\n—\n \n212\n \n125\n \n337\n \n \n$\n120\n \n$\n212\n \n$\n334\n \n$\n666\n \nAccelerated depreciation costs primarily relate to manufacturing, research and administrative facilities and equipment to be sold or closed as part of the programs. Accelerated depreciation costs represent the difference between the depreciation expense to be recognized over the revised useful life of the asset, based upon the anticipated date the site will be closed or divested or the equipment disposed of, and depreciation expense as determined utilizing the useful life prior to the restructuring actions. All the sites will continue to operate up through the respective closure dates and, since future undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover the respective book values, Merck is recording accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life of the site assets. Anticipated site closure dates, particularly related to manufacturing locations, have been and may continue to be adjusted to reflect changes resulting from regulatory or other factors.\nSeparation costs are associated with actual headcount reductions, as well as involuntary headcount reductions which were probable and could be reasonably estimated. \nOther exit costs in 2024, 2023 and 2022 include asset impairment, facility shut-down and other related costs, as well as pretax gains and losses resulting from the sales of facilities and related assets. Additionally, other activity includes certain employee-related costs associated with pension and other postretirement benefit plans (see Note 13) and share-based compensation. \n94\nTable of Content\ns\nThe following table summarizes the charges and spending relating to restructuring program activities:\nAccelerated\nDepreciation\nSeparation\nCosts\nOther Exit Costs\nTotal\nRestructuring reserves January 1, 2023\n$\n—\n \n$\n479\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n513\n \nExpenses\n140\n \n454\n \n339\n \n933\n \n(Payments) receipts, net\n—\n \n(\n252\n)\n(\n158\n)\n(\n410\n)\nNon-cash activity\n(\n140\n)\n—\n \n(\n184\n)\n(\n324\n)\nRestructuring reserves December 31, 2023\n—\n \n681\n \n31\n \n712\n \nExpenses\n254\n \n122\n \n512\n \n888\n \n(Payments) receipts, net\n—\n \n(\n239\n)\n(\n206\n)\n(\n445\n)\nNon-cash activity\n(\n254\n)\n—\n \n(\n337\n)\n(\n591\n)\nRestructuring reserves December 31, 2024 \n$\n—\n \n$\n564\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n564\n \n6.    \nFinancial Instruments\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company manages the impact of foreign exchange rate movements and interest rate movements on its earnings, cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities through operational means and through the use of various financial instruments, including derivative instruments.\nA significant portion of the Company’s revenues and earnings in foreign affiliates is exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates. The objectives of and accounting related to the Company’s foreign currency risk management program, as well as its interest rate risk management activities are discussed below.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nThe Company has established revenue hedging, balance sheet risk management and net investment hedging programs to protect against volatility of future foreign currency cash flows and changes in fair value caused by changes in foreign exchange rates.\nThe objective of the revenue hedging program is to reduce the variability caused by changes in foreign exchange rates that would affect the U.S. dollar value of future cash flows derived from foreign currency denominated sales, primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi. To achieve this objective, the Company will hedge a portion of its forecasted foreign currency denominated third-party and intercompany distributor entity sales (forecasted sales) that are expected to occur over its planning cycle, typically no more than \ntwo years\n into the future. The Company will layer in hedges over time, increasing the portion of forecasted sales hedged as it gets closer to the expected date of the forecasted sales. The portion of forecasted sales hedged is based on assessments of cost-benefit profiles that consider natural offsetting exposures, revenue and foreign exchange rate volatilities and correlations, and the cost of hedging instruments. The Company manages its anticipated transaction exposure principally with purchased local currency put options, forward contracts, and purchased collar options. \nThe fair values of these derivative contracts are recorded as either assets (gain positions) or liabilities (loss positions) in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded each period in either current earnings or \nOCI\n depending on whether the derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction and, if so, the type of hedge transaction. For derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges, the unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in \nAOCL\n and reclassified into \nSales\n when the hedged anticipated revenue is recognized. The amount reclassified into earnings as a result of the discontinuation of cash flow hedges because it was no longer deemed probable the forecasted hedged transactions would occur was not material for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. For those derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges, but serve as economic hedges of forecasted sales, unrealized gains or losses are recorded in \nSales\n each period. The cash flows from both designated and non-designated contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.\nThe Company manages operating activities and net asset positions at each local subsidiary in order to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange on monetary assets and liabilities. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of a given subsidiary are remeasured at spot rates in effect on the balance sheet date with the effects of changes in spot rates reported in \nOther (income) expense, net\n. The Company also uses a balance sheet risk management program to mitigate the exposure of such assets and liabilities from the effects of volatility in foreign exchange. Merck principally utilizes forward exchange contracts to \n95\nTable of Content\ns\noffset the effects of foreign exchange on exposures when it is deemed economical to do so based on a cost-benefit analysis that considers the magnitude of the exposure, the volatility of the foreign exchange rate and the cost of the hedging instrument (primarily the euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, and Chinese renminbi). The forward contracts are not designated as hedges and are marked to market through \nOther (income) expense, net\n. Accordingly, fair value changes in the forward contracts help mitigate the changes in the value of the remeasured assets and liabilities attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except to the extent of the spot-forward differences. These differences are not significant due to the short-term nature of the contracts, which typically have average maturities at inception of less than \nsix months\n. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe Company also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in foreign operations against movements in foreign exchange rates. The forward contracts are designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. The unrealized gains or losses on these contracts are recorded in foreign currency translation adjustment within \nOCI\n, and remain in \nAOCL\n until either the sale or complete or substantially complete liquidation of the subsidiary. The Company excludes certain portions of the change in fair value of its derivative instruments from the assessment of hedge effectiveness (excluded components). Changes in fair value of the excluded components are recognized in \nOCI\n. The Company recognizes in earnings the initial value of the excluded components on a straight-line basis over the life of the derivative instrument, rather than using the mark-to-market approach. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as investing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nForeign exchange risk is also managed through the use of foreign currency debt. Certain of the Company’s senior unsecured euro-denominated notes have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustment within \nOCI\n. \nThe effects of the Company’s net investment hedges on \nOCI\n and the Consolidated Statement of Income are shown below:\nAmount of Pretax (Gain) Loss Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income\n (1)\nAmount of Pretax (Gain) Loss Recognized in \nOther (income) expense, net\n for Amounts Excluded from Effectiveness Testing\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet Investment Hedging Relationships\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n(\n30\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n48\n)\n$\n(\n4\n)\n$\n1\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\nEuro-denominated notes\n(\n192\n)\n105\n \n(\n162\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(1)    \nNo amounts were reclassified from AOCL into income related to the sale of a subsidiary.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe Company may use interest rate swap contracts on certain investing and borrowing transactions to manage its net exposure to interest rate changes and to reduce its overall cost of borrowing. The Company does not use leveraged swaps and, in general, does not leverage any of its investment activities that would put principal at risk. \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company was a party to \nsix\n pay-floating, receive-fixed interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges of the fixed-rate notes as detailed in the table below.\nPar Value of Debt\nNumber of Interest Rate Swaps Held\nTotal Swap Notional Amount\n4.50\n% notes due 2033\n$\n1,500\n \n6\n \n$\n1,500\n \nThe interest rate swap contracts are designated hedges of the fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the benchmark Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) swap rate. The fair value changes in the notes attributable to changes in the SOFR swap rate are recorded in interest expense along with the offsetting fair value changes in the swap contracts. In January 2025, the Company entered into an additional interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $\n250\n million related to its \n5.00\n% notes due 2053. The cash flows from these contracts are reported as operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. \n96\nTable of Content\ns\nThe table below presents the location of amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges as of December 31:\nCarrying Amount of Hedged Liabilities\nCumulative Amount of Fair Value Hedging Adjustment Increase Included in the Carrying Amount\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nBalance Sheet Caption\nLong-Term Debt\n \n$\n1,509\n \n$\n1,056\n \n$\n17\n \n$\n56\n \nPresented in the table below is the fair value of derivatives on a gross basis segregated between those derivatives that are designated as hedging instruments and those that are not designated as hedging instruments as of December 31:\n \n \n2024\n2023\n \n \nFair Value of\nDerivative\nU.S. Dollar\nNotional\nFair Value of\nDerivative\nU.S. Dollar\nNotional\n \nAsset\nLiability\nAsset\nLiability\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nBalance Sheet Caption\n \n \n \n \n \n \nInterest rate swap contracts\nOther Assets\n$\n17\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,500\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n— \n$\n1,000\n \nForeign exchange contracts\nOther current assets\n323\n \n—\n \n8,662\n \n106\n \n— \n6,138\n \nForeign exchange contracts\nOther Assets\n66\n \n—\n \n2,125\n \n26\n \n— \n1,929\n \nForeign exchange contracts\nAccrued and other current liabilities\n—\n \n1\n \n162\n \n— \n76\n \n3,680\n \nForeign exchange contracts\nOther Noncurrent Liabilities\n—\n \n1\n \n16\n \n— \n1\n \n7\n \n \n \n$\n406\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n12,465\n \n$\n189\n \n$\n77\n \n$\n12,754\n \nDerivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nBalance Sheet Caption\n \n \n \n \n \n \nForeign exchange contracts\nOther current assets\n$\n323\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n12,544\n \n$\n153\n \n$\n— \n$\n9,693\n \nForeign exchange contracts\nAccrued and other current liabilities\n—\n \n343\n \n13,551\n \n— \n162\n \n8,104\n \n \n \n$\n323\n \n$\n343\n \n$\n26,095\n \n$\n153\n \n$\n162\n \n$\n17,797\n \n \n \n$\n729\n \n$\n345\n \n$\n38,560\n \n$\n342\n \n$\n239\n \n$\n30,551\n \nAs noted above, the Company records its derivatives on a gross basis in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Company uses a fair value hierarchy which maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest: \nLevel 1\n — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2\n — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. \nLevel 3\n — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. Level 3 assets or liabilities are those whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques with significant unobservable inputs, as well as assets or liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. \nIf the inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.\n99\nTable of Content\ns\nFinancial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nFinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31 are summarized below:\n \nFair Value Measurements Using\nFair Value Measurements Using\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\n  \n2024\n2023\nAssets\nInvestments\nCommercial paper\n$\n—\n \n$\n348\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n348\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n252\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n252\n \nU.S. government and agency securities\n—\n \n99\n \n—\n \n99\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPublicly traded equity securities\n463\n \n—\n \n—\n \n463\n \n252\n \n—\n \n—\n \n252\n \n \n463\n \n447\n \n—\n \n910\n \n252\n \n252\n \n—\n \n504\n \nOther assets \n(1)\nU.S. government and agency securities\n89\n \n—\n \n—\n \n89\n \n72\n \n—\n \n—\n \n72\n \nCorporate notes and bonds\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n13\n \n—\n \n—\n \n13\n \nPublicly traded equity securities \n(2)\n457\n \n—\n \n—\n \n457\n \n512\n \n—\n \n—\n \n512\n \n546\n \n—\n \n—\n \n546\n \n597\n \n—\n \n—\n \n597\n \nDerivative assets \n(3)\nForward exchange contracts\n—\n \n499\n \n—\n \n499\n \n—\n \n202\n \n—\n \n202\n \nPurchased currency options\n—\n \n213\n \n—\n \n213\n \n—\n \n83\n \n—\n \n83\n \nInterest rate swaps\n—\n \n17\n \n—\n \n17\n \n—\n \n57\n \n—\n \n57\n \n \n—\n \n729\n \n—\n \n729\n \n—\n \n342\n \n—\n \n342\n \nTotal assets\n$\n1,009\n \n$\n1,176\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,185\n \n$\n849\n \n$\n594\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,443\n \nLiabilities\nOther liabilities\nContingent consideration\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n193\n \n$\n193\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n354\n \n$\n354\n \nDerivative liabilities \n(3)\nForward exchange contracts\n—\n \n338\n \n—\n \n338\n \n—\n \n239\n \n—\n \n239\n \nWritten currency options\n—\n \n7\n \n—\n \n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n345\n \n—\n \n345\n \n—\n \n239\n \n—\n \n239\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n—\n \n$\n345\n \n$\n193\n \n$\n538\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n239\n \n$\n354\n \n$\n593\n \n(1)    \nInvestments included in other assets are restricted as to use, including for the payment of benefits under employee benefit plans.\n(2)    \nBalance at December 31, 2024 includes securities with a fair value of $\n81\n million, which are subject to a contractual sale restriction that expires in March 2025.

The payments of contingent consideration in 2023 relate to the Sanofi Pasteur MSD liabilities. \nOther Fair Value Measurements\nSome of the Company’s financial instruments, such as cash and cash equivalents, receivables and payables, are reflected in the balance sheet at carrying value, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature.\nThe estimated fair value of loans payable and long-term debt (including current portion) at December 31, 2024, was $\n32.6\n billion compared with a carrying value of $\n37.1\n billion and at December 31, 2023, was $\n32.0\n billion compared with a carrying value of $\n35.1\n billion. Fair value was estimated using recent observable market prices and would be considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company monitors concentrations of credit risk associated with corporate and government issuers of securities and financial institutions with which it conducts business. Credit exposure limits are established to limit a concentration with any single issuer or institution. Cash and investments are placed in instruments that meet high credit quality standards, as specified in the Company’s investment policy guidelines. \nThe majority of the Company’s accounts receivable arise from product sales in the U.S., Europe and China and are primarily due from drug wholesalers, distributors and retailers, hospitals and government agencies. The Company monitors the financial performance and creditworthiness of its customers so that it can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile. The Company also continues to monitor global economic conditions, including the volatility associated with international sovereign economies, and associated impacts on the financial markets and its business. \nThe Company’s customers with the largest accounts receivable balances are: McKesson Corporation, Cencora, Inc. and Cardinal Health, Inc., which represented approximately \n21\n%, \n21\n% and \n13\n%, respectively, of total accounts receivable at December 31, 2024. Vaccines distributed by Chongqing Zhifei Biological Products Co., Ltd. (Zhifei) represent a substantial portion of total sales in China; however, nearly all of the accounts receivable for Zhifei were factored as of December 31, 2024, as part of the Company’s factoring program discussed below. The Company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. Bad debts have been minimal. The Company does not normally require collateral or other security to support credit sales.\nThe Company has accounts receivable factoring agreements with financial institutions in certain countries to sell accounts receivable. The Company factored $\n2.1\n billion and $\n3.0\n billion of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, under these factoring arrangements, which reduced outstanding accounts receivable. The cash received from the financial institutions is reported within operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In certain of these factoring arrangements, for ease of administration, the Company will collect customer payments related to the factored receivables, which it then remits to the financial institutions, generally within thirty days after receipt. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had collected $\n55\n million and $\n44\n million, respectively, on behalf of the financial institutions, which is reflected as restricted cash in \nOther current assets\n, and the related obligation to remit the cash is recorded in \nAccrued and other current liabilities\n. The net cash flows related to these collections are reported as financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The cost of factoring such accounts receivable was \nde minimis\n.\nDerivative financial instruments are executed under International Swaps and Derivatives Association master agreements. The master agreements with several of the Company’s financial institution counterparties also include credit support annexes. These annexes contain provisions that require collateral to be exchanged depending on the value of the derivative assets and liabilities, the Company’s credit rating, and the credit rating of the counterparty. Cash collateral received by the Company from various counterparties was $\n165\n million and $\n3\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The obligation to return such collateral is recorded in \nAccrued and other current liabilities\n.\n \n101\nTable of Content\ns\n7.    \nInventories\nInventories at December 31 consisted of:\n2024\n2023\nFinished goods\n$\n2,022\n \n$\n1,954\n \nRaw materials and work in process\n8,831\n \n8,037\n \nSupplies\n289\n \n277\n \n11,142\n \n10,268\n \nDecrease to LIFO cost\n(\n840\n)\n(\n562\n)\n \n$\n10,302\n \n$\n9,706\n \nRecognized as:\nInventories\n$\n6,109\n \n$\n6,358\n \nOther Assets\n4,193\n \n3,348\n \nInventories valued under the LIFO method comprised approximately $\n3.4\n billion and $\n3.1\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, after reflecting the decrease to LIFO cost. Amounts recognized as \nOther Assets\n are comprised almost entirely of raw materials and work in process inventories. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, these amounts included $\n3.8\n billion and $\n2.6\n billion, respectively, of inventories not expected to be sold within one year. In addition, these amounts included $\n412\n million and $\n790\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of inventories produced in preparation for product launches.\n8.    \nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nThe following table summarizes goodwill activity by segment:\nPharmaceutical\nAnimal Health\nTotal\nBalance January 1, 2023\n$\n17,936\n \n$\n3,268\n \n$\n21,204\n \nOther \n(1)\n \n(\n14\n)\n7\n \n(\n7\n)\nBalance December 31, 2023 \n(2)\n17,922\n \n3,275\n \n21,197\n \nAcquisitions\n—\n \n518\n \n518\n \nOther \n(1)\n \n(\n19\n)\n(\n28\n)\n(\n47\n)\nBalance December 31, 2024 \n(2)\n$\n17,903\n \n$\n3,765\n \n$\n21,668\n \n(1)    \nIncludes cumulative translation adjustments on goodwill balances.\n(2)    \nAccumulated goodwill impairment losses were $\n531\n million at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n \nOther acquired intangibles at December 31 consisted of:\n \n2024\n2023\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nProduct rights\n$\n29,988\n \n$\n19,066\n \n$\n10,922\n \n$\n23,643\n \n$\n17,765\n \n$\n5,878\n \nIPR&D\n430\n \n—\n \n430\n \n6,816\n \n— \n6,816\n \nTrade names\n2,881\n \n954\n \n1,927\n \n2,881\n \n776\n \n2,105\n \nLicenses and other\n8,863\n \n5,772\n \n3,091\n \n8,263\n \n5,051\n \n3,212\n \n \n$\n42,162\n \n$\n25,792\n \n$\n16,370\n \n$\n41,603\n \n$\n23,592\n \n$\n18,011\n \nSome of the more significant acquired intangibles included in product rights, on a net basis, related to human health marketed products at December 31, 2024 were \nWinrevair\n, $\n5.9\n billion; Reblozyl, $\n2.8\n billion; and \nZerbaxa\n, $\n260\n million. Additionally, the Company had $\n4.3\n billion of net acquired intangibles related to animal health at December 31, 2024, of which $\n1.7\n billion related to product rights and $\n1.9\n billion was attributable to trade names, primarily related to Allflex. At December 31, 2024, IPR&D primarily relates to MK-1026 (nemtabrutinib), obtained through the acquisition of ArQule, Inc. (ArQule), which had a balance of $\n418\n million. Some of the more significant net intangible assets included in licenses and other above at December 31, 2024 include Lynparza, $\n1.2\n billion, related to a collaboration with AstraZeneca; Lenvima, $\n442\n million, related to a collaboration with Eisai; and Adempas, $\n372\n million, related to a collaboration with Bayer. See Note 4 for additional information related to the intangible assets associated with these collaborations.\n102\nTable of Content\ns\nIPR&D that the Company acquires through business combinations represents the fair value assigned to incomplete research projects which, at the time of acquisition, have not reached technological feasibility. Amounts capitalized as IPR&D are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets, subject to impairment testing until completion or abandonment of the projects. Upon successful completion of each IPR&D project, the Company will make a separate determination as to the then-useful life of the asset and begin amortization. \nIn 2023, the Company recorded a $\n779\n million IPR&D impairment charge within \nResearch and development\n expenses related to MK-7264, gefapixant, a non-narcotic, oral selective P2X3 receptor antagonist, that was in development for the treatment of refractory or unexplained chronic cough in adults. In December 2023, the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the resubmission of Merck’s New Drug Application (NDA) for gefapixant. In the CRL, the FDA concluded that Merck’s application did not meet substantial evidence of effectiveness for treating refractory chronic cough and unexplained chronic cough. The CRL was not related to the safety of gefapixant. The marketing application for gefapixant was based on results from the COUGH-1 and COUGH-2 clinical trials. In January 2022, the FDA issued a CRL regarding Merck’s original NDA for gefapixant. In that CRL, the FDA requested additional information related to the cough counting system that was used to assess efficacy. Receipt of the second CRL from the FDA constituted a triggering event that required the evaluation of the gefapixant intangible asset for impairment. The Company estimated the current fair value of gefapixant utilizing an income approach, which calculates the present value of projected future cash flows. The market participant assumptions used to derive the forecasted cash flows were updated to reflect revised market launch plans, resulting in a reduction in the estimated fair value. The revised estimated fair value of gefapixant when compared with its related carrying value resulted in the impairment charge noted above. The remaining intangible asset balance related to \nLyfnua\n (gefapixant) at December 31, 2024 of $\n21\n million is included in product rights in the table above and is being amortized over its expected useful life as supported by projected future cash flows in the markets where it is approved including Japan and the EU.\nIn 2022, the Company recorded $\n1.7\n billion of intangible asset impairment charges within \nResearch and development\n expenses, of which $\n1.6\n billion represents IPR&D impairment charges related to nemtabrutinib (MK-1026), an oral, reversible, non-covalent Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor currently being evaluated for the treatment of hematological malignancies that was obtained through the 2020 acquisition of ArQule. Following discussions with regulatory authorities in the third quarter of 2022, the development period for nemtabrutinib was extended, which constituted a triggering event that required the evaluation of the nemtabrutinib intangible asset for impairment. The Company estimated the current fair value of nemtabrutinib utilizing an income approach which calculates the present value of projected future cash flows. The market participant assumptions used to derive the forecasted cash flows were updated to reflect a delay in the anticipated launch date for nemtabrutinib, which resulted in lower cumulative revenue forecasts and a reduction in the estimated fair value. The revised estimated fair value of nemtabrutinib when compared with its related carrying value resulted in a $\n807\n million impairment charge recorded in the third quarter of 2022. In December 2022, regulatory authorities provided additional feedback with respect to clinical study design that led to a further reassessment of the development plan for nemtabrutinib, which was expected to result in changes to the clinical study design, and corresponding delays in the anticipated approval and launch timelines, which constituted a triggering event. Utilizing an income approach, the forecasted cash flows were updated to reflect a decline in forecasted revenue coupled with an increase in development cost forecasts, which reduced projected cash flows lowering the estimated fair value of nemtabrutinib. The revised estimated fair value of nemtabrutinib when compared with its then-related carrying value resulted in a $\n780\n million impairment charge. The remaining IPR&D intangible asset related to nemtabrutinib is $\n418\n million. If the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of nemtabrutinib prove to be incorrect and the development of nemtabrutinib does not progress as anticipated thereby adversely affecting projected future cash flows, the Company may record an additional impairment charge in the future and such charge could be material. The Company also recorded an $\n80\n million intangible asset impairment charge in 2022 related to derazantinib resulting from the termination of the out-licensing agreement and the decision by Merck not to pursue development of derazantinib. \nThe IPR&D projects that remain in development are subject to the inherent risks and uncertainties in drug development and it is possible that the Company will not be able to successfully develop and complete the IPR&D programs and profitably commercialize the underlying product candidates.\nThe Company may recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in the future related to marketed products or pipeline programs and such charges could be material.\nAggregate amortization expense primarily recorded within \nCost of sales\n was $\n2.4\n billion in 2024, $\n2.0\n billion in 2023 and $\n2.1\n billion in 2022. The estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five years is as follows: 2025, $\n2.4\n billion; 2026, $\n2.3\n billion; 2027, $\n2.1\n billion; 2028, $\n1.8\n billion; 2029, $\n1.5\n billion.\n103\nTable of Content\ns\n9.    \nLoans Payable, Long-Term Debt and Leases\nLoans Payable\nLoans payable at December 31, 2024 included $\n2.5\n billion of notes due in 2025 and $\n149\n million of long-dated notes that are subject to repayment at the option of the holders. Loans payable at December 31, 2023 included $\n1.3\n billion of notes due in 2024 and $\n69\n million of long-dated notes that are subject to repayment at the option of the holders.

Effective as of November 3, 2009, the Company executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of its subsidiary Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC. (MSD) and MSD executed a full and unconditional guarantee of the then existing debt of the Company \n104\nTable of Content\ns\n(excluding commercial paper), including for payments of principal and interest. These guarantees do not extend to debt issued subsequent to that date.\nIn May 2024, MSD Netherlands Capital B.V., a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Merck, completed a registered public offering of €\n3.4\n billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-dominated senior notes comprised of €\n850\n million of \n3.25\n% senior notes due 2032, €\n850\n million of \n3.50\n% senior notes due 2037, €\n850\n million of \n3.70\n% senior notes due 2044 and €\n850\n million of \n3.75\n% senior notes due 2054 (collectively, the Euronotes). The Company has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of MSD Netherlands Capital B.V.’s obligations under the Euronotes and no other subsidiary of the Company will guarantee these obligations. MSD Netherlands Capital B.V. is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X of the Exchange Act, with no assets or operations other than those related to the issuance, administration and repayment of the Euronotes. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of MSD Netherlands Capital B.V. are consolidated in the financial statements of the Company. The net cash proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes. \nCertain of the Company’s borrowings require that Merck comply with covenants and, at December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\nThe aggregate maturities of long-term debt for each of the next five years are as follows: 2025, $\n2.6\n billion; 2026, $\n2.2\n billion; 2027, $\n1.5\n billion; 2028, $\n2.1\n billion; 2029, $\n1.7\n billion. Interest payments related to these debt obligations are as follows: 2025, $\n1.2\n billion; 2026, $\n1.2\n billion; 2027, $\n1.1\n billion; 2028, $\n1.1\n billion; 2029, $\n1.0\n billion.\nThe Company has a $\n6.0\n billion credit facility that matures in May 2028. The facility provides backup liquidity for the Company’s commercial paper borrowing facility and is to be used for general corporate purposes. The Company has not drawn funding from this facility.\nLeases\nThe Company has operating leases primarily for manufacturing facilities, research and development facilities, corporate offices, employee housing, vehicles and certain equipment. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. When evaluating contracts for embedded leases, the Company exercises judgment to determine if there is an explicit or implicit identified asset in the contract and if Merck controls the use of that asset. Embedded leases, primarily associated with contract manufacturing organizations, are immaterial. The lease term includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that Merck will exercise that option. Real estate leases for facilities have an average remaining lease term of approximately \nsix years\n, which include options to extend the leases for up to \nfive years\n where applicable. Vehicle leases are generally in effect for \nfour years\n. The Company elected to exclude short-term leases (leases with an initial term of 12 months or less) from the lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet.\n Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since the Company’s leases do not have a readily determinable implicit discount rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to calculate the present value of lease payments by asset class. On a quarterly basis, an updated incremental borrowing rate is determined based on the average remaining lease term of each asset class and the Company’s pretax cost of debt for that same term. The updated rates for each asset class are applied prospectively to new leases. The Company does not separate lease components (e.g., payments for rent, real estate taxes and insurance costs) from non-lease components (e.g. common-area maintenance costs) in the event that the agreement contains both. Merck includes both the lease and non-lease components for purposes of calculating the right-of-use asset and related lease liability (if the non-lease components are fixed). For vehicle leases and employee housing, the Company applies a portfolio approach to account for the operating lease assets and liabilities.\nCertain of the Company’s lease agreements contain variable lease payments that are adjusted periodically for inflation or for actual operating expense true-ups compared with estimated amounts; however, these amounts are immaterial. Sublease income was immaterial and there were no sale and leaseback transactions in 2024. Merck’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. \nOperating lease cost was $\n348\n million in 2024, $\n339\n million in 2023 and $\n334\n million in 2022. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $\n357\n million in 2024, $\n347\n million in 2023 and $\n335\n million in 2022. Operating lease assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations were $\n47\n million in 2024, $\n122\n million in 2023 and $\n57\n million in 2022. \n105\nTable of Content\ns\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases is as follows:\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nAssets\nOther Assets \n(1)\n$\n1,370\n \n$\n1,437\n \nLiabilities\nAccrued and other current liabilities\n282\n \n285\n \nOther Noncurrent Liabilities\n877\n \n928\n \n$\n1,159\n \n$\n1,213\n \nWeighted-average remaining lease term (years)\n6.0\n7.0\nWeighted-average discount rate\n3.2\n \n%\n3.3\n \n%\n(1)    \nIncludes prepaid leases that have no related lease liability.\nMaturities of operating leases liabilities are as follows:\n2025\n$\n329\n \n2026\n292\n \n2027\n235\n \n2028\n146\n \n2029\n116\n \nThereafter\n403\n \nTotal lease payments\n1,521\n \nLess: Imputed interest\n362\n \n$\n1,159\n \nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had entered into additional real estate operating leases that had not yet commenced; the obligations associated with these leases total $\n183\n million.\n10.    \nContingencies and Environmental Liabilities \nThe Company is involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature considered normal to its business, including product liability, intellectual property, commercial litigation, and securities litigation, as well as certain additional matters including governmental and environmental matters. In the opinion of the Company, it is unlikely that the resolution of these matters will be material to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nGiven the nature of the litigation discussed below and the complexities involved in these matters, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss for such matters until the Company knows, among other factors, (i) what claims, if any, will survive dispositive motion practice, (ii) the extent of the claims, including the size of any potential class, particularly when damages are not specified or are indeterminate, (iii) how the discovery process will affect the litigation, (iv) the settlement posture of the other parties to the litigation and (v) any other factors that may have a material effect on the litigation.\nThe Company records accruals for contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or additional information becomes available. Generally, for product liability claims, a portion of the overall accrual is actuarially determined and considers such factors as past experience, number of claims reported and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Individually significant contingent losses are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable.\nThe Company’s decision to obtain insurance coverage is dependent on market conditions, including cost and availability, existing at the time such decisions are made. The Company has evaluated its risks and has determined that the cost of obtaining product liability insurance outweighs the likely benefits of the coverage that is available and, as such, has no insurance for most product liabilities.\n106\nTable of Content\ns\nProduct Liability Litigation\nDr Scholl’s Foot Powder\nAs previously disclosed, Merck is a defendant in product liability lawsuits in the U.S. arising from consumers’ alleged exposure to talc in Dr. Scholl’s foot powder, which Merck acquired through its merger with Schering-Plough Corporation and sold as part of the divestiture of Merck’s consumer care business to Bayer in 2014. In these actions, plaintiffs allege that they were exposed to asbestos-contaminated talc and developed mesothelioma as a result. As of December 31, 2024, approximately \n415\n cases were pending against Merck in various state courts.\nGardasil/Gardasil 9\nAs previously disclosed, Merck is a defendant in product liability lawsuits in the U.S. involving \nGardasil \n(Human Papillomavirus Quadrivalent [Types 6, 11, 16 and 18] Vaccine, Recombinant) and \nGardasil\n 9 (Human Papillomavirus 9-valent Vaccine, Recombinant). As of December 31, 2024, approximately \n225\n cases were filed and pending against Merck in either federal or state court. In these actions, plaintiffs allege, among other things, that they suffered various personal injuries after vaccination with \nGardasil \nor \nGardasil\n 9, with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) as a predominate alleged injury. In August 2022, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ordered that \nGardasil/Gardasil\n 9 product liability cases pending in federal courts nationwide be transferred to Judge Robert J. Conrad in the Western District of North Carolina for coordinated pre-trial proceedings. In February 2024, the multidistrict litigation was reassigned to Judge Kenneth D. Bell. As previously disclosed, there are fewer than \n15\n product liability cases pending outside the U.S.\nOn January 28, 2025, a trial commenced in California state court. Plaintiff claims that she suffers from POTS and fibromyalgia as a result of her \nGardasil\n vaccinations. On February 14, 2025, after four weeks of trial and an opportunity to litigate plaintiff’s claims before a jury, plaintiff’s counsel approached Merck and proposed that the jury be discharged and the case adjourned. Merck agreed, subject to an explicit stipulation that Merck would provide no financial or other consideration in exchange for the agreement to adjourn. The case has thus been adjourned until a new trial date of September 15, 2025. Merck is vigorously defending this case and believes that evidence presented in court will show that \nGardasil\n had no role in causing any of plaintiff’s conditions.\nGovernmental Proceedings\nCivil Investigative Demands\nAs previously disclosed, in June 2024, Merck received a Civil Investigative Demand (CID) from the U.S. Department of Justice, pursuant to a False Claims Act investigation, seeking documents and materials related to \nSteglatro\n, \nJanuvia\n and certain related drugs. The CID states that it is investigating Merck’s price reporting under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program as well as compliance with anti-kickback requirements in connection with patient assistance programs. The Company is cooperating with the investigation.\nAs previously disclosed, in June 2020, Merck received a CID from the U.S. Department of Justice. The CID requests answers to interrogatories, as well as various documents, regarding temperature excursions at a third-party storage facility containing certain Merck products. Merck is cooperating with the government’s investigation and intends to produce information and/or documents as necessary in response to the CID.\nInflation Reduction Act\nAs previously disclosed, in June 2023, Merck filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. government regarding the Inflation Reduction Act’s “Drug Price Negotiation Program” for Medicare (the Program). This litigation seeks relief from the Program by challenging its constitutionality as violative of the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\nOther Matters\nAs previously disclosed, in April 2019, Merck received a set of investigative interrogatories from the California Attorney General’s Office pursuant to its investigation of conduct and agreements that allegedly affected or delayed competition to Lantus in the insulin market. The interrogatories seek information concerning Merck’s development of an insulin glargine product, and its subsequent termination, as well as Merck’s patent litigation against Sanofi S.A. concerning Lantus and the resolution of that litigation. Merck is cooperating with the California Attorney General’s investigation.\nAs previously disclosed, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries in China receive inquiries regarding their operations from various Chinese governmental agencies. Some of these inquiries may be related to matters involving other multinational pharmaceutical companies, as well as Chinese entities doing business with such companies. The Company’s policy is to cooperate with these authorities and to provide responses as appropriate.\n107\nTable of Content\ns\nAs previously disclosed, from time to time, the Company receives inquiries and is the subject of preliminary investigation activities from competition and other governmental authorities in markets outside the U.S. These authorities may include regulators, administrative authorities, and law enforcement and other similar officials, and these preliminary investigation activities may include site visits, formal or informal requests or demands for documents or materials, inquiries or interviews and similar matters. Certain of these preliminary inquiries or activities may lead to the commencement of formal proceedings. Should those proceedings be determined adversely to the Company, monetary fines and/or remedial undertakings may be required.\nSecurities Litigation\nIn February 2025, a putative class action was filed against Merck and certain of its officers in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey purportedly on behalf of all purchasers of Merck common stock between February 2022 and February 2025. Plaintiff alleges that Merck violated federal securities laws by making materially false and misleading statements and material omissions regarding demand for \nGardasil/Gardasil 9\n in China. Plaintiff seeks unspecified monetary damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and fees and costs.\nCommercial and Other Litigation\nZetia\n \nAntitrust Litigation\nAs previously disclosed, Merck, MSD, Schering Corporation, Schering-Plough Corporation, and MSP Singapore Company LLC (collectively, the Merck Defendants) were defendants in a number of lawsuits filed in 2018 on behalf of direct and indirect purchasers of Zetia (ezetimibe) alleging violations of federal and state antitrust laws, as well as other state statutory and common law causes of action. The cases were consolidated in a federal multidistrict litigation (Zetia MDL) before Judge Rebecca Beach Smith in the Eastern District of Virginia. In April 2023, the Merck Defendants reached settlements with the direct purchaser and retailer plaintiffs and a settlement with the indirect purchaser class that the court approved in October 2023.\nAs previously disclosed, in 2020 and 2021, United Healthcare Services, Inc. (United Healthcare), Humana Inc. (Humana), Centene Corporation and others (Centene), and Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. (Kaiser) (collectively, the Insurer Plaintiffs), each filed a lawsuit in a jurisdiction outside of the Eastern District of Virginia against the Merck Defendants and others, making similar allegations as those made in the Zetia MDL, as well as additional allegations about Vytorin. These cases were transferred to the Eastern District of Virginia to proceed with the Zetia MDL.\nIn December 2023, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation remanded the four Insurer Plaintiff cases to the transferor courts in the Northern District of California (Kaiser), the District of Minnesota (United Healthcare), and the District of New Jersey (Humana and Centene). The Merck Defendants filed motions to dismiss in each of the Insurer Plaintiff cases. On December 30, 2024, the court granted in part and denied in part the motions to dismiss in the Humana and Centene cases, and on January 29, 2025, Humana and Centene filed amended complaints.\nRotaTeq Antitrust Litigation\nAs previously disclosed, in March 2023, the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore filed a putative class action against MSD in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on behalf of all third-party payors in \n35\n states that indirectly purchased, paid, and/or provided reimbursement for some or all of the purchase price of \nRotaTeq\n (Rotavirus Vaccine, Live Oral, Pentavalent), other than for resale, from March 3, 2019 to the present. Plaintiff alleges that MSD violated federal and state antitrust laws and state consumer protection laws. Plaintiff alleges that MSD has implemented an anticompetitive vaccine bundling scheme whereby MSD leverages its alleged monopoly power in certain pediatric vaccine markets to maintain its alleged monopoly power in the U.S. market for rotavirus vaccines in order to charge supracompetitive prices for \nRotaTeq\n. Plaintiff seeks permanent injunctive relief and unspecified monetary damages on purchases of \nRotaTeq\n, trebled, and fees and costs. In May 2023, MSD moved to dismiss the complaint. In November 2023, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss, dismissing plaintiff’s Idaho and Utah consumer law claims and allowing all other claims to proceed.\nBravecto Litigation\nAs previously disclosed, in January 2020, the Company was served with a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. Following motion practice, the plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint in August 2024, seeking to certify a nationwide class action of purchasers or users of \nBravecto \n(fluralaner) products in the U.S. or its territories between May 1, 2014 and July 1, 2021. Plaintiffs contend \nBravecto \ncauses neurological events in dogs and cats and alleges violations of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, Breach of Warranty, Product Liability, and related theories. The Company moved to dismiss or, alternatively, to strike the class allegations from the third amended complaint, and that motion is pending. A similar case was filed in Quebec, Canada in May 2019. The \n108\nTable of Content\ns\nSuperior Court certified a class of dog owners in Quebec who gave \nBravecto\n Chew to their dogs between February 16, 2017 and November 2, 2018 whose dogs experienced one of the conditions in the post-marketing adverse reactions section of the labeling approved on November 2, 2018. The Company and plaintiffs each appealed the class certification decision. The Court of Appeal of Quebec amended the class period to start July 2, 2014, allowed the second plaintiff to serve as a class representative, and modified the list of conditions in the class definition. The Company sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, which was denied. The case is proceeding in the Superior Court.\n340B Program Litigation\nAs previously disclosed, Merck filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to challenge the letter Merck received from the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) in May 2022 regarding Merck’s 340B Program integrity initiative. On September 17, 2024, the court entered a consent judgment granting Merck the relief it had sought in the litigation, including declarations that HRSA’s May 2022 letter was unlawful and that the version of Merck’s 340B Program integrity initiative at issue in the litigation did not violate Section 340B on its face. \nQui Tam Litigation\nAs previously disclosed, in June 2012, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania unsealed a complaint that had been filed against the Company under the federal False Claims Act by \ntwo\n former employees alleging, among other things, that the Company defrauded the U.S. government by falsifying data in connection with a clinical study conducted on the mumps component of the Company’s \nM-M-R\n II vaccine. The complaint alleges the fraud took place between 1999 and 2001. The U.S. government had the right to participate in and take over the prosecution of this lawsuit but notified the court that it declined to exercise that right. The \ntwo\n former employees pursued the lawsuit without the involvement of the U.S. government. In July 2023, the court denied relators’ motion for summary judgment, granted \ntwo\n of the Company’s motions for summary judgment, and denied the Company’s remaining motions for summary judgment as moot. The court entered judgment in favor of the Company and dismissed relators’ amended complaint in full with prejudice. Relators appealed that decision, and in August 2024, the Third Circuit affirmed the district court’s decision.\nIn addition, as previously disclosed, \ntwo\n putative class action lawsuits on behalf of direct purchasers of the \nM‑M‑R\n II vaccine, which charge that the Company misrepresented the efficacy of the \nM-M-R\n II vaccine in violation of federal antitrust laws and various state consumer protection laws, are pending in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The court granted the Company’s motion for summary judgment as to plaintiffs’ state law claims and denied the motion as to plaintiffs’ antitrust claim. The Company appealed, and on October 7, 2024, the Third Circuit reversed-in-part the district court’s order and remanded the case with instructions to enter summary judgment for the Company. On November 20, 2024, plaintiffs-appellees filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc, and on February 10, 2025, the court denied the petition.\nMerck KGaA Litigation\nAs previously disclosed, in January 2016, to protect its long-established brand rights in the U.S., the Company filed a lawsuit against Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany (KGaA), historically operating as the EMD Group in the U.S., alleging it improperly uses the name “Merck” in the U.S. KGaA has filed suit against the Company in a number of jurisdictions outside of the U.S. alleging, among other things, unfair competition, trademark infringement and/or corporate name infringement. In certain of those jurisdictions, KGaA also alleges breach of the parties’ coexistence agreement. The litigation is ongoing in the U.S. with no trial date set, and also ongoing in jurisdictions outside of the U.S.\nPatent Litigation\nFrom time to time, generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products file abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) seeking to market generic forms of the Company’s products prior to the expiration of relevant patents owned by the Company. To protect its patent rights, the Company may file patent infringement lawsuits against such generic companies. Similar lawsuits defending the Company’s patent rights may exist in other countries. The Company intends to vigorously defend its patents, which it believes are valid, against infringement by companies attempting to market products prior to the expiration of such patents. As with any litigation, there can be no assurance of the outcomes, which, if adverse, could result in significantly shortened periods of exclusivity for these products and, with respect to products acquired through acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, potentially significant intangible asset impairment charges.\nBridion \n—\n \nAs previously disclosed, between January and November 2020, the Company received multiple Paragraph IV Certification Letters under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying the Company that generic drug companies had filed applications to the FDA seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell generic versions of \nBridion\n (sugammadex) \n109\nTable of Content\ns\nInjection. In March, April and December 2020, the Company filed patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Courts for the District of New Jersey and the Northern District of West Virginia against those generic companies. All actions in the District of New Jersey were consolidated. The West Virginia case was jointly dismissed with prejudice in August 2022 in favor of proceeding in New Jersey. The remaining defendants in the New Jersey action have stipulated to infringement of the asserted claims and withdrew all remaining claims and defenses other than a defense seeking to shorten the patent term extension (PTE) of the sugammadex patent to December 2022. The U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey held a \none-day\n trial in December 2022 on this remaining PTE calculation defense. The court ordered a post-trial briefing on this defense and held closing arguments in February 2023.\nAs previously disclosed, in June 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey ruled in Merck’s favor. The court held that Merck’s calculation of PTE for the sugammadex patent covering the compound is not invalid and that the U.S. Patent & Trademark Office correctly granted a full \nfive-year\n extension. This ruling affirms and validates Merck’s U.S. patent protection for \nBridion\n through at least January 2026. Also in June 2023, the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey issued a final judgment prohibiting the FDA from approving any of the pending or tentatively approved generic applications until January 27, 2026, except for any subsequent agreements between defendants and Merck or further order by the court.\nIn July 2023, defendants filed a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. The appeal is currently pending. Oral argument took place on February 4, 2025.\nWhile the New Jersey action was pending, the Company settled with \nfive\n generic companies providing that these generic companies can bring their generic versions of \nBridion\n to the market in January 2026 (which may be delayed by any applicable pediatric exclusivity) or earlier under certain circumstances. The Company agreed to stay the lawsuit filed against \ntwo\n generic companies, which in exchange agreed to be bound by a judgment on the merits of the consolidated action in the District of New Jersey. One of the generic companies in the consolidated action requested dismissal of the action against it and the Company did not oppose this request, which was subsequently granted by the court. The Company does not expect this company to bring its generic version of \nBridion \nto the market before January 2026 or later, depending on any applicable pediatric exclusivity.\nIn February 2024, the Company received another Paragraph IV Certification Letter under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying the Company that Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. (Hikma) had filed an application to the FDA seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell a generic version of \nBridion\n Injection. In March 2024, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Hikma, postponing FDA approval of the Hikma generic drug for 30 months or until expiration of the sugammadex patent (January 27, 2026) and any potentially applicable pediatric exclusivity or an adverse court decision, if any, whichever may occur earlier. Expiration of the patent, and any potentially applicable pediatric exclusivity, will occur earlier than expiry of the 30-month stay. On April 16, 2024, the district court stayed the case during the pendency of the Federal Circuit appeal noted above.\nJanuvia, Janumet, Janumet XR \n—\n \nAs previously disclosed, the FDA granted pediatric exclusivity with respect to \nJanuvia \n(sitagliptin), \nJanumet \n(sitagliptin/metformin HCl), and \nJanumet XR\n (sitagliptin and metformin HCl extended-release), which provides a further six months of exclusivity in the U.S. beyond the expiration of all patents listed in the FDA’s Orange Book. Adding this exclusivity to the term of the key patent protection extended exclusivity on these products to January 2023. However, \nJanuvia\n, \nJanumet\n, and \nJanumet XR\n contain sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate and the Company has another patent covering certain phosphate salt and polymorphic forms of sitagliptin that expires in May 2027, including pediatric exclusivity (salt/polymorph patent).\nAs previously disclosed, beginning in 2019, a number of generic drug companies filed ANDAs seeking approval of generic forms of \nJanuvia\n and \nJanumet\n along with paragraph IV certifications challenging the validity of the salt/polymorph patent. The Company responded by filing infringement suits which have all been settled. The Company has settled with a total \n26\n generic companies providing that these generic companies can bring their generic versions of \nJanuvia\n and \nJanumet\n to the market in the U.S. in May 2026 or earlier under certain circumstances, and their generic versions of \nJanumet XR\n to the market in July 2026 or earlier under certain circumstances.\nIn March 2021, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Zydus Worldwide DMCC, Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc., and Cadila Healthcare Ltd. (collectively, Zydus). In that lawsuit, the Company alleged infringement of the salt/polymorph patent based on the filing of Zydus’s NDA seeking approval of a form of sitagliptin that is a different from than that used in \nJanuvia\n. In December 2022, the parties reached settlement that included dismissal of the case without prejudice enabling Zydus to seek final approval of a non-automatically substitutable product.\n110\nTable of Content\ns\nIn January 2023, the Company received a Paragraph IV Certification Letter under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying the Company that Zydus filed an ANDA seeking approval of sitagliptin/metformin HCl tablets and certifying that no valid or enforceable claim of any of the patents listed in FDA’s Orange Book for \nJanumet\n will be infringed by the proposed Zydus product. In March 2023, the parties reached settlement enabling Zydus to seek final approval of a non-automatically substitutable product containing a different form of sitagliptin than that used in \nJanumet\n. In November 2023, the Company received a Paragraph IV Certification Letter under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying the Company that Zydus filed an ANDA seeking approval of sitagliptin/metformin HCl Extended Release tablets. In January 2024, the parties reached settlement enabling Zydus to seek final approval of a non-automatically substitutable version containing a different form of sitagliptin than that used in \nJanumet XR\n.\nAs a result of these settlement agreements related to the later expiring salt/polymorph patent directed to the specific sitagliptin salt form of the products, the Company expects that \nJanuvia\n and \nJanumet\n will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until May 2026 and \nJanumet XR\n will not lose market exclusivity in the U.S. until July 2026, although Zydus has received FDA approval for a non-automatically substitutable form of sitagliptin that differs from the form in the Company’s sitagliptin products. \nIn March 2024, the Company received another Paragraph IV Certification Letter under the Hatch-Waxman Act from Azurity Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Azurity) asserting that a different sitagliptin product subject to its ANDA does not infringe the salt/polymorph patent. In May 2024, Merck filed a civil action in the U.S. District Court of Delaware alleging infringement. The case was dismissed without prejudice in July 2024. Following the dismissal, the Company granted Azurity a covenant not to assert the salt/polymorph patent against the Azurity product that is the subject of such ANDA.\nSupplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) for \nJanumet\n expired in April 2023 for the majority of European countries. Prior to expiration, generic companies sought revocation of the \nJanumet\n SPCs in a number of European countries. In February 2022, a Finnish court referred certain questions to the Court of Justice of the European Union that could impact the validity of the \nJanumet\n SPCs in Europe. A decision was rendered on December 19, 2024. The decision provides guidance on points of law and does not directly apply these to the \nJanumet\n SPCs. Thus, additional proceedings in certain countries where generic companies were prevented from launching products during the SPC period may be necessary to determine whether the SPCs are valid and if not, whether damages are appropriate. Those countries include Belgium, Czech Republic, Ireland, Finland, France, Slovakia and Switzerland. If the \nJanumet\n SPCs are ultimately upheld, the Company has reserved its rights related to the pursuit of damages for those countries where a generic launched prior to expiry of the \nJanumet \nSPC.\nIn October 2023, the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Sawai Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. and Medisa Shinyaku Co., Ltd (collectively, Defendants) in the Tokyo District Court seeking an injunction to stop the manufacture, sale and offer for sale of the Defendants’ sitagliptin dihydrogen phosphate product, while the Company’s patents and patent term extensions are in force. The lawsuit is in response to the Defendants’ application for marketing authorization to sell a generic sitagliptin dihydrogen phosphate product, in the anhydrate form, which was approved in August 2023. Merck asserts that the Defendants’ activity infringes a patent term extension associated with Merck’s patent directed to the sitagliptin compound patent.\nKeytruda\n —\n As previously disclosed,\n \nin November 2022, the Company filed a complaint against The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) in the U.S. District Court of Maryland. This action concerns patents emerging from a joint research collaboration between Merck and JHU regarding the use of pembrolizumab, which Merck sells under the trade name \nKeytruda\n. Merck and JHU partnered to design and conduct a clinical study administering \nKeytruda\n to cancer patients having tumors that had the genetic biomarker known as microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H). After the conclusion of the study, JHU secured U.S. patents citing the joint research study. Merck alleges that JHU has breached the collaboration agreement by filing and obtaining these patents without informing or involving Merck and then licensing the patents to others. Merck therefore brought this action for breach of contract, declaratory judgment of noninfringement, and promissory estoppel. JHU answered the complaint in April and May 2023, denying Merck’s claims, and counterclaiming for willful infringement of \nnine\n issued U.S. patents, including a demand for damages. Between November 30, 2023 and March 13, 2024, the Company filed \ninter partes\n review petitions with the United States Patent & Trademark Office Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB), challenging the validity of all nine patents asserted in the case. Between June 2024 and October 2024, the PTAB instituted a review of all \nnine\n asserted patents. In July 2024, the district court granted Merck’s motion to stay the case in its entirety pending the outcome of the PTAB proceeding instituted in June 2024.\nLynparza\n —\n As previously disclosed, in December 2022, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP received a Paragraph IV Certification Letter under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying AstraZeneca that Natco Pharma Limited (Natco) has filed an application to the FDA seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell generic versions of Lynparza (olaparib) tablet. In February 2023, AstraZeneca and the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. \n111\nTable of Content\ns\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey against Natco. This lawsuit, which asserts one or more patents covering olaparib, automatically stays FDA approval of the generic application until June 2025 or until an adverse court decision, if any, whichever may occur earlier. In May, June, July, and November 2024, AstraZeneca and the Company filed additional patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Natco asserting additional patents covering olaparib.\nIn December 2023, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP received a second Paragraph IV Certification Letter under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying AstraZeneca that Sandoz Inc. has filed an application to the FDA seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell generic versions of Lynparza (olaparib) tablet. In February 2024, AstraZeneca and the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Sandoz. This lawsuit, which asserts one or more patents covering olaparib, automatically stays FDA approval of the generic application until June 2026 or until an adverse court decision, if any, whichever may occur earlier. In May, July, and November 2024, AstraZeneca and the Company filed additional patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Sandoz asserting additional patents covering olaparib.\nIn May 2024, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP received a third Paragraph IV Certification Letter under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying AstraZeneca that Cipla USA, Inc. and Cipla Limited (collectively, Cipla) filed an application to the FDA seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell generic versions of Lynparza (olaparib) tablet. In June 2024, AstraZeneca and the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Cipla. This lawsuit, which asserts one or more patents covering olaparib, automatically stays FDA approval of the generic application until November 2026 or until an adverse court decision, if any, whichever may occur earlier. In June, July, and November 2024, AstraZeneca and the Company filed additional patent infringement lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Cipla asserting additional patents covering olaparib.\nIn November 2024, AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP received another Paragraph IV Certification Letter under the Hatch-Waxman Act notifying AstraZeneca that Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. filed an application to the FDA seeking pre-patent expiry approval to sell generic versions of Lynparza (olaparib) tablet. In November 2024, AstraZeneca and the Company filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Zydus. This lawsuit, which asserts one or more patents covering olaparib, automatically stays FDA approval of the generic application until May 2027 or until an adverse court decision, if any, whichever may occur earlier. In November 2024, AstraZeneca and the Company filed an additional patent infringement lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey against Zydus asserting an additional patent covering olaparib.\nOther Litigation\nThere are various other pending legal proceedings involving the Company, principally product liability and intellectual property lawsuits. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of such proceedings, in the opinion of the Company, either the likelihood of loss is remote or any reasonably possible loss associated with the resolution of such proceedings is not expected to be material to the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows either individually or in the aggregate.\nLegal Defense Reserves\nLegal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with a loss contingency are accrued when probable and reasonably estimable. Some of the significant factors considered in the review of these legal defense reserves are as follows: the actual costs incurred by the Company; the development of the Company’s legal defense strategy and structure in light of the scope of its litigation; the number of cases being brought against the Company; the costs and outcomes of completed trials and the most current information regarding anticipated timing, progression, and related costs of pre-trial activities and trials in the associated litigation. The amount of legal defense reserves as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 of approximately $\n225\n million and $\n210\n million, respectively, represents the Company’s best estimate of the minimum amount of defense costs to be incurred in connection with its outstanding litigation; however, events such as additional trials and other events that could arise in the course of its litigation could affect the ultimate amount of legal defense costs to be incurred by the Company. The Company will continue to monitor its legal defense costs and review the adequacy of the associated reserves and may determine to increase the reserves at any time in the future if, based upon the factors set forth, it believes it would be appropriate to do so.\nEnvironmental Matters\n The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to a number of proceedings brought under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and other federal and state equivalents. These proceedings seek to require the operators of hazardous waste disposal facilities, transporters of waste to the sites and generators of hazardous waste disposed of at the sites to clean up the sites or \n112\nTable of Content\ns\nto reimburse the government for cleanup costs. The Company has been made a party to these proceedings as an alleged generator of waste disposed of at the sites. In each case, the government alleges that the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the cleanup costs. Although joint and several liability is alleged, these proceedings are frequently resolved so that the allocation of cleanup costs among the parties more nearly reflects the relative contributions of the parties to the site situation. The Company’s potential liability varies greatly from site to site. For some sites the potential liability is \nde minimis\n and for others the final costs of cleanup have not yet been determined. While it is not feasible to predict the outcome of many of these proceedings brought by federal or state agencies or private litigants, in the opinion of the Company, such proceedings should not ultimately result in any liability which would have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. The Company has taken an active role in identifying and accruing for these costs and such amounts do not include any reduction for anticipated recoveries of cleanup costs from former site owners or operators or other recalcitrant potentially responsible parties.\nIn management’s opinion, the \nliabilities\n for all environmental matters that are probable and reasonably estimable have been accrued and totaled $\n41\n million and $\n42\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These liabilities are undiscounted, do not consider potential recoveries from other parties and will be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which are expected to occur primarily over the next \n15\n years. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, or the ultimate costs of remediation, management does not believe that any reasonably possible expenditures that may be incurred in excess of the liabilities accrued should exceed approximately $\n46\n million in the aggregate. Management also does not believe that these expenditures should result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity for any year.\n11.    \nEquity\nThe Merck certificate of incorporation authorizes \n6,500,000,000\n shares of common stock and \n20,000,000\n shares of preferred stock.\nCapital Stock\nA summary of common stock and treasury stock transactions (shares in millions) is as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n  \nCommon\nStock\nTreasury\nStock\nCommon\nStock\nTreasury\nStock\nCommon\nStock\nTreasury\nStock\nBalance January 1\n3,577\n \n1,045\n \n3,577\n \n1,039\n \n3,577\n \n1,049\n \nPurchases of treasury stock\n—\n \n11\n \n—\n \n13\n \n—\n \n—\n \nIssuances \n(1)\n \n—\n \n(\n7\n)\n—\n \n(\n7\n)\n—\n \n(\n10\n)\nBalance December 31\n3,577\n \n1,049\n \n3,577\n \n1,045\n \n3,577\n \n1,039\n \n(1)    \nIssuances primarily reflect activity under share-based compensation plans.\n12.    \nShare-Based Compensation Plans\nThe Company has share-based compensation plans under which the Company grants restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance share units (PSUs) to certain management level employees. In addition, employees and non-employee directors may be granted options to purchase shares of Company common stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. These plans were approved by the Company’s shareholders.\nAt December 31, 2024, \n75\n million shares collectively were authorized for future grants under the Company’s share-based compensation plans. These awards are settled with treasury shares.\nEmployee stock options are granted to purchase shares of Company stock at the fair market value at the time of grant. These awards generally vest one-third each year over a \nthree-year\n period, with a contractual term of \n7\n-\n10\n years. RSUs are stock awards that are granted to employees and entitle the holder to shares of common stock as the awards vest. The fair value of the stock option and RSU awards is determined and fixed on the grant date based on the Company’s stock price. PSUs are stock awards where the ultimate number of shares issued will be contingent on the Company’s performance against a pre-set objective or set of objectives. The fair value of each PSU is determined on the date of grant based on the Company’s stock price. For RSUs and PSUs, dividends declared during the vesting period are payable to the employees only upon vesting. Over the PSU performance period, the number of shares of stock that are expected to be issued will be adjusted based on the probability of achievement of a performance target and final compensation expense will be recognized based on the ultimate number of shares issued. RSU and PSU distributions will be in shares of Company stock after the end of the vesting or performance \n113\nTable of Content\ns\nperiod, subject to the terms applicable to such awards. PSU awards generally vest after \nthree years\n. RSU awards generally vest one-third each year over a \nthree-year\n period.\nTotal pretax share-based compensation cost recorded in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n761\n million, $\n645\n million and $\n541\n million, respectively. Income tax benefits for share-based compensation expense recognized in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n117\n million, $\n96\n million and $\n78\n million, respectively.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of option grants. In applying this model, the Company uses both historical data and current market data to estimate the fair value of its options. The Black-Scholes model requires several assumptions including expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, volatility, and term of the options. The expected dividend yield is based on historical patterns of dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate at grant date of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Notes with a term equal to the expected term of the option. Expected volatility is estimated using a blend of historical and implied volatility. The historical component is based on historical monthly price changes. The implied volatility is obtained from market data on the Company’s traded options. The expected life represents the amount of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, based on historical and forecasted exercise behavior.\nThe weighted average exercise price of options granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n129.22\n, $\n117.89\n and $\n87.10\n per option, respectively. \nThe weighted average fair value of options granted in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n25.60\n, $\n21.69\n and $\n15.45\n per option, respectively, and were determined using the following assumptions:\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nExpected dividend yield\n3.0\n \n%\n3.1\n \n%\n3.1\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.7\n \n%\n3.4\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\nExpected volatility\n20.5\n \n%\n22.4\n \n%\n22.5\n \n%\nExpected life (years)\n5.8\n5.8\n5.9\nSummarized information relative to stock option plan activity (options in thousands) is as follows:\nNumber\nof Options\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\nPrice\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm (Years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding January 1, 2024\n13,527\n \n$\n77.54\n \nGranted\n1,753\n \n129.22\n \nExercised\n(\n2,581\n)\n68.90\n \nForfeited\n(\n199\n)\n111.48\n \n \n \nOutstanding December 31, 2024\n12,500\n \n$\n86.04\n \n5.9\n$\n249\n \nVested and expected to vest December 31, 2024\n12,201\n \n$\n85.10\n \n5.9\n$\n249\n \nExercisable December 31, 2024\n9,084\n \n$\n74.00\n \n4.9\n$\n241\n \nAdditional information pertaining to stock option plans is provided in the table below:\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal intrinsic value of stock options exercised\n$\n144\n \n$\n95\n \n$\n225\n \nFair value of stock options vested\n32\n \n30\n \n30\n \nCash received from the exercise of stock options\n177\n \n125\n \n384\n \n114\nTable of Content\ns\nA summary of nonvested RSU and PSU activity (shares in thousands) is as follows:\n \nRSUs\nPSUs\n  \nNumber\nof Shares\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nNumber\nof Shares\nWeighted\nAverage\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nNonvested January 1, 2024\n12,542\n \n$\n100.10\n \n1,966\n \n$\n90.80\n \nGranted\n6,356\n \n128.79\n \n968\n \n121.91\n \nVested\n(\n6,091\n)\n92.97\n \n(\n1,109\n)\n73.50\n \nForfeited\n(\n575\n)\n113.18\n \n(\n59\n)\n121.12\n \nNonvested December 31, 2024\n12,232\n \n$\n117.94\n \n1,766\n \n$\n117.57\n \nExpected to vest December 31, 2024\n10,976\n \n$\n117.25\n \n1,669\n \n$\n116.26\n \nAt December 31, 2024, there was $\n1.1\n billion of total pretax unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, RSU and PSU awards which will be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.9\n years.

There are three levels of inputs used to measure fair value with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest:\nLevel 1\n — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2\n — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3\n — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. The Level 3 assets are those whose values are determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques with significant unobservable inputs, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimation. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, $\n700\n million and $\n788\n million, respectively, or approximately \n4\n% of the Company’s pension investments were categorized as Level 3 assets.\nIf the inputs used to measure the financial assets fall within more than one level described above, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument.\n117\nTable of Content\ns\nThe fair values of the Company’s pension plan assets at December 31 by asset category are as follows:\n \nFair Value Measurements Using\nFair Value Measurements Using\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nNAV \n(1)\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nNAV \n(1)\nTotal\n2024\n2023\nU.S. Pension Plans\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n43\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n121\n \n$\n164\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n124\n \n$\n158\n \nInvestment funds\nDeveloped markets equities\n170\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,385\n \n2,555\n \n224\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,573\n \n2,797\n \nEmerging markets equities\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,265\n \n1,265\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n740\n \n740\n \nReal estate\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n174\n \n174\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n113\n \n113\n \nEquity securities\nDeveloped markets\n2,171\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,171\n \n2,071\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,071\n \nFixed income securities\nGovernment and agency obligations\n—\n \n2,101\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,101\n \n—\n \n2,307\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,307\n \nCorporate obligations\n—\n \n1,293\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,293\n \n—\n \n1,485\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,485\n \nMortgage and asset-backed securities\n—\n \n21\n \n—\n \n—\n \n21\n \n—\n \n21\n \n—\n \n—\n \n21\n \nOther investments (liabilities)\nDerivatives\n(\n29\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n29\n)\n109\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n109\n \nOther\n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n3\n \nPlan assets at fair value\n$\n2,355\n \n$\n3,415\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n3,945\n \n$\n9,717\n \n$\n2,438\n \n$\n3,813\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n3,550\n \n$\n9,804\n \nInternational Pension Plans\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n112\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n123\n \n$\n98\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n118\n \nInvestment funds\nDeveloped markets equities\n599\n \n3,537\n \n—\n \n96\n \n4,232\n \n507\n \n3,257\n \n—\n \n106\n \n3,870\n \nGovernment and agency obligations\n262\n \n2,974\n \n—\n \n149\n \n3,385\n \n234\n \n3,123\n \n—\n \n166\n \n3,523\n \nCorporate obligations\n23\n \n8\n \n—\n \n149\n \n180\n \n23\n \n8\n \n—\n \n166\n \n197\n \nEmerging markets equities\n54\n \n—\n \n—\n \n91\n \n145\n \n44\n \n—\n \n—\n \n66\n \n110\n \nOther fixed income obligations\n8\n \n7\n \n—\n \n4\n \n19\n \n9\n \n8\n \n—\n \n3\n \n20\n \nReal estate\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n12\n \n12\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n10\n \n10\n \nEquity securities\nDeveloped markets\n287\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n287\n \n278\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n278\n \nFixed income securities\nGovernment and agency obligations\n—\n \n368\n \n—\n \n—\n \n368\n \n—\n \n423\n \n—\n \n—\n \n423\n \nCorporate obligations\n—\n \n141\n \n—\n \n—\n \n141\n \n—\n \n160\n \n—\n \n—\n \n160\n \nMortgage and asset-backed securities\n—\n \n54\n \n—\n \n—\n \n54\n \n—\n \n61\n \n—\n \n—\n \n61\n \nOther investments\nInsurance contracts \n(2)\n—\n \n1\n \n698\n \n2\n \n701\n \n—\n \n1\n \n785\n \n2\n \n788\n \nOther\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4\n \nPlan assets at fair value\n$\n1,345\n \n$\n7,090\n \n$\n698\n \n$\n514\n \n$\n9,647\n \n$\n1,197\n \n$\n7,041\n \n$\n785\n \n$\n539\n \n$\n9,562\n \n(1)    \nCertain investments that were measured at net asset value (NAV) per share or its equivalent have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

The target investment portfolio of the Company’s U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans is allocated \n25\n% to \n40\n% in U.S. equities, \n15\n% to \n30\n% in international equities, \n40\n% to \n50\n% in fixed-income investments, and up to \n8\n% in cash and other investments. The portfolio’s equity weighting is consistent with the long-term nature of the plans’ benefit obligations. The expected annual standard deviation of returns of the target portfolio, which approximates \n12\n%, reflects both the equity allocation and the diversification benefits among the asset classes in which the portfolio invests. For international pension plans, the targeted investment portfolio varies based on the duration of pension liabilities and local government rules and regulations. \n119\nTable of Content\ns\nAlthough a significant percentage of plan assets are invested in U.S. equities, concentration risk is mitigated through the use of strategies that are diversified within management guidelines.\nExpected Contributions\nContributions during 2025 are expected to be approximately $\n270\n million for U.S. pension plans, approximately $\n180\n million for international pension plans and approximately $\n70\n million for other postretirement benefit plans.\nExpected Benefit Payments\nExpected benefit payments are as follows:\nU.S. Pension Benefits\nInternational Pension\nBenefits\nOther\nPostretirement\nBenefits\n2025\n$\n771\n \n$\n291\n \n$\n86\n \n2026\n775\n \n275\n \n87\n \n2027\n789\n \n286\n \n89\n \n2028\n799\n \n300\n \n91\n \n2029\n822\n \n314\n \n96\n \n2030 — 2034\n4,386\n \n1,792\n \n515\n \nExpected benefit payments are based on the same assumptions used to measure the benefit obligations and include estimated future employee service.\nAmounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nNet gain/loss amounts reflect differences between expected and actual returns on plan assets as well as the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions.

The expected rate of return for both the pension and other postretirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid and is determined on a plan basis. The expected rate of return for each plan is developed considering long-term historical returns data, current market conditions, and actual returns on the plan assets. Using this reference information, the long-term return expectations for each asset category and a weighted-average expected return for each plan’s target portfolio is developed according to the allocation among those investment categories. The expected portfolio performance reflects the contribution of active management as appropriate. For 2025, the expected rate of return for the Company’s U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans will be \n7.70\n%, as compared to \n7.75\n% in 2024. \nThe health care cost trend rate assumptions for other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nHealth care cost trend rate assumed for next year\n7.90\n \n%\n7.80\n \n%\nRate to which the cost trend rate is assumed to decline\n4.50\n \n%\n4.50\n \n%\nYear that the trend rate reaches the ultimate trend rate\n2040\n2038\nSavings Plans\nThe Company also maintains defined contribution savings plans in the U.S. The Company matches a percentage of each employee’s contributions consistent with the provisions of the plan for which the employee is eligible.

The \n122\nTable of Content\ns\nCompany remains indefinitely reinvested with respect to its financial statement basis in excess of tax basis of its foreign subsidiaries. A determination of the net deferred tax liability with respect to this basis difference is not practicable. \nThe foreign earnings tax rate differentials in the tax rate reconciliation above primarily reflect the impacts of operations in jurisdictions with different effective tax rates than the U.S., particularly Ireland, the Netherlands and Switzerland, as well as Singapore and Puerto Rico which operate under tax incentive grants (which begin to expire in 2025), thereby yielding a favorable impact on the effective tax rate compared with the U.S. statutory rate of 21%. The Company has an additional Cantonal tax holiday in Switzerland that provides for a tax rate reduction and is effective through 2032. The Company’s income that is subject to tax incentive grants and the Cantonal tax holiday in Switzerland is subject to the global minimum tax provision of the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (\nOECD) Pillar 2, effective in 2024.\nIncome before taxes consisted of:\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDomestic\n$\n(\n1,849\n)\n$\n(\n15,622\n)\n$\n1,011\n \nForeign\n21,785\n \n17,511\n \n15,433\n \n \n$\n19,936\n \n$\n1,889\n \n$\n16,444\n \nTaxes on income consisted of:\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCurrent provision\nFederal\n$\n944\n \n$\n928\n \n$\n2,265\n \nForeign\n3,123\n \n2,435\n \n1,164\n \nState\n(\n15\n)\n48\n \n57\n \n \n4,052\n \n3,411\n \n3,486\n \nDeferred provision\nFederal\n(\n1,475\n)\n(\n1,559\n)\n(\n1,510\n)\nForeign\n212\n \n(\n233\n)\n71\n \nState\n14\n \n(\n107\n)\n(\n129\n)\n \n(\n1,249\n)\n(\n1,899\n)\n(\n1,568\n)\n \n$\n2,803\n \n$\n1,512\n \n$\n1,918\n \n123\nTable of Content\ns\nDeferred income taxes at December 31 consisted of:\n \n2024\n2023\nAssets\nLiabilities\nAssets\nLiabilities\nProduct intangibles and licenses\n$\n71\n \n$\n978\n \n$\n— \n$\n1,308\n \nR&D capitalization\n3,062\n \n—\n \n2,099\n \n— \nInventory related\n84\n \n413\n \n86\n \n370\n \nAccelerated depreciation\n—\n \n645\n \n— \n626\n \nUndistributed foreign earnings\n275\n \n371\n \n76\n \n118\n \nEquity investments\n—\n \n90\n \n— \n73\n \nPensions and other postretirement benefits\n224\n \n400\n \n323\n \n249\n \nCompensation related\n400\n \n—\n \n357\n \n— \nUnrecognized tax benefits\n152\n \n—\n \n147\n \n— \nNet operating losses and other tax credit carryforwards\n910\n \n—\n \n868\n \n— \nOther\n802\n \n159\n \n755\n \n214\n \nSubtotal\n5,980\n \n3,056\n \n4,711\n \n2,958\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n710\n)\n \n(\n656\n)\n \nTotal deferred taxes\n$\n5,270\n \n$\n3,056\n \n$\n4,055\n \n$\n2,958\n \nNet deferred income taxes\n$\n2,214\n \n$\n1,097\n \nRecognized as:\nOther Assets\n$\n3,601\n \n$\n1,968\n \nDeferred Income Taxes\n \n$\n1,387\n \n \n$\n871\n \nThe Company has net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards in several jurisdictions.

The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024 could decrease by up to approximately $\n22\n million in the next 12 months as a result of various audit closures, settlements or the expiration of the statute of limitations. The ultimate finalization of the Company’s examinations with relevant taxing authorities can include formal administrative and legal proceedings, which could have a significant impact on the timing of the reversal of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company believes that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are adequate to cover existing risks or exposures. \nInterest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions amounted to an expense of $\n51\n million in 2024, $\n131\n million in 2023 and $\n54\n million in 2022. These amounts reflect the beneficial impacts of various tax settlements. Liabilities for accrued interest and penalties were $\n437\n million and $\n388\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nIn 2024, the Company recorded a benefit of $\n519\n million due to a reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration in 2024 of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is currently conducting examinations of the Company’s tax returns for the years 2017 and 2018, including the one-time transition tax enacted under the TCJA. If the IRS disagrees with the Company’s transition tax position, it may result in a significant tax liability. The IRS is also currently conducting examinations of the Company’s tax returns for the years 2021 and 2022. In addition, various state and foreign tax examinations are in progress and for these jurisdictions, the Company’s income tax returns are open for examination for the period 2009 through 2024.\n16.    \nEarnings per Share\nThe calculations of earnings per share (shares in millions) are as follows:\nYears Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet Income Attributable to Merck & Co., Inc.\n$\n17,117\n \n$\n365\n \n$\n14,519\n \nAverage common shares outstanding\n2,532\n \n2,537\n \n2,532\n \nCommon shares issuable \n(1)\n9\n \n10\n \n10\n \nAverage common shares outstanding assuming dilution\n2,541\n \n2,547\n \n2,542\n \nBasic Earnings per Common Share Attributable to Merck & Co., Inc.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n131\nTable of Content\ns\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nU.S. Rebate Accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D \nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records certain variable consideration including discounts, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. Certain of these discounts representing a portion of the accrual take the form of rebates, which are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector (Managed Care) and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. Management uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision. The accrued balance relative to the provision for rebates included in accrued and other current liabilities was $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which the majority relates to U.S. rebate accruals – Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D.  \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. rebate accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing the rebate accruals, as the accruals are based on assumptions developed using pricing information and historical customer segment utilization mix, and a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating evidence related to these assumptions.  \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. rebate accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D, including management’s controls over the assumptions used to estimate the corresponding rebate accruals. These procedures also included, among others (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebate accruals by utilizing third party data on historical customer segment utilization mix in the U.S., pricing information, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid, (ii) comparing the independent estimate to the rebate accruals recorded by management, and (iii) testing rebate claims paid, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual terms of the Company’s rebate agreements.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 25, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\n132\nTable of Content\ns\nItem 9.     Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNot applicable.\nItem 9A.      Controls and Procedures.\nManagement of the Company, with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Act)) are effective. For the fourth quarter of 2024, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has performed its own assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and its attestation report is included in this Form 10-K filing.\nManagement’s Report\nManagement’s Responsibility for Financial Statements\nResponsibility for the integrity and objectivity of the Company’s financial statements rests with management. The financial statements report on management’s stewardship of Company assets. These statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and, accordingly, include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Nonfinancial information included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K has also been prepared by management and is consistent with the financial statements.\nTo assure that financial information is reliable and assets are safeguarded, management maintains an effective system of internal controls and procedures, important elements of which include: careful selection, training and development of operating and financial managers; an organization that provides appropriate division of responsibility; and communications aimed at assuring that Company policies and procedures are understood throughout the organization. A staff of internal auditors regularly monitors the adequacy and application of internal controls on a worldwide basis.\nTo ensure that personnel continue to understand the system of internal controls and procedures, and policies concerning good and prudent business practices, annually all employees of the Company are required to complete Code of Conduct training. This training reinforces the importance and understanding of internal controls by reviewing key corporate policies, procedures and systems. In addition, the Company has compliance programs, including an ethical business practices program to reinforce the Company’s long-standing commitment to high ethical standards in the conduct of its business.\nThe financial statements and other financial information included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K fairly present, in all material respects, the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our formal certification to the Securities and Exchange Commission is included in this Form 10-K filing.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework\n issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls \n133\nTable of Content\ns\nmay become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\nRobert M.
