Our products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and U.S. residential mortgages, provide our customers with access to mission critical tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. Although we report our results in three reportable business segments, we operate as one business, leveraging the collective expertise, particularly in data services and technology, that exists across our platforms to inform and enhance our operations. Our segments are as follows:\n•\nExchanges:\n We operate regulated marketplace technology for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities as well as data and connectivity services related to our exchanges and clearing houses.\n•\nFixed Income and Data Services:\n We provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as global credit default swaps, or CDS, clearing and multi-asset class data delivery technology.\n•\nMortgage Technology:\n We provide a technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address inefficiencies and mitigate risks that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market life cycle, from application through closing, servicing and the secondary market.\nOur History\nIn 2000, ICE was founded with the idea of transforming energy markets by creating a network that removed barriers and provided greater transparency, efficiency and access. By staying close to our customers, we have expanded into new asset classes and services, while retaining a core mission of reducing friction in markets, bringing efficiency to our customers’ workflows and, ultimately, connecting our customers to opportunity.\nToday, we are a Fortune 500 company, providing our customers with an array of technology solutions and data services that span a diverse set of asset classes.\n4\nOur Business Segments\nOur business is conducted through three reportable business segments:\n•\nExchanges;\n•\nFixed Income and Data Services; and\n•\nMortgage Technology.\nThe majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and the U.K. For a summary of our revenues, net assets and net property and equipment by geographic region, see Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.\nExchanges Segment\nWe operate regulated marketplaces for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities, such as commodities, interest rates, foreign exchange and equities as well as corporate and exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. We operate multiple trading venues, including 13 regulated exchanges and 6 clearing houses, which are strategically positioned in major market centers around the world, including the U.S., U.K., European Union, or EU, Canada, Asia Pacific and the Middle East.\nOur Exchanges segment includes trading and listings revenue from our global futures network and the New York Stock Exchange and other registered securities exchanges, or collectively, the NYSE, and various data and connectivity services that are directly related to those exchange platforms. Revenues reflect a mix of both diversified transaction revenues and recurring data and listings revenues. Our Exchanges segment generated revenues, less transaction-based expenses of $5.0 billion and accounted for 53% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses in 2024. Key asset classes include:\n•\nEnergy Futures and Options:\n We offer a range of futures and options products that are designed to enable our customers to manage their risk across global energy markets. Our flagship Brent crude oil contract serves as the cornerstone of a global oil network that today includes over 800 related crude and refined oil products including locational and refined spreads. In addition, as natural gas and Liquefied Natural Gas, or LNG, continue to globalize, we offer one of the broadest footprints of regional and global natural gas benchmarks, which spans North America, Europe and Asia. Our leading environmental and power markets round out our diverse global energy network. For over two decades, our environmental markets have provided customers risk management tools to meet carbon cap and trade program requirements and renewable fuel standards. Increasingly, market \n5\nparticipants are turning to our global environmental markets to help navigate and manage risk related to climate change, the energy transition and the move to net zero emissions.\n•\nAgricultural & Metals Futures and Options:\n We offer futures and options on the leading global soft commodity markets including coffee, cocoa, cotton and sugar. Our benchmark contracts offer one of the most globally relevant price markers for these agricultural markets and provide our customers with the tools to manage price and counterparty risk and facilitate price discovery.\n•\nFinancial Futures and Options:\n We offer a diverse suite of equity futures and options contracts based on our own indices as well as those created by MSCI® and FTSE®. These contracts range from established global benchmarks, such as the MSCI® Emerging Market Index, to newer products, such as MSCI®’s suite of Environmental, Social and Governance, or ESG, indices and the NYSE FAANG+ Index. Our global interest rate complex spans geographies, currencies and tenors, providing participants around the world with tools to manage risk in a capital efficient manner. Key products include: Euribor, Gilts, Sterling Overnight Index Average, or SONIA, and Secured Overnight Financing Rates, or SOFR, among others.\n•\nCash Equities and Equity Options: \nWe offer securities trading services through our five registered securities exchanges, including the NYSE. Our securities exchanges are leading providers of transparent, efficient, and high quality markets for the securities issued by large and small companies, ETFs and equity options. These markets serve issuers, investors and other market participants across five cash equity and two options markets.\n•\nOTC and Other:\n Our over-the-counter, or OTC, markets include bilateral energy markets that offer electronic trading of contracts based on physically-settled natural gas, power and refined oil contracts and other trade confirmation services.

In addition, we receive a share of revenue from the sale of consolidated U.S. equity and options market data by the National Market System Plans, or NMS Plans. Separately, we also provide connectivity services directly related to our futures, cash equity and options exchanges and clearing houses. Revenues from data and connectivity services fees are largely recurring in nature.\n•\nListings:\n The NYSE has been the venue of choice for innovators, visionaries and leaders for over 230 years. The NYSE offers a unique hybrid market model that combines leading technology with an accountable market maker to provide human judgment, a community of the world’s greatest companies and premium brand visibility. With over 70% of S&P 500 companies listed on the NYSE as of December 31, 2024, we are a leading listing venue across a range of sectors from technology and healthcare, to financials and energy.

Revenues from listing fees are largely recurring in nature.\nWe operate 6 clearing houses, each of which acts as a central counterparty, or CCP, that, for its clearing members, becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. Through this CCP function, our clearing houses provide financial security for each transaction, for the duration of the position, by limiting counterparty credit risk. Our clearing houses are responsible for providing clearing services to each of our futures exchanges, and in some cases, to third-party execution venues.\nMechanisms have been created, called guaranty funds, to provide partial protection in the event of a clearing member default. Except for ICE NGX Canada Inc., or ICE NGX, each of the ICE Clearing Houses (as defined below) requires that each clearing member make deposits into a guaranty fund maintained by the relevant ICE Clearing House. In addition, we have contributed $370 million of our own cash to the guaranty funds which is one component of the table below, and such amounts are at risk and could be used in the event of a clearing member default. We also maintain default insurance as an additional layer of clearing member default protection, which is also reflected in the table below. The default insurance was renewed in September 2022 and has a three-year term for the following clearing houses in the following amounts: ICE Clear Europe - $100 million; ICE Clear U.S. - $25 million; and ICE Clear Credit - $75 million. In addition, the table below includes a guaranty fund of $215 million maintained by ICE NGX funded by the following: (1) a $200 million letter of credit issued by a major Canadian chartered bank, and backed by default insurance underwritten by Export Development Canada, a Crown corporation operated at arm’s length from the Canadian government, and (2) $15 million held as restricted cash to fund the first loss amount that ICE NGX is responsible for under the default insurance policy. Separately, ICE NGX has also set aside $30 million of its own capital that could be used for liquidity purposes in the event that a direct participant of the ICE NGX clearing house, or Contracting Party, defaults.\n6\nOur contributions to each clearing house as of December 31, 2024 are listed below and our clearing houses are referred to herein collectively as “the ICE Clearing Houses”:\nClearing House\nProducts Cleared\nLocation\nExchange where Executed\nReporting Segment\nICE's Contribution\nICE Clear Europe\n Energy, agricultural, interest rates and equity index futures and options contracts\nU.K.\nICE Futures Europe, ICE Futures U.S., ICE Endex and ICE Futures Abu Dhabi\nExchanges\n$297 million\nICE Clear U.S.\nAgricultural, metals, foreign exchange, or FX, interest rate, and equity index futures and options contracts\nU.S.\nICE Futures U.S.\nExchanges\n$100 million\nICE Clear Credit\n(1)\nOTC North American, European, Asian-Pacific and Emerging Market CDS instruments\nU.S.\nCreditex and third-party venues\nFixed Income and Data Services\n$125 million\nICE Clear Netherlands\nDerivatives on equities and equity indices traded on regulated markets\nThe Netherlands\nICE Endex\nExchanges\n$2 million\nICE Clear Singapore\nEnergy, metals and financial futures products\nSingapore\nICE Futures Singapore\nExchanges\n$1 million\nICE NGX\nPhysical North American natural gas, environmental commodities and physical and financial electricity\nCanada\nICE NGX\nExchanges\n$245 million\n(1)    Although ICE Clear Credit is included in the Fixed Income and Data Services reporting segment, it is included in the table as a part of our suite of global clearing houses.\nFixed Income and Data Services Segment\nOur Fixed Income and Data Services segment includes our fixed income execution, or ICE Bonds, CDS clearing, our fixed income data and analytics offerings, and other multi-asset class data and network services.

We also face competition for foreign issuer listings from a number of stock exchanges outside the U.S. When other liquidity venues and new entrants obtain exchange status, we face more competition for listings.\nFixed Income and Data Services Segment\n•\nOur fixed income trading venues, or ICE Bonds, compete with other electronic trading venues. Our platforms also compete for volume traded bilaterally or trading activity that is not done through an electronic venue.\n•\nOur data services offerings face intense competition in all aspects of the business. We broadly compete with purchased third-party information and services from large global suppliers of financial market data, including vendor firms, financial consortia, and individual financial institutions. Our Fixed Income Data and Analytics services compete with information obtained from informal industry relationships and sources as well as other index and portfolio analytics providers. Our ICE Global Network business competes with other extranet providers.\n13\nMortgage Technology Segment\n•\nOur origination technology, closing solutions, and servicing software compete with our clients' proprietary systems and other third-party digital mortgage solution providers. We also compete for mortgage activity that does not utilize digital solutions.\n•\nOur data and analytics competitors are primarily third-party providers of similar data assets, including certain niche providers and lender in-house capabilities.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe seek to advance our leadership position by focusing our efforts on the following key strategies for growth:\n•\ninnovate and expand the networks we serve to address the rising demand for transparency and efficiency;\n•\nfurther develop our technology and risk management infrastructure while also increasing our customer base; and\n•\nstrengthen our competitive position through select acquisitions and strategic relationships.\nThe record consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, we achieved in 2024 reflect our focus on the implementation and execution of our long-term growth strategy.\nInnovate and Expand the Networks We Serve to Address the Rising Demand for Transparency and Efficiency\nOur growth strategy has been to expand the networks we serve by, in part, adding new data, technology, connectivity and other workflow tools. By bringing together leading technology with a wide range of data and analytics, as well as an array of delivery mechanisms, we offer customers a comprehensive and flexible solution to address the need for more transparency, efficiency and information across their respective workflows. Our growth has been driven by many factors, such as increased automation, regulation and demand for independent, secure, real-time information.\nWe will continue to look for strategic opportunities to grow our networks and expect to also continue to pursue opportunities in asset classes we do not currently serve.\nFurther Develop Our Technology and Risk Management Infrastructure While Also Increasing Our Customer Base\nWe develop and maintain our own infrastructure, electronic trading platforms, clearing systems, mortgage platforms and data and analytics platforms, which are designed to ensure scalability and the delivery of technology that meets our expanding customer base’s demands for price transparency, reliability, risk management and transaction efficiency. The systems that we operate support trading, clearing, the mortgage market life cycle, data and analytics across many data centers.\nWe expect to continue to develop our exchange technologies. We also expect to continue to invest in mortgage technology to streamline and automate more workflows and build new capabilities. Finally, we expect to add content and build new analytics to enable further electronification in fixed income markets.\nOur customer base has grown and diversified as a result of several drivers, including the addition of new asset classes, products and services, the move toward increased risk management and increased automation, regulation and demand for independent, secure, real-time information. We continue to add new participants to our platforms, which bring additional demand for new products and services. We develop new products, but have also increased our capabilities through licenses and acquisitions of companies and intellectual property. We intend to continue to increase the ease of access and connectivity with our existing and prospective customers and expand our customer base by leveraging our existing relationships and our global sales and marketing team to promote participation on our platform, and by expanding our range of products and services.\nStrengthen Our Competitive Position Through Select Acquisitions and Strategic Relationships\nWe were an early consolidator in global markets and we intend to continue to explore and pursue acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position globally, broaden our product offerings and services and support the growth of our company while enhancing stockholder value as measured by return on invested capital, earnings accretion and cash flow growth. We may enter into business combinations, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or other alliances, any of which may be material. In addition to growing our business, we may enter into these transactions for a variety of additional reasons, including leveraging our existing strengths to enter new markets or related asset classes, expanding our products and services, diversifying our business, addressing underserved markets, advancing our technology and anticipating or responding to regulatory or other potential changes in our industry or other industries.\n14\nInformation About Our Executive Officers\nInformation relating to our executive officers is included under “Executive Officers” in Part III, Item 10, “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” of this Annual Report.\nRegulation\nOur activities and the markets in which we operate are subject to regulations that impact us as well as our customers, and, in turn, meaningfully influence our activities, the manner in which we operate and our strategy.

Accordingly, our U.S. securities exchanges are regulated by the SEC and, in turn, are the regulators of their members. As national securities exchanges, NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE American, NYSE National and NYSE Chicago must comply with, and enforce compliance by their members with, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act.\n15\n•\nWe operate a U.S.-based execution-oriented market for the trading of securities that are not exchange-listed (OTC securities) as an ATS by our SEC-registered broker-dealer, Archipelago Trading Services. Archipelago Trading Services is subject to oversight by the SEC and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA.

Both Creditex Brokerage and ICE Markets Limited are regulated and authorized by the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, or FCA. Creditex Brokerage is authorized to provide automated trading services in Hong Kong, Singapore and Switzerland and is subject to regulatory oversight by national competent authorities in each jurisdiction.\nRegulation of our Data Business\nWe have a U.S. subsidiary, ICE Data Pricing & Reference, LLC, that is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or the Investment Advisers Act, for its evaluated pricing and other advisory services. The Investment Advisers Act imposes numerous regulatory obligations on registered investment advisers, including those relating to the management and distribution of products and services, record-keeping, compliance oversight, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. ICE Data Services (Australia) Pty. Ltd. provides financial services in Australia and is licensed by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, or ASIC. ICE Data Desktop Solutions (Europe) Limited provides certain financial services throughout Europe and is regulated by the FCA.\nRegulation of our Index Business\nWe have an index business, ICE Data Indices, LLC, or ICE Data Indices, which includes equity, fixed income, commodity, volatility, mortgage, sustainability and foreign exchange indices. ICE Data Indices applies the International Organization of Securities Commissions, or IOSCO, Principles for Financial Benchmarks to its indices, and is recognized as a third-country benchmark administrator by the FCA under the U.K. Benchmarks Regulation, or U.K. BMR. In addition, ICE Benchmark Administration Limited, or IBA, applies the IOSCO Principles for Financial Benchmarks to its indices and is authorized and regulated by the FCA for the regulated activity of administering a benchmark and is authorized as a benchmark administrator under the U.K. BMR.\nRegulation of our Mortgage Business\nWe have a mortgage technology business, ICE Mortgage Technology, that provides software, data, and electronic data processing to financial institutions and other stakeholders throughout the U.S. residential mortgage industry. ICE Mortgage Technology is subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, or FFIEC, and its member agencies because ICE Mortgage Technology is a third-party technology service provider to financial institutions directly regulated by the FFIEC's member agencies. In addition, our Mortgage Technology business provides loan origination and servicing technology to mortgage lenders and servicers and processes consumer financial information on behalf of our customers. As a result, ICE Mortgage Technology is subject to a variety of U.S. state and federal regulations governing the protection of consumer financial information, including federal consumer financial laws implemented and enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB. ICE Mortgage Technology is designated as an operator of \"critical infrastructure\" by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Department of Treasury.\n16\nRegulatory Changes\nDomestic and foreign policy makers continue to review their legal frameworks governing financial markets, and periodically change the laws and regulations that apply to our business and to our customers’ businesses. Our key areas of focus on these evolving efforts are:\n•\nIncreased Bank Capital Requirements. \nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, or the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation proposed to implement various Basel Committee standards which would increase U.S. bank capital requirements (Basel III Endgame). The Basel III Endgame would apply credit valuation adjustment risk capital requirements to bank-affiliated clearing members' exposures to their clearing clients. The Federal Reserve also proposes to revise the risk-based capital surcharge for global systemically important bank holding companies to include bank-affiliated clearing members' exposures to their clearing clients in additional aspects of the surcharge calculation. Both proposals would increase capital requirements for client clearing activities, which could increase costs for clearing services, decrease clearing members' clearing capacity, and result in a reduction of cleared volumes at our clearing houses. The Basel III Endgame proposal could also discourage participation in mortgage lending and servicing, resulting in a reduction of mortgage volumes at ICE Mortgage Technology, negatively impact U.S. capital markets, end users' ability to hedge and raise financing through public markets and degrade liquidity. The Basel III Endgame received significant industry feedback, and in September 2024, Michael Barr, Vice Chairman for Supervision of the Federal Reserve, indicated that he intends to recommend that both the Basel III Endgame and G-SIB surcharge be re-proposed. Under the new administration, it is possible that the Basel III Endgame and G-SIB surcharge could be revised beyond the changes suggested by Michael Barr.\n•\nEMIR 3.0. \nUnder the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, or EMIR, known as EMIR 3.0, EU counterparties will need to establish accounts and clear a minimum number of trades (referred to as the active account requirement) in euro-denominated short-term interest rate products with an EU-based clearing house which will affect ICE Euribor and €STR contracts.\n•\nPolicy intervention to address high energy prices\n.\n \nVarious legislative proposals in the EU have been adopted to address high energy prices and impact ICE Endex, the primary European exchange for the benchmark European gas contract, and ICE Clear Europe, which clears ICE Endex contracts. These policy interventions include a temporary price cap on certain Dutch Title Transfer Facility, or TTF, derivatives traded on ICE Endex, which expired on January 31, 2025. In addition, in December 2022, a coalition of G7 and other nations set the price of certain Russian crude oil at or below $60 a barrel, which remains in place and impacts the services we offer to clients.\n•\nRecognition of our Businesses in Foreign Jurisdictions and Continued Access by Market Participants\n.\n \nIn January 2025, the European Commission extended until June 2028 the temporary equivalence decision that allows continued access by EU firms to clear trades at U.K. CCPs.\n•\nRegulation of ESG data and ratings. \nMany jurisdictions have adopted or are proposing or considering proposals to regulate environmental, social or governance, or ESG, data providers, as well as ESG ratings. In December 2024, the EU Regulation on ESG Ratings Providers was published in the Official Journal of the EU. The regulation introduces a regulatory regime for ESG rating providers operating in the EU and will take effect in July 2026. Certain ICE Data Service offerings will likely be in scope and will be required to become authorized and supervised by ESMA. The U.K. government has also published draft legislation proposing to regulate ESG data providers. If adopted, certain ICE Data Service offerings could be subject to increased regulation and oversight by the FCA.\n•\nEquity Market Structure Rules.\n In September 2024, the SEC adopted new rules regarding equity market structure which changed the minimum pricing increments, or tick sizes, for the quoting of certain stocks to allow these stocks to be priced with tighter spreads and reduced current fee caps exchanges can charge market participants for access to protected quotations. These rules have been challenged in court and the SEC has stayed implementation of these rules pending judicial review. The SEC also adopted rules requiring all exchange fees charged and rebates paid for execution of an order to be determinable at the time of execution and accelerating the date by which market participants must make information available for smaller-sized orders, which will take effect in November 2025. These rules, including those currently stayed, could affect market and competitive dynamics for venues that facilitate trading of equity securities.\n•\nEU Deforestation Regulation. \nIn December 2024, the EU postponed the effective date of the EU Deforestation Regulation, or EUDR, from December 30, 2024 to December 30, 2025 for large companies and to June 30, 2026 for small entities. EUDR requires that certain commodities (including cocoa and coffee) and their products be from deforestation-free land and meet other requirements before they can be placed or made available on the EU \n17\nmarket, or exported from it. The EUDR requirements may decelerate the physical trade of cocoa and coffee, impact the usability of EU coffee and cocoa physical inventories, and reduce trading volumes on ICE Futures Europe of the Robusta Coffee Contract and London Cocoa Contract and on ICE Futures U.S. of the Coffee C Contract (Arabica).\n•\nEU DORA Regulation.\n The Digital Operational Resilience Act, or DORA, is an EU regulation that establishes an information and communication technology, or ICT, risk management framework for the EU financial sector. DORA establishes technical standards that EU financial entities must implement by January 2025 and imposes requirements relating to risk management, reporting, and information and communications technology service provider oversight. ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands are EU financial entities and, thus, directly subject to DORA requirements. In addition, EU financial entities using ICT services provided by ICE may be required to impose certain obligations on ICE entities. In January 2025, the European Commission provided guidance clarifying that financial services provided by a regulated entity (including those regulated outside the EU) should not be considered ICT services under DORA.\nSee the discussion below and Item 1(A) “- Risk Factors” in this Annual Report for additional description of regulatory and legislative risks and uncertainties.\nAvailable Information\nOur principal executive offices are located at 5660 New Northside Drive, 3rd Floor, Atlanta, Georgia 30328.

Other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material, or of which we are not presently aware, may become important factors that affect us in the future. If any of the risks discussed below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows could be materially adversely affected. Accordingly, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report.\nSUMMARY\nThe following summarizes some of the key risks and uncertainties that could materially adversely affect us. You should read this summary together with the more detailed description of each risk factor contained below.\nBusiness and Industry\n•    Global economic, political and financial market events or conditions have at times in the past negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact our business.\n•    Our business is subject to the impact of interest rate and inflation levels and volatility and financial markets volatility, which are caused by conditions that are beyond our control.\n•    Our role in the global financial system positions us at a greater risk for cyberattacks, cyberterrorism and other cybersecurity risks.\n18\n•    We may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies.\n•    Systems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry and mortgage technology industry have in the past negatively impacted us and could in the future negatively impact us.\n•    Owning clearing houses exposes us to risks, including risks related to defaults by clearing members, risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses.\n•    If the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses declines or a sovereign government issuer defaults, clearing members may be at risk of defaulting, which could adversely impact our clearing houses.\n•    Owning and operating cash equity and options exchanges exposes us to risks, including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject.\n•    Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results.\n•    We may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively.\n•    We may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities.\n•    Climate change poses operational, commercial, reputational, regulatory and financial risks.\n•    We face reputational, regulatory and financial risks related to our ability to respond to diverse stakeholder expectations and requirements on sustainability-related topics, including in connection with a transition to clean and renewable energy.\n•    We have in the past been, and may in the future be, required to recognize impairments of our goodwill, other intangible assets or investments.\n•    Our majority investment in Bakkt Holdings, Inc., or Bakkt, may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model.\n•    Pandemics and other public health emergencies could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLegal and Regulatory \n•    Our businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to extensive legislation and regulatory scrutiny, and we face the risk of changes to our regulatory environment and business in the future.\n•    Our compliance and risk management methods, as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations, may not be effective, which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators or other legal proceedings.\n•    Regulatory developments or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market and mortgage data and technology and connectivity fees.\n•    Ongoing impacts and uncertainty following the U.K.'s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n•    Risks relating to the administration of benchmarks and indices, and changes to, cessations of, and the replacement of, or transition from, benchmarks and indices may result in legal risks and could adversely affect our business.\n•    We may face liability for content contained in our data products and services.\n•    We are subject to significant litigation and liability risks, including enforcement actions by our regulators.\nOperational and Liquidity\n•    Our systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to cyberattacks, hacking and other cybersecurity risks, which could result in wrongful manipulation, disclosure, destruction, or use of our information or that of a third party, or which could make our customers unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms or other products and services.\n•    Our business has in the past been, and may in the future be, harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays.\n•    An interruption or cessation of an important service, data or content supplied by any third party, or the loss of an exclusive license, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n19\n•    Our emerging technology initiatives under development and the use of artificial intelligence in certain of our existing products may be unsuccessful and may give rise to various risks, which could adversely affect our business, reputation or operating results.\n•    Our success largely depends on key personnel, including our senior management, and having adequate succession plans in place. We may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business, which could harm our business.\n•    We currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our activities or our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations. \nCompetition and Reputational Harm\n•    We face intense competition, and if we fail to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences, it could negatively impact our competitive position.\n•    Damage to our reputation could damage our business.\nMergers & Acquisitions and Common Stock\n•    We may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments, which could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\n•    We are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\n•    Provisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ICE.\nIntellectual Property\n•    Our use of \"open source\" software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to litigation.\n•    A failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, could adversely affect our business.\nBUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nGlobal economic, political and financial market events or conditions have at times in the past negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact our business.\nAdverse macroeconomic conditions, including recessions, inflation, supply chain issues, labor shortages, government shutdowns, currency fluctuations, interest rate changes, increased mortgage foreclosure volume, decreased mortgage origination or servicing volume, geopolitical events or conflicts, political uncertainty and discord, international trade disputes and sanction laws, including the imposition of tariffs or other protectionist measures, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures or slowdown of global trade and travel have in the past negatively impacted consumer and corporate confidence and resulted in reductions in consumer, government and corporate spending, and could have such effects in the future, and in turn impact our business. If our customers reduce spending, workforce, mortgage origination, mortgage servicing activity or trading activity, or if there is reduced demand for financial and property data as a result of adverse macroeconomic conditions, our revenues could decline.\nDuring 2024, macroeconomic conditions, including interest rate, inflation and market volatility, the presidential election in the United States and general elections in many jurisdictions in the U.S. and abroad, along with geopolitical concerns, including the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, created economic and political uncertainty and volatility in global markets, which resulted in a dynamic operating environment and impacted our operations and results. We expect these impacts may continue in 2025. Although inflation generally decreased in 2024 and central banks began modest reductions in interest rates, there remains uncertainty regarding, and volatility in, the inflation rate. Higher inflation levels could return, however, due to, among other things, potential tax cuts or tariffs, which could reduce the appetite for continued interest rate cuts and even necessitate interest rate increases in 2025, which could have a negative impact on our business. Changes in monetary policies resulting from contrasting election results in many of the countries in which we operate, such as the U.S., U.K. and EU, could impact our business. Beginning in 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict has been a catalyst for an energy crisis in Europe. Government interventions related to the energy crisis resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, such as the Market Correction Mechanism (price cap), or interventions that may be proposed in the future related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict or the conflict in the Middle East have had and could in the future have a negative impact on our business. See Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” above for additional information on various legislative proposals in the EU to address high energy prices.\n20\nIn addition, U.S. trade and diplomatic tensions, including trade disputes and tariffs as well as U.S. government policies toward China and Chinese government policies toward the U.S., are likely to impact our existing business and future opportunities. For example, the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act, or HFCAA, requires the SEC to suspend trading in the U.S. of any company whose accounting firm the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB, is unable to inspect or investigate for three consecutive years. In November 2023, following inspections of audit firms for the Chinese and Hong Kong issuers the SEC had previously identified as using non-inspected audit firms, the PCAOB announced settlements related to these inspections, which could lead to fewer Chinese companies listing in the U.S. Moreover, there remains the risk that the SEC may suspend trading of NYSE-listed companies under the HFCAA, which would require us to suspend trading for those companies to comply with U.S. government policies, which could impact our business. Other political developments, including changes in China-Taiwan relations, trade disputes and tariffs on countries such as Canada or Mexico, may also impact our business and future opportunities.\nThe market and mortgage data subscriptions and trading volumes in our markets could decline substantially if our market participants reduce their level of spending or trading activity for any reason, including:\n•    adverse market conditions that curtail the addition of new customers or cause a decrease in purchases by our existing customers for our subscription-based products and services;\n•    weakness in the macroeconomic environment that causes our customers to delay or cancel existing orders or subscriptions;\n•    cost-cutting pressures across the industry or a decrease in demand for our subscription-based products and services that lead to a reduction in price;\n•    consolidation in our markets or the markets of our customers that results in a reduction in the number of market participants;\n•    a reduction in trading demand by customers or a decision to curtail or cease hedging or speculative trading;\n•    regulatory or legislative changes impacting our business, our customers and financial markets;\n•    political uncertainty and discord could negatively impact us if we are viewed as taking a political stance that is contrary to our customers’ beliefs or principles;\n•    the impact of climate change and the impact of, and uncertainty related to, the transition to renewable energy and away from fossil fuels, including regulatory or legislative changes;\n•    a prolonged decrease in volatility in the financial markets;\n•    heightened capital and margin requirements or mandated reductions in leverage resulting from new regulations;\n•    defaults by clearing or exchange members or the inability of participants to pay out contractual obligations;\n•    changes to our contract specifications that are not viewed favorably by our market participants; or\n•    reduced access to, or availability of, capital required to fund trading activities.\nA reduction in our overall trading volume could render our markets less attractive to market participants as a source of liquidity, which could result in further loss of trading volume and associated transaction-based revenues. A reduction in trading volumes could also result in a corresponding decrease in demand for our market data, which would further reduce our overall revenue.\nFurther, NYSE’s revenue increases when more companies are seeking access to public markets, and on the NYSE specifically. Reduced demand for IPOs as compared to historical levels, or issuers choosing to list on venues other than the NYSE, have had and could continue to have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nIn addition, adverse conditions in the residential mortgage lending industry, including a substantial or prolonged decline in mortgage lending volume or an increase in mortgage foreclosure volume, have in the past increased our costs or had an adverse effect on our revenues and may do so in the future. For example, beginning in early 2022, in line with the Federal Reserve raising rates numerous times as part of its anti-inflation strategy, mortgage lending volume decreased substantially. Although this trend has stalled or partially reversed at times in 2023 and 2024, it could continue in the future, meaning we could see a further decline in mortgage origination volumes. This decrease in lending volume has adversely affected our revenues, in particular those of a transactional nature which are directly connected to the number of loans processed using our technology. Factors that are currently adversely impacting mortgage lending volumes include elevated mortgage interest rates, as well as housing affordability and availability. Additional factors that could now or in the future adversely impact mortgage lending volumes include reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages, more stringent underwriting guidelines, decreased liquidity in the secondary mortgage market, high levels of unemployment, \n21\nhigh levels of consumer debt, lower consumer confidence, changes in tax and other regulatory policies, the number of existing mortgages eligible for refinancing, and other macroeconomic factors. Although certain of our mortgage technology products, in particular those supporting default management, may see higher demand during times of rising mortgage foreclosure volume, this increase in demand may be outweighed by the impacts of reduced mortgage lending volume and in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. A reduction in mortgage volume could also result in a corresponding decrease in demand for mortgage data products, which would further reduce our revenues.\nOur business is subject to the impact of interest rate and inflation levels and volatility and financial markets volatility, which are caused by conditions that are beyond our control.\nTrading volume in our markets and products is largely driven by the degree of volatility - the magnitude and frequency of fluctuations - in prices and levels of the underlying commodities, securities, indices, financial benchmarks or other instruments. Volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates opportunities for investment and speculative or arbitrage trading. Were there to be a sustained period of stability in the prices or levels of the underlying commodities, securities, indices, benchmarks or other instruments of our products, we could experience lower trading volumes, slower growth or declines in revenues.\nIn addition, interest rates are a significant factor influencing mortgage loan production volumes and loan foreclosures, as discussed above. Rising or high interest rates generally reduce mortgage loan production volumes and increase loan foreclosures, which has in the past impacted and could in the future impact our transaction-based revenues.\nRapid increases in and high levels of inflation in recent years have impacted the credit health of market participants, increased the risk of default and increased the risk of companies not being able to comply with listing standards. An inflationary environment generally also reduces consumer optimism, resulting in lower demand for mortgage loans. Although inflation generally moderated in 2024, inflation rates have remained volatile and uncertainty remains regarding whether inflation will increase again in the future. Higher inflation levels could adversely affect our business, including by further increasing the cost of capital, resulting in a slowdown of the growth of early stage companies, causing companies to stay private longer.\nFactors that are particularly likely to affect price and interest rate levels and volatility, and thus trading and mortgage loan production volumes, include:\n•    global economic and market conditions;\n•    global political conditions including political uncertainty and discord as a result of elections in many jurisdictions, including in the U.S. and the U.K.; and\n•    concerns over recession, inflation, deflation, legislative and regulatory changes, government fiscal and monetary policy, including actions by the Federal Reserve and other foreign monetary units governing bodies, developments related to the U.S. federal debt ceiling, including the possibility of a government shutdown, default by the U.S. government on its debt obligations or related credit rating downgrades, and investor and consumer confidence levels.\nFactors that are particularly likely to affect trading volumes include:\n•    weather conditions including hurricanes and other significant events, natural and unnatural disasters like large oil spills that impact the production of commodities and, in the case of energy commodities, production, refining and distribution facilities for oil and natural gas;\n•    war, acts of terrorism and any unforeseen market closures or disruptions in trading;\n•    political developments impacting international trade, including trade disputes and increased tariffs, particularly between the U.S. and China, Canada or Mexico and imposition of protectionist measures;\n•    real and perceived changes in the supply and demand of commodities underlying our products, particularly energy and agricultural products, including changes as a result of technological improvements or the development of alternative energy sources; and\n•    credit quality of market participants, the availability of capital and the levels of assets under management.\nAny one or more of these or other factors, which are beyond our control, may reduce volumes and trading activity. Further, lower market volatility could also result in more exchanges competing for trading volumes to maintain their growth. If any of these unfavorable conditions were to persist over a lengthy period of time and trading volumes were to decline substantially and for a long enough period, the critical mass of transaction volume necessary to support viable markets \n22\ncould be jeopardized. Because our cost structure is largely fixed, if demand for our current products and services declines for any reason, we may not be able to adjust our cost structure to counteract the associated decline in revenues, which would cause our net income to decline.\nOur role in the global financial system positions us at a greater risk for cyberattacks, cyberterrorism and other cybersecurity risks.\nThe cybersecurity threat landscape remains a macro concern for most organizations, and particularly those associated with the U.S. financial infrastructure. We may be more likely than other companies to be a target of cyberattacks and other cybersecurity risks due to our role in the global financial ecosystem and the high-profile nature of many of our businesses that deliver critical services to a broad range of financial market participants. For a discussion of our cyber risks, see “—Item 1- \"Business—Cybersecurity\". Our systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to cyberattacks, hacking and other cybersecurity risks, which could result in wrongful manipulation, disclosure, destruction, or use of our information or that of a third party, or which could make our customers unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms or other products and services.”\nIt is impossible to precisely predict the likelihood or impact of any cyberattack on the securities industry generally, or on our business. In the event of a cyberattack or a threat of a cyberattack, our security measures and contingency plans may be inadequate to prevent significant disruptions in our business, technology or access to the infrastructure necessary to maintain our business. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may be at greater risk from terrorism than other companies.\nGiven our prominence in the global financial industry and the location of many of our properties and personnel in U.S., U.K. and European financial centers, including Manhattan, and our presence in India, Abu Dhabi and Israel, we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of attacks by terrorists or terrorist organizations, or other extremist organizations that employ threatening or harassing means to achieve their social or political objectives. Damage to our business or facilities due to such attacks may be significantly in excess of insurance coverage, and we may not be able to insure against some damage at a reasonable price or at all. The threat of terrorist attacks may also negatively affect our ability to attract and retain employees. In addition, terrorist attacks may cause instability or decreased trading in the markets we operate, including trading on our securities exchanges. Any of these events could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSystems failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry and mortgage technology industry have in the past negatively impacted us and could in the future negatively impact us.\nHigh-profile system failures in the derivatives and securities trading industry and mortgage technology industry, including due to cybersecurity disruptions and attacks, have in the past, and could in the future, negatively impact our business and result in a loss of confidence in our technology and our markets, regulatory investigations, fines and penalties and business activity slowdown or interruptions. Further, regulators have imposed requirements for trading platforms that have been costly for us to implement and could result in a decrease in demand for some of our services. In particular, the SEC’s Regulation Systems Compliance and Integrity, or Regulation SCI, and the CFTC’s system safeguards regulations subject portions of our securities and derivatives trading platforms and other technological systems related to our clearing houses, trade repositories and the U.S. Swap Execution Facility, or SEF, to extensive regulation and oversight. Ensuring our compliance with the requirements of Regulation SCI and the CFTC’s system safeguards regulations requires significant ongoing administrative and compliance expenses and burdens. The SEC’s expansion of the obligations under Regulation SCI, including to the ICE businesses or systems that are determined to be in the scope of the regulation, in the past has resulted, and in the future could result, in significant additional expenditures. In addition, the Digital Operational Resilience Act, or DORA, that went into effect on January 17, 2025, establishes an information and communication technology, or ICT, risk management framework for the EU financial sector and imposes risk management, reporting and information oversight for EU financial entities and their ICT third-party service providers. Some of our businesses are impacted by the compliance burdens and costs of DORA as EU financial entities or ICT third-party service providers to EU financial entities.\nOwning clearing houses exposes us to risks, including risks related to defaults by clearing members, risks related to investing margin and guaranty funds and the cost of operating the clearing houses.\nThere are risks inherent in operating clearing houses, including exposure to the market and counterparty risk of clearing members, market liquidity risks, defaults by clearing members and risks associated with custody and investing margin or guaranty fund assets provided by clearing members to our clearing houses, which could subject our business to substantial losses. As of December 31, 2024, we custody a total of $84.3 billion of clearing members' margin and guaranty funds across all of our clearing houses. To the extent available, ICE clearing houses use Sovereign Central Banks to \n23\ncustody assets. For example, ICE Clear Credit holds the U.S. dollar cash and U.S. Treasuries that clearing members transfer to satisfy their original margin and guaranty fund requirements at its account at the Federal Reserve. ICE clearing houses may also use third-party investment agents for investment of cash assets, subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house, and may add or change the investment agents from time to time.\nAlthough our clearing houses have policies and procedures to manage the risks to which they are exposed, including collecting margin and guaranty fund contributions from clearing members, such policies and procedures may not succeed in preventing losses after a member's or counterparty’s default. The processes for calculating and setting margins and financial safeguards is complex and there is no guarantee that our risk models that are utilized to calculate margin and our financial safeguard procedures will adequately protect us in all circumstances. In addition, from time to time, we may redesign the methodology of the risk models that are utilized to calculate margin. Redesigning and implementing a new risk model is a complex process, involving quantitative analysis, regulatory approval and implementation risk. We cannot guarantee that the measures and safeguards we have undertaken to design, implement and operate risk models, calculate and collect margin, and protect our clearing houses in the case of a clearing member default, will be sufficient. Accordingly, it is possible that we would be materially and adversely affected in the event of one or more significant defaults. We have contributed our own capital, or ‘Skin in the Game’, to the front of the guaranty fund of each of the clearing houses that could be used in the event of a default. We also have default insurance that resides after and in addition to the ICE Clear Credit, ICE Clear Europe, and ICE Clear U.S. ‘Skin in the Game’ contributions to the default waterfalls of each of the clearing houses and before the guaranty fund contributions of the non-defaulting clearing members. Notwithstanding these actions, the default of one or more of the clearing members could subject our business to substantial losses and/or cause our customers to lose confidence in our clearing houses and, as a result, in our exchange traded business in general.\nIf the value of securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions by our clearing houses declines or a sovereign government issuer defaults, clearing members may be at risk of defaulting, which could adversely impact our clearing houses.\nOur clearing houses hold a substantial amount of assets as margin or guaranty fund contributions, which comprise U.S. and other sovereign treasury securities. As of December 31, 2024, our clearing houses held $83.1 billion of non-cash margin or guaranty fund contributions in U.S. and other sovereign treasury securities: $72.0 billion of this amount was comprised of U.S. Treasury securities, $6.5 billion of various EU member country Treasury securities, $2.6 billion of U.K. Treasury securities and $1.9 billion of other European, Japanese, Canadian and Tri-Party Treasury securities. Sovereign treasury securities have historically been viewed as one of the safest and most liquid securities for clearing houses to hold due to the perceived credit worthiness of major governments. If there is a collapse in a specific currency relied upon by our clearing houses, our clearing houses could face significant expenses and such an event could cause a credit contraction and major swings in asset prices and exchange rates. To mitigate this risk, our clearing houses currently apply a discount or “haircut” to the market values for all sovereign securities held as margin or guaranty fund contributions; however, market conditions could change more quickly than we adjust the amount of the haircuts and the haircuts could be insufficient in the event of a sudden market event.\nIf the value of these securities declines significantly, our clearing houses will need to collect additional margin or guaranty fund contributions from their clearing members, which may be difficult for the members to supply in a time of financial stress affected by an actual or threatened default by a sovereign government. If a clearing member cannot supply the additional margin or guaranty fund contributions, which may include cash in a currency acceptable to the clearing house, the clearing house would deem the clearing member in default. If any clearing members default as a result of the reduction in the value of margin or guaranty fund contributions, our clearing houses and trading business could suffer substantial losses as a result of the loss of any capital that has been contributed to the clearing house’s guaranty funds and a loss of confidence by clearing members in the clearing house, resulting in a reduction in volumes of future cleared transactions.\nFurther, our clearing houses invest large sums through reverse repo transactions in connection with their clearing operations and hold sovereign securities as security in connection with such investment transactions. In the event that a reverse repo counterparty defaults, the value of the sovereign securities we hold as collateral might not be sufficient to cover our losses. Our clearing houses may also make demand deposits with commercial banks which could be lost in the event one of these banks becomes insolvent.\nOwning and operating cash equity and options exchanges exposes us to risks, including the regulatory responsibilities to which these businesses are subject.\nOwning and operating cash equity and options exchanges for which the revenues are primarily derived from trading activity, market data and listing fees, exposes us to risks. Adverse economic conditions and legal and regulatory changes \n24\nsimilar to those discussed elsewhere in this section could result in decreased trading volume on our exchanges, discourage or prohibit market participants from listing on our exchanges or cause them to forgo new offerings. Any of these could reduce our revenues, including market data and listing fee revenue.\nOur cash equity and options exchanges also have certain regulatory responsibilities that must be fulfilled. For example, these exchanges are responsible for enforcing listed company compliance with applicable listing standards, enforcing members' compliance with exchange rules and federal securities laws, complying with terms of NMS Plans, filing of all material changes to exchanges' rules with the SEC, and operating our exchanges consistent with exchange rules, federal securities laws and other applicable laws. Any failure by one of our exchanges to comply with, and enforce compliance by their members with, exchange rules and securities laws could significantly harm our reputation, prompt regulatory scrutiny, result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe must allocate significant resources to fulfill our regulatory and self-regulatory responsibilities. The business objectives of exchanges might conflict with the exchanges’ regulatory and self-regulatory responsibilities. In addition, the listing of our common stock on the NYSE could potentially create a conflict between the exchange’s regulatory responsibilities to vigorously oversee the listing and trading of securities, on the one hand, and our commercial and economic interest, on the other hand. While we have structural protections to minimize these potential conflicts, we cannot be sure that such measures will be successful.\nFurther, changes in the rules of our securities markets must be reviewed and approved by the SEC. Approval of such changes by the SEC cannot be guaranteed, and the SEC has in the past delayed and could in the future delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process. Any denial or delay in approving changes, or a failure to file changes that regulators view as required, could significantly harm our reputation, prompt regulatory scrutiny, result in the payment of fines or penalties and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The SEC continues to challenge fee filings on securities market data, which has in the past negatively impacted and could in the future negatively impact the value of proprietary data products.\nSee Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” above for additional information regarding regulatory changes impacting our cash equities and options exchanges, including risks to our business associated with possible regulation of services offered by non-exchange affiliates.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial results.\nSince we conduct operations globally, substantial portions of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate non-U.S. dollar denominated revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the other currencies could affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies.\nIn an attempt to combat inflation, countries and regions have used monetary policy, through increasing central bank interest rates, and such actions have caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in currency exchange rates.\nExternal events such as Brexit have caused, and may in the future cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially among the U.S. dollar, the British pound sterling and the euro. If global economic and market conditions, or economic conditions in the U.K., EU, the U.S. or other key markets deteriorate, the value of the pound sterling, euro or U.S. dollar may weaken. Further, financial instability in a particular country could have a contagion effect on the region in which it is located and contribute to general instability and uncertainty in that region. Events that adversely affect our clients and suppliers in a region could in turn have a materially adverse effect on our international business results and our operating results.\nFor additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk, refer to “- Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” in Item 7A “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\", which is included in this Annual Report.\nWe may have difficulty executing our growth strategy and maintaining our growth effectively.\nWe have achieved significant growth since becoming a public company in 2005. Our growth is highly dependent on customer demand for our core products and services, favorable economic conditions and our ability to invest in our personnel, facilities, infrastructure and financial and management systems and controls. Adverse economic conditions could reduce customer demand for our products and services, which may place a significant strain on our management and resources and could force us to defer existing or future planned opportunities. We regularly evaluate our existing operations, service capacity and business efficiencies and, as a result of such evaluations, we may undertake strategic \n25\ninitiatives outside of and within our businesses. We may not be successful in executing on our strategies to support our growth organically or through acquisitions, other investments or strategic alliances.\nWe may not be successful in offering new products or technologies or in identifying opportunities.\nWe from time to time launch, and intend in the future to launch, new products, services and business ventures and continue to explore and pursue other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company. We have spent and may continue to spend substantial time and money developing new product or service offerings or improving current product or service offerings. If these offerings are not successful, we may miss a potential market opportunity and not be able to recover the costs of such initiatives. Obtaining any required regulatory approval associated with these offerings may also result in delays or restrictions on our ability to benefit fully from these offerings. Further, we have entered into and may seek in the future to enter into or increase our presence in markets that already possess established competitors who may enjoy the protection of high barriers to entry, among other advantages.\nIn addition, in light of consolidation in the exchange, data services, clearing and mortgage technology sectors and competition for opportunities, we may be unable to identify strategic opportunities, or we may be unable to negotiate or finance any future acquisition successfully. Our competitors could merge, making it more difficult for us to find appropriate entities to acquire or merge with and making it more difficult to compete in our industry due to the increased resources of our merged competitors. Also, offering new products and services and pursuing acquisitions requires substantial time and attention of our management team, which could prevent them from successfully overseeing other initiatives that are necessary for our success.\nClimate change poses operational, commercial, reputational, regulatory and financial risks.\nClimate change may increase the frequency or severity of extreme weather events and other natural disasters, and such events could negatively impact our activities and results of operations and impact the activities of our customers or third-party vendors or suppliers. The physical commodities and assets underlying certain of our markets may also be impacted by climate change, which could impact users of our markets. The risks associated with climate change may evolve rapidly and we expect that climate change-related risks may increase over time.\nWe face reputational, regulatory and financial risks related to our ability to respond to diverse stakeholder expectations and requirements on sustainability-related topics, including in connection with a transition to clean and renewable energy.\nA variety of sustainability-related topics, including the transition to clean and renewable energy, involve rapidly changing and diverging expectations from our stakeholders, including consumers and institutional investors. Our ability to satisfy the preferences of our stakeholders around these topics (including on energy production and consumption) and the possible failure of our products or services to support the needs and meet the expectations of such stakeholders could adversely impact our business and revenues. Changing market demands and preferences could also have an adverse impact on the operations or financial condition of our customers, which could result in reduced revenues from those customers.\nIn addition, the uncertainty related to the transition to clean and renewable energy and away from fossil fuels, including regulatory or legislative changes by the U.S. government with regard to energy policy and related subsidies, incentives or penalties, may negatively impact trading on our markets and have an adverse effect on the activities of our customers or third-party vendors, which could negatively impact our revenues. Furthermore, lawmakers in many jurisdictions have proposed or adopted laws, regulations or policies on sustainability-related topics, including climate change and diversity, equity and inclusion, that diverge from, or potentially conflict with, laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate. In May 2024, the EU adopted the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which will become effective in 2027 and introduce comprehensive due diligence requirements regarding adverse impacts on human rights and the environment in a company’s and its business partners’ operations as well as the requirement to put into effect a climate transition plan. We are subject to risks related to this and other such laws, regulations or policies, which could impact us and our customers and result in increased regulatory, compliance, reputational or operational challenges and costs.\nWe have in the past been, and may in the future be, required to recognize impairments of our goodwill, other intangible assets or investments.\nThe determination of the value of goodwill and other intangible assets requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2024, we had goodwill of $30.6 billion and net other intangible assets of $16.3 billion relating to our acquisitions, including our acquisition of Black Knight in September 2023, and our purchase of trademarks and Internet domain names from various third parties.\n26\nDuring 2024 and 2023, we recorded an impairment on certain developed technology trademark definite-lived intangible assets, respectively, and during 2022, we recorded an impairment of our equity investment in Bakkt. We cannot assure you that we will not experience future events that may result in these types of impairments. An impairment of the value of our existing goodwill, other intangible assets and other investments and assets could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results.\nFor additional information on our goodwill, other intangible assets and investments, refer to Notes 3, 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements and “- Critical Accounting Policies - Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets” in Item 7 “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” which are included in this Annual Report.\nOur majority investment in Bakkt may introduce additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model.\nWe have a majority equity ownership interest and a minority voting interest in Bakkt, which operates as a separate publicly-traded company listed on the NYSE. Due to our majority equity ownership interest in Bakkt, we face increased financial and reputational risks if there is a security or system failure or if Bakkt's business is unsuccessful. We may not realize the returns originally expected from this investment or it may take longer than expected for us to realize the expected returns. We have reviewed certain Bakkt performance indicators noting that, starting as of September 30, 2023, Bakkt has disclosed that it is monitoring its ability to continue as a going concern. Bakkt has continued to disclose that it is monitoring its ability to continue as a going concern in its 2024 SEC filings to date. The carrying value of our equity method investment in Bakkt has been reduced to zero as of December 31, 2024.\nOn August 12, 2024, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with Bakkt pursuant to which we have agreed to provide Bakkt with a $40 million secured revolving line of credit that matures on December 31, 2026. Although there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement as of December 21, 2024, if Bakkt borrows on the line of credit and is unable to repay the borrowed amount, we will likely not recover the outstanding amounts.\nWe do not control or have direct oversight of Bakkt's operations and our investment in Bakkt entails numerous risks, including risks relating to our minority voting interest in Bakkt and risks relating to Bakkt’s ability to:\n•    manage the complexity of its business model to stay current with the industry;\n•    comply with existing or new laws, regulations or orders of any governmental authority related to the use of digital assets, which are currently under additional regulatory scrutiny following recent negative events in the cryptocurrency industry;\n•    obtain and maintain required licenses and regulatory approvals for its business;\n•    successfully enter categories and markets in which it may have limited or no prior experience;\n•    apply distributed ledger technology to a global ecosystem for digital assets;\n•    successfully develop and integrate products, systems or personnel into its business operations;\n•    maintain a risk management and compliance framework designed to detect illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, tax evasion and ransomware scams and comply with anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing laws and regulations and anti-corruption laws globally; and\n•    maintain technology systems and processes that prevent cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities.\nAs digital assets and blockchain technologies evolve, Bakkt has added, modified or discontinued certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings and may do so in the future. Future additions and modifications to Bakkt’s business will increase the complexity of its business and place significant strain on Bakkt’s management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources and internal financial control and reporting functions. We cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to Bakkt’s business. In addition, volatility in digital asset markets and bankruptcies relating to digital asset companies has in the past reduced and could in the future, among other things, reduce confidence in digital assets and blockchain technologies. These events are continuing to develop, and it is not possible to predict at this time all of the risks that they may pose to Bakkt or on the digital asset industry as a whole.\nPandemics and other public health emergencies could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic created economic and financial disruptions globally and led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease. From an operational perspective, the \n27\nspread of COVID-19 resulted, and the emergence of a new pandemic or other health emergency could in the future result, in temporary closures of our office facilities and the office facilities of our customers and our third-party vendors. We cannot assure you that such measures will adequately protect our business, and such measures could introduce new operational risks, including, but not limited to, cybersecurity risk, and strain our technological resources and business continuity plans. If one or more of the third-party vendors to whom we outsource certain material activities claim that they cannot perform due to a force majeure or experience operational failures as a result of a pandemic or other public health emergency, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. A pandemic or other public health emergency could also impact, among other things, the availability of our executive officers, staff and primary facilities, and the viability of our customers.\nCOVID-19 has in the past resulted, and another pandemic or public health emergency could in the future result, in disruptions to global supply chains, which could negatively affect the flow or availability of certain hardware and related products for technology that we need to operate our business effectively and efficiently. Our inability to acquire suitable hardware and related products on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negatively affect our business. Pandemic and public health-related restrictions could also impact third-party providers' abilities to meet their contractual obligations to us and impact on our customers’ businesses, risk management needs and ability to trade, and, to the extent they do so, adversely affect our operations, business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY\nOur businesses and those of many of our clients have been and continue to be subject to extensive legislation and regulatory scrutiny, and we face the risk of changes to our regulatory environment and business in the future.\nWe are and will continue to be subject to extensive regulation in many jurisdictions around the world, and in particular in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU. We face the risk of significant actions by regulatory and taxing authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct our businesses and hold investments, which may affect our business, the activity of our market participants, and our results. Among other things, as a result of regulators and tax authorities enforcing existing laws and regulations, we have in the past been and could in the future be censured, fined, prohibited from pursuing certain acquisitions or engaging in some of our business activities, subjected to limitations or conditions on our business activities, including fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory pricing restrictions, also known as FRAND, and prohibiting the inclusion of, or reliance on, “unfair” terms in certain customer contracts, or subjected to new or substantially higher taxes or other governmental charges in connection with the conduct of our business or with respect to our employees, including settlement payments, interest payments and penalty payments. In many cases, our activities are subject to overlapping and divergent regulation in different jurisdictions.\nThe adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in regulations or enforcement practices applicable to our businesses or those of our clients could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively with other institutions that are not affected in the same way or impact our clients’ overall trading volume through our exchanges and clearing houses and demand for our market data and connectivity offerings, mortgage technology and other services.\nEU policymakers continue to adopt and propose changes to regulatory intervention related to energy markets, including pricing-limiting mechanisms on exchange-traded gas products and strengthening the EU’s market abuse framework for wholesale energy markets. Trading volumes on ICE Endex, the primary European exchange for the benchmark European gas contract, and ICE Clear Europe, which clears ICE Endex contracts, could be impacted. Additionally, in December 2022, a coalition of various nations set the price of Russian crude oil at or below $60 a barrel, which remains in place and impacts our businesses and those of our clients. There may be additional regulatory changes forthcoming and additional impacts to our business.\nWe are also subject to regulatory risks relating to the mortgage industry, which is heavily regulated in the U.S. Following the acquisition of Black Knight, we are subject to enhanced oversight from the FFIEC and CFPB related to the inclusion of Black Knight's services and product offerings in our portfolio. Changes to existing laws or regulations or adoption of new laws or regulations that affect the residential mortgage industry could reduce residential mortgage volume or otherwise limit the ability of users and participants of our mortgage technology services to operate their businesses, resulting in decreased usage of our solutions. Alternatively, reduced regulatory requirements could also reduce the demand for certain of our products and services, which are intended to enable our customers to satisfy existing regulatory requirements. Potential structural changes to federal agencies integral to the U.S. residential mortgage industry, in particular, those involving the roles of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, in addition to the regulatory roles of the CFPB and other banking regulators, could disrupt the residential mortgage market and have a material adverse effect on our business. Further, as a critical third-party service provider in the mortgage industry, we are subject to supervision and examination by certain regulators, which has resulted, and will continue to result, in additional operating costs.\n28\nThere is ongoing public concern regarding data privacy and data protection in many jurisdictions in which ICE operates. Many of those jurisdictions have passed data privacy legislation, with many more contemplating new laws. The laws and regulations related to privacy and data protection are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which has resulted in greater compliance risk and cost for us. Privacy and data protection regulations often require monitoring of, and changes to, our data practices in regard to the collection, use, disclosure, storage, transfer and/or security of personal and sensitive information. Regulatory activity in the privacy area may also hinder our business, for example, by restricting use or sharing of data, including for marketing or advertising or limiting the use of, limiting our ability to provide certain data to our customers, or otherwise regulating artificial intelligence and machine learning, including the use of algorithms and automated processing in ways that could materially affect our business, or that may lead to significant increases in the cost of compliance. The expansion of our business in the U.S. residential mortgage market increases the impact of data privacy legislation on our business. These developments could impact our profitability in the affected jurisdictions, or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions, or could cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices, restructuring our businesses or moving all or certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions, including liquidating assets or raising capital in a manner that adversely increases our funding costs or otherwise adversely affects our stockholders and creditors.\nU.S., U.K. and EU legal and regulatory developments, in particular EMIR, EMIR 3.0, U.K. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, or U.K. MiFID II, and EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, or EU MiFID II, the U.K BMR and the EU Benchmarks Regulation, or EU BMR, including each such regulation as incorporated into U.K. law, have significantly altered and propose to further alter the regulatory framework within which we operate and may adversely affect our competitive position and profitability. These regulatory developments could also cause us to change our business practices, restructure our businesses or move certain of our businesses and employees. The enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes, if implemented, most likely to affect our businesses are: operational account and clearing requirements for EU market participants in EMIR 3.0, the proposal by U.S. banking regulators to increase bank capital requirements under the Basel III Endgame impacting banking services and activities, including client clearing, lending and capital markets activities and the Federal Reserve proposed revisions to the surcharge on global systemically-important bank holding companies, access rules under the U.K. BMR and EU BMR, the non-harmonization of margin requirements, access to our benchmarks, U.K. CCP resolution enhancements and maintaining our exchanges’ abilities to operate as SROs with related immunity for the discharge of their regulatory functions. As the operator of global businesses, the divergence among countries' regulatory frameworks, including differences between the EU and the U.K. post-Brexit, could impact our business as our clearing houses and exchanges are subject to regulation in multiple jurisdictions.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act established enhanced regulatory requirements for non-bank financial institutions designated as “systemically important” by the FSOC. ICE Clear Credit has been designated as a systemically important financial market utility by the FSOC and, as a result, is subject to additional oversight by the CFTC. Compliance with these requirements has resulted in, and will continue to result in, additional operating costs.\nIn 2016, the SEC approved a plan to establish a market-wide consolidated audit trail, or the CAT, to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity. In 2018, the first phase of implementation went live and required SRO participants to begin reporting to the CAT. In 2024, the final phase went live. In addition to increased risk in connection with our regulatory obligations, the implementation of the CAT could result in significant additional expenditures, which may not be reimbursed. Prior to SEC approval of billing of certain costs to broker-dealers beginning in 2024, funding for the CAT was provided primarily by the SROs, partly in exchange for promissory notes, which increased the risk that SROs, including us, will not be fully reimbursed for costs expended to build and operate the CAT. Due to the replacement of the original plan processor, we recorded promissory note impairment charges of $16 million, $2 million and $16 million in 2023, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The SEC approved a funding model that shares the cost of the CAT between SROs and broker-dealers in September 2023, however, that approval has been challenged in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, and another open litigation matter challenges the CAT as it currently exists. If either challenge is successful, there is a risk that SROs will not be partially or fully reimbursed. As of December 31, 2024, we have accrued approximately $118 million as a receivable in connection with our portion of expenses related to the CAT implementation. In addition, there are additional risks to SRO participants related to regulatory actions or fines in connection with the operation and use of the CAT, including the storage of sensitive and confidential information.\nThere is an increased focus on, and scrutiny of, ESG data and ratings providers by regulators and policymakers. Certain regulators and policymakers have indicated that extension of their regulatory oversight to ESG data service providers is possible. The EU adopted a regulation on the transparency and integrity of ESG rating activities, which aims to enhance the integrity, transparency, governance and independence of ESG ratings. The U.K. government has also published draft legislation proposing to regulate ESG data providers. If adopted, certain of our offerings could be subject to increased regulation and oversight by the FCA. In each instance, our ESG data products and services may be subject to additional \n29\nregulation and may require authorization and supervision by the relevant regulator, which could result in additional operating costs.\nLegislative proposals in the EU and elsewhere are contemplating new or expanded requirements for data service providers such as conflict of interest and transparency rules, regulation of prices and fees and imposition of market access rules for third-country providers. These requirements may increase our regulatory burden and impact our ability to provide certain data related services in relevant jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to tax laws, regulations, rulings and audits in multiple U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions that could have a significant impact on our business and lead to additional expenditures for us or our customers. For example, there have been discussions in various jurisdictions around financial transaction or digital service tax frameworks as well as global minimum corporate income tax rates. Changes to tax frameworks in jurisdictions where we operate significant business, for example, the U.S., the U.K. and the EU have the potential to increase costs to us or to our market participants and discourage participation in the markets we operate. Furthermore, implementation of any new or amended tax laws or regulations could impact our global operations, trading volumes or financial results.\nOther enacted and proposed legal and regulatory changes not discussed above may also adversely affect our competitive position and profitability. See Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” above for additional information regarding the current and proposed laws and regulations that impact our business, including risks to our business associated with these laws and regulations.\nOur compliance and risk management methods, as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations, may not be effective, which could lead to enforcement actions by our regulators or other legal proceedings.\nOur ability to comply with existing and future rules, regulations and laws largely depends on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. Regulators periodically review our ability to self-regulate and our compliance with a variety of laws and regulations including self-regulatory standards. Certain of our businesses associated with the NYSE are subject to public notice procedures prior to making changes in operations, policies and procedures. If we fail to comply with any of these obligations, regulators could take a variety of actions that could impair our ability to conduct our business.\nOur acquisitions expose us to new regulatory requirements. For example, our acquisitions of Ellie Mae, Inc., or Ellie Mae, in 2020 and Black Knight in 2023 expose us to increased regulatory scrutiny from U.S. regulatory bodies that regulate the U.S. residential mortgage industry, including the FFIEC and its member agencies, and the CFPB, among others. Compliance with any such regulatory requirements increases our regulatory burden and gives rise to costs and expenses that may be material.\nOur regulators have broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, embargo future business activity or prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses. We continue to face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance of our business. Any enforcement matters by regulators may result in material adverse consequences to our financial condition, operating results or ability to conduct our business, including adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, restrictions on our business activities or other relief. Our involvement in any such matters, even if the matters are ultimately determined to be in our favor, could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business. Further, any settlement, consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or regulatory agencies may result in additional litigation, investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or regulatory agencies begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities. Finally, the implementation of new legislation or regulations, or changes in or unfavorable interpretations of existing regulations by courts or regulatory bodies, could require us to incur significant compliance costs and impede our ability to remain competitive and grow our business.\nRegulatory developments or court rulings may have an adverse impact on our ability to derive revenue from market and mortgage data and technology and connectivity fees.\nRegulatory developments or court rulings could reduce the amount of revenue that we obtain from exchange market data and connectivity fees related to our U.S. equity and options exchanges, and from mortgage data related to our mortgage technology businesses. With respect to our U.S. equities and equity options exchanges, our ability to assess fees for market data products and certain connectivity fees are subject to review by the SEC. There continue to be opposing industry viewpoints as to the extent that our U.S. equities and equity options exchanges should be able to charge for market data and market access, and the manner in which we set such exchange fees could be reassessed.\n30\nIf new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data, mortgage data or market access in the U.S., it could have a negative impact on our revenues. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any regulatory or other changes will take effect or their impact on our business. A determination by the SEC or a court, for example, that the SEC must link market data fees to marginal costs, take a more active role in the market data rate-setting process, or reduce the current levels of market data fees, could have an adverse effect on our market data revenues. Furthermore, there could also be an adverse effect on our mortgage data revenues if our use of such data were restricted through regulation.\nSeparately, our European exchanges are currently authorized to sell trade information on a non-discriminatory basis at a reasonable cost. This regulatory position could be modified or interpreted by the European Commission or future European court decisions in a manner that could have an adverse effect on our European market data revenues.\nIn addition, the FCA and IOSCO have both issued consultations to explore access to market data in financial markets. The results of these consultations may lead to a regulatory response that could affect our business. Similar to the U.S., if new constraints are placed on our ability to charge for market data or market access in the U.K. or other jurisdictions, it could have a negative impact on our revenues.\nOngoing impacts and uncertainty following the U.K.'s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe long-term effects of Brexit will depend, in part, on the agreement the U.K. made to retain access to EU markets, and whether the EU and U.K. continue to implement regulatory proposals related to the provision of financial services and the administration of benchmarks and indices in the EU and U.K. Following Brexit, matters of access in financial services are left to be addressed through declarations of equivalence under existing equivalence regimes contained in U.K. and EU law and through domestic laws. In February 2022, the European Commission extended its temporary equivalence decision for U.K. CCPs until June 30, 2025. ICE Clear Europe has been recognized by ESMA as a third-country CCP in accordance with EMIR and in March 2022, ESMA extended ICE Clear Europe's temporary recognition and tiering decision to June 2025. In January 2025, the European Union proposed to extend the equivalence decision for UK CCPs until June 30, 2028. In the absence of an extension of the temporary equivalence or permanent equivalence of U.K. CCPs by the European Commission, EU persons would be restricted in accessing clearing services at ICE Clear Europe, which could impact clearing revenues, and could also cause us to change our business practices, restructure our businesses or move certain of our businesses and employees.\nIn June 2023, the FSMA 2023 was enacted, which makes significant changes to U.K. financial services regulation and incorporates considerations of the HM Treasury's March 2022 Wholesale Markets Review. The FSMA 2023 expands the U.K.’s existing resolution regime for CCPs and enables the BOE to take full control of a CCP when necessary without relying on its existing powers, and permits the BOE to use a number of tools without reliance on the CCP’s rulebook.\nAs a result of the U.K. and EU trade and cooperation agreement not providing free trade arrangements for financial services, any equivalence determinations or any further transition period for financial services could include restrictions on access to our services by persons located in the EU or make access more expensive, which could adversely affect our operations and profitability or even make it uneconomical for us to continue to conduct all or certain of our businesses in such jurisdictions. The consequences of Brexit and the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement could also cause us to incur significant costs associated with changing our business practices, restructuring our businesses or moving certain of our businesses and our employees to other jurisdictions. See Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” above for additional information regarding Brexit, including risks to our business associated with Brexit.\nRisks relating to the administration of benchmarks and indices, and changes to, cessations of and the replacement of, or transition from, benchmarks and indices may result in legal risks and could adversely affect our business.\nCertain of our subsidiaries administer, produce and license a variety of benchmarks and indices across multiple asset classes, which are used globally and are referenced in certain of our trading and clearing products. To ensure continued trading and clearing in these benchmark-related products, and the continued licensing and use of these benchmarks and indices, our subsidiaries must be able to demonstrate that these benchmarks and indices are determined with integrity and are not readily subject to manipulation. Our subsidiaries must also continue to evolve these benchmarks and indices as necessary to maintain their reliability and relevance, and continue to administer, produce and license these benchmarks and indices in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any failures, negative publicity or lawsuits related to our subsidiaries' administration of benchmarks and indices could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation.\nChanges to, cessations of, and the replacement of or transition from, our subsidiaries' benchmarks and indices or any other changes or reforms to the determination or administration of such benchmarks and indices, could result in legal risks \n31\nor risks to our reputation, and could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Our subsidiary, IBA, administers various globally important benchmarks, including ICE Swap Rate. IBA was the administrator of LIBOR until the cessation of the benchmark at the end of September 2024. As a “critical” benchmark, LIBOR was subject to a wind-down prior to its ultimate cessation, which included a period during which IBA was compelled by the FCA to continue to publish certain LIBOR settings under a changed \"synthetic\" methodology. Any LIBOR settings published under a “synthetic” methodology were not representative of the underlying market or economic reality such settings were intended to measure prior to the period of compulsion.\nOn November 13, 2024, ICE Swap Rate was designated as a “critical” benchmark, and, as a result, administration of the benchmark is subject to additional obligations under the UK Benchmark Regulation. These include the ability of the FCA to compel continued administration of ICE Swap Rate for up to 10 years if the administrator intends to cease providing the benchmark, to impose changes in the way the benchmark is determined if the FCA believes the benchmark is unrepresentative or its representativeness is at risk and to apply prohibitions and restrictions on the use of the benchmark in certain circumstances.\nAny failures, negative publicity or lawsuits related to IBA’s administration of LIBOR, including during the period of “synthetic” LIBOR, or ICE Swap Rate, could result in a loss of confidence in our subsidiaries’ administration of benchmarks and indices and could harm our business and our reputation.\nBenchmarks administered by our subsidiaries outside of the EU may continue to be used by supervised entities in the EU under transitional provisions of the EU Benchmarks Regulation until December 31, 2025, after which time those subsidiaries, as administrators of \"third-country\" benchmarks, will need to utilize one of the mechanisms provided under that regulation in order for EU-supervised entities to continue to use their third-country benchmarks. To the extent our subsidiaries are unable to utilize one of those mechanisms for any reason once transitional provisions end, there is a risk that EU-supervised entities will not be able to continue to license and use their benchmarks, which could harm our business and our reputation.\nIn addition, certain authorities, including those in the U.S., the U.K. and the EU, have issued consultations to gather feedback on index provider businesses or are undertaking reviews of current regulations. The results of these consultations or reviews may lead to a regulatory response that could affect our business. Additional regulation on index providers in the U.S., U.K., EU or other jurisdictions, could have a negative impact on our revenues.\nWe may face liability for content contained in our data products and services.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to claims for breach of contract, defamation, libel, copyright or trademark infringement, fraud or negligence or based on other theories of liability, in each case relating to the data, articles, commentary, ratings, information or other content we distribute in our financial data services. If such data or other content or information that we distribute has errors, is delayed or has design defects, we could be subject to liability or our reputation could suffer. We could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our corporate website or those websites that we own and operate through links to other websites. Use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for significant amounts. Any such claim, even if the outcome were ultimately favorable to us, could involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources. Such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results and a negative impact on our reputation.\nIn addition, we license and redistribute data and content from various third-party sources and the terms of these licenses change frequently. Our third-party data and content suppliers may audit our use of and our clients’ use of and payment for data and content from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including audits currently underway. Such third-party data and content suppliers have asserted and may in the future assert that we or our clients owe additional amounts under the terms of the applicable license agreements, that we inappropriately distributed the third-party data or that we or our clients used the data or content in a manner that exceeded the scope of the applicable license agreement or without a license agreement. In some instances, where we have certain commercial relationships with third parties, we have assumed the responsibility for this third-party source liability. We have and expect to continue to spend and allocate resources to develop and acquire the use of technology and other intellectual property rights to manage these risks and track third-party data usage, but we cannot be assured that we will not incur liability. The costs and resources required to investigate any allegations could be material, and we may still be required to pay damages to or make unexpected large settlement payments to these data and content suppliers, which could also give rise to reputational harm.\n32\nWe are subject to significant litigation and liability risks, including enforcement actions by our regulators.\nMany aspects of our business, and the businesses of our market participants and data and mortgage technology customers, involve substantial risks of liability. These risks include, among others, potential liability from disputes over terms of a trade and the claim that a system failure or delay caused monetary loss to a participant or that an unauthorized trade occurred. For example, dissatisfied market participants that have traded on our electronic platforms or those on whose behalf such participants have traded may make claims regarding the quality of trade execution, or allege improperly confirmed or settled trades, abusive trading practices, security and confidentiality breaches, mismanagement or even fraud against us or our participants. In addition, because of the ease and speed with which sizable trades can be executed on our electronic platform, participants can lose substantial amounts by inadvertently entering trade orders or by entering them inaccurately. A large number of significant error trades could result in participant dissatisfaction and a decline in participant willingness to trade in our electronic markets. Matters relating to such trading events can also result in reviews, inspections, examinations and investigations by our regulators, any of which may result in claims, legal proceedings, assessments, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business or other sanctions\n.\nIn addition, we are subject to legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines, penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future. See Item 3 \"Legal Proceedings\" in this Annual Report for a general description of our legal proceedings and claims and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for a summary of specific legal proceedings. The outcome of any of these legal proceedings that remain unresolved cannot be determined and adverse rulings in these matters could impact our financial condition and continued operations.\nFurther, we have incurred significant expenses defending the claims mentioned above and will likely incur significant expenses defending any future claims, even those without merit. An adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us, including those we are involved with due to acquisition activity, has in the past required, and may in the future require, us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, from time to time we are required to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change.\nOPERATIONAL AND LIQUIDITY\nOur systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to cyberattacks, hacking and other cybersecurity risks, which could result in wrongful manipulation, disclosure, destruction, or use of our information or that of a third party, or which could make our customers unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms or other products and services.\nThe secure transmission of confidential information and the ability to reliably transact on our electronic platforms and provide financial data services are critical elements of our operations. Some of our products and services involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential client and other data, including client portfolio information or personally identifiable information. If anyone gains improper access to our electronic platforms, networks or databases, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify our confidential information or that of a third party. Breaches of our cybersecurity measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our clients or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation, regulatory action and potential liability for us, damaging our brand and reputation or otherwise harming our business. Our networks and those of our customers, third-party service providers and external market infrastructures may be vulnerable to compromise, unauthorized access, security technology failure, malware, social engineering, denial of service attacks, terrorism, ransomware attacks, supply chain attacks, firewall or encryption failures or other security problems resulting in loss of data integrity, information disclosure, unavailability or fraud. The financial services industry has been targeted for purposes of political protest, activism and financial gain and our role in the global marketplace places us at greater risk than other public companies for cyberattack and other information security threats. Further, former employees of companies in the financial sector have misappropriated trade secrets or stolen source code in the past and we could be a target for such illegal acts in the future. There also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded systems are defective or not tested and installed properly.\nAlthough we have not been subject to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents that have had a material impact on our operations or financial condition, we have from time to time experienced cybersecurity events including distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attacks, malware infections, phishing, web attacks, zero day and/or emerging vulnerabilities with known exploits and other information technology incidents that are typical for a financial services company of our size. For example, although not material, we experienced DDoS attempts, brand misuse, and phishing attempts directed toward \n33\nemployee systems and employee email accounts during 2024. While we operate an Information Security program that is designed to prevent, detect, track and mitigate cyber incidents and that has detected and mitigated such incidents in the past, we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to protect our business against future attacks. Any such attacks could result in reputational damage, cause system failures or delays that could cause us to lose customers, cause us to experience lower current and future trading volumes or incur significant liabilities or have a negative impact on our competitive position. In addition, given the increasing complexity and sophistication of the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or disable or degrade systems, a cyberattack could occur and persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and we may not anticipate these acts or respond adequately or timely. The extent of a particular cyber incident and the steps that we may need to take to investigate the incident may not be immediately clear, and it may take a significant amount of time before such investigation can be completed and full and reliable information about the incident is known. While such an investigation is ongoing, we may not necessarily know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate it, which may compound damages before the incident is discovered or remediated. Additionally, as threats continue to evolve and increase, and as the regulatory environment and regulations related to information security, disclosure of cyberattacks, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify, remediate and disclose any security vulnerabilities, which could adversely impact our net income.\nFurther, cybersecurity threats to, and incidents involving, vendors and other third parties who support our activities - particularly those with less-sophisticated defenses - could impact us.\nOur business has in the past been, and may in the future be, harmed by computer and communication systems failures and delays.\nOur business depends on the integrity, reliability and security of our infrastructure which is highly dependent on our and our third-party providers’ computer and communication systems. Our customers rely on us for the delivery of time-sensitive, up-to-date and high-quality financial market data, analytics and related solutions. Our timely, reliable delivery of high-quality products and services is dependent upon an array of technical production processes that enable our content delivery platforms. Our and our third-party providers’ redundant systems or disaster recovery plans, including our and our third-party providers’ ability to recover from the loss of one of our primary data centers, may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cybersecurity breach. Our systems, or those of our third-party providers, may fail or be shut down or, due to capacity constraints, may operate slowly, causing one or more of the following or other issues:\n•    unanticipated disruption in service to our participants;\n•    slower response time and delays in our participants’ trade execution and processing;\n•    failed settlement by participants to whom we provide trade confirmation or clearing services; \n•    incomplete or inaccurate accounting, recording or processing of trades;\n•    failure to complete the clearing house margin settlement process resulting in significant financial risk;\n•    distribution of inaccurate or untimely market data;\n•    disruption to ICE Mortgage Technology and our loan origination and servicing systems; and \n•    financial loss to us or those who depend on our systems and data.\nFor example, our business was impacted by the CrowdStrike outage in July 2024, and although impact to us from the outage was limited in scope and not material, we cannot make assurances that we will not experience future events that may be material.\nWe have experienced system failures in the past due to telecommunication failures and hardware and software malfunctions and defects, and could experience future system failures due to power or telecommunications failures, human error on our part or on the part of our vendors or participants, natural disasters, fire, sabotage, hardware or software malfunctions or defects, computer viruses, cyberattacks, intentional acts of vandalism or terrorism and similar events. For example, on June 3, 2024, a defect in a new software release by NYSE subsidiary Securities Industry Automation Corporation, or SIAC, caused incorrect calculation of industry-wide trade price bands in certain securities symbols, leading to trades occurring at incorrect prices that were required to be reversed, the triggering of trading pauses based on the incorrect trade price bands, and member claims paid by the NYSE exchanges under their rules (in combination with SIAC) related to the same. NYSE and/or SIAC may also potentially be subject to additional claims from the SEC or other third parties as a result of this event. This event, and other system issues in the future, could result in damage to our business reputation and user dissatisfaction with our electronic platforms or technology services, which could prompt participants to trade elsewhere, use other technology vendors, and/or expose us to litigation or regulatory sanctions. As a consequence, our business, financial condition and operating results could suffer materially.\n34\nOur regulated business operations generally require that our trade execution and communications systems be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading volume. Heavy use of computer systems during peak trading times or at times of unusual market volatility could exceed our available capacity based on estimated future trading volumes and cause those systems to operate slowly or even to fail for periods of time. If we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses could be adversely affected.\nAn interruption or cessation of an important service, data or content supplied by any third party, or the loss of an exclusive license, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe depend on a number of suppliers, such as online service providers, hosting service and software providers, data processors, data centers, software and hardware vendors, banks, local and regional utility providers, and telecommunications companies for elements of our trading, clearing, data services, mortgage technology applications and other systems. We rely on access to certain data used in our business through licenses with third parties, and we rely on a large international telecommunications company for the provision of hosting services. We also depend on third-party suppliers for data and content, including data received from certain competitors, clients, various government and public record services and financial institutions, used in our products and services. Some of this data is exclusive to particular suppliers and may not be obtained from other suppliers. In addition, our data suppliers could enter into exclusive contracts with our competitors without our knowledge. The general trend toward industry consolidation increases the risk that these services may not be available to us in the future. If these companies were to experience difficulties, discontinue providing services to us for any reason or be unable to or fail to provide the type of service agreed to for any reason, we would likely experience significant disruption to our business and may be subject to litigation by our clients, increased regulatory scrutiny or regulatory fines or damage to our reputation. It could require a significant amount of time and additional resources to transition to new third-party service providers or to enter into new commercial arrangements in order to offset loss of services to our clients. Our third-party data suppliers perform audits on us from time to time in the ordinary course of business to determine if data we license for use in our products and services or for redistribution has been properly accounted for in accordance with the terms of the applicable license agreement. As a result of these audits, we have incurred and may in the future incur additional expenses.\nMany of our clients also rely on third parties to provide them with systems necessary to access our trading platform. If these companies were to discontinue providing services to our clients for any reason, we may experience a loss of revenue associated with our clients’ inability to transact with our businesses. We hold exclusive licenses to list various index futures and options contracts. In the future, litigation or regulatory action may limit the right of owners to grant exclusive licenses for index futures and options contracts trading to a single exchange, and our competitors may succeed in providing economically similar products in a manner or jurisdiction not otherwise covered by our exclusive license. MiFID II introduced a harmonized approach to the licensing of benchmarks in Europe and the legislation requires non-discriminatory access to any benchmarks registered in Europe. If unlicensed trading of any index product where we hold an exclusive license were permitted, we could lose trading volume for these products which would adversely affect our revenues associated with the license and the related index products.\nOur emerging technology initiatives under development and the use of artificial intelligence in certain of our existing products may be unsuccessful and may give rise to various risks, which could adversely affect our business, reputation or operating results.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to develop and market new and innovative services and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate our products or provide cost efficiencies, while avoiding increased related expenses. Our adoption of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence and machine learning tools, poses both risk of displacement and opportunity for innovation. As artificial intelligence is a new and evolving technology in the early stages of commercial use, there are significant risks involved in the development and deployment of artificial intelligence. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the use of artificial intelligence will enhance our products or services or augment our business or operating results. Market acceptance of artificial intelligence technologies is uncertain, and we may be unsuccessful in our product development efforts. Our artificial intelligence-related product initiatives and offerings, or use in our internal business operations, may give rise to risks related to accuracy, bias, discrimination, intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or leakage, defamation, data privacy and cybersecurity, among others. We are also exposed to risks related to the use of artificial intelligence technologies by third-party vendors, clients and other financial intermediaries. In addition, the use of such technologies is governed by an evolving set of laws and regulations, and there is no single global regulatory framework for artificial intelligence, which creates further uncertainties regarding compliance with such laws and regulations. As a result, our ability to leverage artificial intelligence could be restricted by burdensome and costly legal requirements. The use of artificial intelligence may also give rise to ethical concerns or negative public perceptions, which may cause brand or reputational harm. Additionally, our existing competitors or new entrants may be developing their own artificial intelligence products and technologies, which may be superior in features \n35\nor functionality, or cost, to our offerings, or could negatively impact our business by causing our clients to rely less on our products and services. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, reputation or operating results.\nOur success largely depends on key personnel, including our senior management, and having adequate succession plans in place. We may not be able to attract, retain and develop the highly skilled employees we need to support our business, which could harm our business.\nOur future performance depends, in large part, on the continued services of our senior management and other key personnel, including our ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel. Competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel, in particular senior management, will be dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. Current economic, market, social, and political conditions and demand for hybrid working options have increased talent risk, which has led to higher employee attrition and made recruitment for certain positions more difficult, and could lead to a loss of top performers and make it more difficult to fill key positions. For example, our in-office requirements, as well as the location of our offices, and our remote working arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees, including senior management or other key employees, or may not be viewed as competitive, which could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. In addition, we operate globally and geopolitical events or conflicts in the countries or regions in which we operate could lead to physical risks to our personnel and disruption to business continuity that could negatively impact our ability to execute our business strategy. There is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives. The loss of the services of any of our senior management or other key personnel, or our inability to attract highly qualified senior management and other key personnel, could harm our business. In particular, we have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave, and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner or at all.\nEffective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees and board members could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Further, changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully integrate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition and operations and restrict our activities or our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $20.4 billion of outstanding debt, inclusive of approximately $19.8 billion of senior notes and approximately $529 million of commercial paper. This level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including making it more difficult to satisfy our debt service obligations, increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our peers. In addition, the terms of our debt facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants, including a leverage ratio test and certain limitations on the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters. Further, a portion of our outstanding debt has historically been and may continue to be in commercial paper, which is subject to interest rate changes. Rising interest rates will result in an increase in our interest expense. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could materially affect our financial condition.\nOur long-term and short-term debt is currently rated by Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings. These ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and our credit ratings based on a number of quantitative and qualitative factors, including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry, generally. Our credit ratings remain subject to change at any time, and it is possible that a ratings agency may take action to downgrade our credit ratings in the future. A downgrade of our credit ratings in the future could impact customers’ willingness to use our clearing houses, make parties less willing to do business with us, and could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase the cost of our commercial paper and any future debt funding we may obtain.\nCOMPETITION AND REPUTATIONAL HARM\nWe face intense competition, and if we fail to keep up with rapid changes in technology and client preferences, it could negatively impact our competitive position.\nWe face intense competition in all aspects of our business and our competitors, both domestic and international, are numerous. We currently compete with:\n36\n•    regulated, diversified futures exchanges that offer trading in a variety of asset classes similar to those offered by us, such as energy, agriculture, equity and equity index, credit, and interest rate derivatives markets and foreign exchange;\n•    exchanges offering listing and trading of cash equities, ETFs, closed-end funds and other structured products similar to those offered by us;\n•    market and mortgage data and information vendors, and financial firm consortia and single financial institutions selling such data and information;\n•    providers of digital solutions for the U.S. residential mortgage industry, including technology providers for loan origination, closing solutions and other ancillary solutions, and loan servicing;\n•    interdealer brokers active in the global credit derivatives markets;\n•    existing and newly formed electronic trading platforms, service providers and exchanges, some of which may utilize block chain technology or do not receive the same regulatory scrutiny as established market places;\n•    other clearing houses; and\n•    consortia of our customers, members or market participants that may work together to achieve more favorable terms or pool their trading activity to establish new exchanges, trading platforms or clearing facilities.\nTrends towards the globalization of capital markets have resulted in greater mobility of capital, greater international participation in markets and increased competition among markets in different geographical areas. Competition in the market for derivatives trading and clearing and in the market for cash equity listings, trading and execution have intensified as a result of consolidation, as the markets become more global in connection with the increase in electronic trading platforms and the desire by existing exchanges to diversify their product offerings. Finally, many of our competitors are our largest customers or are owned by our customers and may prioritize their internalization and ATS businesses ahead of their exchange-based market making business. Some of our competitors may have greater capital and resources, offer a wide range of products and services or operate under less stringent regulatory regimes than we do.\nIn the mortgage technology sector, we compete against other technology providers for loan origination, closing solutions, and loan servicing, as well as the many ancillary products and services we offer to the U.S. residential mortgage industry. We also compete with traditional methods of exchanging data and documents among mortgage industry participants, such as email, facsimile, phone, courier, and mail. There is vigorous competition among providers of mortgage technology services, and we may be unsuccessful in differentiating our services to the extent necessary to effectively compete and may not succeed in convincing potential customers using other services or methods to switch to ours.\nWe also face pricing competition in many areas of our business. A decline in our fees due to competitive pressure or regulatory changes, the inability to successfully launch new products or the loss of customers due to competition could lower our revenues, which would adversely affect our profitability. For example, our data service offerings have benefited from a high renewal rate in its subscription-based services, but we cannot assure you that this will continue. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to expand our product offerings, modify the pricing for our products or retain our current customers or attract new customers. If we are not able to compete successfully, our business could be materially impacted, including our ability to remain as an operating entity.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our product offerings, our customer base and our technology. To remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, accessibility and reliability of our electronic platforms and our proprietary and acquired technology. The financial services industry is characterized by rapid technological change, change in use patterns, change in client preferences, frequent product and service introductions, the emergence of new industry standards and practices and increased consolidation through mergers and acquisitions activity that results in new competitors or expanded product offerings by current competitors. For example, financial institutions are investing significantly in new technologies involving artificial intelligence and machine learning to deliver solutions at lower prices, more efficiently or more conveniently. The development and use of these types of new technologies and other industry changes could render our existing proprietary technology or product offerings or services uncompetitive or obsolete.\nWe cannot assure you that we will successfully implement new technologies or adapt our proprietary technology, product offerings or services to our clients’ requirements or emerging industry standards in a timely and cost-effective manner. Any failure to remain abreast of industry standards in technology and to be responsive to client preferences could cause our market share to decline and negatively impact our results.\n37\nDamage to our reputation could damage our business.\nOur business is highly competitive and our customers have options on where to conduct their business. Our management team and business operations benefit from being highly regarded in our industry. Maintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and retaining customers and investors and for maintaining our relationships with our regulators. Negative publicity regarding our company, especially given the speed with which false information can spread through social media channels, or actual, alleged or perceived issues regarding our products or services, operations, risk management, compliance with regulations, political affiliations or management team could give rise to reputational risk which could significantly harm our existing business and business prospects.\nMERGERS & ACQUISITIONS AND COMMON STOCK\nWe may fail to realize the anticipated cost savings, growth opportunities and synergies and other benefits anticipated from our past or future acquisitions and strategic investments, which could adversely affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nWe have completed many acquisitions, and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures. The success of our acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate these businesses and realize anticipated cost savings, revenue synergies and growth opportunities. We generally set aggressive timelines for realizing savings, which assumes we successfully undertake a variety of actions (including, but not limited to, integrating technology, eliminating redundancies and effecting organizational restructurings) that are themselves subject to a variety of risks and may be subject to regulatory approvals that we do not control. The process of integrating acquired companies is time-consuming and could disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses, produce unforeseen regulatory and operating difficulties (including inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect relationships with market participants, regulators and others), require substantial resources and expenditures and divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of the business.\nThere is also a risk that we may not integrate these acquired companies in a manner that permits our expected cost savings and revenue synergies to be fully realized in the time periods expected, or at all. In addition, a variety of factors, including but not limited to regulatory conditions, governmental competition approvals, cultural differences and difficulty integrating technology platforms, may adversely affect our ability to complete our acquisitions or realize our anticipated cost savings and synergies. For example, our acquisition of Black Knight closed in September 2023, and we are continuing to integrate the business of Black Knight into the ICE Mortgage Technology business as we pursue expected cost savings and revenue synergies from the acquisition. In addition, following the completion of the acquisition of Black Knight, we continue to be subject to periodic reviews by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, under the Consent Order we entered into with the FTC, and we are required to certify that we are in compliance with the restrictions contained in the Consent Order. If we are not able to successfully achieve our objectives from the Black Knight merger within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, may take longer to realize than expected, and our business or stock price may be adversely affected.\nWe also may not realize anticipated growth opportunities and other benefits from strategic investments or strategic joint ventures or alliances that we have entered into or may enter into for a number of reasons, including decline in value of the other company, regulatory or government approvals or changes, global market changes, contractual obligations, competing products and, in some instances, our lack of or limited control over the management of the business. Further, strategic initiatives that have historically been successful may not continue to be successful due to competitive threats, changing market conditions or the inability for the parties to extend the relationship into the future.\nAs a result of any future acquisition, we may issue additional shares of our common stock that dilute our stockholders’ ownership interest, expend cash, incur debt, assume actual and contingent liabilities, inherit existing or pending litigation or create additional expenses related to amortizing intangible assets. Further, we cannot assure you that any such financing or equity investments will be available with terms that will be favorable to us, or available at all.\nWe are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends, distributions and other payments.\nWe are a legal entity separate and distinct from our operating subsidiaries. Our principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to our stockholders, principal and interest on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock, is dividends from our subsidiaries. There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by certain of our subsidiaries to us. If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our stockholders, principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt or repurchase shares of our common stock, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n38\nProvisions of our organizational documents and Delaware law may delay or deter a change of control of ICE.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that may have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of, or unsolicited acquisition proposals for, ICE. These provisions make a change of control less likely, which may be contrary to the desires of certain of our stockholders. Many of these provisions are required by relevant regulators in connection with our ownership and operation of U.S. and European equity exchanges. For example, our organizational documents include provisions that generally restrict any person (either alone or together with its related persons) from (i) voting or causing the voting of shares of stock representing more than 10% of our outstanding voting capital stock (including as a result of any agreement by any other persons not to vote shares of stock) or (ii) beneficially owning shares of stock representing more than 20% of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. Further, our organizational documents generally limit the ability of stockholders to act by written consent, and generally authorize our Board of Directors, without stockholder approval, to issue and fix the rights and preferences of one or more series of preferred stock. In addition, provisions of Delaware law may have a similar effect, such as provisions limiting the ability of certain interested stockholders, as defined under Delaware law, from causing the merger or acquisition of a corporation against the wishes of the Board of Directors.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nOur use of \"open source\" software could negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services and subject us to litigation.\nWe use some open-source software in our technology, most often as small components within a larger product or service, to augment algorithms, functionalities or libraries we create, and we may use more open-source software in the future. Open-source code is also contained in some third-party software we rely on. We could be subject to suits by parties claiming breach of the terms of the license for such open-source software. The terms of many open-source licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by U.S. or other courts, and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products and services. Further, open-source licensors generally do not provide technology support, maintenance, warranties or assurance of title or controls on the origin of the software, which can also lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software.\nA failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, could adversely affect our business.\nOur business is dependent on proprietary technology and other intellectual property that we own or license from third parties, including trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents. We cannot assure you that the steps that we have taken or will take in the future will prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property. Certain artificial intelligence technology may give rise to increased intellectual property risks, such as compromises to proprietary intellectual property and intellectual property infringement. We may be unable to detect the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our confidential information and intellectual property. Our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, we have resorted to litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights in the past, and may need to do so in the future, which requires significant financial and managerial resources.\nIn addition, our competitors, as well as other companies and individuals, have obtained, and may obtain in the future, intellectual property rights, including patents, related to the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We cannot assure you that we are or will be aware of all intellectual property rights that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services. As a result, we have in the past faced and may in the future face allegations that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of third parties which may be costly for us to defend against. If one or more of our products or services is found to infringe intellectual property rights held by others, we may be subject to lawsuits or required to stop developing or marketing the products or services, obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the owners of the intellectual property or redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the third-party intellectual property. We also have in the past, and could in the future, be required to pay damages if we are found to infringe intellectual property rights held by others, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to intellectual property rights held by others, whether such licenses would be available or, if available, whether we would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms. If we were unable to obtain such licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products or services at a reasonable cost to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nITEM 1 (B).    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS\nNone.\n39\nITEM 1 (C).    CYBERSECURITY\nOur business activities rely extensively on technology and software, including the systems used by our business partners, regulators and customers. In addition, our activities involve the use and retention of confidential data and information. These activities make us susceptible to cyberattacks. We employ the following activities, processes and strategies to help evaluate, manage and address these risks.\n•\nStrategy: \nWe maintain a Cybersecurity Strategy, or CSS, which emphasizes consideration of the nature of our business, ongoing intelligence collection regarding cybersecurity threats, and initiatives to specifically address prominent areas of cybersecurity risk.\n The CSS outlines the key priorities for our cybersecurity program and the methods by which our Information Security department seeks to accomplish those goals.\n•\nGovernance and Leadership: \nOur Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing ICE’s risk management process, which includes management of general risks as well as specific risks, such as those relating to cybersecurity, facing our business.\n The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors has been delegated the primary responsibility for overseeing management’s identification and mitigation of cybersecurity risk. The Risk Committee is composed of board members with diverse expertise including cybersecurity, risk management, technology, business operations, regulatory and finance.\n \nThe Risk Committee receives presentations on at least a quarterly basis from our Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO, and senior members of the Enterprise Risk Management, or ERM, team, and the Chair of the Risk Committee provides reports to the full Board of Directors following such presentations.\n Our Information Security department is led by our CISO, who, in addition to quarterly presentations to the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors, also provides comprehensive reports to a dedicated internal governance committee at least quarterly outlining threat assessment, control performance, and ongoing enhancements. \nOur current CISO has served in the role since September 2021 and leads the cybersecurity program across our regulated futures and options exchanges, CCPs, trade repositories, equities venues, systemically important financial market utilities (SIFMUs) and our data services network and mortgage technology platforms. Prior to joining ICE, our CISO served as CISO of the White House Military Office and as CISO for two technology companies, and has more than 20 years of experience in cybersecurity, national security, and intelligence.\n Additionally, cybersecurity matters are reported to and discussed with a cross-subsidiary leadership committee and subsidiary boards. The Cyber Threat Intelligence team monitors multiple cybersecurity intelligence feeds and curates the applicable data. In the event we identify a cybersecurity threat applicable to us, we have a process to evaluate, escalate to Senior Management and respond to the threat faced. In addition, our CISO and other senior security leaders conduct periodic cybersecurity education sessions with our employees and directors. These sessions cover general cybersecurity topics as well as specific details regarding our cybersecurity program.\n•\nRisk Management\n: \nCybersecurity risk management is integrated into our broader ERM framework.\n Our cybersecurity leadership team, in concert with our ERM team, assess threats and risks at least annually through the Enterprise Technology Risk Assessment process, which includes threat objective inherent risk score determination, identification of key and supporting controls, and resulting residual threat objective risk scores. Additionally, thematic threats such as sabotage, fraud, and theft of assets or customer data are used to frame our risk management activities. Asset theft often involves organized crime or financially motivated nations staging sophisticated, well-planned campaigns to steal significant cash, cryptocurrency, or equivalent assets. Our thematic threats, along with others, are evaluated by our \nBoard of Directors\n as well as our Risk Committee, Corporate Risk Officer and our CISO.\n The CSS provides the framework we use for assessing risk, prioritizing testing, identifying remedial actions and validating improvements. The CSS also provides for the deployment of external and internal teams of ethical hackers that operate alongside our traditional vulnerability detection processes.\n•\nInformation Sharing\n: We recognize the importance of collaboration and information sharing among private sector firms in the financial services sector, across sectors, and with global public-sector agencies, when appropriate. Our cybersecurity leaders hold memberships and/or positions within the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or FS-ISAC, and the cross-sector Analysis and Resiliency Center, or ARC, in the U.S., the Financial Sector Cyber Collaboration Centre, or FSCCC, in the U.K., and similar organizations across the Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia Pacific, or APAC, regions.\n•\nThird-Party Risk Oversight\n: \nWe\n \nmaintain a\n \nthird-party risk management program. Our Information Security team provides subject matter expertise to our vendor management team to help assess a vendors' cybersecurity processes. Vendors are assessed before we engage them, and once engaged, are monitored periodically to ensure that they maintain compliance with our cybersecurity standards.\n•\nIndependent Security Attestation\n:\n We utilize both internal assessments and assessments by third parties, including external security assessors, consultants and auditors, to evaluate and test our cybersecurity program. \n40\nICE’s Internal Audit, ERM, and Information Security Assurance teams conduct frequent assessments of varying scope to validate that our cybersecurity program controls and remediation processes are operating effectively. External auditors are contracted to perform annual Service Organization Controls, or SOC, report attestations of both business and security controls. In addition, our Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan is tested at least annually. Our internal \"red team\" conducts multiple tests each year driven by key cybersecurity risks. The results of these reviews alongside frequent regulatory and customer examinations are assessed, with any resulting mitigation activity assigned and tracked to remediation.\n•\nControls\n: Our identification of risks and selection of cyber-related controls is performed in the context of the critical financial infrastructure we maintain and operate. Our ongoing threat assessments are intended to identify changes in external events and in our activities, infrastructure and processes that could necessitate reprioritization of risks and controls. The nature of our business activities mandates an emphasis on sabotage and asset theft as primary threats in addition to contemporary themes of data theft. Our focus on these threats leads to an emphasis on network security, social engineering controls, behavioral detection of insider threat, and deliberate and rehearsed recovery strategies.\nAlthough we do not believe that our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition have been materially adversely affected by any cybersecurity threats, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to cyberattacks, hacking and other cybersecurity risks.\n For further information on our cybersecurity risks, see Part I, Item 1(A), \"Risk Factors\", including the risk factor entitled “Our systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to cyberattacks, hacking and other cybersecurity risks, which could result in wrongful manipulation, disclosure, destruction, or use of our information or that of a third party, or which could make our customers unable or reluctant to use our electronic platforms,” included elsewhere in this Annual Report."
