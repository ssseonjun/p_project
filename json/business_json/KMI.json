These investments include our use of continuous third-party security monitoring of our network perimeters, advanced persistent threat group monitoring to keep us informed of emerging serious threats, standardization of our network security architecture which separates business and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) networks, and security information and event management software systems.\nOur critical business systems are fully redundant and backed up at separate locations.  Separate business and SCADA networks allow for isolation of potential threats and enhances the security of these systems.  Our security systems correlate security events and aggregate security-related incident data, such as malware activity and other possible malicious activities.  This system sends alerts if the data analysis shows that an activity could be a potential security issue.  Security functionality is continuously monitored by our network operations center, and our network traffic is analyzed for signs of malicious activity through the CyberSentry program, which is managed by DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and a third-party security operations center, which operates continuously.  We maintain a dedicated SCADA group within our IT department to evaluate and respond to significant events and incidents that may impact our operations.  Anti-virus solutions are deployed on the SCADA systems and workstations in our data centers and control centers.\nOur processes and cybersecurity plans are part of our overall emergency response plans, and we conduct simulated exercise drills, including with multiple U.S. government agencies and peer companies, to enhance our preparedness and provide for continual process improvement.\nIf data and network defenses are bypassed, processes detailed in our Cyber Incident Response Plan would help identify, contain and eradicate threats and bring our systems back online if needed.  Additionally, the plan requires that the appropriate level of our management be made aware of incidents and be updated as the situation warrants.\nVulnerability Assessments and Penetration Testing\nWe hire an independent third-party cybersecurity firm to perform penetration testing annually.  The third-party checks for vulnerabilities on our external and internal network perimeters.  If vulnerabilities are found, corrective actions are implemented to remediate any issues.\nGovernment and Industry Group Engagement\nWe engage with a wide variety of government agencies and industry groups to enable cross-sharing of information and to identify opportunities to improve our security, including active participation in IT Sector Coordinating Councils and attendance at classified briefings and security architecture reviews hosted by the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and DHS.  Partnership with these agencies provides us with intelligence on a wide range of critical infrastructure protection and cybersecurity issues as well as an opportunity to exchange best practices.\nEmployee Training\nOur employees are required to take annual cyber and physical security training designed to help employees guard our cyber and physical data.  Employees are tested regularly on cybersecurity, and cybersecurity performance is considered in annual employee performance reviews.\n37\nCybersecurity Governance Structures\nManagement’s Role in Managing Cybersecurity Risk\nWe are committed to protecting sensitive information and have a dedicated cybersecurity group within our IT department that is overseen by our Chief Information Officer.  This group provides a quarterly cybersecurity report to our senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Information Officer, General Counsel, business segment Presidents and the Vice President—Corporate Security\n.  This senior management team is involved in all significant cybersecurity decisions, including efforts undertaken to comply with the security directives issued by the TSA.  Our Chief Information Officer and, occasionally, our Chief Executive Officer and our General Counsel have attended classified briefings on cybersecurity in Washington, D.C.  In addition to the quarterly reports to senior management, the cybersecurity team prepares broader management briefings that include updates regarding company-wide cybersecurity matters and initiatives and provide a forum for discussing data security risk solutions and formulating action plans.\nManagement of our cybersecurity team has extensive experience and training related to cybersecurity matters.  These leaders hold top-secret clearance from the U.S. federal government and have attended classified briefings from relevant federal agencies.  Our cybersecurity team has in excess of 100 years of combined cybersecurity experience as of year-end 2024, and members of the team hold various specialized certifications related to cybersecurity, including training related to penetration testing and information system auditing.\nThe Board’s Role in Cybersecurity Risk Oversight\nThe \nAudit Committee\n of our Board has oversight responsibility related to cybersecurity risk\n and is briefed quarterly by our Chief Information Officer on cybersecurity risk, our cybersecurity management program and initiatives, and, if applicable, notable cybersecurity events.\n  In the event of a significant cybersecurity incident, our \nChief Executive Officer\n will notify the Chairman of the Board or, in that person’s absence, the lead independent director of the Board.\nItem 3.  \nLegal Proceedings.\nSee Note 17 “Litigation and Environmental” to our consolidated financial statements.\nItem 4.  \nMine Safety Disclosures.\nExcept for one terminal facility that is in temporary idle status with the Mine Safety and Health Administration, we do not own or operate mines for which reporting requirements apply under the mine safety disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.  We have not received any specified health and safety violations, orders or citations, related assessments or legal actions, mining-related fatalities, or similar events requiring disclosure pursuant to the mine safety disclosure requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n38\nPART II\nItem 5.  \nMarket for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nOur Class P common stock is listed for trading on the NYSE under the symbol “KMI.”\nAs of February 12, 2025, we had 9,082 holders of record of our Class P common stock, which does not include beneficial owners whose shares are held by a nominee, such as a broker or bank.\nFor information on our equity compensation plans, see Note 9 “Share-based Compensation and Employee Benefits\n—Share-based Compensation\n” to our consolidated financial statements.

Circumstances may arise that lead to conflicts between using funds to pay anticipated dividends or to invest in our business.\n”\n \nAll of these matters will be taken into consideration by our Board when declaring dividends.\nOur dividends are not cumulative.  Consequently, if dividends on our stock are not paid at the intended levels, our stockholders are not entitled to receive those payments in the future.  Our dividends generally will be paid on or about the 15th day of each February, May, August and November.\n63\nSummarized Combined Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries\nKMI and certain subsidiaries (Subsidiary Issuers) are issuers of certain debt securities.  KMI and substantially all of KMI’s wholly owned domestic subsidiaries (Subsidiary Guarantors), are parties to a cross guarantee agreement whereby each party to the agreement unconditionally guarantees, jointly and severally, the payment of specified indebtedness of each other party to the agreement.  Accordingly, with the exception of certain subsidiaries identified as subsidiary non-guarantors (Subsidiary Non-Guarantors), the parent issuer, Subsidiary Issuers and Subsidiary Guarantors (the “Obligated Group”) are all guarantors of each series of our guaranteed debt (Guaranteed Notes).  As a result of the cross guarantee agreement, a holder of any of the Guaranteed Notes issued by KMI or a Subsidiary Issuer is in the same position with respect to the net assets, and income of KMI and the Subsidiary Issuers and Guarantors.  The only amounts that are not available to the holders of each of the Guaranteed Notes to satisfy the repayment of such securities are the net assets, and income of the Subsidiary Non-Guarantors.\nIn lieu of providing separate financial statements for the Obligated Group, we have presented the accompanying supplemental summarized combined income statement and balance sheet information for the Obligated Group based on Rule 13-01 of the SEC’s Regulation S-X.  Also, see Exhibit 10.11 to this report “\nCross Guarantee Agreement, dated as of November 26, 2014, among KMI and certain of its subsidiaries, with schedules updated as of December 31, 2024.\n”\nAll significant intercompany items among the Obligated Group have been eliminated in the supplemental summarized combined financial information. The Obligated Group’s investment balances in Subsidiary Non-Guarantors have been excluded from the supplemental summarized combined financial information. Significant intercompany balances and activity for the Obligated Group with other related parties, including Subsidiary Non-Guarantors (referred to as “affiliates”), are presented separately in the accompanying supplemental summarized combined financial information.\nExcluding fair value adjustments, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Obligated Group had $31,052 million and $31,167 million, respectively, of Guaranteed Notes outstanding. \nSummarized combined balance sheet and income statement information for the Obligated Group follows:\nDecember 31,\nSummarized Combined Balance Sheet Information\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCurrent assets\n$\n2,216 \n$\n2,246 \nCurrent assets - affiliates\n735 \n760 \nNoncurrent assets\n63,267 \n62,877 \nNoncurrent assets - affiliates\n813 \n903 \nTotal Assets\n$\n67,031 \n$\n66,786 \nCurrent liabilities\n$\n4,737 \n$\n6,907 \nCurrent liabilities - affiliates\n758 \n734 \nNoncurrent liabilities\n34,052 \n31,681 \nNoncurrent liabilities - affiliates\n1,561 \n1,306 \nTotal Liabilities\n41,108 \n40,628 \nKinder Morgan, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity\n25,923 \n26,158 \nTotal Liabilities and Stockholders’ Equity\n$\n67,031 \n$\n66,786 \nSummarized Combined Income Statement Information\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nRevenues\n$\n13,678 \nOperating income\n3,827 \nNet income\n2,131 \n64\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease refer to Note 18 “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” to our consolidated financial statements for information concerning recent accounting pronouncements.\nItem 7A.\n  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nGenerally, our market risk sensitive instruments and positions have been determined to be “other than trading.”  Our exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward-looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in energy commodity prices or interest rates.  Our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur, since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated based on actual fluctuations in energy commodity prices or interest rates and the timing of transactions.\nEnergy Commodity Market Risk\nWe enter into certain energy commodity derivative contracts in order to reduce risks encountered in the ordinary course of business associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of crude oil, natural gas and NGL.  The derivative contracts that we use include exchange-traded and OTC commodity financial instruments, including, but not limited to, futures and options contracts, fixed price swaps and basis swaps.  We may categorize such use of energy commodity derivative contracts as cash flow hedges because the derivative contract is used to hedge the anticipated future cash flow of a transaction that is expected to occur but whose value is uncertain.\nOur hedging strategy involves entering into a financial position intended to offset our physical position, or anticipated position, in order to minimize the risk of financial loss from an adverse price change.  For example, as sellers of crude oil, natural gas and NGL, we often enter into fixed price swaps and/or futures contracts to guarantee or lock-in the sale price of our crude oil or the margin from the sale and purchase of our natural gas at the time of market delivery, thereby in whole or in part offsetting any change in prices, either positive or negative.  Using derivative contracts for this purpose helps provide increased certainty with regard to operating cash flows, which helps us to undertake further capital improvement projects, attain budget results and meet dividend targets.\nOur policies require that derivative contracts are only entered into with carefully selected major financial institutions or similar counterparties based upon their credit ratings and other factors, and we maintain strict dollar and term limits that correspond to our counterparties’ credit ratings.  While it is our policy to enter into derivative transactions principally with investment grade counterparties and actively monitor their credit ratings, it is nevertheless possible that losses will result from counterparty credit risk in the future.\nWe measure the risk of price changes in the derivative instrument portfolios utilizing a sensitivity analysis model.  The sensitivity analysis applied to each portfolio measures the potential income or loss (i.e., the change in fair value of the derivative instrument portfolio) based upon a hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying quoted market prices.  In addition to these variables, the fair value of each portfolio is influenced by fluctuations in the notional amounts of the instruments and the discount rates used to determine the present values. Because we enter into derivative contracts largely for the purpose of mitigating the risks that accompany certain of our business activities, both in the sensitivity analysis model and in reality, the change in the market value of the derivative contracts’ portfolio is offset largely by changes in the value of the underlying physical transactions. A hypothetical 10% movement in the underlying commodity prices would have the following effect on the associated derivative contracts’ estimated fair value:\nAs of December 31,\nCommodity derivative\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCrude oil\n$\n120 \n$\n127 \nNatural gas\n76 \n28 \nNGL\n4 \n4 \nTotal\n$\n200 \n$\n159 \nOur sensitivity analysis represents an estimate of the reasonably possible gains and losses that would be recognized on the crude oil, natural gas and NGL portfolios of derivative contracts assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is \n65\nnot necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur.  It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated.  Actual gains and losses may differ from estimates due to actual fluctuations in market rates, operating exposures and the timing thereof, as well as changes in our portfolio of derivatives during the year.\nInterest Rate Risk\nIn order to maintain a cost effective capital structure, it is our policy to borrow funds using a mix of fixed-rate debt and variable-rate debt.  Fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements are entered into for the purpose of converting a portion of the underlying cash flows related to long-term fixed-rate debt securities into variable-rate debt in order to achieve our desired mix of fixed and variable-rate debt.  Variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements are entered into primarily for the purpose of managing our exposure to changes in interest rates on our debt balances that are subject to variable interest rates and adjusting, on a short-term basis, our mix of fixed-rate debt and variable-rate debt based on changes in market conditions.  The market risk inherent in our debt instruments and positions is the potential change arising from increases or decreases in interest rates as discussed below.\nFor fixed-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our earnings or cash flows.  Conversely, for variable-rate debt, changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument, but may affect our future earnings and cash flows.  Generally, there is not an obligation to prepay fixed-rate debt prior to maturity and, as a result, changes in fair value should not have a significant impact on the fixed-rate debt.  We are generally subject to interest rate risk upon refinancing maturing debt.  Below are our debt balances, including debt fair value adjustments, and sensitivity to interest rates:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nCarrying\nvalue\nEstimated\nfair value(a)\nCarrying\nvalue\nEstimated\nfair value(a)\n(In millions)\nFixed rate debt(b)\n$\n31,519 \n$\n30,423 \n$\n30,063 \n$\n29,317 \nVariable rate debt\n$\n371 \n$\n371 \n$\n2,053 \n$\n2,053 \nNotional principal amount of variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements\n(1,500)\n— \nNotional principal amount of fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements\n4,750 \n6,200 \nDebt balances subject to variable interest rates(c)\n$\n3,621 \n$\n8,253 \n(a)\nFair values were determined using Level 2 inputs.\n(b)\nA hypothetical 10% change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, would result in changes of approximately $1,416 million and $1,889 million, respectively, in the estimated fair values of these instruments.\n(c)\nA hypothetical 10% change in the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings (approximately 58 basis points in both 2024 and 2023) when applied to our outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, including adjustments for the notional swap amounts described in the table above, would result in changes of approximately $21 million and $48 million, respectively.\nWe monitor our mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions, and we may alter that mix from time to time by, for example, refinancing outstanding balances of variable rate debt with fixed rate debt (or vice versa) or by entering into interest rate swap agreements or other interest rate hedging agreements.  As of December 31, 2024, including debt converted to variable rates through the use of interest rate swaps but excluding our debt fair value adjustments, approximately 11% of our debt balances were subject to variable interest rates.\nFor more information on our interest rate risk management and on our interest rate swap agreements, see Note 13 “Risk Management” to our consolidated financial statements.\n66\nForeign Currency Risk\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had a notional principal amount of $543 million of cross-currency swap agreements that effectively convert all of our fixed-rate Euro denominated debt, including annual interest payments and the payment of principal at maturity, to U.S. dollar denominated debt at fixed rates.  These swaps eliminate the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency denominated debt.\n67\nItem 8.  \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nKINDER MORGAN, INC.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework \n(2013)\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023\n, \nand the results of its\n \noperations and its\n \ncash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n \n(2013)\n \nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n69\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nGoodwill Impairment Assessment – Natural Gas Pipelines Regulated, Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated, CO\n2\n, Products Pipelines, Products Pipelines Terminals, and Terminals Reporting Units\nAs described in Notes 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated goodwill balance was $20.1 billion as of December 31, 2024, of which $20.0 billion relates to the Natural Gas Pipelines Regulated, Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated, CO\n2\n, Products Pipelines, Products Pipelines Terminals, and Terminals reporting units (collectively, “the reporting units”). Management evaluates goodwill for impairment on May 31 of each year, or more frequently to the extent events occur or conditions change between annual tests that would indicate a risk of possible impairment at the interim period. Management estimated the fair value of the reporting units based on a market approach utilizing forecasted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, including amortization of excess cost of equity investments (EBITDA), and the enterprise value to estimated EBITDA multiples of comparable companies for each reporting unit.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the goodwill impairment assessment of the reporting units is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting units; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to forecasted EBITDA and the enterprise value to estimated EBITDA multiples of comparable companies for each of the reporting units; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over developing the fair value estimate of the reporting units. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the reporting units; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the market approach used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the market approach; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to forecasted EBITDA and the enterprise value to estimated EBITDA multiples of comparable companies for each of the reporting units. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to forecasted EBITDA and the enterprise value to estimated EBITDA multiples of comparable companies for each of the reporting units involved evaluating whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting units; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the market approach and (ii) the reasonableness of the assumption related to the enterprise value to estimated EBITDA multiples of comparable companies for each of the reporting units.\n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 13, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1997.\n70\nKINDER MORGAN, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. \nGeneral\nWe are one of the largest energy infrastructure companies in North America.  Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” “the Company,” or “KMI” are intended to mean Kinder Morgan, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  Our pipelines transport natural gas, refined petroleum products, crude oil, condensate, CO\n2\n, renewable fuels and other products, and our terminals store and handle various commodities including gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, chemicals, metals, petroleum coke, and ethanol and other renewable fuels and feedstocks.\n \n2. \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nOur reporting currency is U.S. dollars, and all references to dollars are U.S. dollars, unless stated otherwise.  Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the rules and regulations of the SEC.  These rules and regulations conform to the accounting principles contained in the FASB’s Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), the single source of GAAP.  Under such rules and regulations, all significant intercompany items have been eliminated in consolidation.  Additionally, certain amounts from prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nCertain amounts included in or affecting our financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated, requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions which cannot be known with certainty at the time our financial statements are prepared.  These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities, our revenues and expenses during the reporting period, and our disclosures, including those related to contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements.  We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with experts and other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances.  Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates.  Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.\nCertain accounting policies are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others, and set out below are the principal accounting policies we apply in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nCash Equivalents and Restricted Deposits\nWe define cash equivalents as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less.\nAmounts included in the restricted deposits in the accompanying consolidated financial statements represent a combination of restricted cash amounts required to be set aside by regulatory agencies to cover obligations for our captive insurance subsidiary and cash margin deposits posted by us with our counterparties associated with certain energy commodity contract positions.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe evaluate our financial assets measured at amortized cost and off-balance sheet credit exposures for expected credit losses over the contractual term of the asset or exposure.  We consider available information relevant to assessing the collectability of cash flows including the expected risk of credit loss even if that risk is remote.  We measure expected credit losses on a collective (pool) basis when similar risk characteristics exist, and we reflect the expected credit losses on the amortized cost basis of the financial asset as of the reporting date.\nOur financial instruments primarily consist of our accounts receivable from customers, notes receivable from affiliates and contingent liabilities such as proportional guarantees of debt obligations of an equity investee.  We utilized historical analysis of credit losses experienced over the previous five years along with current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future conditions in our evaluation of collectability of our financial assets.\n77\nOur allowance for credit losses as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023 were immaterial and is included in “Other current assets” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nInventories\nOur inventories consist of materials and supplies and products such as natural gas, NGL, crude oil, condensate, refined petroleum products and transmix.  We report products inventory at the lower of weighted-average cost or net realizable value. We report materials and supplies inventories at cost, and periodically review for physical deterioration and obsolescence.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, net\nCapitalization, Depreciation and Depletion and Disposals\nWe report property, plant and equipment at its acquisition cost.  We expense costs for routine maintenance and repairs in the period incurred.  The following table summarizes our significant policies related to our property, plant and equipment.  The application of these policies can involve significant estimates.\nAsset\nAccounting Area\nPolicy\nStraight-line assets\nDepreciation rates\n•\nDepreciable lives are based on estimated economic lives.  This includes age, manufacturing specifications, technological advances, estimated production life of the oil or gas field served by the asset, contract terms for assets on leased or customer property and historical data concerning useful lives of similar assets.\nGains and losses\n•\nA gain or loss on the sale of property, plant and equipment is calculated as the difference between the cost of the asset disposed of, net of depreciation, and the sale proceeds received or when held for sale, the market value of the asset.\n•\nA gain on an asset disposal is recognized in income in the period that the sale is closed.\n•\nA loss is recognized when the asset is sold or when classified as held for sale.\n•\nGains and losses are recorded in operating costs, expenses and other.\nComposite assets\nDepreciation rates\n•\nA single depreciation rate is applied to the total cost of a functional group of assets that have similar economic characteristics until the net book value of the composite group equals the salvage value.\n•\nInterstate natural gas FERC-regulated entities use the depreciation rates approved by the FERC.\n•\nA depreciation rate for other composite assets is based on estimated economic lives.  This includes age, manufacturing specifications, technological advances, estimated production life of the oil or gas field served by the asset, contract terms for assets on leased or customer property and historical data concerning useful lives of similar assets.\nGains and losses\n•\nGains and losses are credited or charged to accumulated depreciation, net of salvage and cost of removal.\n•\nGains or losses on land sales and FERC-approved operating unit sales are recorded in operating costs, expenses and other.\nOil and gas producing activities(a)\nSuccessful efforts method of accounting\n•\nCosts that are incurred to acquire leasehold and subsequent development costs are capitalized.  \n•\nCosts that are associated with the drilling of successful exploration wells are capitalized if proved reserves are found.  \n•\nCosts associated with the drilling of exploratory wells that do not find proved reserves, geological and geophysical costs, and costs of certain non-producing leasehold costs are expensed as incurred.  \n•\nThe capitalized costs of our producing oil and gas properties are depreciated and depleted by the units-of-production method.  \n•\nOther miscellaneous property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the asset.\nEnhanced recovery techniques\n•\nIn some cases, the cost of the CO\n2\n associated with enhanced recovery is capitalized as part of our development costs when it is injected.  \n•\nThe cost of CO\n2\n associated with pressure maintenance operations for reservoir management is expensed when it is injected.  \n•\nWhen CO\n2\n is recovered in conjunction with oil production, it is extracted and re-injected, and all of the associated costs are expensed as incurred.  \n•\nProved developed reserves are used in computing units of production rates for drilling and development costs, and total proved reserves are used for depletion of leasehold costs.\n78\n(a)\nGains and losses associated with assets in our oil and gas producing activities have a similar treatment as with that associated with our straight-line assets.\nCircumstances may develop which cause us to change our estimates, thus impacting the future calculation of depreciation and amortization expense.  Historically, adjustments to useful lives have not had a material impact on our aggregate depreciation levels from year to year.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe record liabilities for obligations related to the retirement and removal of long-lived assets used in our businesses.  The majority of our asset retirement obligations are associated with our CO\n2\n business where we are required to plug and abandon oil and gas wells that have been removed from service and to remove the surface wellhead equipment and compressors, but we also have obligations for certain gathering and long-haul pipelines and certain processing plants.  We record, as liabilities, the fair value of asset retirement obligations on a discounted basis when they are incurred and can be reasonably estimated, which is typically at the time the assets are installed or acquired.  The fair value estimates are primarily based on Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  The inputs include estimates and assumptions related to timing of settlement and retirement costs, which we base on historical retirement costs, future inflation rates and credit-adjusted risk-free interest rates.  Amounts recorded for the related assets are increased by the amount of these obligations.  Over time, the liabilities are accreted to reflect the change in their present value, and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.  The liabilities are eventually extinguished when the asset is taken out of service.  Our estimates of retirement costs could change as a result of changes in cost estimates and/or timing of the obligation.\nThe following table summarizes changes in the asset retirement obligations included in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nBalance at beginning of period\n$\n231\n \n$\n204\n \nAccretion expense\n13\n \n12\n \nDivestitures (Note 3)\n(\n33\n)\n—\n \nAcquisitions (Note 3)\n43\n \n12\n \nNew obligations\n10\n \n10\n \nSettlements\n(\n16\n)\n(\n7\n)\nBalance at end of period(a)\n$\n248\n \n$\n231\n \n(a)\nBalances at December 31, 2024 and 2023 include $\n2\n million and \n$\n3\n million, respectively, included within “Other current liabilities” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nFor certain assets, we currently cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the asset retirement obligations because the associated assets have indeterminate lives.  These assets include certain pipelines, processing plants and distribution facilities, and liquids and bulk terminal facilities.  Based on the widespread use of hydrocarbons domestically and for international export, management expects supply and demand to exist for the foreseeable future.  Therefore, the remaining useful lives of these assets are indeterminate due to prolonged expected demand.  Additionally, these assets could also benefit from potential future conversion opportunities.  For example, certain assets could be converted to transport, handle or store products other than traditional hydrocarbons.  Under our integrity program, individual asset parts are replaced regularly.  Although some of the individual asset parts may be replaced, the assets themselves may remain intact indefinitely.  For these assets, an asset retirement obligation, if any, will be recognized once sufficient information is available to reasonably estimate the fair value of the obligation.\nLong-lived Asset Impairments\nWe evaluate long-lived assets including leases and investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that our carrying amount of an asset or investment may not be recoverable.\nIn addition to our annual goodwill impairment test discussed further below, to the extent triggering events exist, we complete a review of the carrying value of our long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment as well as other intangibles, and record, as applicable, the appropriate impairments using a two-step approach.  To determine if a long-lived \n79\nasset is recoverable, we compare the asset’s estimated undiscounted cash flows to its carrying value (step 1).  Because the impairment test for long-lived assets held in use is based on estimated undiscounted cash flows, there may be instances where an asset or asset group is not considered impaired, even when its fair value may be less than its carrying value, because the asset or asset group is recoverable based on the cash flows to be generated over the estimated life of the asset or asset group.  If the carrying value of a long-lived asset or asset group is in excess of estimated undiscounted cash flows, we typically use discounted cash flow analyses to calculate the fair value of the long-lived asset to determine if an impairment is required and the amount of the impairment losses to be recognized (step 2).\nWe evaluate our oil and gas producing properties for impairment of value on a field-by-field basis or, in certain instances, by logical grouping of assets if there is significant shared infrastructure, using undiscounted future cash flows based on estimated future oil and gas production volumes.\nOil and gas producing properties deemed to be impaired are written down to their fair value, as determined by discounted future cash flows based on estimated future oil and gas production volumes.  Unproved oil and gas properties that are individually significant are periodically assessed for impairment of value, and a loss is recognized at the time of impairment.\nEquity Method of Accounting and Basis Differences\nWe use the equity method of accounting for investments which we do not control, but for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence.  The carrying values of these investments are impacted by our share of investee income or loss, distributions, amortization or accretion of basis differences and other-than-temporary impairments.\nThe difference between the carrying value of an investment and our share of the investment’s underlying equity in net assets is referred to as a basis difference.  If the basis difference is assigned to depreciable or amortizable assets and liabilities, the basis difference is amortized or accreted as part of our share of investee earnings.  To the extent that the basis difference relates to goodwill, referred to as equity method goodwill, the amount is not amortized.\nWe evaluate our equity method investments for other-than-temporary impairment.  When an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized, the loss is recorded as a reduction in equity earnings.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the cost of an acquisition of a business in excess of the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities and is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet.  Goodwill is not subject to amortization but must be tested for impairment at least annually and in interim periods if indicators of impairment exist.  This test requires us to assign goodwill to an appropriate reporting unit and compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value.  If the carrying value of a reporting unit, including allocated goodwill, exceeds its fair value an impairment is measured and recorded at the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment on May 31 of each year, or more frequently to the extent events occur or conditions change between annual tests that would indicate a risk of possible impairment at the interim period.  For purposes of our May 31, 2024 evaluation, we grouped our businesses into \nseven\n reporting units as follows: (i) Natural Gas Pipelines Regulated; (ii) Natural Gas Pipelines Non-Regulated; (iii) CO\n2\n; (iv) Products Pipelines (excluding associated terminals); (v) Products Pipelines Terminals (evaluated separately from Products Pipelines for goodwill purposes); (vi) Terminals; and (vii) Energy Transition Ventures.  Generally, the evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves a quantitative test, although under certain circumstances an initial qualitative evaluation may be sufficient to conclude that goodwill is not impaired without conducting the quantitative test.\nA large portion of our goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes, and as such, to the extent there are impairments, all or a portion of the impairment may not result in a corresponding tax benefit.\nRefer to Note 7 for further information.\nOther Intangibles\nExcluding goodwill, our other intangible assets include customer contracts and other relationships and agreements.\nOur intangible assets primarily relate to customer contracts or other relationships for the handling and storage of petroleum, chemical, and dry-bulk materials, including oil, gasoline, and other refined petroleum products, petroleum coke, metals and \n80\nores, the gathering of natural gas and the production and supply of RNG.  We determined the values of these intangible assets by first, estimating the revenues derived from a customer contract or relationship (offset by the cost and expenses of supporting assets to fulfill the contract), and second, discounting the revenues at a risk adjusted discount rate.\nWe amortize the costs of our intangible assets to expense in a systematic and rational manner over their estimated useful lives.  The life of each intangible asset is based either on the life of the corresponding customer contract or agreement or, in the case of a customer relationship intangible (the life of which was determined by an analysis of all available data on that business relationship), the length of time used in the discounted cash flow analysis to determine the value of the customer relationship.  Among the factors we weigh, depending on the nature of the asset, are the effects of obsolescence, new technology, and competition.\nThe following tables summarize our other intangible assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and our amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022: \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nGross\n$\n3,543\n \n$\n3,543\n \nAccumulated amortization\n(\n1,783\n)\n(\n1,586\n)\nNet carrying amount\n$\n1,760\n \n$\n1,957\n \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nAmortization expense\n$\n197\n \n$\n202\n \n$\n253\n \nOur estimated amortization expense for our intangible assets for each of the next five fiscal years is:\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n(In millions)\nEstimated amortization expenses\n$\n193\n \n$\n191\n \n$\n191\n \n$\n190\n \n$\n189\n \nRevenue Recognition\nThe majority of our revenues are accounted for under Topic 606,\n Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n; however, to a limited extent, some revenues are accounted for under other guidance such as Topic 842, \nLeases\n or Topic 815, \nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\n.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nWe review our contracts with customers using the following steps to recognize revenue based on the transfer of goods or services to customers and in amounts that reflect the consideration the company expects to receive for those goods or services.  The steps include:  (i) identify the contract; (ii) identify the performance obligations of the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and then (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.  Each of these steps involves management judgment and an analysis of the contract’s material terms and conditions.\nOur customer sales contracts primarily include sales of natural gas, NGL, crude oil, CO\n2\n and transmix, as described below.  Generally, for the majority of these contracts (i) each unit (Bcf, gallon, barrel, etc.) of commodity is a separate performance obligation, as our promise is to sell multiple distinct units of commodity at a point in time; (ii) the transaction price principally consists of variable consideration, which amount is determinable each month end based on our right to invoice at month end for the value of commodity sold to the customer that month; and (iii) the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation based on the commodity’s standalone selling price and recognized as revenue upon delivery of the commodity, which is the point in time when the customer obtains control of the commodity and our performance obligation is satisfied.\nOur customer services contracts are primarily for transportation service, storage service, gathering and processing service, and terminaling, as described below.  Generally, for the majority of these contracts (i) our promise is to transfer (or stand ready to transfer) a series of distinct integrated services over a period of time, which is a single performance obligation; (ii) the \n81\ntransaction price includes fixed and/or variable consideration, which amount is determinable at contract inception and/or at each month end based on our right to invoice at month end for the value of services provided to the customer that month; and (iii) the transaction price is recognized as revenue over the service period specified in the contract (which can be a day, including each day in a series of promised daily services, a month, a year, or other time increment, including a deficiency makeup period) as the services are rendered using a time-based (passage of time) or units-based (units of service transferred) output method for measuring the transfer of control of the services and satisfaction of our performance obligation over the service period, based on the nature of the promised service (e.g., firm or non-firm) and the terms and conditions of the contract.\nFirm Services\nFirm services (also called uninterruptible services) are services that are promised to always be available to the customer during the period(s) covered by the contract, with limited exceptions.  Our firm service contracts are typically structured with take-or-pay or minimum volume provisions, which specify minimum service quantities a customer will pay for even if it chooses not to receive or use them in the specified service period (referred to as “deficiency quantities”).  For take-or-pay contracts, we recognize the take-or-pay amount as revenue ratably over the service period based on the passage of time as our performance obligation is to make the service, or a part of the service (e.g., reservation), continuously available over such period. For contracts with minimum volume provisions, we recognize the portion of the transaction price associated with the minimum provision as each service period expires and, as a result, our performance obligation is satisfied.\nNon-Firm Services\nNon-firm services (also called interruptible services) are the opposite of firm services in that such services are provided to a customer on an “as available” basis.  Generally, we do not have an obligation to perform these services until we accept a customer’s periodic request for service.  For the majority of our non-firm service contracts, the customer will pay only for the actual quantities of services it chooses to receive or use, and we typically recognize the transaction price as revenue as those units of service are transferred to the customer in the specified service period (typically a daily or monthly period).\nContract Balances\nContract assets and contract liabilities are the result of timing differences between revenue recognition, billings and cash collections.  We recognize contract assets in those instances where billing occurs subsequent to revenue recognition, and our right to invoice the customer is conditioned on something other than the passage of time.  Our contract assets are substantially related to breakage revenue associated with our firm service contracts with minimum volume commitment payment obligations where the customer cannot or will not make up deficiency quantities in the specified service period and contracts where we apply revenue levelization (i.e., contracts with fixed rates per volume that increase over the life of the contract for which we record revenue ratably per unit over the life of the contract based on our performance obligations that are generally unchanged over the life of the contract).  Our contract liabilities are substantially related to (i) capital improvements paid for in advance by certain customers generally in our non-regulated businesses, which we subsequently recognize as revenue on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the related customer contracts; (ii) consideration received from customers for temporary deficiency quantities under minimum volume contracts that we expect will be made up in a future period, which we subsequently recognize as revenue when the customer makes up the volumes or the likelihood that the customer will exercise its right for deficiency volumes becomes remote (e.g., there is insufficient capacity to make up the volumes, the deficiency makeup period expires); and (iii) contracts with fixed rates per volume that decrease over the life of the contract where we apply revenue levelization for amounts received for our future performance obligations.  We reassess amounts recorded as contract assets or liabilities upon contract modification.\nRefer to Note 14 for further information.\nCosts of Sales\nCosts of sales primarily includes the cost to purchase energy commodities sold, including natural gas, crude oil, NGL and other refined petroleum products, adjusted for the effects of our energy commodity hedging activities, as applicable.  Costs of our crude oil, gas and CO\n2\n producing activities, such as those in our CO\n2\n business segment, are not accounted for as costs of sales.\nOperations and Maintenance \nOperations and maintenance includes costs of services and is primarily comprised of (i) operational labor costs and (ii) operations, maintenance and asset integrity, regulatory and environmental costs.  Costs associated with our crude oil, gas and \n82\nCO\n2\n producing activities included within operations and maintenance totaled $\n402\n million, $\n393\n million and $\n367\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe capitalize certain environmental expenditures required to obtain rights-of-way, regulatory approvals or permitting as part of the construction of facilities we use in our business operations.  We accrue and expense environmental costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations, which do not contribute to current or future revenue generation.  We generally do not discount environmental liabilities to a net present value, and we record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and we can reasonably estimate the costs, such as after the completion of a feasibility study or commitment to a formal plan of action.  We recognize receivables for anticipated associated insurance recoveries when such recoveries are deemed to be probable.  We record at estimated fair value, where appropriate, environmental liabilities assumed in a business combination.\nWe routinely conduct reviews of potential environmental issues and claims that assist us in identifying environmental issues and estimating the costs and timing of remediation efforts.  We also routinely adjust our environmental liabilities to reflect changes in previous estimates.  In making environmental liability estimations, we consider the material effect of environmental compliance, pending legal actions against us, and potential third-party liability claims we may have against others.  Often, as the remediation evaluation and effort progresses, additional information is obtained, requiring revisions to estimated costs.\nLeases\nWe lease property including corporate and field offices and facilities, vehicles, heavy work equipment including rail cars and large trucks, tanks, office equipment and land.  Our leases have remaining lease terms of \none\n to \n46\n years, some of which have options to extend or terminate the lease.  We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception or upon modification.  For purposes of calculating operating lease liabilities, lease terms may be deemed to include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nOur operating ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement date.  Leases with variable rate adjustments, such as Consumer Price Index (CPI) adjustments, are reflected based on contractual lease payments as outlined within the lease agreement and not adjusted for any CPI increases or decreases.  Because most of our leases do not provide an explicit rate of return, we use our incremental secured borrowing rate based on lease term information available at the commencement date of the lease in determining the present value of lease payments.  We have real estate lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately.  For certain equipment leases, such as copiers and vehicles, we account for the leases under a portfolio method.  Leases that were grandfathered under various portions of Topic 842\n,\n such as land easements, are reassessed when the agreements are modified.\nRefer to Note 16 for further information.\nShare-based Compensation\n \nWe recognize compensation expense ratably over the vesting period of the restricted stock award based on the grant-date fair value, which is determined based on the market price of our Class P common stock on the grant date, less estimated forfeitures.  Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical forfeitures under our equity award plans.  Upon vesting, the restricted stock award will be settled in unrestricted shares of our Class P common stock.\n \nPensions and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe recognize the differences between the fair value of each of our and our consolidated subsidiaries’ pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets and the benefit obligations as either assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.  We record deferred plan costs and income—unrecognized losses and gains, unrecognized prior service costs and credits, and any remaining unamortized transition obligations—net of income taxes in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” with the proportionate share associated with less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries allocated and included within “Noncontrolling interests,” or as a regulatory asset or liability for certain of our regulated operations, until they are amortized as a component of benefit expense.\n83\nDeferred Financing Costs\nWe capitalize financing costs incurred with new borrowings and amortize the costs over the contractual term of the related obligations.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represents the interests in our consolidated subsidiaries that are not owned by us.  In our accompanying consolidated statements of income, the noncontrolling interest in the net income of our less than wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries is shown as an allocation of our consolidated net income and is presented separately as “Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.”  In our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, noncontrolling interests is presented separately as “Noncontrolling interests” within “Stockholders’ Equity.”\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense is recorded based on an estimate of the effective tax rate in effect or to be in effect during the relevant periods.  Changes in tax legislation are included in the relevant computations in the period in which such changes are enacted. We do business in a number of states with differing laws concerning how income subject to each state’s tax structure is measured and at what effective rate such income is taxed.  Therefore, we must make estimates of how our income will be apportioned among the various states in order to arrive at an overall effective tax rate.  Changes in our effective tax rate, including any effect on previously recorded deferred taxes, are recorded in the period in which the need for such change is identified.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more-likely-than-not that all, or a portion, of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  While we have considered estimated future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the amount of our valuation allowance, any change in the amount that we expect to ultimately realize will be included in income in the period in which such a determination is reached.  Income tax effects are released from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings, when applicable, on an individual item basis as those items are reclassified into income.\nIn determining the deferred income tax asset and liability balances attributable to our investments, we apply an accounting policy that looks through our investments.  The application of this policy resulted in no deferred income taxes being provided on the difference between the book and tax basis on the non-tax-deductible goodwill portion of our investments, including KMI’s investment in its wholly-owned subsidiary, KMP.\nRisk Management Activities\nWe utilize energy commodity derivative contracts for the purpose of mitigating our risk resulting from fluctuations in the market price of commodities including crude oil, natural gas, and NGL.  In addition, we enter into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of managing our interest rate exposure associated with our debt obligations.  We also enter into cross-currency swap agreements to manage our foreign currency risk associated with certain debt obligations.  We measure our derivative contracts at fair value and we report them on our balance sheet as either an asset or liability.  For certain physical forward commodity derivatives contracts, we apply the normal purchase/normal sale exception, whereby the revenues and expenses associated with such transactions are recognized during the period when the commodities are physically delivered or received.\nFor qualifying accounting hedges, we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, the risk management objectives, and the methods used for assessing and testing effectiveness.  When we designate a derivative contract as a cash flow accounting hedge, the entire change in fair value of the derivative that is included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness is deferred in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” and reclassified into earnings in the period in which the hedged item affects earnings.  When we designate a derivative contract as a fair value accounting hedge, the change in fair value of the hedged item is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the hedged item and recognized currently in earnings in the same line item that the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings.  Therefore, any difference between the changes in fair values of the item being hedged and the derivative contract results in a gain or loss from the hedging relationship recognized currently in earnings.\nFor derivative instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges, or for which we have not elected the normal purchase/normal sales exception, changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings.\n84\nUnrealized gains and losses associated with our derivative activities that affect income are reflected as “Change in fair market value of derivative contracts” within our accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows as a noncash add back to net income to arrive at cash flows from our derivative activities for the period.  Net changes in our interest receivable and payable balances that represent accruals and periodic settlements of interest on our interest rate swaps are included within “Accrued interest, net of interest rate swaps” on our accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows.\nFair Value\nThe fair values of our financial instruments are separated into three broad levels (Levels 1, 2 and 3) based on our assessment of the availability of observable market data and the significance of non-observable data used to determine fair value.  We assign each fair value measurement to a level corresponding to the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Recognized valuation techniques utilize inputs such as contractual prices, quoted market prices or rates, and discount factors.  These inputs may be either readily observable or corroborated by market data.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nRegulatory assets and liabilities represent probable future revenues or expenses associated with certain charges and credits that will be recovered from or returned to customers through the ratemaking process.  In instances where we receive recovery in tariff rates related to losses on dispositions of operating units, we record a regulatory asset for the estimated recoverable amount.  We include the amounts of our regulatory assets and liabilities within “Other current assets,” “Deferred charges and other assets,” “Other current liabilities” and “Other long-term liabilities and deferred credits,” respectively, in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table summarizes our regulatory asset and liability balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023: \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCurrent regulatory assets\n$\n25\n \n$\n26\n \nNon-current regulatory assets\n231\n \n214\n \nTotal regulatory assets(a)\n$\n256\n \n$\n240\n \nCurrent regulatory liabilities\n$\n35\n \n$\n45\n \nNon-current regulatory liabilities\n197\n \n188\n \nTotal regulatory liabilities(b)\n$\n232\n \n$\n233\n \n(a)\nRegulatory assets as of December 31, 2024 include (i)  $\n90\n million of unamortized losses on disposal of assets; (ii) $\n41\n million income tax gross up on equity AFUDC; and (iii) $\n125\n million of other assets, including amounts related to fuel tracker arrangements.  Approximately $\n162\n million of the regulatory assets, with a weighted average remaining recovery period of \n8\n years, are recoverable without earning a return, including the income tax gross up on equity AFUDC for which there is an offsetting deferred income tax balance for FERC rate base purposes; therefore, it does not earn a return.\n(b)\nRegulatory liabilities as of December 31, 2024 are comprised of customer prepayments to be credited to shippers or other over-collections that are expected to be returned to shippers or netted against under-collections over time.  Approximately $\n118\n million of the $\n197\n million classified as non-current is expected to be credited to shippers over a remaining weighted average period of \n11\n years, while the remaining $\n79\n million is not subject to a defined period.\nEarnings per Share\nWe calculate earnings per share using the two-class method.  Earnings were allocated to Class P common stock and participating securities based on the amount of dividends paid in the current period plus an allocation of the undistributed earnings or excess distributions over earnings to the extent that each security participates in undistributed earnings or excess distributions over earnings.  Our unvested restricted stock awards, which may be restricted stock or restricted stock units issued to employees and non-employee directors and include dividend equivalent payments, do not participate in excess distributions over earnings.\n85\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of net income available to shareholders of Class P common stock and participating securities:\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nNet Income Available to Stockholders\n$\n2,613\n \n$\n2,391\n \n$\n2,548\n \nParticipating securities:\n   Less: Net Income Allocated to Restricted stock awards(a)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n13\n)\nNet Income Allocated to Common Stockholders\n$\n2,598\n \n$\n2,377\n \n$\n2,535\n \nBasic Weighted Average Shares Outstanding\n2,220\n \n2,234\n \n2,258\n \nBasic Earnings Per Share\n$\n1.17\n \n$\n1.06\n \n$\n1.12\n \n(a)\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were approximately \n13\n million restricted stock awards outstanding.\nThe following maximum number of potential common stock equivalents are antidilutive and, accordingly, are excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per share.  As we have no other common stock equivalents, our diluted earnings per share are the same as our basic earnings per share for all periods presented.\nYear Ended December 31, \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions on a weighted average basis)\nUnvested restricted stock awards\n13\n \n13\n \n13\n \nConvertible trust preferred securities\n3\n \n3\n \n3\n \n3. \nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAcquisitions\nFor acquired businesses, we recognize the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition with any excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired recorded to goodwill.  Determining the fair value of these items requires management’s judgment and the utilization of an independent valuation specialist, if applicable, and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nOur allocation of the purchase price for acquisitions completed during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are detailed below:\nAssignment of Purchase Price\nRef\nAcquisition\nPurchase price\nCurrent assets\nProperty, plant & equipment\nOther long-term assets\nCurrent liabilities\nLong-term liabilities\nNon-controlling interest\nResulting goodwill\n(In millions)\n(1)\nNorth McElroy Unit\n$\n61\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n102\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n42\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n(2)\nSTX Midstream\n1,829\n \n25\n \n1,199\n \n549\n \n(\n6\n)\n—\n \n(\n66\n)\n128\n \n(3)\nDiamond M\n13\n \n—\n \n25\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n12\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(4)\nNorth American Natural Resources\n132\n \n2\n \n5\n \n64\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n61\n \n(5)\nMas Ranger, LLC\n358\n \n9\n \n31\n \n320\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(1) North McElroy Unit Acquisition\nOn June 10, 2024, we completed the acquisition of AVAD Energy Partners’ interest in North McElroy Unit, which is an existing waterflood located in Crane County, Texas for a purchase price of $\n61\n million.  The acquired long-term liabilities consist of asset retirement obligations.  The acquired assets are included in our CO\n2\n business segment.\n86\n(2) STX Midstream Pipeline System (STX Midstream) Acquisition\nOn December 28, 2023, we completed the acquisition of STX Midstream from NextEra Energy Partners for a purchase price of $\n1,829\n million, including purchase price adjustments for working capital.  Other long-term assets includes $\n357\n million related to customer relationships with weighted average amortization period of \n15\n years and $\n192\n million related to a \n50\n% equity investment interest in Dos Caminos, LLC.  The acquisition included a \n90\n% interest in NET Mexico Pipeline LLC.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company identified an adjustment of $\n38\n million to the calculation of noncontrolling interest in addition to measurement period adjustments of $\n10\n million, resulting in a net $\n28\n million decrease to goodwill.  The goodwill consists primarily of synergies expected from the business combination and $\n124\n million of the goodwill recorded is expected to be tax deductible.  The acquired assets are included in our Natural Gas business segment.\nThe determination of fair value utilized valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows for the customer relationships intangible assets and the equity method investment and the replacement cost approach for the property, plant and equipment.  The significant assumptions made in performing these valuations include the discount rate utilized to value the customer relationships intangible assets and equity method investment and replacement costs used to value property, plant and equipment.\n(3) Diamond M Acquisition\nOn June 1, 2023, we completed the acquisition of the Diamond M Field from Parallel Petroleum LLC for a purchase price of $\n13\n million, including purchase price adjustments for working capital.  During the year ended December 31, 2024, we acquired an additional working interest from Collins Permian LP for a purchase price of $\n3\n million, net of an immaterial asset retirement obligation assumed.  These acquired assets, which are adjacent to our SACROC field, are included in our CO2 business segment.\n(4) North American Natural Resources Acquisition\nOn August 11, 2022, we completed the acquisition of \nseven\n landfill assets with the purchase of North American Natural Resources, Inc. and, its sister companies, North American Biofuels, LLC and North American-Central, LLC (NANR) consisting of GTE facilities in Michigan and Kentucky for $\n132\n million, including purchase price adjustments for working capital.  Other long-term assets within the purchase price allocation consists of intangibles related to gas rights and customer contracts with a weighted average amortization period of approximately \n13\n years.  The goodwill associated with this acquisition is tax deductible.  The acquired assets align with our strategy to invest in low-carbon energy and are included as part of our Energy Transition Ventures group within our CO\n2\n business segment.  During November 2023, the seller exercised its option to repurchase one of the landfill assets for an insignificant amount.\n(5) Mas Ranger Acquisition\nOn July 19, 2022, we completed an acquisition of \nthree\n landfill assets with the purchase of Mas Ranger, LLC and its subsidiaries from Mas CanAm, LLC, comprising an RNG facility in Arlington, Texas and medium Btu facilities in Shreveport, Louisiana and Victoria, Texas for $\n358\n million including purchase price adjustments for working capital.  Other long-term assets within the purchase price allocation reflects an intangible related to a customer contract with an amortization period of approximately \n17\n years.  The acquired assets align with our strategy to invest in low-carbon energy and are included as part of our Energy Transition Ventures group within our CO\n2\n business segment.\nPro Forma Information\nPro forma consolidated income statement information that gives effect to the above acquisitions as if they had occurred as of January 1 of each year preceding each transaction is not presented because it would not be materially different from the information presented in our accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nSubsequent Event\nOn January 13, 2025, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to purchase a natural gas gathering and processing system in North Dakota from Outrigger Energy II LLC for a cash payment of $\n640\n million.  The acquisition includes a \n0.27\n Bcf/d processing facility and a \n104\n-mile, large-diameter, high-pressure rich gas gathering header pipeline with \n0.35\n Bcf/d of capacity connecting supplies from the Williston Basin area to high-demand markets.  Subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval, this transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2025.\n87\nDivestitures\nCO\n2\n Divestiture\nIn June 2024, we divested our interests in the Katz Unit, Goldsmith Landreth San Andres Unit, Tall Cotton Field and Reinecke Unit, along with certain shallow interests in the Diamond M Field, all located in the Permian Basin, and received a leasehold interest in an undeveloped leasehold directly adjacent to the SACROC Unit.  In addition to the leasehold interest, we received $\n18\n million of cash proceeds from this divestiture, net of working capital adjustments, which is reported as an investing activity within “Other, net” on our accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows, and recorded a gain of $\n40\n million, which is reported within “Other income, net” on our accompanying consolidated statement of income and includes the effect of a $\n33\n million reduction in our asset retirement obligations that were transferred to the buyer.  The assets were included in our CO\n2\n business segment.\nSale of Interest in ELC\nOn September 26, 2022, we completed the sale of a \n25.5\n% ownership interest in ELC.  We received net proceeds of $\n557\n million which were used to reduce short-term borrowings.  As we continue to have a controlling financial interest in ELC, we recorded an increase of $\n190\n million to “Additional paid in capital” for the impact of the change in our ownership interest in ELC, which is reflected on our accompanying consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2022.  We continue to own a \n25.5\n% interest in and operate ELC.\nWe continue to consolidate ELC.  We have determined that ELC is a variable interest entity and Southern Liquefaction Company, LLC (SLC), which is indirectly controlled by us, is the primary beneficiary because it has the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact ELC’s economic performance and the right to receive benefits and the obligation to absorb losses.  In addition to being the operator of ELC, the evaluation of ELC as a variable interest entity and SLC as the primary beneficiary included consideration of the following:  (i) a liquefaction service agreement between ELC and its customer was designed for recovery by ELC of actual costs for operating and maintaining ELC’s facilities, which reduces the risk for all equity owners to absorb losses resulting from cost variability; and (ii) substantially all ELC’s activities involve KMI subsidiaries under common control that provide services for and benefit from the operations of ELC.\nThe following table shows the carrying amount and classification of ELC’s assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets: \nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nAssets\nCurrent assets\n$\n47\n \n$\n46\n \nProperty, plant and equipment, net \n1,129\n \n1,162\n \nDeferred charges and other assets\n6\n \n5\n \nLiabilities\nCurrent liabilities\n$\n18\n \n$\n15\n \nOther long-term liabilities and deferred credits\n49\n \n25\n \nWe receive distributions from ELC, indirectly, through our interest in SLC, but otherwise, the assets of ELC cannot be used to settle our obligations.  ELC’s creditors have no recourse against our general credit and the obligations of ELC may only be settled using the assets of ELC.  ELC does not guarantee our debt or other similar commitments.\n88\n4. \nIncome Taxes\nThe components of “Income Before Income Taxes” are as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nU.S.\n$\n3,402\n \n$\n3,192\n \n$\n3,318\n \nForeign\n5\n \n9\n \n17\n \nTotal Income Before Income Taxes\n$\n3,407\n \n$\n3,201\n \n$\n3,335\n \nComponents of the income tax provision applicable for federal, foreign and state taxes are as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nCurrent tax expense\n \n \n \nFederal\n$\n11\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nState\n26\n \n5\n \n14\n \nForeign\n3\n \n—\n \n4\n \nTotal\n40\n \n5\n \n18\n \nDeferred tax expense \n \n \n \nFederal\n602\n \n619\n \n642\n \nState\n45\n \n91\n \n50\n \nTotal\n647\n \n710\n \n692\n \nTotal tax provision\n$\n687\n \n$\n715\n \n$\n710\n \nThe difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and our effective income tax rate is summarized as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions, except percentages)\nFederal income tax\n$\n716\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n672\n \n21.0\n \n%\n$\n700\n \n21.0\n \n%\nIncrease (decrease) as a result of:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nState income tax, net of federal benefit\n71\n \n2.1\n \n%\n64\n \n2.0\n \n%\n69\n \n2.0\n \n%\nDividend received deduction\n(\n34\n)\n(\n1.0\n)\n%\n(\n34\n)\n(\n1.1\n)\n%\n(\n36\n)\n(\n1.1\n)\n%\nGeneral business credit(a)\n(\n42\n)\n(\n1.2\n)\n%\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n—\n \n%\nOther\n(\n24\n)\n(\n0.7\n)\n%\n14\n \n0.4\n \n%\n(\n23\n)\n(\n0.7\n)\n%\nTotal\n$\n687\n \n20.2\n \n%\n$\n715\n \n22.3\n \n%\n$\n710\n \n21.2\n \n%\n(a)\nRecognition of investment tax credits generated by biogas projects.\n89\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities result from the following:\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nDeferred tax assets\n \n \nEmployee benefits\n$\n81\n \n$\n114\n \nNet operating loss carryforwards\n1,416\n \n2,024\n \nTax credit carryforwards\n312\n \n300\n \nInterest expense limitation\n372\n \n266\n \nOther\n179\n \n181\n \nValuation allowances\n(\n64\n)\n(\n77\n)\nTotal deferred tax assets\n2,296\n \n2,808\n \nDeferred tax liabilities\nProperty, plant and equipment\n217\n \n215\n \nInvestments(a)\n4,124\n \n3,951\n \nOther\n25\n \n30\n \nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n4,366\n \n4,196\n \nNet deferred tax liability\n$\n(\n2,070\n)\n$\n(\n1,388\n)\n(a)\nAmounts as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 are primarily associated with KMI’s investment in KMP.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances\nA reconciliation of our valuation allowances for the year ended December 31, 2024 is as follows:\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\n(In millions)\nBalance at beginning of period\n$\n77\n \nAddition for state NOL\n4\n \nState rate changes\n(\n10\n)\nCurrency fluctuation\n(\n7\n)\nBalance at end of period\n$\n64\n \nThe following table provides details related to our deferred tax assets and valuation allowances as of December 31, 2024:\nUnused Amount\nDeferred Tax Asset\nValuation Allowance\nExpiration Period\n(In millions)\nNet Operating Loss\nU.S. federal net operating loss\n$\n5,707\n \n$\n1,198\n \n$\n—\n \nIndefinite\nState losses\n4,560\n \n194\n \n(\n40\n)\n2024 - 2044\nForeign losses\n70\n \n24\n \n(\n24\n)\nIndefinite\nTax Credits\nGeneral business credits\n312\n \n312\n \n—\n \n2036 - 2044\nUse of a portion of our U.S. federal carryforwards is subject to the limitations provided under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code as well as the separate return limitation rules of Internal Revenue Service regulations.

We did not identify any triggers requiring further impairment analysis during the remainder of the year.\nThe fair value estimates used in our goodwill impairment test include Level 3 inputs of the fair value hierarchy.  For all reporting units other than the Energy Transition Ventures reporting unit within our CO\n2\n business segment, we estimated fair value based on a market approach utilizing forecasted earnings before interest, income taxes, DD&A expenses, including amortization of excess cost of equity investments, (EBITDA) and the enterprise value to estimated EBITDA multiples of comparable companies for each of our reporting units.  The value of each reporting unit was determined from the perspective of a market participant in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  For the Energy Transition Ventures reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $\n114\n million as of December 31, 2024, we estimated fair value based on an income approach, which includes assumptions regarding future cash flows based primarily on production growth assumptions, terminal values and discount rates.\nChanges to any one or a combination of these factors would result in a change to the reporting unit fair values, which could lead to future impairment charges.  Such potential non-cash impairments could have a significant effect on our results of operations.\n8.  Debt\nThe following table provides detail on the principal amount of our outstanding debt balances:\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nCredit facility and commercial paper borrowings(a)\n$\n331\n \n$\n1,989\n \nCorporate senior notes(b)\n4.15\n%, due February 2024\n—\n \n650\n \n4.30\n%, due May 2024\n—\n \n600\n \n4.25\n%, due September 2024\n—\n \n650\n \n4.30\n%, due June 2025\n1,500\n \n1,500\n \n1.75\n%, due November 2026\n500\n \n500\n \n6.70\n%, due February 2027\n7\n \n7\n \n2.25\n%, due March 2027(c)\n518\n \n552\n \n6.67\n%, due November 2027 \n7\n \n7\n \n94\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n4.30\n%, due March 2028\n1,250\n \n1,250\n \n7.25\n%, due March 2028 \n32\n \n32\n \n6.95\n%, due June 2028\n31\n \n31\n \n5.00\n%, due February 2029\n1,250\n \n—\n \n5.10\n% due August 2029\n500\n \n—\n \n8.05\n%, due October 2030\n234\n \n234\n \n2.00\n%, due February 2031\n750\n \n750\n \n7.40\n%, due March 2031 \n300\n \n300\n \n7.80\n%, due August 2031\n537\n \n537\n \n7.75\n%, due January 2032\n1,005\n \n1,005\n \n7.75\n%, due March 2032 \n300\n \n300\n \n4.80\n%, due February 2033\n750\n \n750\n \n5.20\n%, due June 2033\n1,500\n \n1,500\n \n7.30\n%, due August 2033 \n500\n \n500\n \n5.40\n%, due February 2034\n1,000\n \n—\n \n5.30\n%, due December 2034\n750\n \n750\n \n5.80\n%, due March 2035 \n500\n \n500\n \n7.75\n%, due October 2035\n1\n \n1\n \n6.40\n%, due January 2036 \n36\n \n36\n \n6.50\n%, due February 2037 \n400\n \n400\n \n7.42\n%, due February 2037\n47\n \n47\n \n6.95\n%, due January 2038 \n1,175\n \n1,175\n \n6.50\n%, due September 2039 \n600\n \n600\n \n6.55\n%, due September 2040 \n400\n \n400\n \n7.50\n%, due November 2040\n375\n \n375\n \n6.375\n%, due March 2041 \n600\n \n600\n \n5.625\n%, due September 2041 \n375\n \n375\n \n5.00\n%, due August 2042\n625\n \n625\n \n4.70\n%, due November 2042\n475\n \n475\n \n5.00\n%, due March 2043\n700\n \n700\n \n5.50\n%, due March 2044\n750\n \n750\n \n5.40\n%, due September 2044 \n550\n \n550\n \n5.55\n%, due June 2045\n1,750\n \n1,750\n \n5.05\n%, due February 2046\n800\n \n800\n \n5.20\n%, due March 2048\n750\n \n750\n \n3.25\n%, due August 2050\n500\n \n500\n \n3.60\n%, due February 2051\n1,050\n \n1,050\n \n5.45\n%, due August 2052\n750\n \n750\n \n5.95\n% due August 2054\n750\n \n—\n \n7.45\n%, due March 2098 \n26\n \n26\n \nTGP senior notes(b)\n7.00\n%, due March 2027\n300\n \n300\n \n7.00\n%, due October 2028\n400\n \n400\n \n2.90\n%, due March 2030\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \n8.375\n%, due June 2032\n240\n \n240\n \n7.625\n%, due April 2037\n300\n \n300\n \nEPNG senior notes(b)\n7.50\n%, due November 2026\n200\n \n200\n \n3.50\n%, due February 2032\n300\n \n300\n \n8.375\n%, due June 2032\n300\n \n300\n \nCIG senior notes(b)\n4.15\n%, due August 2026\n375\n \n375\n \n6.85\n%, due June 2037\n100\n \n100\n \nEPC Building, LLC, promissory note, \n3.967\n%, due January 2023 through December 2035\n310\n \n330\n \nTrust I Preferred Securities, \n4.75\n%, due March 2028(d)\n221\n \n221\n \nOther miscellaneous debt(e)\n205\n \n234\n \nTotal debt – KMI and Subsidiaries\n31,788\n \n31,929\n \nLess: Current portion of debt\n2,009\n \n4,049\n \nTotal long-term debt – KMI and Subsidiaries(f)\n$\n29,779\n \n$\n27,880\n \n95\n(a)\nWeighted average interest rates on borrowings at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were \n4.60\n% and \n5.68\n%, respectively.\n(b)\nNotes provide for the redemption at any time at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest to the redemption date plus a make whole premium and are subject to a number of restrictions and covenants.

Trust I exists for the sole purpose of issuing preferred securities and investing the proceeds in \n4.75\n% convertible subordinated debentures, which are due 2028.  Trust I’s sole source of income is interest earned on these debentures.  This interest income is used to pay distributions on the preferred securities.  We provide a full and unconditional guarantee of the Trust I Preferred Securities.  There are no significant restrictions from these securities on our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries by distribution, dividend or loan.  The Trust I Preferred Securities are non-voting (except in limited circumstances), pay quarterly distributions at an annual rate of \n4.75\n% and carry a liquidation value of $\n50\n per security plus accrued and unpaid distributions.  The Trust I Preferred Securities outstanding as of December 31, 2024 are convertible at any time prior to the close of business on March 31, 2028, at the option of the holder, into the following mixed consideration: (i) \n0.7197\n of a share of our Class P common stock; and (ii) $\n25.18\n in cash without interest.

Standby fees for the unused portion of the credit facility will be calculated at a rate ranging from \n0.100\n% to \n0.250\n%.\n \nOur credit facility contains financial and various other covenants that apply to us and our subsidiaries and are common in such agreements, including a maximum ratio of Consolidated Net Indebtedness to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit facility, as amended) of \n5.50\n to 1.00, for any four-fiscal-quarter period.  Other negative covenants include restrictions on our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt, grant liens, make fundamental changes or engage in certain transactions with affiliates, or in the case of certain material subsidiaries, permit restrictions on dividends, distributions or making or prepayments of loans to us or any guarantor.  Our credit facility also restricts our ability to make certain restricted payments if an event of default (as defined in the credit facility) has occurred and is continuing or would occur and be continuing.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had \nno\n borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, $\n331\n million borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program and $\n57\n million in letters of credit.

We contribute \n5\n% of eligible compensation for most of the plan participants.  Certain collectively bargained participants receive Company contributions in accordance with collective bargaining agreements.  A participant becomes fully vested in Company contributions after \ntwo years\n and may take a distribution upon termination of employment or retirement.  The total cost for our savings plan was approximately $\n56\n million, $\n53\n million and $\n51\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nPension Plans\nOur pension plans are defined benefit plans that cover substantially all of our U.S. employees and provide benefits under a cash balance formula.  A participant in the cash balance formula accrues benefits through contribution credits based on a combination of age and years of service, multiplied by eligible compensation.  Interest is also credited to the participant’s plan account.  A participant becomes fully vested in the plan after \nthree years\n and may take a lump sum or annuity distribution upon termination of employment or retirement.  Certain collectively bargained and grandfathered employees accrue benefits through career pay or final pay formulas.\nIn 2023, we settled approximately $\n179\n million of the retiree benefit obligation for our pension plans through an annuity purchase.  The impact of the annuity purchase is reflected in the December 31, 2023 benefit obligation for our pension plans.\n99\nOPEB Plans\nWe and certain of our subsidiaries provide OPEB benefits, including medical benefits for closed groups of retired employees and certain grandfathered employees and their dependents, and limited postretirement life insurance benefits for retired employees.

The 2024 net actuarial loss for the OPEB plans was primarily due to changes in the claims cost and trend assumptions.  The 2023 net actuarial loss for the pension plans was primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average discount rate used to determine the benefit obligation as of December 31, 2023.  The 2023 net actuarial gain for the OPEB plans was primarily due to changes in the claims cost assumptions.\nPlan Assets.  \nThe investment policies and strategies are established by our plan’s fiduciary committee for the assets of each of the pension and OPEB plans, which are responsible for investment decisions and management oversight of the plans. The stated philosophy of the fiduciary committee is to manage these assets in a manner consistent with the purpose for which the plans were established and the time frame over which the plans’ obligations need to be met.  The objectives of the investment management program are to (i) meet or exceed plan actuarial earnings assumptions over the long term and (ii) provide a reasonable return on assets within established risk tolerance guidelines and to maintain the liquidity needs of the plans with the goal of paying benefit and expense obligations when due.  In seeking to meet these objectives, the fiduciary committee recognizes that prudent investing requires taking reasonable risks in order to raise the likelihood of achieving the targeted investment returns.  In order to reduce portfolio risk and volatility, the fiduciary committee has adopted a strategy of using multiple asset classes.\nThe allowable range for asset allocations in effect for our plans as of December 31, 2024, by asset category, are as follows:\nPension Benefits\nOPEB\nCash\n0\n% to \n23\n%\nEquities\n42\n% to \n52\n%\n43\n% to \n71\n%\nFixed income securities\n37\n% to \n47\n%\n26\n% to \n50\n%\nReal estate\n2\n% to \n12\n%\nCompany securities (KMI Class P common stock and/or debt securities)\n0\n% to \n10\n%\nBelow are the details of our pension and OPEB plan assets by class and a description of the valuation methodologies used for assets measured at fair value.\n•\nLevel 1 assets’ fair values are based on quoted market prices for the instruments in actively traded markets.  Included in this level are cash, equities and exchange traded mutual funds.  These investments are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded.\n•\nLevel 2 assets’ fair values are primarily based on pricing data representative of quoted prices for similar assets in active markets (or identical assets in less active markets).  Included in this level are short-term investment funds, fixed income securities and derivatives.  Short-term investment funds are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.  The fixed income securities’ fair values are primarily based on an evaluated price which is based on a compilation of primarily observable market information or a broker quote in a non-active market.  Derivatives are exchange-traded through clearinghouses and are valued based on these prices.\n•\nPlan assets with fair values that are based on the net asset value per share, or its equivalent (NAV), as a practical expedient to measure fair value, as reported by the issuers are determined based on the fair value of the underlying securities as of the valuation date and include common/collective trust funds, private investment funds, real estate, limited partnerships and short-term investment funds.  The plan assets measured at NAV are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy described above but are separately identified in the following tables.\n101\nListed below are the fair values of our pension and OPEB plans’ assets that are recorded at fair value by class and categorized by fair value measurement used at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nPension Assets\n2024\n2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nTotal\n(In millions)\nMeasured within fair value hierarchy\nShort-term investment funds\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n32\n \n$\n32\n \nEquities(a)\n203\n \n—\n \n203\n \n143\n \n—\n \n143\n \nFixed income securities\n—\n \n380\n \n380\n \n—\n \n410\n \n410\n \nSubtotal\n$\n203\n \n$\n380\n \n583\n \n$\n143\n \n$\n442\n \n585\n \nMeasured at NAV\nCommon/collective trusts(b)\n1,002\n \n976\n \nPrivate limited partnerships(c)\n—\n \n1\n \nShort-term investment funds\n29\n \n—\n \nSubtotal\n1,031\n \n977\n \nTotal plan assets fair value\n$\n1,614\n \n$\n1,562\n \n(a)\nPlan assets include $\n167\n and $\n107\n of KMI Class P common stock for 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n(b)\nCommon/collective trust funds were invested in approximately \n66\n% equities, \n22\n% fixed income securities and \n12\n% real estate in 2024 and \n64\n% equities, \n23\n% fixed income securities and \n13\n% real estate in 2023.\n(c)\nIncludes assets invested in real estate, venture and buyout funds.\nOPEB Assets\n2024\n2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nTotal\n(In millions)\nMeasured within fair value hierarchy\nShort-term investment funds\n$\n—\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n5\n \nMeasured at NAV\nCommon/collective trusts(a)\n328\n \n318\n \nTotal plan assets fair value\n$\n331\n \n$\n323\n \n(a)\nCommon/collective trust funds were invested in approximately \n62\n% equities and \n38\n% fixed income securities for both 2024 and 2023.\nEmployer Contributions and Expected Payment of Future Benefits\n.

Benefit obligations and net benefit cost are based on actuarial estimates and assumptions.  The following table details the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used in determining our benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and net benefit costs of our pension and OPEB plans for 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nPension Benefits\nOPEB\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nAssumptions related to benefit obligations:\nDiscount rate\n5.58\n \n%\n5.13\n \n%\n5.44\n \n%\n5.08\n \n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.50\n \n%\n3.50\n \n%\nn/a\nn/a\nInterest crediting rate\n3.78\n \n%\n3.85\n \n%\nn/a\nn/a\nPension Benefits\nOPEB\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nAssumptions related to benefit costs:\nDiscount rate\n5.13\n \n%\n5.41\n \n%\n2.74\n \n%\n5.08\n \n%\n5.38\n \n%\n2.56\n \n%\nExpected return on plan assets\n7.00\n \n%\n7.00\n \n%\n6.50\n \n%\n6.00\n \n%\n6.00\n \n%\n5.75\n \n%\nRate of compensation increase\n3.50\n \n%\n3.50\n \n%\n3.50\n \n%\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nInterest crediting rate\n3.85\n \n%\n3.50\n \n%\n3.01\n \n%\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nWe utilize a full yield curve approach in estimating the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost (credit) for our retirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows.  The expected long-term rates of return on plan assets were determined by combining a review of the historical returns realized within the portfolio, the investment strategy included in the plans’ investment policy, and capital market projections for the asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the target weightings of each asset class.  The expected return on plan assets listed in the table above is a pre-tax rate of return based on our targeted portfolio of investments.  For the OPEB assets subject to unrelated business income taxes, we utilize an after-tax expected return on plan assets to determine our benefit costs.\nActuarial estimates for our OPEB plans assume an annual increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits.  The initial annual rate of increase is \n8.03\n% which gradually decreases to \n4.00\n% by the year 2050.\n103\nComponents of Net Benefit Cost and Other Amounts Recognized in Other Comprehensive Income. \n For each of the years ended December 31, the components of net benefit cost and other amounts recognized in pre-tax other comprehensive income related to our pension and OPEB plans are as follows:\nPension Benefits\nOPEB\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nComponents of net benefit cost (credit):\nService cost\n$\n52\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n55\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n1\n \nInterest cost\n91\n \n107\n \n57\n \n8\n \n10\n \n5\n \nExpected return on assets\n(\n106\n)\n(\n117\n)\n(\n142\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n13\n)\n(\n17\n)\nAmortization of prior service cost (credit)\n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nAmortization of net actuarial loss (gain)\n22\n \n35\n \n29\n \n(\n17\n)\n(\n16\n)\n(\n18\n)\nSettlement loss\n—\n \n46\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nNet benefit cost (credit)\n59\n \n127\n \n—\n \n(\n25\n)\n(\n21\n)\n(\n32\n)\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in OCI:\nNet (gain) loss arising during period\n(\n132\n)\n10\n \n(\n11\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n30\n)\n24\n \nAmortization or settlement recognition of net actuarial (loss) gain\n(\n22\n)\n(\n81\n)\n(\n29\n)\n16\n \n16\n \n17\n \nAmortization of prior service (cost) credit\n—\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n1\n \n1\n \n2\n \nTotal recognized in OCI(a)\n(\n154\n)\n(\n72\n)\n(\n41\n)\n11\n \n(\n13\n)\n43\n \nTotal recognized in net benefit cost (credit) and OCI\n$\n(\n95\n)\n$\n55\n \n$\n(\n41\n)\n$\n(\n14\n)\n$\n(\n34\n)\n$\n11\n \n(a)\nExcludes $\n1\n million and $\n4\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2022, respectively, associated with other plans.\n10. \nStockholders’ Equity\nClass P Common Stock\nWe have a board-approved share buy-back program that authorizes share repurchases of up to $\n3\n billion that began in December 2017.  All shares we have repurchased are canceled and are no longer outstanding.

During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 we did not issue any shares under this agreement.\n \n104\nDividends\nThe following table provides information about our per share dividends: \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPer share cash dividend declared for the period\n$\n1.15\n \n$\n1.13\n \n$\n1.11\n \nPer share cash dividend paid in the period\n1.1450\n \n1.1250\n \n1.1025\n \nOn January 22, 2025, our Board declared a cash dividend of $\n0.2875\n per share for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2024, which is payable on February 18, 2025 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 3, 2025. \nAdoption of Accounting Pronouncement\nOn January 1, 2022, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2020-06, “\nDebt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity.\n”  This ASU (i) simplifies an issuer’s accounting for convertible instruments by eliminating two of the three models in Subtopic 470-20 that require separate accounting for embedded conversion features, (ii) amends diluted earnings per share calculations for convertible instruments by requiring the use of the if-converted method and (iii) simplifies the settlement assessment entities are required to perform on contracts that can potentially settle in an entity’s own equity by removing certain requirements.  Using the modified retrospective method, the adoption of this ASU resulted in a pre-tax adjustment of $\n14\n million to unwind the remaining unamortized debt discount within “Debt fair value adjustments” on our consolidated balance sheet and an adjustment of $\n11\n million to unwind the balance of the conversion feature classified in “Additional paid in capital” on our consolidated statement of stockholders’ equity for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nChanges in the components of our “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” not including noncontrolling interests are summarized as follows:\n \nNet unrealized\ngains/(losses)\non cash flow\nhedge derivatives\nPension and\nother\npostretirement\nliability adjustments\nTotal\nAccumulated other\ncomprehensive\nloss\n(In millions)\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n$\n(\n172\n)\n$\n(\n239\n)\n$\n(\n411\n)\nOther comprehensive (loss) gain before reclassifications \n(\n312\n)\n1\n \n(\n311\n)\nLosses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n320\n \n—\n \n320\n \nNet current-period change in accumulated other comprehensive loss\n8\n \n1\n \n9\n \nBalance at December 31, 2022\n(\n164\n)\n(\n238\n)\n(\n402\n)\nOther comprehensive gain before reclassifications \n155\n \n65\n \n220\n \nGains reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n(\n35\n)\n—\n \n(\n35\n)\nNet current-period change in accumulated other comprehensive loss\n120\n \n65\n \n185\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n(\n44\n)\n(\n173\n)\n(\n217\n)\nOther comprehensive (loss) gain before reclassifications \n(\n29\n)\n111\n \n82\n \nLosses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss\n40\n \n—\n \n40\n \nNet current-period change in accumulated other comprehensive loss\n11\n \n111\n \n122\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n(\n33\n)\n$\n(\n62\n)\n$\n(\n95\n)\n105\n11.  Related Party Transactions\nAffiliate Balances and Activities\nIn the course of our normal operations, we provide services to and obtain services from affiliates which consist of (i) unconsolidated affiliates in which we hold an investment accounted for under the equity method of accounting (see Note 6 for additional information related to these investments); and (ii) external partners of our joint ventures we consolidate.\nThe following tables summarize our affiliate balance sheet balances and income statement activity, other than amounts reported within our “Investments” balances and “Earnings from equity investments” activity:\nDecember 31,\n2024\n2023\n(In millions)\nBalance sheet location\nAccounts receivable\n$\n48\n \n$\n45\n \nOther current assets\n1\n \n2\n \n$\n49\n \n$\n47\n \nCurrent portion of debt\n$\n5\n \n$\n5\n \nAccounts payable\n21\n \n16\n \nOther current liabilities\n8\n \n3\n \nLong-term debt\n132\n \n137\n \nOther long-term liabilities and deferred credits\n60\n \n54\n \n$\n226\n \n$\n215\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(In millions)\nIncome statement location\nRevenues\n$\n346\n \n$\n172\n \n$\n172\n \nOperating Costs, Expenses and Other\nCosts of sales\n$\n145\n \n$\n132\n \n$\n134\n \nOther operating expenses\n69\n \n57\n \n50\n \n12.  Commitments and Contingent Liabilities\n \nRights-Of-Way\nOur rights-of-way obligations primarily consist of non-lease agreements that existed at the time of Topic 842\n, Leases, \nadoption, at which time we elected a practical expedient which allowed us to continue our historical treatment.  Our future minimum rental commitments related to our rights-of-way obligations were $\n66\n million as of December 31, 2024. \nContingent Debt\nOur contingent debt disclosures pertain to certain types of guarantees or indemnifications we have made and cover certain types of guarantees included within debt agreements, even if the likelihood of requiring our performance under such guarantee is remote.  \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our contingent debt obligations totaled $\n149\n million and $\n154\n million, respectively.  These amounts represent our proportional share of the debt obligations of \none\n equity investee, Cortez Pipeline Company (Cortez).  Under such guarantees we are severally liable for our percentage ownership share of Cortez’s debt in the event of its non-performance. The contingent debt obligations balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 each included $\n120\n million for \n100\n% guaranteed debt obligations for a subsidiary of Cortez. \n106\nGuarantees and Indemnifications \nWe are involved in joint ventures and other ownership arrangements that sometimes require financial and performance guarantees.  In a financial guarantee, we are obligated to make payments if the guaranteed party fails to make payments under, or violates the terms of, the financial arrangement.  In a performance guarantee, we provide assurance that the guaranteed party will execute on the terms of the contract.  If they do not, we are required to perform on their behalf.  We also periodically provide indemnification arrangements related to assets or businesses we have sold.  These arrangements include, but are not limited to, indemnifications for income taxes, the resolution of existing disputes and environmental matters. \nWhile many of these agreements may specify a maximum potential exposure, or a specified duration to the indemnification obligation, there are also circumstances where the amount and duration are unlimited.  Other than with our rights-of-way obligations and contingent debt described above, we are currently not subject to any material requirements to perform under quantifiable arrangements. We are unable to estimate a maximum exposure for our other guarantee and indemnification agreements that do not provide for limits on the amount of future payments due to the uncertainty of these exposures. \nSee Note 17 for a description of matters that we have identified as contingencies requiring accrual of liabilities and/or disclosure, including any such matters arising under guarantee or indemnification agreements.\n13.  Risk Management \nCertain of our business activities expose us to risks associated with unfavorable changes in the market price of natural gas, NGL and crude oil.  We also have exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk as a result of the issuance of our debt obligations.  Pursuant to our management’s approved risk management policy, we use derivative contracts to hedge or reduce our exposure to some of these risks.\nEnergy Commodity Price Risk Management\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had the following outstanding commodity forward contracts to hedge our forecasted energy commodity purchases and sales: \n \nNet open position long/(short)\nDerivatives designated as hedging contracts\n \n \nCrude oil fixed price\n(\n16.8\n)\nMMBbl\nNatural gas

Management\nWe utilize interest rate derivatives to hedge our exposure to both changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments and variability in expected future cash flows attributable to variable interest rate payments. \nThe following table summarizes our outstanding interest rate contracts as of December 31, 2024:\nNotional amount\nAccounting treatment\nMaximum term\n(In

As of December 31, 2024, we had cash margins of $\n104\n million posted by us with our counterparties as collateral and reported within “Restricted deposits” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheet.  As of December 31, 2023, we had cash margins of $\n63\n million posted by our counterparties with us as collateral and reported within “Other current liabilities” on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The cash margin balance at December 31, 2024 represents the initial margin requirements of $\n52\n million, and variation margin requirements of $\n52\n million.  We also use industry standard commercial agreements that allow for the netting of exposures associated with transactions executed under a single commercial agreement.  Additionally, we generally utilize master netting agreements to offset credit exposure across multiple commercial agreements with a single counterparty.\nWe also have agreements with certain counterparties to our derivative contracts that contain provisions requiring the posting of additional collateral upon a decrease in our credit rating.  As of December 31, 2024, based on our current mark-to- market positions and posted collateral, we estimate that if our credit rating were downgraded one notch, we would not be required to post additional collateral. If we were downgraded two notches, we estimate that we would be required to post $\n25\n million of additional collateral.\n111\n14.  Revenue Recognition\nNature of Revenue by Segment\nNatural Gas Pipelines Segment\nWe provide various types of natural gas transportation and storage services, natural gas and NGL sales contracts, and various types of gathering and processing services for producers, including receiving, compressing, transporting and re-delivering quantities of natural gas and/or NGL made available to us by producers to a specified delivery location.\nNatural Gas Transportation and Storage Contracts\nThe natural gas we receive under our transportation and storage contracts remains under the control of our customers.  Under firm service contracts, the customer generally pays a two-part transaction price that includes (i) a fixed take-or-pay reservation fee and (ii) a fee-based per-unit rate for quantities of natural gas actually transported or injected into/withdrawn from storage.  Under non-firm service contracts, generally described as interruptible service, the customer pays a transaction price on a fee-based per-unit rate for the quantities actually transported or injected into/withdrawn from storage.\nNatural Gas and NGL Sales Contracts\nOur sales and purchases of natural gas and NGL are primarily accounted for on a gross basis as natural gas sales or product sales, as applicable, and cost of sales.  These customer contracts generally provide for the customer to nominate a specified quantity of commodity products to be delivered and sold to the customers at specified delivery points.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a market indexed per-unit rate for the quantities sold.\nGathering and Processing Contracts\nWe provide various types of gathering and processing services for producers, including receiving, processing, compressing, transporting and re-delivering quantities of natural gas made available to us by producers to a specified delivery location.  This integrated service can be firm if subject to a minimum volume commitment or acreage dedication or non-firm when offered on an as requested, non-guaranteed basis.  In our gathering contracts we generally promise to provide the contracted integrated services each day over the life of the contract.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a per-unit rate for the quantities actually gathered and/or processed, including amounts attributable to deficiency quantities associated with minimum volume contracts.\nProducts Pipelines Segment\nWe provide crude oil and refined petroleum transportation and storage services on a firm or non-firm basis.  For our firm transportation service, the customer is obligated to pay for its minimum volume commitment amount, regardless of whether or not it flows volumes into our pipeline.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a per-unit rate for quantities transported, including amounts attributable to deficiency quantities.  Our firm storage service generally includes a fixed take-or-pay monthly reservation fee for the portion of storage capacity reserved by the customer and a per-unit rate for actual quantities injected into/withdrawn from storage.  Under the non-firm transportation and storage service the customer typically pays a per-unit rate for actual quantities of product injected into/withdrawn from storage and/or transported.\nWe sell transmix, crude oil or other commodity products.  The customer’s contracts generally include a specified quantity of commodity products to be delivered and sold to the customers at specified delivery points.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a market indexed per-unit rate for the quantities sold.\nTerminals Segment\nWe provide various types of liquid tank and bulk terminal services.  These services are generally comprised of inbound, storage and outbound handling of customer products.\nLiquids Tank Services\nFirm Storage and Handling Contracts:  We have liquids tank storage and handling service contracts that include a promised tank storage capacity provision and prepaid volume throughput of the stored product.  In these contracts, the customers have fixed take-or-pay monthly obligation which generally include a per-unit rate for any quantities we handle at the request of the \n112\ncustomer in excess of the prepaid volume throughput amount and also typically include per-unit rates for additional, ancillary services that may be periodically requested by the customer.\nFirm Handling Contracts:  For our firm handling service contracts, we typically promise to handle on a stand-ready basis throughput volumes up to the customer’s minimum volume commitment amount.  The customer is obligated to pay for its minimum volume commitment amount, regardless of whether or not it used the handling service.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a per-unit rate for volumes handled, including amounts attributable to deficiency quantities.\nBulk Services\nOur bulk storage and handling contracts generally include inbound handling of our customers’ dry bulk material product (e.g., petcoke, metals, ores) into our storage facility and outbound handling of these products from our storage facility.  These services are provided on both a firm basis, including amounts attributable to deficiency quantities, and non-firm basis where the customer pays a transaction price typically based on a per-unit rate for quantities handled on an as requested, non-guaranteed basis.\nCO\n2\n Segment\nOur crude oil, NGL, CO\n2\n and natural gas production customer sales contracts typically include a specified quantity and quality of commodity product to be delivered and sold to the customer at a specified delivery point.  The customer pays a transaction price typically based on a market indexed per-unit rate for the quantities sold.\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe following tables present our revenues disaggregated by segment, revenue source and type of revenue for each revenue source:\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nNatural Gas Pipelines\nProducts Pipelines\nTerminals\nCO\n2\nCorporate and Eliminations\nTotal\n(In millions)\nRevenues from contracts with customers(a)\nServices\nFirm services(b)\n$\n3,893\n \n$\n220\n \n$\n846\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n4\n)\n$\n4,957\n \nFee-based services\n1,044\n \n1,059\n \n460\n \n41\n \n(\n7\n)\n2,597\n \nTotal services\n4,937\n \n1,279\n \n1,306\n \n43\n \n(\n11\n)\n7,554\n \nCommodity sales\nNatural gas sales\n2,303\n \n—\n \n—\n \n43\n \n(\n6\n)\n2,340\n \nProduct sales\n965\n \n1,444\n \n50\n \n1,031\n \n(\n4\n)\n3,486\n \nOther sales\n20\n \n—\n \n—\n \n85\n \n(\n2\n)\n103\n \nTotal commodity sales\n3,288\n \n1,444\n \n50\n \n1,159\n \n(\n12\n)\n5,929\n \nTotal revenues from contracts with customers\n8,225\n \n2,723\n \n1,356\n \n1,202\n \n(\n23\n)\n13,483\n \nOther revenues(c)\nLeasing services(d)\n459\n \n209\n \n666\n \n66\n \n—\n \n1,400\n \nDerivatives adjustments on commodity sales\n113\n \n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(\n85\n)\n—\n \n27\n \nOther\n145\n \n24\n \n—\n \n21\n \n—\n \n190\n \nTotal other revenues\n717\n \n232\n \n666\n \n2\n \n—\n \n1,617\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n8,942\n \n$\n2,955\n \n$\n2,022\n \n$\n1,204\n \n$\n(\n23\n)\n$\n15,100\n \n113\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nNatural Gas Pipelines\nProducts Pipelines\nTerminals\nCO\n2\nCorporate and Eliminations\nTotal\n(In millions)\nRevenues from contracts with customers(a)\nServices\nFirm services(b)\n$\n3,543\n \n$\n171\n \n$\n819\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n4,537\n \nFee-based services\n1,008\n \n1,036\n \n427\n \n40\n \n(\n9\n)\n2,502\n \nTotal services\n4,551\n \n1,207\n \n1,246\n \n41\n \n(\n6\n)\n7,039\n \nCommodity sales\nNatural gas sales\n2,631\n \n—\n \n—\n \n43\n \n(\n8\n)\n2,666\n \nProduct sales\n1,110\n \n1,635\n \n33\n \n1,114\n \n(\n8\n)\n3,884\n \nOther sales\n20\n \n—\n \n—\n \n42\n \n(\n4\n)\n58\n \nTotal commodity sales\n3,761\n \n1,635\n \n33\n \n1,199\n \n(\n20\n)\n6,608\n \nTotal revenues from contracts with customers\n8,312\n \n2,842\n \n1,279\n \n1,240\n \n(\n26\n)\n13,647\n \nOther revenues(c)\nLeasing services(d)\n475\n \n200\n \n638\n \n55\n \n—\n \n1,368\n \nDerivatives adjustments on commodity sales\n285\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n107\n)\n—\n \n178\n \nOther\n96\n \n24\n \n—\n \n21\n \n—\n \n141\n \nTotal other revenues\n856\n \n224\n \n638\n \n(\n31\n)\n—\n \n1,687\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n9,168\n \n$\n3,066\n \n$\n1,917\n \n$\n1,209\n \n$\n(\n26\n)\n$\n15,334\n \nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nNatural Gas Pipelines\nProducts Pipelines\nTerminals\nCO\n2\nCorporate and Eliminations\nTotal\n(In millions)\nRevenues from contracts with customers(a)\nServices\nFirm services(b)\n$\n3,547\n \n$\n207\n \n$\n763\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n4,515\n \nFee-based services\n926\n \n962\n \n426\n \n46\n \n—\n \n2,360\n \nTotal services\n4,473\n \n1,169\n \n1,189\n \n47\n \n(\n3\n)\n6,875\n \nCommodity sales\nNatural gas sales\n6,198\n \n—\n \n—\n \n82\n \n(\n20\n)\n6,260\n \nProduct sales\n1,433\n \n2,032\n \n29\n \n1,426\n \n(\n7\n)\n4,913\n \nOther sales\n68\n \n—\n \n—\n \n12\n \n—\n \n80\n \nTotal commodity sales\n7,699\n \n2,032\n \n29\n \n1,520\n \n(\n27\n)\n11,253\n \nTotal revenues from contracts with customers\n12,172\n \n3,201\n \n1,218\n \n1,567\n \n(\n30\n)\n18,128\n \nOther revenues(c)\nLeasing services(d)\n474\n \n194\n \n574\n \n60\n \n—\n \n1,302\n \nDerivatives adjustments on commodity sales\n(\n26\n)\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n(\n325\n)\n—\n \n(\n354\n)\nOther\n66\n \n26\n \n—\n \n32\n \n—\n \n124\n \nTotal other revenues\n514\n \n217\n \n574\n \n(\n233\n)\n—\n \n1,072\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n12,686\n \n$\n3,418\n \n$\n1,792\n \n$\n1,334\n \n$\n(\n30\n)\n$\n19,200\n \n(a)\nDifferences between the revenue classifications presented on the consolidated statements of income and the categories for the disaggregated revenues by type of revenue above are primarily attributable to revenues reflected in the “Other revenues” category above (see note (c)).\n(b)\nIncludes non-cancellable firm service customer contracts with take-or-pay or minimum volume commitment elements, including those contracts where both the price and quantity amount are fixed. Excludes service contracts with index-based pricing, which along with revenues from other customer service contracts are reported as “Fee-based services.”\n(c)\nAmounts recognized as revenue under guidance prescribed in Topics of the ASC other than in Topic 606 were primarily from leases and derivative contracts.  See Note 13 for additional information related to our derivative contracts.\n(d)\nOur revenues from leasing services are predominantly comprised of specific assets that we lease to customers under operating leases where one customer obtains substantially all of the economic benefit from the asset and has the right to direct the use of that asset.  These \n114\nleases primarily consist of specific tanks, treating facilities, marine vessels and gas equipment and pipelines with separate control locations.  Our revenues derived from leases were not material. \n \nWe do not lease assets that qualify as sales-type or finance leases.\nContract Balances\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our contract asset balances were $\n15\n million and $\n34\n million, respectively.  Of the contract asset balance at December 31, 2023, $\n25\n million was transferred to accounts receivable during the year ended December 31, 2024.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our contract liability balances were $\n377\n million and $\n415\n million, respectively.  Of the contract liability balance at December 31, 2023, $\n97\n million was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, we entered into an agreement with a customer to prepay certain fixed reservation charges under a long-term terminaling contract.  We received $\n843\n million in the fourth quarter of 2023 as part of this agreement.  The prepayment, which relates to contracts expiring from 2035 to 2040, was discounted to present value at a rate that is attractive relative to our cost of issuing long-term debt.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had lease contract liability balances of $\n587\n million and $\n643\n million, respectively, and contract liability balances of $\n187\n million and $\n195\n million, respectively, associated with this prepayment.\nRevenue Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nThe following table presents our estimated revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations for contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, representing our “contractually committed” revenue as of December 31, 2024 that we will invoice or transfer from contract liabilities and recognize in future periods:\nYear\nEstimated Revenue\n(In millions)\n2025\n$\n5,038\n \n2026\n4,292\n \n2027\n3,541\n \n2028\n3,088\n \n2029\n2,725\n \nThereafter\n15,956\n \nTotal\n$\n34,640\n \nOur contractually committed revenue, for purposes of the tabular presentation above, is generally limited to service or commodity sale customer contracts which have fixed pricing and fixed volume terms and conditions, generally including contracts with take-or-pay or minimum volume commitment payment obligations.  Our contractually committed revenue amounts, based on the practical expedient that we elected to apply, generally exclude remaining performance obligations for contracts with index-based pricing or variable volume attributes in which such variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation.\n15.  Reportable Segments\n \nOur reportable business segments are:\n•\nNatural Gas Pipelines—the ownership and operation of (i) major interstate and intrastate natural gas pipeline and storage systems; (ii) natural gas gathering systems and natural gas processing and treating facilities; (iii) NGL fractionation facilities and transportation systems; and (iv) LNG regasification, liquefaction and storage facilities;\n•\nProducts Pipelines—the ownership and operation of refined petroleum products, crude oil and condensate pipelines that primarily deliver, among other products, gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, crude oil and condensate to various markets, plus the ownership and/or operation of associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix facilities; \n•\nTerminals—the ownership and/or operation of (i) liquids and bulk terminal facilities located throughout the U.S. that store and handle various commodities including gasoline, diesel fuel, chemicals, metals, petroleum coke, and ethanol and other renewable fuels and feedstocks; and (ii) Jones Act-qualified tankers;\n115\n•\nCO\n2\n—(i) the production, transportation and marketing of CO\n2\n to oil fields that use CO\n2\n as a flooding medium to increase recovery and production of crude oil from mature oil fields; (ii) ownership interests in and/or operation of oil fields and gasoline processing plants in West Texas; (iii) the ownership and operation of a crude oil pipeline system in West Texas; an\nd (iv) the ownership and operation of RNG and LNG facilities.\nOur reportable segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services, have different marketing strategies and are managed separately.  \nThe Company’s chief operating decision maker (CODM) is represented by the Office of the Chairman which consists of our Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President.  Our CODM \nevaluates performance principally based on each reportable segment’s earnings before DD&A expenses including amortization of excess cost of equity investments (EBDA), which excludes general and administrative expenses and corporate charges, interest expense, net, and income tax expense.  The CODM uses budgeted Segment EBDA compared to actual results to evaluate performance and allocate certain resources for each segment.\nWe consider each period’s earnings before all non-cash DD&A expenses to be an important measure of business segment performance for our reporting segments.  We account for intersegment sales at market prices, while we account for asset transfers at book value.\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022, we did not have revenues from any single external customer that exceeded \n10\n% of our consolidated revenues.\n \n116\nFinancial information by segment follows: \n \nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nReportable Segments\n \nNatural Gas Pipelines\nProducts Pipelines\nTerminals\nCO\n2\nCorporate and Eliminations\nTotal\n(In millions)\nRevenues\nRevenues from external customers\n$\n8,930\n \n$\n2,955\n \n$\n2,013\n \n$\n1,202\n \n$\n— \n$\n15,100\n \nIntersegment revenues\n12\n \n—\n \n9\n \n2\n \n(\n23\n)\n— \nTotal revenues\n8,942\n \n2,955\n \n2,022\n \n1,204\n \n(\n23\n)\n15,100\n \nCosts of sales\n(\n2,837\n)\n(\n1,394\n)\n(\n42\n)\n(\n82\n)\nLabor\n(\n322\n)\n(\n128\n)\n(\n273\n)\n(\n50\n)\nFuel and power\n(\n74\n)\n(\n92\n)\n(\n20\n)\n(\n153\n)\nField -

Litigation and Environmental\nWe and our subsidiaries are parties to various legal, regulatory and other matters arising from the day-to-day operations of our businesses or certain predecessor operations that may result in claims against the Company.  Although no assurance can be given, we believe, based on our experiences to date and taking into account established reserves and insurance, that the ultimate resolution of such items will not have a material adverse impact to our financial position, cash flows or operating results, unless otherwise indicated below.  We believe we have numerous and substantial defenses to the matters to which we are a party and intend to vigorously defend the Company.  When we determine a loss is probable of occurring and is reasonably estimable, we accrue an undiscounted liability for such contingencies based on our best estimate using information available at that time.  If the estimated loss is a range of potential outcomes and there is no better estimate within the range, we accrue the amount at the low end of the range.  We disclose the following contingencies where an adverse outcome may be material or, in the judgment of management, we conclude the matter should otherwise be disclosed.\nGulf LNG Facility Disputes\nGulf LNG Energy, LLC and Gulf LNG Pipeline, LLC (GLNG) filed a lawsuit in 2018 against Eni S.p.A. in the Supreme Court of the State of New York to enforce a Guarantee Agreement (Guarantee) entered into by Eni S.p.A. in 2007 in connection with a contemporaneous terminal use agreement entered into by its affiliate, Eni USA Gas Marketing LLC (Eni USA).  GLNG filed suit to enforce the Guarantee against Eni S.p.A. after an arbitration tribunal delivered an award which called for the termination of the terminal use agreement and payment of compensation by Eni USA to GLNG.  In response to GLNG’s lawsuit, Eni S.p.A. filed counterclaims based on the terminal use agreement and a parent direct agreement with Gulf LNG Energy (Port), LLC.  The foregoing counterclaims asserted by Eni S.p.A sought unspecified damages based on the same substantive allegations that were dismissed with prejudice in previous separate arbitrations with Eni USA described above and with GLNG’s remaining customer Angola LNG Supply Services LLC, a consortium of international oil companies including Eni S.p.A.  In early 2022, the trial court granted Eni S.p.A’s motion for summary judgment on GLNG’s claims to enforce the Guarantee.  The Appellate Division denied GLNG’s appeal.  GLNG elected not to pursue further recourse to the state Court of Appeals, which is the state’s highest appellate court, thereby concluding GLNG’s efforts to enforce the Guarantee.  With respect to the counterclaims asserted by Eni S.p.A., the trial court granted GLNG’s motion for summary judgment and entered \n121\njudgment dismissing all of Eni S.p.A.’s claims with prejudice on September 15, 2023.  On September 24, 2024, the Appellate Division affirmed the entry of summary judgment in GLNG’s favor.  On December 17, 2024, the Appellate Division denied Eni S.p.A.’s motion for reargument.  On January 16, 2025, Eni S.p.A. filed a motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals, which we will vigorously oppose.\nFreeport LNG Winter Storm Litigation\nOn September 13, 2021, Freeport LNG Marketing, LLC (Freeport) filed a lawsuit against Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC and Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline LLC in the 133rd District Court of Harris County, Texas (Case No. 2021-58787) alleging that defendants breached the parties’ base contract for sale and purchase of natural gas by failing to repurchase natural gas nominated by Freeport between February 10-22, 2021 during Winter Storm Uri.  We deny that we were obligated to repurchase natural gas from Freeport given our declaration of force majeure during the storm and our compliance with emergency orders issued by the Railroad Commission of Texas providing heightened priority for the delivery of gas to human needs customers.  Freeport alleges that it is owed approximately $\n104\n million, plus attorney fees and interest.  On October 24, 2022, the trial court granted our motion for summary judgment on all of Freeport’s claims.  On November 21, 2022, Freeport filed a notice of appeal to the 14\nth\n Court of Appeals, where the matter remains pending.  We believe we have numerous and substantial defenses and intend to continue to vigorously defend this case.\nPension Plan Litigation\nOn February 22, 2021, Kinder Morgan Retirement Plan A participants Curtis Pedersen and Beverly Leutloff filed a purported class action lawsuit under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  The named plaintiffs were hired initially by the ANR Pipeline Company (ANR) in the late 1970s.  Following a series of corporate acquisitions, plaintiffs became participants in pension plans sponsored by the Coastal Corporation (Coastal), El Paso Corporation (El Paso) and our company by virtue of our acquisition of El Paso in 2012 and our assumption of certain of El Paso’s pension plan obligations.  The complaint, which was transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas (Civil Action No. 4:21-3590) and later amended to include the Kinder Morgan Retirement Plan B, alleges that the series of foregoing transactions resulted in changes to plaintiffs’ retirement benefits which are now contested on a class-wide basis in the lawsuit. The complaint asserts \nsix\n claims that fall within three primary theories of liability.  Claims I, II, and III all challenge plan provisions that are alleged to constitute impermissible “backloading” or “cutback” of benefits, and seek the same plan modification as to how the plans calculate benefits for former participants in the Coastal plan.  Claims IV and V allege that former participants in the ANR plans should be eligible for unreduced benefits at younger ages than the plans currently provide.  Claim VI asserts that actuarial assumptions used to calculate reduced early retirement benefits for current or former ANR employees are outdated and therefore unreasonable.  On February 8, 2024, the Court certified a class defined as any and all persons who participated in the Kinder Morgan Retirement Plan A or B who are current or former employees of ANR or Coastal, and participated in the El Paso pension plan after El Paso acquired Coastal in 2001, and are members of at least one of three subclasses of individuals who are allegedly due benefits under one or more of the \nsix\n claims asserted in the complaint.  On July 25, 2024, the Court decided the parties’ respective cross-motions for summary judgment.  The Court granted our motion for summary judgment with respect to Claims I and II based on the Court’s determination that the formula used to calculate projected service was neither backloaded nor a violation of ERISA’s anti-cutback rule.  The Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment with respect to Claim III because the Court found that the summary plan description did not include any clarifying examples or illustrations of accrued benefits using the applicable formula.  The Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment as to Claim IV based upon the Court’s finding that an amendment to the plan in 2007 violated ERISA’s anti-cutback protection by terminating the accrual of early retirement benefits in connection with the sale of ANR.  The Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for partial summary judgment as to Claim V because the Court found that the plan administrator used an inconsistent interpretation to calculate benefits for some retirees.  The Court dismissed Claim VI without prejudice based upon its determination that the claim was moot given that the Court had allowed plaintiffs’ motion as to Counts IV and V.  Neither the parties’ respective motions nor the Court’s decision addressed the extent of potential plan liabilities for past or future benefits or other potential damage or equitable relief associated with the claims.  The Court instructed the parties to propose a schedule to determine the scope of potential remedies associated with the remaining claims or obtain a referral to mediation before the presiding Magistrate Judge.  On October 8, 2024, the case was referred to the presiding Magistrate Judge for mediation that is scheduled to commence on March 11, 2025.  We believe plaintiffs seek to recover early retirement benefits, monetary damages, or equitable relief in excess of $\n100\n million.  In the event a settlement cannot be achieved through the mediation process, we believe we have numerous and substantial defenses to support our vigorous defense at the trial or appellate levels if necessary.  To the extent an adverse judgment or settlement results in an increase in plan liabilities, we may elect as the sponsor of the plans to address them in accordance with applicable ERISA provisions, including provisions that allow for contributions to the plans over several years.\n122\nPipeline Integrity and Releases\nFrom time to time, despite our best efforts, our pipelines experience leaks and ruptures.  These leaks and ruptures may cause explosions, fire, and damage to the environment, damage to property and/or personal injury or death.  In connection with these incidents, we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines and/or to properly maintain our pipelines.  Depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident, state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil and/or criminal fines and penalties.\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our total reserve for legal matters was $\n48\n million and $\n23\n million, respectively.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental cleanup and enforcement actions from time to time.  In particular, CERCLA generally imposes joint and several liability for cleanup and enforcement costs on current and predecessor owners and operators of a site, among others, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, subject to the right of a liable party to establish a “reasonable basis” for apportionment of costs.  Our operations are also subject to local, state and federal laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment.  Although we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, risks of additional costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline, terminal, CO\n2\n field and oil field, and our other operations, and there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities.  Moreover, it is possible that other developments could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies under the terms of authority of those laws, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations.  Although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcomes, we believe that the resolution of the environmental matters set forth in this note, and other matters to which we and our subsidiaries are a party, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows or operating results.\nWe are currently involved in several governmental proceedings involving alleged violations of local, state and federal environmental and safety regulations.  As we receive notices of non-compliance, we attempt to negotiate and settle such matters where appropriate.  These alleged violations may result in fines and penalties, but except as disclosed herein we do not believe any such fines and penalties will be material to our financial position, cash flows or operating results, individually or in the aggregate.  We are also currently involved in several governmental proceedings involving groundwater and soil remediation efforts under state or federal administrative orders or related remediation programs.  We have established a reserve to address the costs associated with the remediation efforts.\nIn addition, we are involved with and have been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) in several federal and state Superfund sites.  Environmental reserves have been established for those sites where our contribution is probable and reasonably estimable.  Because costs associated with remedial plans are generally expected to be spread over at least several years, we do not anticipate that our share of the cost of remediation will have a material adverse impact to our financial position, cash flows or operating results.  In addition, we are from time to time involved in civil proceedings relating to damages alleged to have occurred as a result of accidental leaks or spills of refined petroleum products, crude oil, NGL, natural gas or CO\n2\n, including natural resource damage (NRD) claims.\nPortland Harbor Superfund Site, Willamette River, Portland, Oregon\nOn January 6, 2017, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (ROD) that established a final remedy and cleanup plan for an industrialized area on the lower reach of the Willamette River commonly referred to as the Portland Harbor Superfund Site (PHSS).  The cost for the final remedy is estimated to be more than $\n2.8\n billion and active cleanup is expected to take more than \n10\n years to complete.  KMLT, KMBT, and some \n90\n other PRPs identified by the EPA are involved in a non-judicial allocation process to determine each party’s respective share of the cleanup costs related to the final remedy set forth by the ROD.  We are participating in the allocation process on behalf of KMLT (in connection with its ownership or operation of \ntwo\n facilities) and KMBT (in connection with its ownership or operation of \ntwo\n facilities).  Effective January 31, 2020, KMLT entered into separate Administrative Settlement Agreements and Orders on Consent (ASAOC) to complete remedial design for two distinct areas within the PHSS associated with KMLT’s facilities.  The ASAOC obligates KMLT to pay a share of the remedial design costs for cleanup activities related to these two areas as required by the ROD.  Our share of responsibility for the PHSS costs will not be determined until the ongoing non-judicial allocation process is concluded or a lawsuit is filed that results in a judicial decision allocating responsibility.  At this time, we anticipate the non-judicial allocation process will be complete by December 31, 2026.  Until the allocation process is completed, we are unable to reasonably estimate the extent of our liability for the costs related to the design of the proposed remedy and cleanup of the PHSS.  In August 2024, we reached an \n123\nagreement to settle claims first made in January 2021 asserted by state and federal trustees following their natural resource assessment of the PHSS.\nLower Passaic River Study Area of the Diamond Alkali Superfund Site, New Jersey\nEPEC Polymers, Inc. and EPEC Oil Company Liquidating Trust (collectively EPEC) are identified as PRPs in an administrative action under CERCLA known as the Lower Passaic River Study Area (Site) concerning the lower 17-mile stretch of the Passaic River in New Jersey.  On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a ROD for the lower eight miles of the Site.  At that time the cleanup plan in the ROD was estimated to cost $\n1.7\n billion.  The cleanup is expected to take at least \nsix years\n to complete once it begins.  In addition, the EPA and numerous PRPs, including EPEC, engaged in an allocation process for the implementation of the remedy for the lower eight miles of the Site.  That process was completed December 28, 2020 and certain PRPs, including EPEC, engaged in discussions with the EPA as a result thereof.  On October 4, 2021, the EPA issued a ROD for the upper nine miles of the Site.  At that time, the cleanup plan in the ROD was estimated to cost $\n440\n million.  No timeline for the cleanup has been established.  On December 16, 2022, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the EPA announced a settlement and proposed consent decree with \n85\n PRPs, including EPEC, to resolve their collective liability at the Site.  The total amount of the settlement is $\n150\n million.  Also on December 16, 2022, the DOJ on behalf of the EPA filed a Complaint against the \n85\n PRPs, including EPEC, a Notice of Lodging of Consent Decree, and a Consent Decree in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey.  On January 17, 2024, the DOJ on behalf of the EPA voluntarily dismissed its Complaint against \n3\n PRPs, filed an Amended Complaint against \n82\n PRPs, including EPEC, and a modified Consent Decree in the U.S. District Court.  On January 31, 2024, the DOJ on behalf of the EPA filed a motion to Enter Consent Decree in the U.S. District Court.  On December 18, 2024, the U.S. District Court entered the Consent Decree.  On January 9, 2025, a Notice of Appeal was filed in the U.S. District Court indicating the Consent Decree is being appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\nLouisiana Governmental Coastal Zone Erosion Litigation\nBeginning in 2013, several parishes in Louisiana and the City of New Orleans filed separate lawsuits in state district courts in Louisiana against a number of oil and gas companies, including TGP and SNG.  The lawsuits allege that certain of the defendants’ oil and gas exploration, production and transportation operations were conducted in violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended (SLCRMA) and that those operations caused substantial damage to the coastal waters of Louisiana and nearby lands.  Plaintiffs seek, among other relief, unspecified money damages, attorney fees, interest, and restoration costs.  There are more than \n40\n of these cases pending in Louisiana against oil and gas companies, \none\n of which is against TGP and \none\n of which is against SNG, both described further below.\nOn November 8, 2013, the Parish of Plaquemines, Louisiana and others filed a petition in the state district court for Plaquemines Parish against TGP and \n17\n other energy companies, alleging that the defendants’ operations in Plaquemines Parish violated SLCRMA and Louisiana law, and caused substantial damage to the coastal waters and nearby lands.  Plaintiffs seek, among other relief, unspecified money damages, attorney fees, interest, and restoration costs.  In May 2018, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  The case has been stayed pending the resolution of federal question jurisdictional issues in separate, consolidated cases to which TGP is not a party: The Parish of Plaquemines, et al. vs. Chevron USA, Inc. et al. consolidated with The Parish of Cameron, et al. v. BP America Production Company, et al.  At this time, we are not able to reasonably estimate the extent of our potential liability, if any.  We intend to vigorously defend this case.\nOn March 29, 2019, the City of New Orleans (Orleans) filed a petition in the state district court for Orleans Parish, Louisiana against SNG and \n10\n other energy companies alleging that the defendants’ operations in Orleans Parish violated the SLCRMA and Louisiana law, and caused substantial damage to the coastal waters and nearby lands.  Orleans seeks, among other relief, unspecified money damages, attorney fees, interest, and restoration costs.  In April 2019, the case was removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.  On February 28, 2024, the U.S. District Court entered partial Final Judgment dismissing a co-defendant and stayed the case pending an appeal by Orleans to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  On January 23, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the U.S. District Court’s judgment, thereby retaining jurisdiction and dismissing a co-defendant on the basis that SLCRMA does not apply to a co-defendant’s pipeline constructed prior to the regulation’s effective date.  Considering this ruling and that SNG’s pipelines were constructed prior to the regulation’s effective date, SNG intends to seek to be dismissed from this suit on the same basis through subsequent motion practice.  We intend to vigorously defend this case.\n124\nGeneral\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we have accrued a total reserve for environmental liabilities in the amount of $\n188\n million\n and $\n199\n million\n, respectively.  In addition, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had receivables of $\n10\n million and $\n11\n million, respectively, recorded for expected cost recoveries that have been deemed probable.\nChallenge to Federal “Good Neighbor Plan”\nOn July 14, 2023, we filed a Petition for Review against the EPA and others in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking review of the EPA’s final action promulgating the EPA’s final rule known as the “Good Neighbor Plan” (the Plan).  The case was styled \nKinder Morgan, Inc. v. EPA, et al.\n and has since been consolidated with other cases and is styled \nUtah, et al. v, EPA, et al.  \nThe Plan was published in the Federal Register as a final rule on June 5, 2023.  The Plan is a federal implementation plan to address certain interstate transport requirements of the Clean Air Act for the 2015 8-hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS).  We believe that the Plan is deeply flawed and that numerous and substantial bases for challenging the Plan exist.  If the Plan were fully implemented, its emission standards would require installation of more stringent air pollution controls on hundreds of existing internal combustion engines used by our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment.  On July 27, 2023, in combination with other parties, we filed a Motion to Stay the Plan Pending Review, and on September 25, 2023, the U.S. Court of Appeals denied the Motion.  On October 13, 2023, in combination with other parties, we filed an Emergency Application for Stay of Final Agency Action in the United States Supreme Court.  The case was styled \nKinder Morgan, Inc, et al. v. EPA, et al.\n and has since been consolidated with other cases and is styled \nOhio, et al. v. EPA, et al.  \nThe Supreme Court issued an order deferring consideration of the Emergency Application for Stay pending oral argument which took place February 21, 2024.  On June 27, 2024, the Supreme Court granted the Emergency Application ruling that enforcement of the Plan shall be stayed pending the disposition of the case on the merits by the U.S. Court of Appeals, and any subsequent petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court, if such writ is timely sought. In reaching its decision to grant the Emergency Application, the Supreme Court found that the parties challenging the Plan are likely to prevail on their argument that the Plan was not reasonably explained, that the EPA failed to supply a satisfactory explanation for its action, and that the EPA ignored an important aspect of the problem it was attempting to solve by promulgating the Plan.\nOn August 5, 2024, the EPA filed a Motion for Partial Voluntary Remand asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for an opportunity to cure the deficiency in the record identified by the Supreme Court.  On September 12, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals granted EPA’s motion, remanded the record to permit EPA to further respond to comments, and ordered the case be held in abeyance.  On December 10, 2024, the EPA published the Notice on Remand of the Record in the Federal Register.  On January 13, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals ordered the case be returned to its active docket for further proceedings.  On February 6, 2025, the EPA filed a Motion to Hold Consolidated Cases in Abeyance asking the U.S. Court of Appeals to hold the case in abeyance for 60 days to allow the Trump Administration time to familiarize themselves with the Plan, receive briefing from the EPA about the case and the Plan, and decide what action on the Plan, if any, is necessary.\nThe EPA has no legal basis to enforce the Plan while the Supreme Court stay remains in place.  If the Plan ultimately were to take effect in its current form (including full compliance by a revised compliance deadline accounting for the stays, and assuming failure of all challenges to state implementation plan disapprovals and to the Plan), we anticipate that it would have a material adverse impact on us.  Due to the extensive pending litigation, impacts of the Plan are difficult to predict.  Should the Plan take effect, we would seek to mitigate the impacts, and to recover expenditures through adjustments to our rates on our regulated assets where available.\n18. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nAccounting Standards Updates\nASU No. 2023-09\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n.”  This ASU improves the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring (i) consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and (ii) income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction.

This ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2026, for interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, and early adoption is permitted.  Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company’s disclosures.\nItem 9.  \nChanges in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.\nNone.\n126\nItem 9A. \nControls and Procedures.\nConclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAs of December 31, 2024, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures.  Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.  Based upon and as of the date of the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this assessment, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their audit report, which appears herein.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nItem 9B.  \nOther Information.\nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, none of our directors or officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) \nadopted\n, \nterminated\n or modified a Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement (as such terms are defined in Item 408 of Regulation S-K).\nItem 9C.  \nDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections.\nNot Applicable.\n127\nPART III\nItem 10.  \nDirectors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.\n \nThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference from KMI’s definitive proxy statement for the 2025 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which shall be filed no later than April 30, 2025.\nWe have a securities trading policy\n governing the purchase, sale and other dispositions of KMI securities by directors, \nofficers, employees, and by us.
