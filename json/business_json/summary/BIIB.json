We also have collaborations with Eisai on the commercialization of LEQEMBI for Alzheimer's disease . We commercialize a portfolio of biosimilars of advanced biologics including: BENEPALI, an etanercept biosimilar referencing ENBREL .\n Our consolidated financial statements reflect our financial statements, those of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary . Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation . In November 2023 we terminated the Neurimmune Agreement, which resulted in the deconsolidation of our variable interest entity .\n Our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue and expense . We recognize revenue following the five-step model prescribed under FASB ASC 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . In the U.S., we sell our products primarily to wholesale and specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies .\n Products revenue is recorded net of reserves for applicable discounts and allowances that are offered within contracts with our customers, health care providers or payors . We expense incremental costs of obtaining a contract as and when incurred if the expected amortization period of the asset that we would have recognized is one year or less or the amount is immaterial . Product revenue reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales .\n Discounts include trade term discounts, wholesaler incentives and volume related discounts . Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates . If actual results vary, we adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment . Rebate accruals are recorded in the same period the related revenue is recognized .\n Rebate and chargeback reserves are established in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, resulting in a reduction of product revenue and a reduction in net accounts receivable . Governmental rebates, including VA and PHS discounts, represent estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to qualified healthcare providers at prices lower than the list prices we charge to wholesalers .\n These rebates result from performance-based goals, formulary position and price increase limit allowances . Copay assistance represents financial assistance to qualified patients, assisting them with prescription drug co-payments required by insurance . Pharmacy rebates represent our estimated obligations resulting from contractual commitments to sell products to specific pharmacies . Other governmental rebates include mandatory rebates and discounts in international markets .\n In accordance with contractual terms, wholesalers are permitted to return product for reasons such as damaged or expired product . The majority of wholesaler returns are due to product expiration . We also maintain certain customer service contracts with distributors and other customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally reflected as a reduction of revenue .\n Revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs consists of our share of pre-tax profits and losses in the U.S. for RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO . Pre-tax co-promotion profits consist of net sales to third party customers less applicable costs to manufacture, third-party royalty expense, distribution, selling and marketing expense and joint development expense incurred by Genentech and the Roche Group .\n Biogen recorded its share of the expense incurred in connection with the development of LUNSUMIO within research and development expense . Beginning in January 2023 our share of pre-tax profits and losses in the U.S. for that product was reflected as a component of revenue from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs within our consolidated statements of income .\n Royalty and Other revenue primarily reflects royalty revenue on biosimilar products from our license arrangements with Samsung Bioepis and royalties we receive from net sales on products related to patents that we have out-licensed . We also have a number of significant collaborative and other third-party relationships for revenue and for the development, regulatory approval, commercialization and marketing of certain of our products and product candidates .\n We have certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value which have been classified as Level 1, 2 or 3 within the fair value hierarchy . Fair values are determined by utilizing quoted prices for identical or similar assets and other market observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves, foreign currency spot rates and option pricing valuation models . For more information on our collaboration arrangements, please read Note 19, Collaborative and Other Relationships, to these consolidated financial statements .\n The option pricing valuation models use assumptions within the model, including the term, stock price volatility, constant maturity risk-free interest rate and dividend yield . The majority of our accounts receivable arise from product sales and primarily represent amounts due from our wholesale and other third-party distributors, public hospitals, pharmacies and other government entities .\n We provide reserves against accounts receivable for estimated losses that may result from a customer's inability to pay . Amounts determined to be uncollectible are charged or written-off against the reserve . We minimize credit risk resulting from derivative ins. eption if we expect to collect the receivables in one year or less from the time of sale .\n \"We monitor the financial performance and creditworthiness of our customers so that we can properly assess and respond to changes in their credit profile\" \"We continue to monitor these conditions and assess their possible impact on our business\" \"During the third quarter of 2023 we sold all of our marketable debt securities and used the proceeds to partially fund our acquisition of Reata,\" \"Note 2, Acquisitions,\" to these consolidated financial statements .\n Our investments in venture capital funds are recorded at net asset value, which approximates fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are included in other (income) expense, net . We also invest in equity securities of companies whose securities are not publicly traded and where fair value is not readily available . These investments are recorded using either the equity method of accounting or the cost minus impairment adjusted for observable price changes .\n For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, management performs an analysis to assess whether we intend to sell or whether we would more likely than not be required to sell the security before the expected recovery of the amortized cost basis . Credit losses are identified where we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the amortized cost basis of a security . If our share of losses exceeds our investment, we will suspend recognizing additional losses .\n Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value with cost based on the first-in, first-out method . We classify our inventory costs as long-term when we expect to utilize the inventory beyond our normal operating cycle . We capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval, when, based on management’s judgment, future commercialization is considered probable .\n At each reporting period, we review our inventories for excess or obsolescence and write-down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value . We also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization, trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria . We expense previously capitalized costs related to pre-approval inventory upon changes in such judgments .\n The cost for planned major maintenance activities, including the related acquisition or construction of assets, is capitalized if the repair will result in future economic benefits . Interest costs incurred during the construction of major capital projects are capitalized until the underlying asset is ready for its intended use . We capitalize certain direct and incremental costs associated with the validation effort required for licensing by regulatory agencies of new manufacturing equipment for the production of a drug .\n We determine if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception . Operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease . When we dispose of property, plant and equipment, we remove the associated cost and accumulated depreciation from the related accounts in our consolidated balance sheets .\n For certain equipment leases, such as vehicles, we apply a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease assets and liabilities . We recognize sublease income on a straight-line basis over the lease term in our consolidated statements of income . For additional information on our leases, please read Note 12, Leases, to these consolidated financial statements .\n The economic consumption method is based on revenue generated from the products underlying the related intangible assets . Intangible assets related to trademarks, trade names, IPR&D prior to commercialization and priority review vouchers are not amortized because they have indefinite lives . An analysis of the anticipated lifetime revenue of our marketed products is performed annually .\n Upon the acquisition of IPR&D, we complete an assessment of whether our acquisition constitutes the purchase of a single asset or a group of assets . We consider multiple factors in this assessment, including the nature of the technology acquired, the presence or absence of separate cash flow . Future costs to develop these assets are recorded to research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income .\n Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually, as of October 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable . Long-lived assets to be held and used, including property, plant and equipment, and definite-lived intangible assets, are reviewed .\n Changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations are recognized in our consolidated statements of income . The fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market . The period over which we discount our contingent obligations is based on the current development stage of the product candidates, our specific development plan for that product candidate adjusted for the probability of completing the development step and when the contingent payments would be triggered .\n Changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments are recognized each period in current earnings or AOCI . We do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes . We assess at inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivative instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in cash flow or fair values of the hedged items .\n Beginning in the second quarter of 2022 we no longer held net investment hedges as they were closed with the sale of our 49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis in April 2022 . The functional currency for most of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency . Income and expense items are translated at the average foreign currency exchange rates for the period .\n We make royalty payments to a number of third parties under license or purchase agreements associated with our acquisition of intellectual property . Translation adjustments of these subsidiaries are included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income . We recognize compensation expense for the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures over the requisite service period .\n The fair values of our stock option grants are estimated as of the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option valuation model . Compensation expense for RSUs is recognized straight-line over the applicable service period . The probability of actual shares expected to be earned is considered in the grant date valuation, therefore the expense is not adjusted to reflect the actual units earned .\n The fair values of PSUs that settle in stock and do not have market-based metrics are based upon the stock price on the date of grant . Compensation expense is recognized for the number of units expected to be earned after assessing the probability that certain performance criteria will be met and the targeted payout level associated with the performance criteria .\n Payments we make for research and development services prior to the services being rendered are recorded as prepaid assets in our consolidated balance sheets . We also accrue the costs of ongoing clinical trials associated with programs that have been terminated or discontinued for which there is no future economic benefit at the time the decision is made to terminate or discontinue the program .\n Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases . Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method . Income tax consequences from the intra-entity transfers of inventory within our consolidated group, both current and deferred, are recorded as a prepaid tax or deferred charge .\n The company is currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings . Loss contingency provisions are recorded if the potential loss from any claim, asserted or unasserted, or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated or a range of loss can be determined . Legal costs associated with legal proceedings are expensed when incurred .\n Business combinations are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting . Any excess of consideration transferred over the net carrying value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date is recognized as goodwill . Raw materials acquired are valued using the replacement cost method . Transaction and restructuring costs related to business combinations are expensed as incurred .\n New accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies that we adopt as of the specified effective date . We do not believe that the adoption of recently issued standards have or may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures . The adoption of this standard resulted in additional disclosure on the significant expenses reviewed by our CODM .\n The amendments in this update are required to be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply it retrospectively . Early adoption of the new standard is permitted . We are evaluating the potential impact that this new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures . The amendments require disclosure of specified information about certain costs and expense including purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and depreciation .\n New rule will require large accelerated filers to disclose material climate-related risks that are reasonably likely to have a material impact on their business, results of operations or financial condition . Compliance period beginning with annual reporting for fiscal years as of December 31, 2025 . New rules will require disclosure within the notes to the financial statements of the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions .\n The acquisition of HI-Bio is expected to augment our pipeline and build on our expertise in immunology . Felzartamab has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation and ODD from the FDA for development in the treatment of PMN and AMR . The $1.15.15-billion paid includes approximately $74.5.5-million related to  non-vested equity awards, inclusive of employer taxes .\n In addition to the lead program felzartamab, the HI-Bio pipeline acquired includes izastobart/HIB210, an anti-C5aR1 antibody currently in a Phase 1 trial, and the potential for continued development in a range of complement-mediated diseases . The acquisition-date fair value of these milestones was approximately $485.1 million .\n The short-term liability relates to the fourth patient dosed in a phase 3 clinical trial of felzartamab in a first and s.-decade indication, which would trigger milestone payments of $279.3.3 per cent . The remaining $205.8 per cent is reflected as a component of other long-term liabilities within our consolidated balance sheets .\n The estimated fair values of the program related intangible assets were determined using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, utilizing cash flow analyses and a discount rate of 14.5% . Intangible assets comprised of $.6 billion of IPR&D related to HI-Bio's lead asset felzartamab .\n The goodwill recognized from our acquisition of HI-Bio is primarily the result of the deferred tax consequences from the transaction recorded for financial statement purposes . Acquisition-related expense, primarily comprised of advisory and legal fees, and other transaction costs, totaled approximately $2.8 million . We recognized goodwill of approximately $256.5 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes .\n HI-Bio operations had an immaterial impact on our results of operations for the  year ended December 31, 2024 . The acquisition of Reata Pharmaceuticals is expected to complement our global portfolio of neuromuscular and rare disease therapies . The addition of SKYCLARYS is anticipated to provide potential operating synergies with SPINRAZA and QALSODY .\n We funded this acquisition through available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, supplemented by the issuance of a $1.0-billion term loan under our 2023 Term Loan . The remaining $197.0 million as a charge to research and development expense within our consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2023. These amounts were associated with the accelerated vesting of stock options and RSUs previously granted to Reata employees .\n The measurement period adjustments resulted from updates to our valuation assumptions related to the estimated amounts and timing of future cash flows associated with certain intangible assets . e accounting for this acquisition in the third quarter of 2024 . The related impact to our consolidated statements of income that would have been recognized in previous periods if the adjustments were recognized as of the acquisition date is immaterial .\n Total inventory acquired was approximately $1.3.3 billion, which reflects a step-up in the fair value of finished goods and work-in-process inventory for SKYCLARYS . Fair value was determined based on the estimated selling price of the inventory, less the remaining manufacturing and selling costs and a normal profit margin .\n The estimated fair values of the program related intangible assets were determined using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, utilizing a discount rate of  around 14.3% and the estimated fair value of the PRV was based on recent external purchase and sale transactions of similar vouchers .\n The goodwill recognized from our acquisition of Reata is primarily the result of the deferred tax consequences from the transaction recorded for financial statement purposes . Goodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from the other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized . Acquisition-related expense, primarily comprised of regulatory, advisory and legal fees, and other transaction costs, totaled approximately $28.4-million .\n We concluded that the divestment of Samsung Bioepis did not meet the criteria to be reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements . We elected the fair value option and measured the payments due to us from Samsung BioLogics at fair value . For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a gain of approximately $7.5 million to reflect the change in fair value associated with the passage of time related to the second deferred payment .\n In the year ended December 31, 2022, we recognized a gain of approximately $9.7.7% and a loss of $1.4% . In April 2024 we completed the sale of our rare pediatric disease PRV, generated by the development associated with SPINRAZA, to a third party . In consideration for the PRV we received a cash payment of $.103.0% .\n The Fit for Growth program is expected to generate approximately $1.0.0 billion in gross operating expense savings by the end of 2025 . Some of these savings will be reinvested in various initiatives . The Fit For Growth program includes net headcount reductions of approximately  around 1,000 employees and restructuring charges ranging from approximately $260.0-$280.0-million .\n In connection with our acquisition of Reata we assumed responsibility for a single-tenant, build-to-suit building of approximately                 327,400 square feet of office and laboratory space . We do not intend to occupy this building and are evaluating opportunities to sublease the property . Under this initiative, we incurred approximately $2.6.6 million of severance and employment costs .\n Charges related to our 2022 cost saving initiatives were substantially incurred during 2022 with remaining payments expected to be made through 2026 . Amounts reflect a gain recorded during the third quarter of 2022 of approximately $.3.3 million related to the partial termination of a portion of our lease located at 300 Binney Street. ce, the substantial elimination of our commercial ADUHELM. infrastructure, deprioritization of certain research and development programs, the consolidation of certain real estate locations and operating efficiencies across our selling, general and administrative and research . functions .\n Subtotal: Multiple Sclerosis, Rare Disease, Fumarate and Rare Disease . The Company's net loss is $1.2 billion . The company's net losses are $2.3 billion, primarily from non-operations related to the Company's non-taxed net loss of $3.1 billion in 2012 and 2013 .\n The company acquired Reata in September 2023 . ZURZUVAE became commercially available in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2023 and we began recognizing revenue from SKYCLARYS . The company recognized revenue from  two wholesale distributors individually accounted for approximately  around 27.9% of gross product revenue in 2024,  receiving 27.2% of net accounts receivable associated with w.\n An analysis of the change in reserves for discounts and allowances is summarized as follows as follows: December 31, 2024, 2023, 2024 and 2023 . As compared to  24.6% and  -2023, as compared to 24.6%, and 11.6%. As of Dec. 31, 2025, our product sales were  prepared to  substantially increased with revenues for discounts for receipt and allowances .\n Revenues from anti-CD20 therapeutic programs are summarized in the table below . Biogen's share of pre-tax profits in the U.S. for RITUXAN, GAZYVA and LUNSUMIO became commercially available in the first quarter of 2023 . LunSUMio became commercially available in the first quarter of 2023 .\n For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized approximately $59.9.9                 million of Alzheimer's collaboration revenue within our consolidated statements of income . During the first quarter of 2023 we began recognizing contract manufacturing revenue for LEQEMBI, upon accelerated approval of LEQemBI in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2023 .\n The components of inventory are summarized as follows: Raw materials, finished goods and investments . The fair value was determined based on the estimated selling price of the inventory, less the remaining manufacturing . Long-term inventory is included in investments and other assets within our consolidated balance sheets . We recorded approximately $1.3 billion of acquired inventory,  including SKYCLARYS as a result of our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 .\n The fair value step-up adjustment is being amortized to cost of sales within our consolidated statements of income as the inventory is sold, which is expected to be sold over a period of approximately  around a decade from the acquisition date . For additional information on our acquisition of Reata, please read  Note 2, Acquisitions, to these consolidated financial statements .\n The increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets, excluding impairment charges, was primarily due to amortizing for the Reata acquisition acquired intangible . assets associated with SKYCLARYS. ps. Amortization  reflects the impact of a $40.0.0 million impairment charge related to intangible assets from other clinical programs . The increased amortizations of acquired . intangible assets totaled $386.5 million, $.240.6 million and $.246 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 .\n The occurrence of an adverse event could substantially increase the amount of amortization expense related to our acquired intangible assets as compared to previous periods or our current expectations, which may result in a significant negative impact on our future results of operations . For the year ended December 31, 2023, we had no impairment charges .\n In connection with our acquisition of Reata in September 2023 we acquired SKYCLARYS, a commercially-approved product in the U.S., with an estimated fair value of approximately $4.2.2 billion . Completed technology intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range between  grotesque1.1- to  grotesque31.31 years, with a remaining weighted average useful life of  around 13-years .\n SKYCLARYS was approved in the E.U. and became commercially available, which resulted in the reclassification of the related intangible asset  from IPR&D to completed technology . Goodwill resulting from HI-Bio acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2024, relates to Reata measu. The estimated future amortization of finite-lived intangible assets for the next five years is expected to be as follows:\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no accumulated impairment losses related to goodwill . Other includes adjustments related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations . For additional information on our acquisitions of Reata and HI-Bio, please read  apologeticNote 2, Acquisitions, to these consolidated financial statements .\n The company has no material impairments of our assets measured and carried at fair value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 . We may realize significantly less than the current value of our investments in Denali, Sangamo and Sage common stock . We elected the fair value option for the sale of our equity interest in Samsung Bioepis to Samsung BioLogics during the second quarter of 2022 .\n The following table presents quantitative information, as of the dates indicated, about the valuation techniques and significant unobservable inputs used in the valuation of our Level 3 financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis . The weighted average discount rates were calculated based on the relative fair values of each distinct contingent consideration obligation related to our acquisition of HI-Bio in July 2024 .\n The fair value of our contingent consideration obligations are recorded in (gain) loss on fair value remeasurement of contingent consideration in our consolidated statements of income . The fair values of the contingent consideration liabilities were based on a probability-adjusted discounted cash flow calculation using Level 3 fair value measurements and inputs . For additional information on the valuation techniques and inputs utilized in the valuation of our financial assets and liabilities, please read  Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, which includes Note 1 to these consolidated financial statements .\n The fair values of each of our series of Senior Notes were determined through market, observable and corroborated sources . In connection with our acquisition of Reata we drew $1.0 billion from our 2023 Term Loan, comprised of a $705.0 million floating rate 364-day tranche and a $395.0million floating rate three-year tranche . As of December 31, 2024, our 20 23 Term Loan was repaid in full .\n The following table summarizes our financial assets with maturities of less than 90 days from the date of purchase included in cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets . The carrying value of our money market funds approximates fair value due to their short-term maturity . For additional information related to our Senior Notes, please read Note 13, Indebtedness, to these consolidated financial statements .\n The proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable debt securities and resulting realized gains and losses are summarized as follows . We partially funded our Reata acquisition through available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities . As of December 31, 2023, we had sold all of our marketable debts . The company's strategic investment portfolio includes investments in equity securities of certain biotechnology companies .\n The ecrease in our strategic investment portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2024, was primarily due to the decrease in the fair value of our investment in Sage common stock . The value of revenue and operating expense measured in U.S. dollars is therefore subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates . Realized gains and losses of such contracts and options are recognized in revenue .\n The notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options that were entered into to hedge forecasted revenue and operating expense is summarized as follows . We expect the net unrealized gains of approximately $395 million to be settled over the next  next  12 months, with any amounts in AOCI to be reported as an adjustment to revenue or operating expense . We consider the impact of our and our counterparties’ credit risk on the fair value of the contracts .\n In February 2012, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Samsung BioLogics establishing an entity, Samsung Bioepis, to develop, manufacture and market biosimilar products . In order to mitigate currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and South Korean won, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts . These contracts were designated as net investment hedges . In April 2022, we completed the sale of our   49.9% equity interest in Samsung BioEpis . Upon completing this sale, the cumulative gains on our net investment . of  $57.0 million were reclassified from AOCI and reflected within the total pre-tax gain recognized from the sale .\n Beginning in the second quarter of 2022 we no longer held net investment hedges as they were closed with the sale of our  49.9% equity interest in Samsung Bioepis in April 2022 .
