Business\nModerna is a leader in the creation of the field of messenger RNA (mRNA) medicine. Through the advancement of mRNA technology, we are reimagining how medicines are made and transforming how we treat and prevent disease for everyone. By working at the intersection of science, technology and health for more than a decade, we have developed medicines at unprecedented speed and efficiency, including one of the earliest and most effective COVID vaccines.\nOur mRNA platform has enabled the development of medicines across four franchises: respiratory virus vaccines, latent and other virus vaccines, oncology therapeutics and rare disease therapeutics. With a unique culture and a global team driven by the Moderna values and mindsets to responsibly change the future of human health, we strive to deliver the greatest possible impact to people through mRNA medicines.\nOur first commercial product, Spikevax (our COVID vaccine), has helped hundreds of millions of people worldwide combat COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, continues to evolve, and in 2023, the COVID vaccine market shifted from a pandemic to an endemic, seasonal commercial market. In 2024, we became a multi-product company with the approval of our second commercial product, mRESVIA, our mRNA respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine for older adults. In 2024, we achieved net product sales of $3.1 billion, largely from sales of Spikevax.  \nBeyond our commercial products, we continue to demonstrate the potential of our platform technology. In 2024, we shared four positive Phase 3 data readouts across our respiratory portfolio—for our next-generation COVID vaccine, our RSV vaccine for high-risk adults aged 18 to 59, our seasonal flu+COVID combination vaccine and our seasonal flu vaccine. In the area of oncology therapeutics, we continue to demonstrate the potential clinical benefit of our individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) (mRNA-4157), which is being developed in collaboration with Merck. We and Merck have rapidly expanded clinical studies to several tumor types and completed enrollment of the Phase 3 clinical trial for adjuvant melanoma in 2024. Additionally, in 2024, we also took steps to move two of our rare disease therapeutics programs—targeting propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA)—toward registrational trials. We also achieved milestones in our latent and other vaccines franchise, including the initiation of a Phase 3 study of our norovirus vaccine.  \nOur success in research and development is a testament to our platform. Moving forward, we are taking a paced approach to our research and development investment. We entered 2025 with a focus on a prioritized portfolio addressing our four franchises where there is unmet need.\nTHE mRNA OPPORTUNITY\nmRNA, the software of life\nmRNA transfers the information stored in our genes to the cellular machinery that makes all the proteins required for life. Our genes are stored as sequences of DNA which contain the instructions to make specific proteins. DNA serves as a hard drive, safely storing these instructions in the cell’s nucleus until they are needed by the cell.\nWhen a cell needs to produce a protein, the instructions to make that protein are copied from the DNA to mRNA, which serves as the template for protein production. Each mRNA molecule contains the instructions to produce a specific protein with a distinct function in the body. mRNA transmits those instructions to cellular machinery, called ribosomes, that make copies of the required protein.\nWe see mRNA functioning as the “software of life.” Every cell uses mRNA to provide real time instructions to make the proteins necessary to drive all aspects of biology, including in human health and disease. This was codified as the central dogma of molecular biology over 60 years ago, and is exemplified in the schematic below.\n6\nTable of Contents\nThe structure of mRNA \nmRNA is a linear polymer comprising four monomers called nucleotides: adenosine (A), guanosine (G), cytosine (C) and uridine (U). Within the region of the molecule that codes for a protein (the coding region), the sequence of these four nucleotides forms a language made up of three-letter words called codons. The first codon, or start codon (AUG), signals where the ribosome should start protein synthesis. To know what protein to make, the ribosome then progresses along the mRNA one codon at a time, appending the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein. To end protein synthesis, three different codons (UAA, UAG, and UGA) serve as stop signals, telling the ribosome where to terminate protein synthesis. In total, there are 64 potential codons, but only 20 amino acids that are used to build proteins; therefore, multiple codons can encode for the same amino acid.\nThe process of protein production is called translation because the ribosome is reading in one language (a sequence of codons) and outputting in another language (a sequence of amino acids). The coding region is analogous to a sentence in English. Much like a start codon, a capitalized word can indicate the start of a sentence. Codons within the coding region resemble groups of letters representing words. The end of the sentence is signaled by a period in English, or a stop codon for mRNA.\nIn every cell, hundreds of thousands of mRNAs make hundreds of millions of proteins every day. A typical protein contains 200-600 amino acids; therefore, a typical mRNA coding region ranges from 600-1,800 nucleotides. In addition to the coding region, mRNAs contain four other key features: (1) the 5’ untranslated region (5’-UTR); (2) the 3’ untranslated region (3’-UTR); (3) the 5’ cap; and (4) a 3’ polyadenosine (poly-A) tail. The sequence of nucleotides in the 5’-UTR influences how efficiently the ribosome initiates protein synthesis, whereas the sequence of nucleotides in the 3’-UTR contains information about which cell types should translate that mRNA and how long the mRNA should last. The 5’ cap and 3’ poly-A tail enhance ribosome engagement and protect the mRNA from attack by intracellular enzymes that digest mRNA from its ends.\n7\nTable of Contents\nThe intrinsic advantages of using mRNA as a medicine\nmRNA possesses inherent characteristics that we believe position it to have a profound impact on human health:\n•\nmRNA is used by every cell to produce all proteins:\n mRNA is used to make every type of protein, including secreted, membrane and intracellular proteins, in varying quantities over time, in different locations and in various combinations. Given the universal role of mRNA in protein production, we believe that mRNA medicines could have broad applicability across human disease.\n•\nMaking proteins inside one’s own cells mimics human biology: \nTailored mRNA can be sent into cells to instruct them to produce specific protein therapeutics or vaccine antigens and provides certain advantages over traditional approaches to medicine, where a protein or chemical is introduced to the body.\n•\nmRNA has a simple and flexible chemical structure:\n Each mRNA molecule comprises four chemically similar nucleotides to encode proteins made\n \nfrom up to 20 chemically different amino acids. To make the full diversity of possible proteins, only simple sequence changes are required in mRNA, instead of starting from scratch for each new vaccine or therapy.\n•\nmRNA has classic pharmacologic features: \nmRNA possesses many of the attractive pharmacologic features of most modern medicines, including reproducible activity, predictable potency and well-behaved dose dependency; mRNA also provides the ability to adjust dosing based on an individual patient’s needs, including stopping or lowering the dose, to seek to promote safety and tolerability.\nOur success in developing, manufacturing and commercializing vaccines against COVID-19 and RSV demonstrates the potential of mRNA medicines to help people and patients in far-reaching ways that could exceed the impact of traditional approaches to medicine.\nWe believe that the main advantages of mRNA as compared to traditional medicine are: \n1.\nmRNA could create an unprecedented abundance and diversity of medicines.\n mRNA’s breadth of applicability has the potential to create an extraordinary number of new mRNA medicines that are currently beyond the reach of recombinant protein technology.\n2.\nAdvances in the development of our mRNA medicines reduce risks across our portfolio. \nmRNA medicines share fundamental features that can\n \nbe leveraged across our portfolio. We believe that once safety and proof of protein production has been established in one program, the technology and biology risks of related programs that use similar mRNA technologies, delivery technologies and manufacturing processes will decrease significantly.  \n3.\nmRNA technology can accelerate discovery and development. \nThe software-like features of mRNA enable rapid\n \nin silico\n \ndesign and the use of\n \nautomated high-throughput synthesis processes that permit discovery to proceed in parallel rather than sequentially. We believe these mRNA features can also accelerate drug development by allowing the use of shared manufacturing processes and infrastructure.\n4.\nThe ability to leverage shared processes and infrastructure can drive significant capital efficiency over time. \nWe believe the manufacturing\n \nrequirements of different mRNA medicines are similar and that at commercial scale, a portfolio of mRNA medicines will benefit from shared capital expenditures.\nOUR STRATEGY\nWe believe that the development of mRNA medicines represents a significant breakthrough for patients, our industry and human health globally. Our success in developing one of the earliest and most effective COVID vaccines, at unprecedented speed and efficiency, demonstrates the promise of mRNA medicine. Our COVID vaccine has helped hundreds of millions of people worldwide combat COVID-19. Beyond COVID, our platform continues to be highly productive, with our RSV vaccine representing our second commercial product and eleven programs in late-stage development. \nWe are currently focused on three strategic priorities: \n1.\nDriving use of Spikevax and mRESVIA.\n Spikevax and mRESVIA are the foundation of our respiratory vaccine portfolio and we expect to participate in the full contracting season in the United States for both in 2025 for the first time. We will continue to work with all market channels to maximize the availability of Spikevax. Internationally, we plan to bring manufacturing plants online in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom (UK) in 2025, subject to execution of manufacturing plant licensures. With a full season of RSV contracting in 2025, our goal is to increase mRESVIA’s market share in the United States and market access globally.\n2.\nFocusing on ten product approvals over the next three years to drive sales growth.\n Our prioritized programs span our four franchises: respiratory, latent and other virus, oncology and rare diseases. We expect execution of this priority to drive \n8\nTable of Contents\nsales growth and fund our next wave of research and development investment. For nine of these programs, we have near-term milestones, including up to three potential 2025 approvals for our next-generation COVID vaccine, our RSV vaccine for high-risk adults aged 18 to 59, and our flu+COVID combination vaccine for adults 50 years and older. We also anticipate up to six upcoming registrational data readouts for our cytomegalovirus (CMV), seasonal flu, norovirus, INT for adjuvant melanoma, PA and MMA product candidates.\n3.\nDelivering cost efficiency across the business.\n We plan to continue improving efficiency by further reducing our research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses in 2025. By 2027, we expect to decrease annual research and development expenses by approximately $1.0 billion compared to 2024. On cost of sales, we will work to continue to drive efficiency through manufacturing productivity improvements to achieve operating leverage.\nOUR PLATFORM\nOverview of our platform\nOur mRNA “platform” refers to our accumulated knowledge and capabilities in basic and applied sciences. Our platform incorporates advances across three key components—mRNA, delivery and the manufacturing process— to advance our medicines. We integrate these components and combine different versions of mRNA delivery and process into each of our medicines. \nOur platform: mRNA science advancements\nWe continue to invest in both basic and applied research, seeking to advance both the state of our technology and the state of the scientific community’s understanding of mRNA. Examples of advances in mRNA science that combine nucleotide chemistry, sequence engineering and targeting elements are described below.\nmRNA chemistry: Modified nucleotides to mitigate immune system activation: \nThe innate immune system has evolved to protect cells from foreign RNA, such as viral RNA, by inducing inflammation and suppressing mRNA translation once detected. Many cells surveil their environment through sensors called toll-like-receptors (TLRs). These include types that are activated by the presence of double-stranded RNA (TLR3) or uridine containing RNA fragments (TLR7, TLR8). Additionally, all cells have cytosolic double-stranded RNA, sensors, including retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) that are sensitive to foreign RNA inside the cell.\nThe immune and cellular response to mRNA is complex, context specific, and often linked to the sensing of uridine. To minimize undesired immune responses to our potential mRNA medicines, our platform employs chemically-modified uridine nucleotides to minimize recognition by both immune cell sensors such as TLR3/7/8, and broadly-distributed cytosolic receptors such as RIG-I. \nmRNA sequence engineering: Maximizing protein expression: \nmRNA exists transiently in the cytoplasm, during which time it can be translated into thousands of proteins before eventually being degraded. Our platform applies bioinformatic, biochemical, and biological screening capabilities, most of which have been invented internally that aim to optimize the amount of protein produced per mRNA. We have identified proprietary sequences for the 5’-UTR that have been observed to increase the likelihood that a ribosome bound to the 5’-end of the mRNA transcript will find the desired start codon and reliably initiate translation of the coding region.\n \nWe additionally design the nucleotide sequence of the coding region to maximize its successful translation into protein. \nTargeting elements: Enabling tissue-targeted translation: \nAll nucleated cells in the body are capable of translating mRNA, resulting in pharmacologic activity in any cell in which mRNA is delivered and translated. To minimize or prevent potential off-target effects, our platform employs technologies that regulate mRNA translation in select cell types. Cells often contain short RNA sequences, called microRNAs or miRNAs, that bind to mRNA to regulate protein translation at the mRNA level. Different cell types have different concentrations of specific microRNAs, in effect giving cells a microRNA signature. microRNA binding directly to mRNA effectively silences or reduces mRNA translation and promotes mRNA degradation. We design microRNA binding sites into the 3’-UTR of our potential mRNA medicines so that if our mRNA is delivered to cells with such microRNAs, it will be minimally translated and rapidly degraded.\nOur platform: Delivery science\nOur mRNA can, in specific instances, be delivered by direct injection to a tissue in a simple saline formulation without lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to locally produce small amounts of pharmacologically active protein. However, the blood and interstitial fluids in humans contain significant RNA degrading enzymes that rapidly degrade any extracellular mRNA and prevent broader distribution without LNPs. Additionally, cell membranes tend to act as a significant barrier to entry of large, negatively-charged molecules such as mRNA. We have therefore invested heavily in delivery science and have developed LNP technologies to enable delivery of larger quantities of mRNA to target tissues.\n9\nTable of Contents\nLNPs are generally composed of four components: an amino lipid, a phospholipid, cholesterol, and a pegylated-lipid (PEG-lipid). Each component, as well as the overall composition, or mix of components, contributes to the properties of each LNP system. LNPs containing mRNA injected into the body rapidly bind proteins that can drive uptake of LNPs into cells. Once internalized in endosomes within cells, the LNPs are designed to escape the endosome and release their mRNA cargo into the cell cytoplasm, where the mRNA can be translated to make a protein and have the desired therapeutic effect. Any mRNA and LNP components that do not escape the endosome are typically delivered to lysosomes where they are degraded by the natural process of cellular digestion. Examples of tools we developed by using our platform include proprietary LNP formulations that address the steps of mRNA delivery, including cell uptake, endosomal escape, and subsequent lipid metabolism, and for avoidance of counterproductive interactions with the immune system. \nChemistry: Novel lipid chemistry to potentially improve safety and tolerability: \nOur proprietary LNP systems are designed to be highly tolerated and minimize any LNP vehicle-related toxicities with repeat administration \nin vivo\n. To overcome limitations of previous LNP formulations, we have engineered amino lipids to avoid the immune system and to be rapidly biodegradable relative to prior lipids. \nComposition: Proprietary LNPs enhance delivery efficiency: \nOur platform includes extensive in-house expertise in medicinal chemistry, which we have applied to design large libraries of novel lipids. Using these libraries in combination with our discovery biology capabilities, we have conducted high throughput screens for desired LNP properties and believe that we have made fundamental discoveries in preclinical studies about the relationships between structural motifs of lipids and LNP performance for protein expression. \nSurface properties: Novel LNP design to avoid immune recognition: \nWe have designed our proprietary LNP systems for sustained pharmacology upon repeat dosing by eliminating or altering features that activate the immune system. These are based on insights into the surface properties of LNPs. Upon repeated dosing, surface features on traditional LNPs such as amino lipids, phospholipids, and PEG-lipids, can be recognized by the immune system, leading to rapid clearance from the bloodstream, a decrease in potency upon repeat dosing, and an increase in inflammation.\n \nBased on our insights into these mechanisms, we have engineered our LNP systems to reduce or eliminate undesirable surface features. In clinical studies for our systemic therapeutic product candidates that use our novel LNP systems, we have been able to repeat dose with negligible or undetectable loss in potency, liver damage, and immune system activation.\nOur platform: Manufacturing process science\nWe invest significantly in manufacturing process science to impart more potent features to our mRNA and LNPs, and to invent the technological capabilities necessary to manufacture our mRNA medicines at scales ranging from micrograms to kilograms, as well as achieve pharmaceutical properties such as solubility and shelf life. We view developing these goals of manufacturing and pharmaceutical properties as appropriate for each program, based on its stage of development.\nmRNA manufacturing process: Improving pharmacology: \nOur platform creates mRNA using a cell-free approach called \nin vitro\n transcription in which an RNA polymerase enzyme binds to and transcribes a DNA template, adding the nucleotides encoded by the DNA to the growing RNA strand. Following transcription, we employ proprietary purification techniques to ensure that our mRNA is free from undesired synthesis components and impurities that could activate the immune system in an indiscriminate manner. Applying our understanding of the basic science underlying each step in the manufacturing process, we have designed proprietary manufacturing processes to impart desirable pharmacologic features, for example increasing potency in a vaccine. \nLNP manufacturing process: Improving pharmacology:\n Our platform technology includes synthetic processes to produce LNPs. Traditionally LNPs are assembled by dissolving the four molecular components, amino lipid, phospholipid, cholesterol, and PEG-lipid, in ethanol and then mixing this with mRNA in an aqueous buffer. The resulting mixture is then purified to isolate LNPs from impurities. Such impurities include molecular components that have not been incorporated into particles, un-encapsulated mRNA that could activate the immune system, and particles outside of the desired size range.\n \nGoing beyond optimization of traditional manufacturing processes, we have invested in understanding and measuring the various biochemical and physical interactions during LNP assembly and purification. We have additionally developed state-of-the-art analytical techniques necessary to characterize our LNPs and biological systems to analyze their \nin vitro\n and \nin vivo\n performance. With these insights, we have identified manufacturing process parameters that drive LNP performance, for example, the potency in a secreted therapeutic setting. These insights have allowed us to make significant improvements in the efficiency of our processing and the potency of our LNPs. \n10\nTable of Contents\nHarnessing the power of mRNA through modalities \nWithin our platform, we invest in science to invent novel ways to deliver mRNA into various cell types. Each novel delivery system is a new application, called a “modality.” While the programs within a modality may target diverse diseases, they share similar mRNA characteristics and manufacturing processes to achieve shared product features.  \nWe believe that the high technological correlation within a modality allows us to rapidly accelerate the expansion of programs within that modality based on learnings from the earlier programs, while the lower technology correlation between modalities allows us to compartmentalize the technology risks. Additionally, because programs within a modality pursue diverse diseases, they often have uncorrelated biology risk. New modalities and product candidates can create a network effect by helping us gain additional insight into the other programs in our pipeline. \nAlthough developing a new modality is difficult, time-consuming and expensive, we believe our experience and technology provide us with unique advantages in the development of mRNA medicines. Over the last decade, we have developed a number of modalities, each with one or many product candidates in the clinic. We believe that our ongoing investments in our platform will lead to the identification of additional modalities and expand the utility of our existing modalities and the diversity of our pipeline. \nOUR PIPELINE\nOver the last decade, we have advanced in parallel a diverse development pipeline that currently consists of 44 therapeutic and vaccine programs, eleven of which are in late-stage development. The scope of our pipeline reflects the breadth of biology addressable using mRNA technology, and spans four franchises: respiratory virus vaccines, latent and other vaccines, oncology therapeutics, and rare disease therapeutics. \nOur selection process for advancing new product candidates reflects both program-specific and portfolio-wide considerations. Program-specific criteria include, among other relevant factors, the severity of the unmet medical need, the biology risk of our chosen target or disease, the feasibility of clinical development, the costs of development and the commercial opportunity. Portfolio-wide considerations include the ability to demonstrate technical success for our platform components within a modality, thereby increasing the probability of success and learnings for subsequent programs. We are currently focusing our efforts on delivering up to ten prioritized products over the next three years to drive sales growth and fund the next wave of research and development investment.\nThe diversity of proteins made from mRNA within our development pipeline is shown in the figure below.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOur full pipeline is shown in the figure below:\n12\nTable of Contents\nRESPIRATORY FRANCHISE \nWe have two commercial respiratory virus vaccines—Spikevax (our COVID vaccine) and mRESVIA (our RSV vaccine for older adults). Additionally, we have achieved four positive Phase 3 data readouts for our next-generation COVID vaccine (mRNA-1283), our RSV vaccine for high-risk adults aged 18 to 59 (mRNA-1345), our seasonal flu+COVID vaccine (mRNA-1083), and our seasonal flu vaccine (mRNA-1010). We have a total of 15 respiratory programs in our current portfolio, summarized below.\nCOVID vaccines (Spikevax/mRNA-1273, next-generation mRNA-1283) \nSpikevax is approved for use in jurisdictions globally. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus that was first identified in humans in 2019, driving a global pandemic resulting in millions of deaths. The risk of mortality increases with age and the risk of severe disease and mortality increases for persons with certain pre-existing diseases or comorbid conditions, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic lung disease and obesity.\n \nAs the SARS-CoV-2 virus continues to evolve, Spikevax continues to be a key tool in fighting COVID-19. As part of our strategy to continue to combat COVID-19, we develop and assess variant-specific versions of our COVID vaccine. In August and September 2024, we received regulatory approvals in major markets for our updated COVID vaccine, targeting the JN.1 (mRNA-1273.167) and KP.2 (mRNA-1273.712) subvariants of SARS-CoV-2, based on the new variant composition requests from different public health bodies. We developed JN.1 and KP.2 formulations of mRNA-1273 in accordance with regulatory guidance, with the goal of broadening vaccine-induced immunity and providing protection against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. We have also observed preliminary clinical trial data showing that these vaccines generate a robust immune response (cross-neutralization) against currently circulating variants of SARS-CoV-2.\nThe FDA has approved Spikevax for individuals 12 years and older, and granted Emergency Use Authorization for individuals aged six months through 11 years. Spikevax has also been authorized for individuals six months and older in other key markets, including the European Union (EU), Canada and Japan.\nForward-looking references to our COVID vaccine in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may include future modifications to mRNA-1273 or other product candidates that are designed to provide protection against variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. \nIn addition to Spikevax, we have advanced other COVID vaccine candidates into the clinic as part of our effort to fight the evolving SARS-CoV-2 virus. In June 2024, we announced positive Phase 3 efficacy data for our next-generation COVID vaccine, mRNA-1283. In September 2024, we shared additional data for mRNA-1283, which included non-inferior relative vaccine efficacy (rVE) compared to Spikevax. We filed for FDA approval for mRNA-1283 in 2024 using a priority review voucher, and have been assigned a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) goal date of May 31, 2025. Our goal with mRNA-1283 is to facilitate easier distribution and administration by healthcare providers, as it is designed to have enhanced stability in refrigerated conditions and packaged in pre-filled syringes. \nAs SARS-CoV-2 evolves, we continue to perform continuous epidemiological monitoring, genomic surveillance and risk assessments of variants of concern to determine which new variants may have the ability to circumvent immunity provided by currently approved COVID vaccines. For variants that appear to be growing in circulation and have evolved the ability to evade immunity, we proactively develop new product candidates. We have taken several of these candidates to clinical trials, and our monitoring activities allow for expedited delivery of new vaccines in the event that regulatory agencies request specific vaccine composition updates to address public health needs.\nRSV vaccine (mRESVIA/mRNA-1345)\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one of the most common causes of lower respiratory disease in children under the age of five and in older adults. Populations that are especially vulnerable to developing severe RSV infections include infants, young children, children and adults with chronic medical conditions and older adults. Most children are infected at least once by age two. In the United States, it is estimated that over two million children younger than five receive medical attention and up to 80,000 are hospitalized due to RSV infection annually. RSV also causes a substantial burden of respiratory illness in older adults. RSV infection causes up to 160,000 hospitalizations and up to 10,000 deaths per year in adults aged 65 years or older in the United States.\nWe are developing an RSV vaccine (mRNA-1345) for children, pregnant women and adults. mRNA-1345 encodes an engineered form of the RSV F protein stabilized in the prefusion conformation and is formulated in our proprietary LNP. In May 2024, we announced the FDA approved mRNA-1345, brand name mRESVIA, for the prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract disease (RSV-LRTD) in adults 60 years or older. Subsequently, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) issued a recommendation for all unvaccinated people aged 75 years and older and unvaccinated people aged 60 to 74 who are at increased risk for RSV to receive the vaccine for the prevention of RSV-associated LRTD and acute respiratory disease. mRESVIA was approved in \n13\nTable of Contents\nthe EU in August 2024 and in Canada in November 2024 for the same indication and ages. It has been approved in additional jurisdictions globally.\nIn September 2024, we announced that our Phase 3 (P303) study designed to test immunogenicity and safety in high-risk adults aged 18 to 59 met all primary immunogenicity endpoints and was well-tolerated with no safety concerns identified. We filed a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for U.S. approval in December 2024 to extend the indicated age range of mRNA-1345 to high-risk adults 18 to 59 years old using a priority review voucher, and have been assigned a PDUFA goal date of June 12, 2025. A Type II Variation in the EU and a Supplemental New Drug Submission in Canada were also filed in January 2025 for extension of the indication in those countries to high-risk adults 18 to 59 years old. \nWe have additional Phase 3 studies that have generated data in adults to explore co-administration with licensed flu or COVID vaccines, revaccination with mRNA-1345, and expansion to adults aged 18 and older who are immunocompromised due to solid organ transplant. In pediatrics, mRNA-1345 has ongoing safety follow up in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, and we are conducting a Phase 2 study in maternal populations. In the third quarter of 2024, we announced the discontinuation of our program of RSV in infants (seronegative, <2 years).\nSeasonal influenza vaccines (mRNA-1010, mRNA-1011, mRNA-1012, mRNA-1020 and mRNA-1030) \nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that seasonal influenza viruses cause three to five million cases of severe illness and 290,000 to 650,000 deaths each year, resulting in a severe challenge to public health. Currently licensed seasonal influenza vaccines rarely exceed 60% overall effectiveness and can provide low effectiveness during years when the circulating viruses do not match the strains selected for the vaccine antigens. \nOur mRNA seasonal influenza vaccine program is taking an iterative approach to development. Our first-generation seasonal influenza vaccine candidate (mRNA-1010) encodes for the hemagglutinin (HA) proteins of the strains recommended by the WHO. We are intending to subsequently improve upon the first-generation candidate through inclusion of additional HA antigens that could provide expanded coverage of co-circulating strains, as well as broadening protection through the addition of another influenza protein, the neuraminidase (NA). We also aim to work with the WHO, regulators and public health authorities to enable strain selection closer to the influenza season to provide a better match to the circulating viruses.\nThe inclusion of additional HA antigens is being tested in our mRNA-1011/1012 programs, and the addition of NA antigens is being tested in our mRNA-1020/1030 programs. We aim to ultimately combine both approaches into a single next-generation vaccine. Phase 1/2 studies for our mRNA-1011/1012 and mRNA-1020/1030 programs have been initiated and interim results have been presented at scientific meetings.\nIn February 2023, we announced interim results from the P301 study of mRNA-1010. The results indicated that mRNA-1010 achieved higher seroconversion rates for A/H3N2 and A/H1N1, as well as superiority on geometric mean titer ratios for A/H3N2 and non-inferiority on geometric mean titer rations for A/H1N1. Non-inferiority was not met for either endpoints for the influenza B/Victoria- or B/Yamagata-lineage strains. mRNA-1010 showed an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. In April 2023, we announced the P302 study of mRNA-1010 did not accrue sufficient cases at the interim efficacy analysis to declare early success in the Phase 3 Northern Hemisphere efficacy trial. In September 2023, we announced the P303 immunogenicity and safety study of mRNA-1010 met all 8 co-primary endpoints with an updated formulation that was able to generate an improved immune response to influenza B strains. mRNA-1010 also elicited higher titers than the licensed comparator against all strains in this study. In September 2024, we shared results in an older adult extension study of P303, where mRNA-1010 met all primary immunogenicity endpoints, including superiority for all strains, compared to a licensed enhanced flu vaccine and showed an acceptable reactogenicity profile. We also announced that we are no longer pursuing an accelerated approval pathway for mRNA-1010, and plan to start a confirmatory vaccine efficacy study, funded by project financing through Blackstone Life Sciences, a partnership we announced earlier in 2024. We have initiated the two-season Phase 3 efficacy study (P304) for mRNA-1010.\nCombination vaccines (mRNA-1083 and mRNA-1365)\nWe are developing combination vaccine candidates to simplify and facilitate protection against a range of respiratory diseases. \nmRNA-1083, our next-generation COVID and seasonal influenza combination vaccine, encodes the same antigens as our updated seasonal influenza vaccine (mRNA-1010) and our next-generation COVID vaccine (mRNA-1283). In June 2024, we announced that our Phase 3 clinical trial of mRNA-1083 met its primary endpoints, eliciting higher immune responses against influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 than licensed flu and COVID vaccines in adults 50 years and older, including an enhanced influenza vaccine in adults 65 years and older. We filed for FDA approval for mRNA-1083 in November 2024. We have also filed mRNA-1083 for approval in other geographies including the EU, Canada, Australia and the UK. Demonstration of vaccine efficacy in our ongoing Phase 3 \n14\nTable of Contents\nmRNA-1010 flu study may be required to support approval of mRNA-1083 in some markets. In addition, we are preparing to start a Phase 2 study evaluating the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1083 in adults aged 18 to 64.\nSafety follow-up continues in our Phase 1 study for mRNA-1365 in children five to 23 months of age.\nWe are evaluating a new COVID, seasonal flu and RSV combination vaccine using our updated mRNA-1010 composition as well as our next-generation COVID vaccine (mRNA-1283), and are planning development in older adults. We also plan to evaluate an updated version of mRNA-1365, our RSV and hMPV combination vaccine in older adults.\nWe have discontinued development of mRNA-1230, our first-generation COVID, seasonal flu and RSV combination vaccine, and mRNA-1045, our seasonal flu and RSV combination vaccine.\nPandemic influenza vaccine (mRNA-1018) \nAn influenza pandemic is a global outbreak of a new influenza A virus that is very different from current and recently circulating human seasonal influenza A viruses. Pandemic strains can arise by antigenic shift, which is the exchange of genetic segments between a (non-human) influenza virus with another influenza virus; this can occur through a simultaneous infection of an animal (e.g., swine) or humans with multiple influenza viruses. \nWe are developing a pandemic influenza vaccine candidate that encodes for hemagglutinin (HA) glycoproteins with the support of Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). In 2023, we initiated a Phase 1/2 study to generate safety and immunogenicity data of our investigational pandemic influenza vaccine (mRNA-1018) in healthy adults 18 years of age and older. The study includes vaccine candidates against H5 and H7 avian influenza viruses.\nIn July 2024, we announced a project award of $176 million through the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) to accelerate the development of mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines. In January 2025, the agreement was expanded through the RRPV, funded by BARDA. The agreement provides additional funding up to $590 million to support the late-stage development and licensure of mRNA-based pre-pandemic influenza vaccines. In addition, the funding will enable the expansion of clinical studies for up to five subtypes of pandemic influenza, enhancing our preparedness to address emerging public health threats. \nLATENT AND OTHER FRANCHISE\nWe have prioritized the development of vaccines against two latent and other viruses with unmet or underserved needs: our vaccine against cytomegalovirus (CMV) (mRNA-1647) and our trivalent norovirus vaccine (mRNA-1403). We have a total of 14 latent and other virus vaccines programs in our current portfolio, summarized below.\nVaccines against latent viruses\nCMV vaccine (mRNA-1647)\nCMV is a common human pathogen and member of the herpes virus family. Congenital CMV (cCMV) results when infected mothers transmit the virus to their unborn child and it is the leading infectious cause of birth defects in the United States. cCMV infection is well-established to occur at a rate of approximately 1 in 200 live births or 0.5%. As a result, the total number of infants in the U.S. born each year who are infected with cCMV fall within the range of 14,400-20,500. There is currently no available vaccine for CMV and a vaccine that leads to durable immunity in women of child-bearing age would address a critical unmet need in the prevention of congenital CMV infection. \nOur CMV vaccine candidate, mRNA-1647, combines six mRNAs in one vaccine. These six mRNAs encode proteins located on the surface of CMV: five mRNAs encode the subunits that form the membrane-bound pentamer complex and one mRNA encodes the full-length membrane-bound glycoprotein B (gB). Both pentamer and gB are essential for CMV to infect barrier epithelial surfaces and gain access to the body, which is the first step in CMV infection. mRNA-1647 is designed to produce an immune response against both pentamer and gB for the prevention of CMV infection, which could reduce the risk of birth defects and post-transplant infections.\nWe are conducting an ongoing pivotal Phase 3 study for mRNA-1647, known as CMVictory, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1647 against primary CMV infection in female participants 16 to 40 years of age. The study is fully enrolled and accruing cases. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) met to review the initial study data in December 2024, and informed us that the criterion for early efficacy was not met. The DSMB recommended that the study continue as planned. We remain blinded and anticipate final efficacy data from the study in 2025. \n15\nTable of Contents\nWe are also conducting a Phase 1/2 study of mRNA-1647 in participants 9 to 15 years of age. The study is enrolling and will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1647 to inform the selection of a dose level for subsequent development in this age group.\n \nAdditionally, in April 2023 we announced that a Phase 2 proof-of-concept study for mRNA-1647 in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients had started enrollment. Enrollment is ongoing.\nEBV vaccine (mRNA-1189 and mRNA-1195)\nEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the herpesvirus family that infects approximately 90% of people in the U.S. by adulthood, with primary infection typically occurring during childhood or late adolescence (approximately 50% and 89% seropositivity, respectively). EBV is the major cause of infectious mononucleosis, accounting for over 90% of the cases in the U.S. each year. Infectious mononucleosis can debilitate patients for weeks to months and, in some cases, can lead to hospitalization due to complications such as splenic rupture. EBV infection is also associated with the development and progression of certain lymphoproliferative disorders, cancers and autoimmune diseases. In particular, EBV infection and infectious mononucleosis are associated with increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. MS is the most common neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system, affecting approximately 2.8 million individuals worldwide of which approximately 1 million live in the U.S. MS leads to progressive disability, with profound socioeconomic impact on the patients, caregivers and the healthcare system.\nWe are developing two EBV vaccine candidates—a vaccine to prevent infectious mononucleosis (mRNA-1189) and a vaccine to prevent or treat the longer-term sequelae of EBV infection (mRNA-1195). We believe that an effective EBV vaccine must generate an immune response against antigens that are required for viral entry and reactivation in susceptible cell types. mRNA-1189 is designed to elicit an immune response to EBV envelope glycoproteins, which are required for infection of both epithelial and B cells. mRNA-1195 encodes for entry glycoproteins and latent antigens aimed at inducing an antibody and T cell response, and will be investigated in the context of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders and multiple sclerosis.\nWe are conducting Phase 1, randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled studies of mRNA-1189 and mRNA-1195. The primary purpose of these studies is to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates. In March 2024, we shared Phase 1 data for mRNA-1189, where the randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study showed mRNA-1189 was immunogenic and generally well tolerated across all dose levels.\n \nWe have since initiated a dose finding Phase 2 study for mRNA-1189 that is currently in active enrollment. Our Phase 1 study for mRNA-1195 is ongoing, and we announced in March 2024 that the first part of the study was fully enrolled.\nHSV vaccine (mRNA-1608)\nHerpes simplex viruses (HSV), commonly known as herpes, are categorized into two types: HSV-1 primarily spreads by oral contact and is most commonly associated with cold sores, while HSV-2 spreads through sexual contact and is the main cause of recurrent genital herpes. Both viruses establish life-long latent infections within nearby sensory neurons from which they can reactivate and re-infect the skin. There is a significant burden of disease from HSV genital infections. Diagnosed, symptomatic genital herpes causes a reduction in quality of life, which antivirals (current standard of care) only partially restore. In the United States, approximately 18.6 million adults aged 18 to 49 years are living with HSV-2. Globally, an estimated 520 million persons have HSV-2 infection, representing 13% of the world’s population aged 15 to 49 years. We believe that an HSV vaccine could offer significant therapeutic benefit to patients, improve treatment compliance and quality of life. We aim to induce a strong antibody response with neutralizing and effector functionality combined with cell-mediated immunity.\nWe are conducting a Phase 1/2, randomized, observer-blind, controlled, dose-ranging study of mRNA-1608, our HSV vaccine candidate against recurrent HSV-2 disease, in health adults 18 to 55 years of age with recurrent HSV-2 genital herpes. The primary purpose of this study is to assess safety and immunogenicity data, and establish a proof-of-concept of clinical benefit. In March 2024, we announced that this study is fully enrolled with over 300 participants in the U.S.\nVZV vaccine (mRNA-1468)\nHerpes zoster, also known as shingles, is caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus (VZV) and occurs in approximately one in three adults in their lifetime, with incidence significantly increasing after 50 years of age. Protective immunity against VZV wanes as the immune system ages, allowing reactivation of the virus from latently infected neurons, causing painful and itchy lesions. Serious herpes zoster complications include postherpetic neuralgia (10-13% of herpes zoster cases), bacterial coinfections and cranial and peripheral palsies; 1-4% of individuals with herpes zoster cases are hospitalized for complications. Severity of disease and likelihood of complications, including postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) also increases with age. People with immunocompromising conditions, people using immunosuppressive therapies, people living with HIV, and hematopoietic stem cell (HSCT) and solid organ transplant \n16\nTable of Contents\n(SOT) recipients have an increased risk of developing herpes zoster. The current standard of care for prevention of shingles is Shingrix, an FDA-approved vaccine for use in adults 50 years and older, and other patients at increased risk for shingles due to immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by known disease or therapy. Shingrix was found to be more than 90% efficacious against herpes zoster in adults aged 50 to 70 over more than three years of follow-up in pivotal trials, with only a slight reduction in efficacy in adults over age 70.\nWe are conducting an ongoing Phase 1/2, randomized, observer-blind, active-controlled, dose-ranging study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mRNA-1468, compared head-to-head with Shingrix, in healthy adults, aged 50 years and older. The first participant was dosed in February 2023 and enrollment of 500 participants was completed in June 2023. Subsequently, we expanded the study to evaluate two additional dose levels, with enrollment now totaling over 650 participants. In March 2024, we presented initial data from a Phase 1/2 trial, which showed that mRNA-1468 elicited strong antigen-specific T cell responses at one month after the second dose and was generally well-tolerated. Results of the first interim analysis support the further clinical development of mRNA-1468 for the prevention of shingles.\nHIV vaccine (mRNA-1644 and mRNA-1574)\nHIV is the virus responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a lifelong, progressive illness with no effective cure. Approximately 38 million people worldwide are currently living with HIV, with 1.2 million in the U.S. Approximately 1.5 million new infections of HIV are acquired worldwide every year and approximately 680,000 people die annually due to complications from HIV/AIDS. The primary routes of transmission are sexual intercourse and IV drug use, putting young adults at the highest risk of infection. From 2000 to 2015, a total of $562.6 billion globally was spent on care, treatment and prevention of HIV, representing a significant economic burden.\nWe are developing two HIV vaccine candidates—mRNA-1644 and mRNA-1574—both of which are in Phase 1 clinical trials. In collaboration with the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), NIAID and the Gates Foundation, mRNA-1644 is testing a novel HIV vaccine strategy in humans as delivered by mRNA to elicit broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibodies (bnAbs) through sequential vaccination of novel prime and boost antigens that induce specific B-cell responses. In collaboration with IAVI, Scripps, NIH and the HIV Vaccine Trials Network, mRNA-1574 is testing multiple native-like HIV trimer mRNAs in humans to improve our understanding of how to make stable and immunogenic native-HIV trimers. \nVaccines against enteric viruses\nNorovirus vaccines (mRNA-1403 and mRNA-1405) \nNorovirus is the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis (AGE), responsible for approximately 1 in 5 of all AGE cases worldwide and resulting in substantial health care burden. Annually, norovirus causes an estimated 677 million AGE cases and 213,000 deaths globally, including more than 70,000 deaths in children under the age of five. The global economic impact is estimated at $64.5 billion per year. The incidence of norovirus AGE is highest among young children, while disease severity is most pronounced in young children, older adults, and individuals with underlying medical conditions. In high-income settings such as the U.S., deaths are concentrated among older adults. Norovirus is highly infectious and difficult to control, often causing large and costly outbreaks in closed or semi-closed settings, including daycares, schools, cruise ships, long term care facilities and healthcare institutions. In the U.S., norovirus accounts for an estimated 20 million infections, 100,000 hospitalizations and 900 deaths annually, with an associated economic cost of approximately $10.6 billion. The burden of norovirus among older adults is expected to rise alongside societal aging and the rising demand for institutionalized care.  \nNorovirus has broad genetic diversity; the virus is classified into 10 genogroups and 49 genotypes, 30 of which are known to infect humans. Vaccine development has been challenging to date for many reasons, including the lack of a robust cell culture system, no reliable immune markers of norovirus protection and the broad and shifting diversity of genotypes. A multivalent vaccine with broad genotype coverage is needed to maximize protection against the genotypes most frequently associated with AGE in young children and older adults.\nWe are currently developing pentavalent (mRNA-1405) and trivalent (mRNA-1403) vaccine candidates for norovirus. Both candidates were reviewed in a Phase 1 study to evaluate safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity in healthy adult participants 18 to 49 years of age and 60 to 80 years of age. Approximately 660 participants were enrolled in the Phase 1 study, and dosing was completed in December 2023. In March 2024, we presented data demonstrating that a single dose of trivalent vaccine candidate mRNA-1403 was well-tolerated across all dose levels evaluated and elicited robust antibody responses against vaccine-matched norovirus genogroup I & II selected genotypes, including functional HBGA-blocking antibodies. In September 2024, we presented additional data that mRNA-1403 elicited robust histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) blocking antibody titers against a second strain in genotype II in older and younger adults. \n17\nTable of Contents\nIn September 2024, we began dosing participants in a Phase 3 study of mRNA-1403. This Phase 3 trial is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of mRNA-1403. The trial aims to enroll up to 30,000 participants 18 years of age and older globally, across countries in the Northern Hemisphere (U.S., Canada, UK, Japan), and Panama and Australia. Up to 25,000 participants 60 years of age and older and up to 5,000 participants between 18 and 59 years of age will be enrolled to assess the ability of mRNA-1403 to protect against virus-matched moderate to severe norovirus AGE, with a focus on the older adult age group that is at greatest risk of severe outcomes including hospitalization and death. \nThe two-season Phase 3 study of mRNA-1403 is fully enrolled in the Northern Hemisphere and we are preparing second season enrollment in the Southern Hemisphere. The trial is currently on FDA clinical hold following a single adverse event report of a case of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which is currently under investigation. We do not expect an impact on the study's efficacy readout timeline as enrollment in the Northern Hemisphere has already been completed. \nBacterial vaccines\nLyme vaccines (mRNA-1975 and mRNA-1982)\nLyme disease is an illness caused by Borrelia bacteria, and is usually spread from the bite of a tick carrying the bacteria. Lyme disease affects approximately 120,000 people annually in the U.S. and Europe, with incidence increasing due to expanding tick territories driven by rising temperatures. The disease burden follows a bimodal age distribution, predominantly impacting children under 15 and older adults. Symptoms include rash, fever, headaches, fatigue, joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and headaches. While no vaccines are currently approved, prior Phase 3 trials of outer surface protein A (OspA) antigen-based vaccines achieved efficacy up to 92%, with protection linked to high levels of antigen-specific antibodies.\nWe are conducting a randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging Phase 1/2 trial in healthy participants aged 18 to 70. This trial evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of a heptavalent (mRNA-1975) and monovalent (mRNA-1982) approach in parallel. mRNA-1982 targets Borrelia burgdorferi, responsible for nearly all Lyme cases in the U.S., while mRNA-1975 targets the four major Borrelia species causing disease in the U.S. and Europe.\nNo safety concerns have been identified across the evaluated dose levels for three injections of mRNA-1975/1982. Furthermore, three injections of mRNA-1975/1982 elicit robust anti-OspA IgG antibody responses, with titers up to ~1,300 times above baseline for OspA serotype 1 of Borrelia burgdorferi.\nPublic health vaccines\nZika vaccine (mRNA-1893)\nThe Zika virus is a single stranded RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family. Sero-epidemiology data suggest that it is endemic to regions of Africa and Asia, where the Aedes mosquito vectors are found. Zika virus is predominantly spread by mosquitos from the Aedes genus, but it can also be transmitted congenitally, sexually and through blood donation. Zika infection is usually asymptomatic or mild in adults, leading to fever, rash and conjunctivitis. However, infection of women during pregnancy can result in devastating fetal outcomes, including miscarriages, stillbirths, premature births, and congenital anomalies collectively known as congenital Zika syndrome (microcephaly, limb contractures, high muscle tone, eye abnormalities and hearing loss) in newborns. Microcephaly is a birth defect characterized by an abnormally small head and brain, associated with lifelong neurodevelopmental delay, seizures, intellectual disability, balance problems and dwarfism/short stature, resulting in significant disability and requiring lifelong support. In 2007, a Zika infection outbreak progressed across the Pacific islands. An outbreak observed in Brazil in 2015 soon spread across the Americas, which led the WHO to declare Zika a public health emergency of international concern in 2016. During the period, tens of thousands of cases of microcephaly and congenital Zika syndrome were reported in infants. Zika has also been associated with certain neurological sequelae, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, reported in adults.\nOur Zika vaccine candidate, mRNA-1893, encodes for the prME structural protein encapsulated in our proprietary LNP. In partnership with BARDA, we conducted Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. Results of the Phase 1 study were previously published. \nIn November 2024, we presented data from the randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, dose confirmation Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of three regimens of mRNA-1893: a single dose regimen (100 μg) or 2-dose regimens (30 μg or 100 μg given 28 days apart), in adults aged 18 to 65 living in flavivirus endemic and non-endemic areas. The trial enrolled 808 participants (approximately 200 participants per study arm) from the continental United States and Puerto Rico.\n \nThe main portion of the trial followed participants for 6 months after the last dose, with an optional extension phase for follow up to 22 months after last dose. Key findings from the main study showed that mRNA-1893 was generally safe and well tolerated, with no new safety concerns identified. Both 2-dose regimens (30 μg and 100 μg) elicited strong immune responses with no significant differences \n18\nTable of Contents\nin neutralizing antibody (nAb) geometric mean titers across baseline serostatus. Our data (up to end of main study) suggests that a single vaccination of mRNA-1893 in a flavivirus-experienced population may be sufficient to induce robust nAb\n \nresponses against Zika virus; in contrast, a prime-boost strategy with 2-doses of the mRNA-1893 will likely be required in a flavivirus-naive population to obtain a similar level of immunogenicity/protection.\nApproximately half of the main study participants opted in the extension phase, which was completed in 2024; data analysis of the extension phase will provide insight into the long-term safety and durability of immune response to mRNA-1893. At this time, we do not anticipate advancing the Zika program into further development in the absence of external funding.\nNipah vaccine (mRNA-1215) \nNipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus transmitted to humans from animals, contaminated food or through direct human-to-human transmission and causes a range of illnesses including fatal encephalitis. Severe respiratory and neurologic complications from NiV have no treatment other than intensive supportive care. The case fatality rate among those infected is estimated at 40-75%. NiV outbreaks cause significant economic burden to impacted regions due to loss of human life and interventions to prevent further spread, such as the slaughter of infected animals. NiV has been identified as the cause of isolated outbreaks in India, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Singapore since 2000 and is included on the WHO R&D Blueprint list of epidemic threats needing urgent research and development action. \nIn collaboration with the NIH-Vaccine Research Center (VRC), we are conducting an ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of mRNA-1215, our vaccine candidate against NiV, and testing will be focused on pandemic preparedness. This Phase 1 dose-escalation, open-label clinical trial is the first study of mRNA-1215 in healthy adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a NiV mRNA vaccine candidate. The trial is sponsored and funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID).\nMpox vaccine (mRNA-1769)\nMpox is an infectious viral disease that affects humans and some other animals. It is caused by the monkeypox virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, which also includes Variola virus, the causative agent of smallpox. Although smallpox was eradicated in 1977, continued protection from smallpox is of great interest given the lethality of the infection and potential for use as an agent of bioterrorism. Other viruses associated with the Orthopoxvirus genus include cowpox, rabbitpox and camelpox.\nThere are two subtypes of the monkeypox virus—Clade I and Clade II, with Clade I endemic in Central Africa and Clade II in West Africa. Clade I is historically associated with more severe disease and increased mortality. Prior to 2022, mpox outbreaks were primarily sporadic, driven by zoonotic spillover in endemic regions. Transmission occurs mainly through close contact with lesions, bodily fluids and contaminated surfaces. Respiratory transmission via face-to-face interaction is also possible. The incubation period ranges from three to 17 days, followed by characteristic progressive rash and systemic symptoms, including fever, chills, lymphadenopathy, fatigue, muscle ache and headache. In 2022, a global outbreak of the Clade II mpox virus was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern by the WHO. The outbreak resulted in more than 124,000 confirmed cases across 128 countries. The main mode of transmission during the 2022 global outbreak was sexual transmission. More recently, the Clade I monkeypox virus has also been linked to sexual transmission, during the ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and with reports of travel-related cases of Clade I in non-endemic areas (North America, Europe, Asia), there is concern that it may lead to further global outbreaks. \nThe current standard of care for mpox is JYNNEOS, which is approved by the FDA for the prevention of mpox and smallpox disease. Our mpox vaccine (mRNA-1769) expresses four antigens from the monkeypox virus and has been shown to provide protection against multiple routes of infection with monkeypox virus. In 2024, we published pre-clinical data showing that, in a stringent non-human primate model, mRNA-1769 resulted in lower lesions and reduced viral replication and induced enhanced neutralizing and functional antibodies compared to existing treatment. Additionally, neutralizing responses were found to cover a broad range of orthopox viruses, including ectromelia, rabbitpox, cowpox and camelpox viruses.\nWe are conducting a randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging, observer-blind Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of three dose levels of mRNA-1769 in healthy participants.\nONCOLOGY THERAPEUTICS FRANCHISE \nWithin our oncology therapeutics franchise, we are developing INT (mRNA-4157) in collaboration with Merck. We and Merck are targeting a variety of tumor types, with Phase 3 trials ongoing in adjuvant melanoma, adjuvant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and adjuvant NSCLC post neoadjuvant treatment. The Phase 3 clinical trial for adjuvant melanoma completed enrollment in 2024. We \n19\nTable of Contents\nand Merck also have multiple Phase 2 and earlier trials ongoing. We have a total of 8 oncology programs in our current portfolio, summarized below.\nIndividualized Neoantigen Therapy (INT) (mRNA-4157) \nAs tumors grow, they acquire mutations, some of which create new protein segments, or neoantigens, that can be presented on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules in the tumor and recognized as non-self by T cells. While some of these neoantigens could be shared across tumors, the majority are completely unique to an individual patient’s tumor, in addition the presentation of those neoantigens is also dependent on a patient’s specific HLA type. \nOur INT, mRNA-4157, uses next generation sequencing and a machine-learning based algorithm to design an mRNA that encodes up to 34 neoantigens against each individual patient’s tumor mutations with specificity to their HLA type, and is predicted to elicit both class I (CD8) and class II (CD4) responses. The neoantigens are encoded in a single mRNA sequence and formulated in our proprietary LNPs designed for intramuscular injection. INT is manufactured using an automated workflow to enable a rapid turnaround time. \nWe are developing mRNA-4157 in collaboration with Merck. In September 2022, Merck exercised its option for personalized cancer vaccines, including mRNA-4157, pursuant to the terms of our existing PCV Collaboration and License Agreement with Merck, which was amended and restated in 2018 (PCV Agreement, also referred to as the INT Agreement). Pursuant to the PCV Agreement, we and Merck will collaborate on further development and commercialization of mRNA-4157, and we will share costs and any profits and losses worldwide related to mRNA-4157 equally\n.\nIn December 2022, we announced that the randomized Phase 2 trial of mRNA-4157 had met its primary endpoint. The open-label Phase 2 study is investigating a 1 mg dose of mRNA-4157 in combination with Merck’s pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®), compared to pembrolizumab alone, for the adjuvant treatment of high-risk resected melanoma. The study showed that mRNA-4157 in combination with KEYTRUDA reduced the risk of recurrence or death by 44% (HR=0.56 [95% CI, 0.31-1.02]; one-sided p value=0.0266) compared with KEYTRUDA alone. The results were the first demonstration of efficacy for an investigational mRNA cancer treatment in a randomized clinical trial in melanoma. Adverse events observed were consistent with those previously reported in a Phase 1 clinical trial, which showed mRNA-4157 to be well-tolerated at all dose levels. \nIn February 2023, mRNA-4157 received a Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA, and in April 2023 mRNA-4157 received PRIME Scheme Designation from the EMA.   \nIn December 2023, we announced that at a planned median follow-up of approximately three years, mRNA-4157 in combination with KEYTRUDA showed sustained benefit, reducing the risk of recurrence or death by 49% (HR=0.510 [95% CI, 0.288-0.906]; one-sided nominal p=0.0095) and the risk of distant metastasis or death by 62% (HR=0.384 [95% CI, 0.172-0.858]; one-sided nominal p= 0.0077) compared to KEYTRUDA alone in stage III/IV melanoma patients with high risk of recurrence following complete resection. This data was presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in June 2024, as well as translational biomarker data that suggests mRNA-4157 may benefit a broad patient population, irrespective of the status of PD-L1, TMB, ctDNA, and HLA heterozygosity. Three-year exploratory endpoint data also showed an encouraging trend in overall survival (OS) with the combination versus pembrolizumab monotherapy. \nWe and Merck have rapidly expanded the INT program, initiating Phase 3 studies in the adjuvant setting in patients with high-risk melanoma and NSCLC, and the Phase 3 high-risk melanoma study completing enrollment in 2024. In 2024 we further expanded development into a Phase 3 allowing neoadjuvant treatment in patients with NSCLC; a Phase 2 adjuvant treatment in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC), or kidney cancer; a Phase 2 adjuvant treatment in patients with high-risk muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC); and a Phase 2/3 neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment in patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). \nCheckpoint adaptive immune modulation therapy (mRNA-4359)\nWe are developing a checkpoint adaptive immune modulation therapy (AIM-T) (mRNA-4359) that encodes Indoleamine \n2,3\n-dioxygenase (IDO) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antigens. We designed mRNA-4359 with the goal of stimulating effector T cells that target and kill suppressive immune and tumor cells that express the target antigens. Our initial indications for mRNA-4359 are advanced or metastatic cutaneous melanoma and NSCLC. \nWe presented data from the Phase 1a study of mRNA-4359 at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in 2024, where in a population of patients with heavily pre-treated, advanced stage cancers, eight of 16 response-evaluable patients achieved a best overall response (BOR) of stable disease.\n \nTranslational data showed antigen-specific T-cell responses were elicited by mRNA-4359 treatment; a proportion of activated, cytotoxic, and memory T cells were elevated and a proportion of regulatory T cells \n20\nTable of Contents\nand myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) were diminished on-treatment.\n \nmRNA-4359 monotherapy was tolerable at all dose levels tested with most adverse events of low grade (grade 1–2) and manageable. Enrollment in the phase 1b portion of the study, which studied mRNA-4359 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced or metastatic checkpoint inhibitor refractory melanoma and NSCLC, is complete and results will be submitted to a scientific congress for presentation. Following results of the Phase 1b study, we began enrollment of the Phase 2 portion of the study in June 2024.\nRARE DISEASE FRANCHISE\nIn our prioritized portfolio, we are pursuing rare disease therapies targeting two organic acidemias caused by deficient metabolic enzymes—propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA). We have a total of seven rare disease programs in our current portfolio, summarized below.  \nPropionic acidemia (PA) (mRNA-3927)\nPA is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder with significant morbidity and mortality, affecting one in 100,000-150,000 individuals worldwide. PA is caused by pathogenic variants in the propionyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (PCC) α or β subunits (PCCA and PCCB genes, respectively), leading to PCC deficiency and subsequent accumulation of toxic metabolites. PA is characterized by recurrent life-threatening metabolic decompensation events (MDEs) and multisystemic complications. Multisystemic complications include neurological manifestations, cardiomyopathy, arrythmias, growth retardation, recurrent pancreatitis, bone marrow suppression and predisposition to infection. Long-term, insults by toxic metabolites cause complications in various organs, and cognitive outcome is negatively correlated with the number of MDEs. Currently, there is no approved therapy for PA that targets the underlying root cause of the disease. \nOur PA therapy candidate, mRNA-3927, is a novel, IV-administered, LNP-encapsulated dual mRNA therapy that encodes for PCCA and PCCB subunit proteins to restore functional PCC enzyme activity in the liver. By encoding for intracellular proteins, mRNA therapy has a potential role in preventing and treating acute metabolic decompensations.\nThe global Phase 1/2 clinical trial for mRNA-3927, the Paramount Study, is ongoing and we have fully enrolled all five dose optimization cohorts, as well as a dose confirmation cohort. The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacology of mRNA-3927 in patients aged one year and older with PA. The primary endpoints are safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Secondary endpoints include incidence and severity of adverse events and change in plasma biomarkers: methylcitric acid (2-MC) and 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP). \nWe have received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation, Orphan Drug Designation and Fast Track Designation from the FDA and Orphan Designation from the European Commission for the PA program. \nSeveral critical milestones have been reached in the trial. mRNA-3927 has been generally well-tolerated to date with no events meeting protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity criteria. Early results suggest potential decreases in annualized MDE frequency compared to pre-treatment, and the majority of patients have elected to continue on the open label extension study.\n \nDue to the objective and disease-defining nature of MDEs, regulators have provided initial support for MDE as a clinically meaningful, preferred primary clinical endpoint for development. We began generating registrational trial data in the Phase 1/2 study in 2024.\nMethylmalonic acidemia (MMA) (mRNA-3705)\nMMA is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder with significant morbidity and mortality caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT). There are an estimated 500-2,000 people with MMA MUT deficiency in the United States based on estimated birth prevalence (0.3-1.2:100,000 newborns) and mortality rates. Mortality is significant, with mortality rates of 50% for those with complete MUT deficiency (mut 0) (median age of death 2 years) and 40% for MMA patients with partial MUT deficiency (mut -) (median age of death 4.5 years) reported in a large European study. MMA mainly affects the pediatric population and usually presents in the first few days or weeks of life. The occurrence of acute metabolic decompensations is the hallmark of the disorder and decompensations are typically more frequent in the first few years of life. Each decompensation is life-threatening and often requires hospitalization and management at an intensive care unit. Survivors often suffer from numerous complications including chronic renal failure and neurologic complications such as movement disorders, developmental delays, and seizures. Consequently, the health-related quality of life for MMA patients and their families is significantly impaired. There are currently no approved therapies that address the underlying defect for MMA. \nOur MMA therapy candidate, mRNA-3705, encodes for a missing or deficient hepatic enzyme. In an ongoing Phase 1/2 study, fifteen participants have been dosed. Thus far, all eligible participants have opted to participate in the Open-Label Extension study. To date, mRNA-3705 was generally well-tolerated to date with no discontinuations due to safety and no events meeting protocol-defined dose-limiting toxicity criteria. Initial data is encouraging, with reductions in methylmalonic acid and other pathway biomarkers in participants, particularly at doses of at least 0.4 mg/kg Q2W. Early results suggest potential decreases in annualized rates of MMA-related hospitalizations and MDEs compared to pre-treatment rates. We are working to identify an optimal dose and continue to \n21\nTable of Contents\nengage with the FDA, via the START Program, and other global regulators. We have agreed with the FDA on the pivotal study design, and we expect to start a registrational study in 2025.\n \nGlycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD1a) (mRNA-3745)\nGSD1a is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the catalytic activity of the intracellular protein glucose 6-phostphatase (G6Pase). GSD1a patients suffer from severe fasting hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, nephromegaly, lactic acidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, hypercholesterolemia, hepatic steatosis and growth retardation. In addition, hepatocellular adenomas occur in 70% to 80% of GSD1a patients by their third decade of life and carries risk of transformation into hepatocellular carcinomas. Proteinuria has been observed in over half of patients above 25 years of age. GSD1a occurs in approximately 1:100,000 live births in the United States and the EU but is more common in Ashkenazi Jews where the incidence is reported to be 1:20,000 live births. There are an estimated 2,500 people in the United States and over 4,000 people in the EU with GSD1a. Although strict diet therapy, including frequent feeding with uncooked cornstarch, allows GSD1a patients to live into adulthood by preventing hypoglycemia, the underlying pathological processes remain uncorrected resulting in the development of many long-term complications including liver adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma.\nOur GSD1a therapy candidate, mRNA-3745, consists of an mRNA encoding for modified human G6Pase, and has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). A Phase 1/2 study to evaluate the safety and pharmacology of mRNA-3745 in GSD1a patients 18 years of age and older is ongoing. We have observed encouraging signs of clinical benefit with mRNA-3745.\nOrnithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency (mRNA-3139)\nOrnithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency (OTCD) is an X-linked recessive disorder that is the most common urea cycle disorders (UCDs) in humans. OTCD prevents the breakdown and excretion of ammonia, allowing ammonia to accumulate, rising to toxic levels where it affects the central nervous system. With an incidence of approximately 1:57,000 live births, OTCD accounts for nearly half of all UCDs. OTCD causes high mortality and morbidity, particularly in males.\nOur OTCD therapy candidate, mRNA-3139, is in preclinical development. mRNA-3139 is a chronic intravenous, mRNA, enzyme replacement therapy for OTCD, which may act as a bridge to liver transplant or a standalone therapeutic depending on efficacy. mRNA-3139 uses the same LNP as in our GSD1a program.\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) (mRNA-3210)\nPKU is a rare inherited metabolic disease, affecting approximately 40,000 patients in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK. Mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene encoding the PAH enzyme result in the inability to metabolize the essential amino acid Phe to Tyr in the liver. There is a high unmet medical need for patients with PKU with early and continuous treatment throughout life being fundamental to prevent the development of irreversible neuropsychiatric outcomes.\nWe determined that the product profile of our preclinical candidate, mRNA-3210, did not meet our criteria to move into the clinic. We are evaluating other preclinical assets for this indication.  \nCrigler-Najjar Syndrome Type 1 (CN-1) (mRNA-3351)\nCN-1 is a severe condition caused by the mutations in the UGT1A1 gene. CN-1 is characterized by high levels of a toxic substance called bilirubin in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia). It is caused by mutations in the UGT1A1 gene, which results in an inability to break down bilirubin, a substance made by the liver. Without the UGT1A1 enzyme, bilirubin can build up in the body and lead to jaundice and damage to the brain, muscles and nerves. The symptoms become apparent shortly after birth and can be life-threatening. It is estimated that there are only approximately 70-100 known cases of CN-1 in the world. Affected individuals rely on current standard of care, phototherapy treatments of up to 12 hours a day, throughout life. The only definitive treatment is liver transplant, which is associated with its own set of side effects and risk of death.\nOur CN-1 therapy candidate, mRNA-3351, consists of an mRNA encoding human UGT1A1 encapsulated in our proprietary LNPs. It is designed to restore the missing or dysfunctional protein that causes CN-1. We have licensed mRNA-3351 to Institute for Life Changing Medicines (ILCM) with no upfront fees and without any downstream payments. The goal of the collaboration is to make an mRNA therapy for the treatment of CN-1 available at no cost to patients. We are collaborating with the ILCM in developing a preclinical package for Investigational New Drug application and Clinical Trial Application filings. ILCM will be responsible for the clinical development of mRNA-3351.\n22\nTable of Contents\nCystic Fibrosis (CF) (mRNA-3692/VX-522)\nCF is a rare genetic disease, which is progressive from birth and leads to multi-organ damage and early death due to lung dysfunction. It is caused by the mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which results in the loss of CFTR chloride ion channel function. This decreased function of CFTR at the cell surface leads to thick, sticky mucus in multiple organ systems but most pathologically the lungs. There are approximately 92,000 patients living with cystic fibrosis in the United States, Europe, Australia and Canada, with over 5,000 of these patients not being able to benefit from the approved CFTR modulators. \nWe are collaborating with Vertex on our CF candidate, mRNA-3692/VX-522, which is designed to treat the underlying cause of CF by enabling cells in the lungs to produce functional CFTR protein for the treatment of the 10% of patients who do not produce any modulator-responsive CFTR protein. This would be our first demonstration of a nebulized mRNA therapy. The FDA has granted VX-522 Fast Track designation.\nThe multiple ascending dose (MAD) portion of the Phase 1/2 study of VX-522 is underway, with data expected in the first half of 2025.\nPROGRAMS DISCONTINUED IN 2024\nAs a result of portfolio prioritization and emerging clinical data, we elected to discontinue a number of programs in 2024 as we focus our research and development efforts. We do not have current plans for future development of the following programs:\n•\nmRNA-0184: Relaxin (program wrapping up Phase 1)\n•\nmRNA-1045: Seasonal flu and RSV combination vaccine\n•\nmRNA-1230: First-generation COVID, seasonal flu and RSV combination vaccine \n•\nmRNA-1287: Endemic HCoV (the preclinical program will not advance to Phase 1)\n•\nmRNA-1345 and mRNA-1365: We have discontinued RSV development in children < 2 years (seronegative)\n•\nmRNA-6981: PD-L1 (the preclinical program will not advance to Phase 1)\n•\nmRNA-5671: KRAS antigen-specific therapy (no further development plans)\n•\nmRNA-2752: OX40L/IL-23/IL-36\nγ\n (Triplet) (we have deprioritized further development based on emerging clinical data)\nMANUFACTURING \nManufacturing plays a critical role in our value chain and our ability to develop our medicines. Our manufacturing capabilities support every stage of the development of our products, from discovery to commercialization. During the research stage of product development, manufacturing provides mRNA drug substance and drug product for platform research and therapeutic area drug discovery. During early development of our product candidates, we manufacture mRNA and drug product for IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies and initial human clinical studies. For late clinical development, we produce mRNA and drug product for Phase 3 trials. At the commercial stage, we manufacture drug substance and drug product in collaboration with our contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs), both in the United States and internationally.\nOverview of our manufacturing operating model \nOur manufacturing activities generally focus on: \n•\nCommercial Production:\n Our manufacturing capabilities include state-of-the-art technologies for mRNA and drug substance manufacturing, as well as quality control testing to attain a robust and consistent supply that matches target product profiles. Our manufacturing technology is built to scale-up and support production of products for commercial approval. Our platform allows for efficient manufacturing at scale. \n•\nResearch and Development Support:\n The product supply enables platform research and drug discovery in our therapeutic and vaccine areas, in addition to activities related to clinical studies of our product candidates. \nWe have built a dedicated in-house, multi-building manufacturing campus in Norwood, Massachusetts, the Moderna Technology Center (MTC). In December 2024, we purchased the MTC campus, including the underlying land and buildings, providing greater operational flexibility and long-term stability in supporting our manufacturing and development capabilities. The MTC provides supply for our preclinical research, IND-enabling GLP toxicology study supplies, our Phase 1 and Phase 2 pipeline activities, later-stage clinical development activities (e.g., Phase 3 CMV vaccine clinical trials), as well as drug substance commercial production for vaccines. Our vaccine drug substance production for the U.S. market is completed at our MTC campus. The MTC has been designed to allow us to continue to optimize our mRNA products as we explore new pharmaceutical delivery forms in our manufacturing \n23\nTable of Contents\nnetwork such as prefilled syringes. The MTC campus has been designed with a high level of automation and state-of-the-art digital integration to handle manufacturing execution, product testing and release, and regulatory filings.  \nIn the second quarter of 2023, we acquired a newly constructed, \n140,000\n square feet biomanufacturing facility in Marlborough, Massachusetts. The facility is undergoing enhancements, including the addition of \n60,000\n square feet to the existing structure. We expect the facility to be operational in 2025. This new site is strategically intended to support our INT program.\nInternationally, we expect to bring state-of-the-art mRNA manufacturing facilities online in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in 2025. The government in each of these countries has entered into a multi-year commitment to purchase mRNA products from us once the covered respiratory vaccine products are approved and the local facilities are licensed for production. We expect that these local manufacturing facilities will provide direct access to rapid pandemic response capabilities and our respiratory virus vaccine candidates. We may seek to enter into future agreements with other governments to provide similar manufacturing capabilities in other geographies. \nIn addition to our internal manufacturing facilities, we also maintain relationships with CMOs in the United States and abroad, providing critical raw material production and fill-finish capacity for our vaccines.   \nManufacturing technology development \nTo support our broad pipeline of products, which spans multiple therapeutic areas and routes of administration, our platform research and technical development teams closely collaborate to facilitate rapid and seamless clinical translation of scientific breakthroughs. This enables us to develop potential medicines to serve a broad patient population. \nTechnical development encompasses the design and optimization of robust and consistent manufacturing processes, product characterization, fit-for-purpose formulations and product presentations. For instance, our novel hardware platforms’ automation and robotics, coupled with the flexibility of our in-house digital development systems, allows for thousands of experiments and process parameters across our projects, thus supporting our drug product pharmaceutical readiness. Moreover, our recent technical manufacturing advances have enabled internalization of new key capabilities, including DNA plasmids and small molecules. \nIn parallel, we continue to refine existing processes, resulting in increased manufacturing capabilities. These improvements allow us better control over our supply chain, resulting in larger production yields and longer shelf life of our products. Furthermore, formulation development advancements have added new drug product images, including lyophilization, giving us a path from frozen to refrigerated storage conditions. \nOur substantial investments in recent years in technical development has enabled the breadth and depth of our pipeline, and laid the foundation to help meet the needs and requirements associated with late-stage development and the commercialization of our products. \nSupply of mRNA for All Stages of Product Development and Commercialization \nSupply for Research \nHigh-throughput automation and custom engineered equipment allow us to produce and deliver high quality mRNA and formulated constructs in a short period of time: our proprietary platform is capable of producing up to 1,000 lots of mRNA sequences and formulations per month with a turnaround time of a few weeks from sequence to final product. The typical scale of mRNA manufactured by this team is 1-1,000 mg. This has been possible, in part, due to the ability of researchers in the Moderna ecosystem to order constructs through an integrated digital portal that tracks materials end-to-end in less than 45 days. In addition, multiple integrated algorithms that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning optimize manufacturability, reduce failures and increase quality of mRNA sequences. \nSupply for Clinical Development \nWe have established manufacturing capabilities that support the early development stage of product development in three key areas: GLP Tox, Clinical Studies and INTs. We supply formulated product to conduct IND-enabling GLP toxicology studies. In addition, human clinical studies rely on supply to meet required cGMP standards. This is achieved via internal manufacturing at the MTC campus. Our MTC campus is also suited to enable rapid technology development and scale-up for future needs.  \nOur manufacturing also produces cGMP INTs. Due to the specialized nature of personalized medicine (i.e., where a batch is specifically designed and manufactured for a single patient), the manufacturing process for INTs has unique requirements. We digitally integrate patient-specific data from sequencing tumor samples to automatically design INTs for patients. We have developed proprietary bioinformatics designed algorithms linked to an automated manufacturing process for rapid production of formulated \n24\nTable of Contents\nmRNA, with a typical turnaround time of a few weeks. We have operationalized INT manufacturing at the MTC campus to meet our Phase 1 and 2 pipeline supply needs by using single-use systems with fast “needle-to-needle” turnaround times. Unlike traditional process development, each INT batch is manufactured for a single patient and thus scaled-out (in parallel) with extensive use of automation and robotics to account for the larger number of patients involved in later phases of development and commercialization. We have shown consistent quality in our production of many patient batches, each with unique mRNA sequences. In the second quarter of 2023, we acquired a new manufacturing facility in Marlborough, Massachusetts, which we expect to support our INT program. Upon completion, the facility will have state-of-the-art mRNA manufacturing areas, including a full manufacturing clean room, quality control laboratories, and a just-in-time satellite warehouse.\nOur manufacturing capabilities have allowed us to build our broad pipeline of development programs, including the output required to supply related toxicological and human clinical studies. While the technology that underpins these programs is the same, each program typically requires customization based on target product profiles. These custom features range from varying molecular architecture to different routes of administration, often requiring multivalent products. All programs, except for INT, require that we progressively scale up supply to meet clinical demand requirements across development phases, in addition to the necessary preparation for regulatory approval and commercial production, which demand larger batch sizes. In contrast, the INT program seeks to develop a cancer therapeutic that is designed and manufactured for a specific patient, thus increasing the number of unique batches. As we scale manufacturing output for each program, we plan to continuously improve yield, purity and the pharmaceutical properties of our product candidates. \nSupply for Late-Stage Development and Commercialization \nOur development pipeline continues to advance to later-stage development and towards commercialization. Our platform approach allows us to continue to evolve our manufacturing suites and other capabilities at our manufacturing facilities. mRNA manufacturing is flexible and one plant can manufacture multiple vaccines and therapeutics. Our manufacturing facilities also permit us to manufacture products in parallel. For instance, we can produce drug substance and drug product for our Phase 3 CMV clinical trial while manufacturing COVID-19 drug substance in the same facilities. \nQuality Unit \nQuality is core to the way we operate. We seek to ensure quality at Moderna through a combination of a robust Quality Management System (QMS), our quality culture and our people. In accordance with applicable regulations, we have established, documented and implemented a QMS to assure continued compliance with the requirements therein. The QMS facilitates cGMP compliance by implementing practices that identify the various required processes, their application throughout the organization and the sequence of interaction of these processes. \nThe primary mode of documenting these key practices is through policies, standard operating procedures (SOPs), forms and other quality records, which include an overarching Quality Policy and Quality Manual. We have implemented tools and metrics to monitor, measure, and analyze these practices to support cGMP operations, achieve planned results, and support continuous improvement. We monitor these quality metrics through formal governance processes, including Quality Management Review (QMR), to enable continuous improvement. We have also established an independent Quality Unit that fulfills quality assurance and quality control responsibilities. \nEnvironment, Health, and Safety \nWe have established a global Environment, Health, and Safety (EHS) organization to foster a safe and healthy work environment with a focus on sustainability and compliance. Our approach integrates environmentally responsible practices with health and safety measures focused on risk reduction to promote long-term workplace well-being and environmental stewardship. We achieve this through a combination of training, procedures, digital data collection and reporting tools, and corporate programs that drive towards continuous improvement. \nSupply Chain Unit \nWe have established a global supply chain to enable supply of the raw materials and components used to produce our products, consistent with clinical and preclinical demands. We have worked with our external vendors to characterize critical raw materials and to understand their impact on the quality of drug substance and formulated drug product. We also assess the quality system and performance of our external vendors and work with them to comply with regulatory requirements. In addition, we have established an infrastructure to enable direct-to-customer shipments for our commercial products. We leverage third-party wholesalers and integrate with artificial intelligence-driven data analytics to ensure successful ordering and delivery.\n25\nTable of Contents\nEngineering\nOur global engineering organization is structured to deliver exceptional facilities and services. We partner closely with external and internal service providers to incorporate robotics, automation and predictive analysis for equipment operation. Engineering plays a critical role in the design, build, operation and maintenance of our facilities.\nDIGITAL AND AI STRATEGY\nSince our founding, we have been a digital-first company, seeking to use the power of digital information to maximize our impact on patients. mRNA is an information molecule, and our company was built on the premise that the natural flow of information in life can be used to develop medicines. Leveraging over a decade of experience developing mRNA medicines, we have built a large library of data that, combined with our platform approach and cloud-native infrastructure, positions us well to scale a digital operating model using artificial intelligence (AI).\nLed by our Chief People and Digital Technology Officer, our digital organization partners across all Moderna functions to perpetuate and grow Moderna's AI-native culture. To that end, in 2021, we launched our AI Academy, which offers cross-organization training to all of our employees on how they can use AI to transform the way we work. Through the AI Academy, our employees learn how to leverage AI in their specific job functions to augment their capacity and capabilities, and to maximize our impact on patients. \nAI helps optimize each aspect of our value chain, from drug design to commercial manufacturing and beyond. At the research stage, our digital and AI infrastructure allows our scientists to design novel mRNA constructs, use AI algorithms to optimize them and order them from our high throughput preclinical scale production line. Our capabilities allow us to design mRNA, protein and LNP components with desired properties, such as reduced toxicity or increased stability. At the product development stage, AI helps to improve the efficiency of our clinical trial operations by, for example, forecasting participant enrollment and automating clinical trial data processing. \nOur manufacturing processes likewise utilize the power of AI. For example, we leverage a series of fully autonomous, integrated AI algorithms in connection with manufacturing mRNA-4157, our INT candidate. Our machine-learning based algorithms design the specific therapy for each individual patient and optimize the timely manufacture and delivery of INT to each patient. \nAt the commercial stage, our digital and commercial organizations partner to drive performance and prepare for product launches. Digital and AI are key components of our commercialization strategy and are vital to our ability to increase our speed to market, enhance our commercial capabilities and continuously improve the quality of our products. We believe that our ability to move with both scale and speed positions us well to pursue our goals related to future product launches.\nIn early 2023, we began a collaboration with OpenAI to co-innovate with a shared vision of AI’s transformative potential in the future of business and healthcare. In 2024, our AI culture led to the deployment across the company of ChatGPT Enterprise and its enhanced capabilities such as Advanced Analytics, Image Generation and GPTs. These GPTs are now embedded across our business functions, including legal, research, manufacturing and commercial, helping to drive productivity. For example, our Dose ID GPT uses ChatGPT Enterprise’s Advanced Data Analytics feature to further evaluate the optimal vaccine dose selected by the clinical study team. By applying standard dose selection criteria and principles, Dose ID provides a rationale, references its sources, and generates informative charts illustrating the key findings. This allows for a detailed review, led by humans and augmented with AI input, while prioritizing safety and optimizing the vaccine dose profile prior to further development in late-stage clinical trials.  \nWe believe that the integrated AI ecosystem we are building at Moderna will accelerate our mission to deliver the greatest possible impact to people through mRNA medicines. \nCOMMERCIAL\nWe continue to build our differentiated commercial model, with active commercial subsidiaries in key markets across North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region. Our commercial footprint provides us with local commercial teams in major markets where respiratory vaccines have high utilization rates and sales. To support the build out of our commercial activities in markets worldwide, we have hired talent with extensive pharmaceutical company experience. Our commercial teams also work with third-party distributors and other partners in countries where we do not have a direct presence. Our commercial activities are dependent on regulatory approvals and on agreements that we have made or may make in the future with strategic collaborators. \nWe currently have two commercial products—Spikevax (our COVID vaccine) and mRESVIA (our RSV vaccine), which is approved for adults aged 60 and older. The commercial markets for these vaccines are seasonal and characterized, particularly in the U.S. (our largest market), by a fragmented customer base, unpredictability in orders and seasonality of deliveries. The private vaccine market is also characterized by market practices regarding rebates, discounts and returns. The respiratory vaccine market, and markets for \n26\nTable of Contents\nCOVID and RSV vaccines in particular, depends on many factors such as medical need, viral evolution, public health authority recommendations and consumer motivation to vaccinate. The market volume for COVID vaccines has been relatively stable for two years, and public health recommendations for vaccinations are normalizing. We are encouraged to see the emergence of a sizable and durable long-term COVID vaccine market. \nBeyond Spikevax and mRESVIA, we continue to advance a broad seasonal respiratory vaccine franchise, consisting of single-agent, next-generation and combination vaccines against respiratory viruses that have the highest medical bur\nden. In 2024, we filed for regulatory approval of our next-generation COVID vaccine, our RSV vaccine for high-risk adults aged 18 to 59, and our flu+COVID combination vaccine for adults 50 years and older. We anticipate potential product launches for each of these products as early as 2025, with additional potential approvals of our seasonal flu vaccine and flu+COVID combination vaccine for adults aged 18 to 49\n over the next several years.\nIn addition to our respiratory vaccine franchise, we are also investing in building out our commercial capabilities for other franchises, including latent and other virus vaccines, rare disease therapeutics and oncology therapeutics. We expect to launch products in each of these franchises over the next several years.\nAdditionally, we expect to bring state-of-the-art mRNA manufacturing facilities online in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in 2025. The government in each of these countries has entered into a multi-year commitment to purchase mRNA products from us once the covered respiratory vaccine products are approved and the local facilities are licensed for production. See “—Manufacturing” above for further detail.\nTHIRD-PARTY STRATEGIC ALLIANCES\nStrategic alliances\nWe are party to strategic alliances with a diverse group of collaborators, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, government agencies, academic laboratories, foundations and research institutes with therapeutic area expertise and resources. Through our collaborations, we seek to advance our discovery and development programs, while leveraging our platform and our research and early development capabilities. From time to time, we also partner with and invest in companies developing other types of therapeutics, such as gene editing and cell-therapy, where we believe we can leverage our core mRNA and LNP capabilities to expand the reach of our technology.\nThrough certain of our strategic alliances, we share the rewards and risks of developing a new mRNA modality or program, where we may have early research data and desire a strategic collaborator to join us in advancing early development candidates within such modality into the clinic. Representative relationships and associated programs include those with Merck, for our INT programs (mRNA-4157), and Vertex, for our CF program (mRNA-3692).\nTo maintain the integrity of our platform, our strategic collaboration agreements generally grant either us the rights to develop and commercialize potential mRNA medicines we design and manufacture, or grant our collaborators those rights. These agreements do not allow collaborators to use our platform to generate new mRNA technologies, and we generally retain ownership of intellectual property related to our platform arising from research conducted under the alliance. We may continue to identify potential strategic collaborators who can contribute meaningful technology and insights to our programs and allow us to expand our impact more rapidly to broader patient populations. \nBelow are brief descriptions of certain of our ongoing collaborations.\nMerck—Strategic Alliance for Individualized Neoantigen Therapies\nIn June 2016, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Merck for the development and commercialization of personalized mRNA cancer vaccines (also known as INTs), which was subsequently amended and restated in 2018 (the INT Agreement), to develop and commercialize INTs for individual patients using our mRNA vaccine and formulation technology. Under the strategic alliance, we identify genetic mutations present in a particular patient’s tumor cells, synthesize mRNA for these mutations, encapsulate the mRNA in one of our proprietary LNPs and administer to each patient a unique INT designed to specifically activate the patient’s immune system against her or his own cancer cells.\nPursuant to the INT Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $200 million from Merck and we were responsible for designing and researching INTs, providing manufacturing capacity and manufacturing INTs and conducting Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for INTs, alone and in combination with KEYTRUDA (pembrolizumab), Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy, all in accordance with an agreed upon development plan and budget.\n27\nTable of Contents\nIn September 2022, Merck exercised its option for INTs, including mRNA-4157, pursuant to the terms of the INT Agreement and in October 2022 paid us an option exercise fee of $250 million. Pursuant to the INT Agreement, we and Merck have agreed to collaborate on further development and potential commercialization of INTs, with costs and any profits or losses generally shared equally on a worldwide basis, subject to certain exceptions as outlined in the agreement. \nVertex—2016 Strategic Alliance in Cystic Fibrosis\nIn July 2016, we entered into a Strategic Collaboration and License Agreement (Vertex Agreement) with Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (Europe) Limited (together, Vertex). The Vertex Agreement is aimed at the discovery and development of potential mRNA medicines for the treatment of CF by enabling cells in the lungs of people with CF to produce functional CFTR proteins.\nOther Collaborations\nWe have entered into additional collaborations where we have agreed to provide funding in areas where we believe we can leverage our mRNA technology. These collaborations include those with:\n•\nCarisma Therapeutics\n, to discover, develop and commercialize \nin vivo \nengineered chimeric antigen receptor monocyte (CAR-M) therapeutics for the treatment of cancer, including solid tumors, and autoimmune diseases.\n•\nCytomX Therapeutics\n, to create investigational mRNA-based conditionally activated therapies utilizing our mRNA technologies and CytomX\n’\ns Probody platform.\n•\nGeneration Bio Co.\n, to combine our biological and technical expertise with core technologies of Generation Bio's non-viral genetic platform. \n•\nImmatics N.V.\n, to pioneer novel and transformative therapies for cancer patients with high unmet medical need.\n•\nLife Edit Therapeutics\n, to discover and develop \nin vivo\n mRNA gene editing therapies.\nWe have made equity investments in Carisma and Generation Bio pursuant to those collaborations.\nStrategic alliances with government organizations and foundations\nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)\nIn September 2020, we entered into an agreement with DARPA to fund development of a mobile manufacturing prototype leveraging our existing manufacturing technology that is capable of rapidly producing vaccines and therapeutics.\nBiomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)\nCOVID vaccine program\nIn April 2020, we entered into an agreement with BARDA for an award of up to \n$483 million\n to accelerate development of mRNA-1273, our original COVID vaccine. The agreement has been subsequently amended to provide for additional commitments to support various late-stage clinical development efforts of mRNA-1273, including a 30,000 participant Phase 3 study,\n \npediatric clinical trials, adolescent clinical trials and pharmacovigilance studies. The maximum award from BARDA, inclusive of all amendments, was approximately \n$1.8 billion\n. All contract options have been exercised. As of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, the remaining available funding, net of revenue earned was \n$63 million\n.\nPandemic influenza program\nIn June 2024, we were awarded up to \n$176 million\n through the Rapid Response Partnership Vehicle (RRPV) Consortium, funded by BARDA, to accelerate the development of mRNA-based pandemic influenza vaccines. The project award will support the late-stage development of an mRNA-based vaccine to enable the licensure of a pre-pandemic vaccine against the H5 influenza virus. This subtype of the influenza virus causes a highly infectious and severe disease in birds known as avian influenza and poses a risk of spillover into the human population. The agreement also includes additional options to prepare and accelerate a response to future public health threats.\nIn January 2025, we were awarded up to \n$590 million\n through the RRPV, funded by BARDA. This funding builds on the \n$176 million\n award received in June 2024 and will provide additional support for late-stage development and licensure of pre-pandemic mRNA-based influenza vaccines. The agreement will also support the expansion of clinical studies for up to five additional subtypes of pandemic influenza.\n28\nTable of Contents\nInstitute for Life Changing Medicines (ILCM)\nIn September 2021, we entered into a collaboration agreement with the ILCM to develop a new mRNA therapeutic (mRNA-3351) for type 1 Crigler-Najjar syndrome (CN-1). Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to license mRNA-3351 to ILCM with no upfront fees, and without any downstream payments. ILCM will be responsible for the clinical development of mRNA-3351.\nThe Gates Foundation\nIn January 2016, we entered a global health project framework agreement with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (n/k/a the Gates Foundation) to advance mRNA development projects for various infectious diseases. The Gates Foundation has committed up to $20 million in grant funding to support our initial project related to the evaluation of antibody combinations in a preclinical setting as well as the conduct of a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of a potential mRNA medicine to help prevent HIV infections. Follow-on projects, which could bring total potential funding under the framework agreement up to $100 million (including the HIV antibody project) to support the development of additional mRNA projects for various infectious diseases, can be proposed and approved until the sixth anniversary of the framework agreement, subject to the terms of the framework agreement, including our obligation to grant to the Gates Foundation certain non-exclusive licenses.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, including patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret, as well as confidentiality and license agreements, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. \nProtecting our platform, modality and program investments: Building an expansive, multi-layered IP estate\nWe have built a substantial IP estate that includes numerous patents and patent applications related to the development and commercialization of mRNA vaccine and therapeutic development candidates, including related platform technologies. Our platform IP protects advances in mRNA design and engineering, proprietary LNP components, delivery systems, processes for the manufacture and purification of drug substances and products and analytical methods. A significant portion of our platform IP estate further provides multi-layered protection for our modalities and programs.\nWith respect to our IP estate, our solely-owned patent portfolio consists of more than 260 issued or allowed U.S. patents or patent applications and more than 140 granted or allowed patents in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. (including granted European patents that have been validated in numerous European countries) covering certain of our proprietary platform technology, inventions and improvements, and covering key aspects of our clinical and most advanced development candidates. We have 700 additional pending patent applications that, in many cases, are counterparts to the foregoing U.S. and foreign patents.\nMost of the patents and applications (if issued) in our portfolio will not expire until 2033 at the earliest. Any patent that may issue from our most recently filed patent applications is projected to expire between 2043 and 2044, at the earliest. We file additional U.S. and foreign patent applications in key markets as necessary to protect our evolving intellectual property positions.\nWe also rely on trademarks, copyright, trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and programs, continuing innovation, and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of mRNA therapeutic and vaccine technologies. We take additional steps, such as entering into confidentiality and license agreements, to protect our intellectually property and proprietary rights. We additionally plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when and where available, and plan to seek and rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations. We also possess substantial proprietary know-how associated with related manufacturing processes and expertise.\nIP protecting our platform\nWe have a broad IP estate covering key aspects of our platform. This estate provides multiple layers of protection covering the making and use of the mRNA drug substance and delivery technologies.\nWith respect to our platform, we have a portfolio that includes U.S. and foreign patents or patent applications covering platform innovations that are related to the design, manufacturing and formulating of mRNA medicines. For example, these patents and patent applications include claims directed to:\n•\nmRNA chemistry imparting improved properties for vaccine and therapeutic uses;\n•\nmethods for mRNA sequence optimization to enhance the levels and fidelity of proteins expressed from our mRNA medicines;\n•\nmethods for identifying epitopes having superior suitability in cancer vaccine contexts;\n•\nengineering elements tailored to enhance stability and the\n in vivo\n performance of mRNA medicines;\n29\nTable of Contents\n•\nLNP delivery systems, including novel lipid components designed for optimal delivery and expression of both therapeutic and vaccine nucleic acids, in particular, prophylactic infectious disease and cancer vaccine nucleic acids, intratumoral immuno-oncology therapeutics, local regenerative therapeutics, systemic therapeutics, and inhaled pulmonary therapeutics; and\n•\ninnovative processes for the manufacture and analysis of mRNA drug substance and formulated drug product.\nIP protection\nOur IP estate provides protection for the multiple programs both at the product-specific level and at various broader levels. For example, we have patent coverage for LNP-encapsulated mRNAs having specific chemical modification suited for vaccine and therapeutic mRNA use. Our estate also includes IP covering certain LNP-encapsulated mRNAs coding for infectious disease antigens for use in preventing or treating infectious diseases, including those caused by respiratory and latent viruses, as well as bacterial, viral and parasitic diseases known to threaten public health. Our mRNA chemistry, formulation and manufacturing patent applications and related know-how, along with trade secrets, may also provide us with additional IP protection relating to our development candidates.\nRespiratory vaccines\nFor our respiratory vaccines programs, we have pursued patent protection featuring composition of matter and method of use claims. Where we may pursue patent protection may vary based on the unique geographic prevalence of various infectious diseases.\nWe have filed several patent applications covering our betacoronavirus vaccine program. We are pursuing patent protection for both our existing and next generation betacoronavirus vaccines. A non-exhaustive list of granted patents covering our COVID vaccine can be found in the following table.\nPatent Number\nCountry/Region*\nPatent Type\nExpiration Date**\n12,208,288\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter\nOctober 21, 2036\n11,622,972\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter\nOctober 22, 2041\n11,524,023\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter\nOctober 22, 2041\n11,485,972\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter\nMay 18, 2038 \n10,898,574\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter and Method of Use\nApril 2, 2032\n10,703,789\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter\nMarch 9, 2033\n10,702,600\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter\nOctober 21, 2036\n10,577,403\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter\nMarch 9, 2033\n10,442,756\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter\nSeptember 16, 2036\n10,266,485\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter\nSeptember 16, 2036\n10,064,959\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter\nOctober 3, 2031\n9,868,692\nUnited States\nComposition of Matter\nSeptember 16, 2036\n3 590 949\nEurope\nComposition of Matter and Method of Use\nOctober 3, 2031\n3 718 565\nEurope\nComposition of Matter\nOctober 21, 2036\n* Selected granted patents in the U.S. and Europe only.

We have patent applications covering our hMPV vaccine pending in the U.S. and Europe, with a granted patent in the U.S.\nLatent vaccines\nWe have vaccine programs and patent applications directed to diseases caused by various latent viruses, including CMV, EBV, HSV and VZV, in some cases, using both preventative vaccines targeting the acute phase and therapeutic vaccines for treating the latent diseases in those who do become infected.\nCMV\nThe patent coverage for our human CMV vaccine candidate is extensive and is based on a vaccine with six mRNAs encoding a pentamer surface glycoprotein complex and the gB surface glycoprotein. Both pentamer and gB facilitate entry of the virus into different cell types and therefore immune responses targeting these proteins can block virus entry, spread and reactivation. The current patent portfolio contains both compositions of matter and methods of treating subjects using the vaccine. In the U.S., our CMV vaccine is covered by multiple issued U.S. patents of differing breadth. Each family has counterparts consisting of pending applications and issued patents in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including, in some cases, Europe and Japan. A separate family of CMV patents, which includes mRNA-1647 plus mRNA-1443 for use in CMV vaccines for transplant indications, is also yielding patents and applications in foreign jurisdictions are pending.\nEBV, HSV and VZV\nSimilar to CMV, we have filed patent applications, and in some cases multiple patent families, for each of EBV, HSV and VZV, e.g., covering prophylactic and/or therapeutic indications. In addition to patent applications filed in the United States, certain of these patent families have foreign counterparts, such as \nin Europe.\n31\nTable of Contents\nPublic health vaccines\nWe maintain a multi-program effort at developing vaccines for potential future pandemics and for use in parts of the world with less well-established health care systems. This group of programs include infectious diseases such as flaviviruses such as Zika and dengue viruses, HIV, Nipah virus, and the Mpox virus. In addition, programs are ongoing in many bacterial diseases. While patent applications are filed on some potential public health targets, in some scenarios, platform patents rather than target specific patents may be used to provide patent protection for public health target vaccines.\nINT\nComposition of matter and method claims are being pursued to protect programs within our oncology therapeutics franchise. Proprietary methods around the making and therapeutic use of our INTs and resulting vaccine compositions are described and claimed in one granted U.S. patent, eight pending U.S. patent applications, six pending European patent applications, one granted patent and five pending patent applications in Japan, three pending patent applications and one granted patent in China, and several pending patent applications in New Zealand, South Africa, Asian and South American countries, as well as one PCT application. These applications also relate to various vaccine design formats, in particular, polyepitopic vaccine formats, and methods of treating cancer with such INTs. We also possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our cancer vaccine programs, including related manufacturing process and technology.\nRare diseases\nWe have programs featuring expression of therapeutic proteins, e.g., intracellular enzymes for the treatment of rare diseases. For our rare disease programs, we generally pursue patent protection featuring composition of matter and method of use claims, for example, pharmaceutical composition and method of treatment claims. We have patent applications granted, pending and/or published for our most advanced rare disease development candidates targeting PA and MMA. In addition, we have patent applications granted, pending and/or published for our other rare disease candidates targeting Glycogen Storage Disorder, Type 1a (GSD1a), PKU, Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type 1 (CN-1) and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (OTC).\nAny U.S. and foreign patents that may issue from these patent families would be expected to expire in 2036 for the earliest of the MMA patents and 2038 to 2042 for the remaining MMA, PA, PKU, GSD1a and CN-1 patents, excluding any patent term adjustments, any patent term extensions and any terminal disclaimers.\nAs further described below, as we continue the development of our intended products, we continue to identify additional means of protecting our assets that would potentially enhance commercial success, including possible patent protection for additional methods of use, formulation, or manufacture.\nCystic fibrosis\nOur CF development candidate is covered by pending U.S., European and PCT patent applications.\nGene editing\nOur gene editing program currently has one filed patent family that includes issued patents in the U.S., Europe and Japan, and also pending applications in these jurisdictions. We plan to file patent applications on development candidates and other aspects of gene editing technology as we continue to innovate both internally and through strategic collaborations.\nTrademarks\nOur trademark portfolio currently contains at least 1,250 trademark registrations, including at least 30 registrations in the United States and the remaining in Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Israel, China, Japan, Australia, and elsewhere. In addition, we have at least 360 pending trademark applications in more than 55 jurisdictions, including in the aforementioned locations and additional countries throughout Africa, Asia, and South America.\nIn-licensed intellectual property\nWhile we develop and manufacture our potential mRNA medicines using our internally created mRNA technology platform, we also seek out and evaluate third party technologies and IP that may be complementary to our platform.\n32\nTable of Contents\nPatent sublicense agreements with Cellscript and mRNA RiboTherapeutics\nThe Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania owns several issued U.S. patents, granted European patents and pending U.S. patent applications directed, in part, to nucleoside-modified mRNAs and their uses (the Penn Modified mRNA Patents). mRNA RiboTherapeutics, Inc. (MRT) obtained an exclusive license to the Penn Modified mRNA Patents and granted its affiliate, Cellscript, LLC (Cellscript), a sublicense to the Penn Modified mRNA Patents in certain fields of use.\nIn June 2017, we entered into two sublicense agreements, one with Cellscript, and one with MRT, which agreements we collectively refer to as the Cellscript-MRT Agreements. Together, the Cellscript-MRT Agreements grant us a worldwide, sublicensable sublicense to the Penn Modified mRNA Patents to research, develop, make, and commercialize products covered by the Penn Modified mRNA Patents (licensed products), for all\n in vivo\n uses in humans and animals, including therapeutic, prophylactic, and diagnostic applications. The Cellscript-MRT Agreements are non-exclusive, although Cellscript and MRT are subject to certain time restrictions on granting additional sublicenses for\n in vivo\n uses in humans under the Penn Modified mRNA Patents. The Cellscript-MRT Agreements require us to pay royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products at rates in the low single digits for therapeutic, prophylactic, and diagnostic uses, and royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products sold for research uses at rates in the mid-single digits, subject to certain reductions, with an aggregate minimum floor.\nThe Cellscript-MRT Agreements will terminate upon the expiration or abandonment of the last to expire or become abandoned of the Penn Modified mRNA Patents. Cellscript or MRT, as applicable, may terminate its respective Cellscript-MRT Agreement if we fail to make required payments or otherwise materially breach the applicable agreement, subject to specified notice and cure provisions. Cellscript or MRT, as applicable, may also terminate the applicable Cellscript-MRT Agreement upon written notice in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of the Penn Modified mRNA Patents. We have the right to terminate each Cellscript-MRT Agreement at will upon 60 days’ prior notice to Cellscript or MRT, as applicable, provided that we cease all development and commercialization of licensed products upon such termination. If rights to MRT or Cellscript under the Penn Modified mRNA Patents are terminated (e.g., due to bankruptcy of MRT or Cellscript), the terminated party will assign its interest in the respective Cellscript-MRT Agreement to the licensor from which it received rights under the Penn Modified mRNA Patents and our rights will continue under the new licensor.\nPatent license agreements with NIAID\nIn December 2022, we entered into a non-exclusive patent license agreement with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), an Institute or Center of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to license certain patent rights concerning stabilizing prefusion coronavirus spike proteins and the resulting stabilized proteins for use in COVID vaccine products. Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to pay low single-digit royalties on future net sales, a minimum annual royalty payment and certain contingent development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis.\nIn January 2025, we entered into a non-exclusive patent license agreement with NIAID to license certain patent rights concerning prefusion RSV F proteins and their use. Pursuant to the agreement, we have agreed to pay tiered, low-to-mid single-digit royalties on net sales of our RSV vaccine, a minimum annual royalty payment, and certain contingent development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments on a licensed product-by-licensed product basis.  \nFormulation technology in-licenses\nOur development candidates use internally developed formulation technology that we own. We do, however, have rights to use and exploit multiple issued and pending patents covering formulation technologies under licenses from other entities. If in the future we elect to use or to grant our strategic collaborators sublicenses to use these in-licensed formulation technologies, we or our strategic collaborators may be liable for milestone and royalty payment obligations arising from such use. We consider the commercial terms of these licenses and their provisions regarding diligence, insurance, indemnification and other similar matters, to be reasonable and customary for our industry.\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nWe had approximately 5,800 full-time employees in 18 countries as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n. \nWe operate in a highly competitive environment for talent, particularly as we seek to attract and retain talent with experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors. Our workforce is highly educated, and as of December 31, 2024, 43% of our employees hold Ph.D., Doctorate, M.D., J.D. or Master’s degrees. Among our employees, as of December 31, 2024, 49% are female. Among our leadership (which we define as employees at the vice president level and above), as of December 31, 2024, approximately 38% are female. 45% of our U.S. employees identify as racially or ethnically diverse as of December 31, 2024. In 2024, for the third year in a row, an outside statistical pay equity analysis confirmed zero statistically significant differences in pay across gender globally and across gender, race and ethnicity in the United States.\n33\nTable of Contents\nOur approach to attracting and retaining talent \nWe are committed to ensuring that our employees find that their careers at Moderna are filled with purpose, growth and fulfillment. We believe that a career at Moderna provides opportunity for:\n•\nImpact\n: Our people will have the opportunity to do work that is unparalleled in terms of its innovation and scope of impact on people’s lives.\n•\nGrowth\n: We provide incredible opportunities for growth and we obsess over learning (as demonstrated, in part, by our Mindsets (see below). We invest substantially in the development of our people. \n•\nWell-being\n: We are committed to the health and well-being of our employees and their families and provide numerous family-friendly benefits and opportunities to be healthy, including monthly contributions to employee lifestyle spending accounts.\n•\nInclusion\n: We believe in the benefits of bringing together a diverse set of perspectives and backgrounds, and creating an environment where differences are celebrated and leveraged. We measure and hold management accountable to creating an environment where everyone's voice is heard.\n•\nCompelling rewards\n: To attract and retain the best talent, we provide competitive rewards that help to drive groundbreaking work and allow employees to share in the value we will create together, including through our equity programs.\n•\nGiving and volunteering: \nOur people have the opportunity to give back to their communities and directly support causes that they are passionate about through volunteer and employee matching donation programs.\nTo help promote alignment between our employees and our shareholders, all employees participate in our corporate equity programs through the receipt of equity awards, and the percentage of equity as a component of overall pay mix increases with seniority. We also allow our employees to select how they want the value of their award to be split between stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs). We believe that in addition to incentivizing growth that leads to shareholder value, broad eligibility for our equity programs further embeds our \"We behave like owners\" mindset and helps promote employee retention as these awards generally vest over a four-year period.\nNone of our employees have entered into a collective bargaining agreement with us. A small number of employees in France, Italy and Spain are covered by statutory collective bargaining agreements governing certain benefits and working conditions. Employees in our Madrid work center are represented by a works council. None of our other employees are represented by a labor union or a works council. We consider our employee relations to be good.\nWe believe that our employees are highly engaged, and our company and team have been publicly recognized for our leadership, innovation and good corporate citizenship. \nScience\n magazine ranked us as a top employer for each of the last ten years. Additionally, in 2024, \nBiospace\n ranked us the number one large employer in its 2025 Best Places to Work in Biopharma report for the fourth consecutive year. We also received a perfect score from the Human Rights Campaign's Corporate Equality Index for 2025. We measure employee engagement through a vendor-supplied engagement software, using validated external benchmarks to track employee engagement factors.\nWe continually monitor employee turnover rates, as our success depends upon retaining our highly trained personnel. We believe that the competitive compensation we offer, along with the combination of the factors listed above, among other factors, have helped reduce voluntary turnover. In 2024, our voluntary turnover rate was approximately 6%.\nOur approach to training our employees\nTo further invest in our teams, we have established a structured training curriculum for our employees so that every employee becomes deeply familiar with our core technology and technologies that might further enable our innovation. In addition, we are focused on creating strong leaders through various management and leadership trainings. We have also built an online library of videos of a variety of scientific material that our employees can access flexibly. This content includes presentations by external speakers at in-house scientific seminars, scientific courses at external universities and peer-to-peer video series in which in-house experts provide an introductory view of complex topics they tackle within their teams.\nNew employees participate in our Moderna ONE onboarding program, which is an interactive learning experience designed to immerse our people in our culture and Mindsets from day one. Following onboarding, our employees continue to learn throughout their careers at Moderna and we deploy a digital learning management system to track and administer training programs for each of employee. \nIn December 2021, we launched our Artificial Intelligence (AI) Academy. The AI Academy is intended to educate and empower our employees to identify and integrate AI and machine learning solutions into every Moderna system and process to bring mRNA medicines to patients. In 2024, we enhanced the AI Academy with a required GPT training to empower employees to transform the way they work with the power of AI.\n34\nTable of Contents\nOur culture\nAs an organization, we are bold, collaborative, curious and relentless. These values are underpinned by a core set of what we call “basecamp” values— integrity, quality, respect. Additionally, with the continued rapid growth of our company, we articulated the Moderna Mindsets, which define how we behave, lead and make decisions. We believe our Mindsets will be integral to our future success, and we integrate them into every facet of how we identify, onboard, grow and manage our talent.  \nTo further develop and retain our workforce, we conduct periodic talent reviews that identify key talent within the organization. We use that data to inform specific development opportunities for key current and potential future leaders, and to support our periodic succession planning activities for key roles. These steps together ensure we have a robust understanding of our workforce and a talent pipeline to grow future leaders, and provide our employees an opportunity to continuously grow and advance in a way that meets their aspirations and talents.\nCORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY \nAs we pursue our mission to deliver the greatest possible impact to people through mRNA medicines, we have developed a corporate social responsibility (CSR) program that demonstrates our commitment to patients, employees, the environment and local communities. Our CSR framework consists of five key focus areas: medicines for patients, community, governance and ethics, employees and environment. Please refer to our \n2023\n ESG Report under the “Responsibility—Corporate policies” section of our website, which can be found at www.modernatx.com/responsibility/corporate-policies, as well as our proxy statement related to our \n2025\n Annual Meeting of Stockholders that we will file with the SEC, for a description of some of the measures we have taken to progress our commitment to corporate social responsibility.\nCOMPETITION\nThe biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries utilize rapidly advancing technologies and are characterized by intense competition. There is also a strong emphasis on defense of intellectual property and proprietary products. \nmRNA Medicines \nWe believe that mRNA as a medicine coupled with our capabilities across mRNA technology, drug discovery, development and manufacturing provide us with a competitive advantage. However, we face competition from others developing mRNA vaccines and therapeutics, as well as other medicines that compete or could compete with our products. We face competition from various sources, including large pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies and public and private research institutions. The continued growth of the mRNA field is leading to increased competitive pressure, including from large and more established pharmaceutical companies. We also face competition when entering into strategic alliances to advance and grow our pipeline. \nWe largely compete against Pfizer and BioNTech for sales of our COVID vaccine, whose vaccine is also based on mRNA technology. We also compete against other vaccines, including Sanofi and Novavax’s. Other companies and academic institutions are conducting research on, and may develop, vaccines against COVID or other coronaviruses that could compete with our vaccine. Additionally, some competitors have developed COVID treatments, including Pfizer’s antiviral pill, and the existence of such treatments may reduce demand for vaccines. With respect to our RSV vaccine, we compete against Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline, who entered the U.S. market prior to us and achieved larger market shares in 2024. Unlike 2024, we expect to participate in the full contracting season in the United States in 2025, and our goal is to increase our market share in the United States and market access globally.  \nCompetition for the sale of our products is impacted by many factors, including, among others, actual and perceived vaccine efficacy, safety and tolerability, perceptions of mRNA technology, storage and handling conditions and the relative ease of distribution and administration, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, reimbursement coverage and production and distribution costs. \nIn markets that we enter after competitors have already introduced a competing product, we may have difficulty achieving market share, as was the case in connection with the launch of our RSV vaccine. See “Risk Factors—The vaccines market, and pharmaceutical market more generally, is intensely competitive, and we may not compete effectively in the market for existing or new products, treatment methods or technologies.”\nThere are additional companies working on mRNA medicines, some of which have reached commercialization. These companies include BioNTech, Pfizer, Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline in collaboration with CureVac.\n35\nTable of Contents\nOur Collaborations \nWe and our strategic collaborators also face competition in other therapeutic areas beyond the field of mRNA medicines. These competitors include a growing number of pharmaceutical, biotechnology and academic institutions researching and developing therapies (e.g., CAR-T) against which we could compete in the future. Potentially competitive products are at various stages of development.   \nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nGovernment authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries and regions, such as in the EU regulate, among other things, the research, development, manufacture and marketing of our products. Generally, before a new medicine can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained and submitted for review and approved by the competent regulatory authority.\nU.S. drug and biological product development\nIn the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and biologics under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), each in conjunction with their implementing regulations. Both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or following approval may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license revocation, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. \nAny of our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through a BLA or new drug application (NDA), or supplemental BLA or supplemental NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. \nPreclinical studies\nBefore any of our development candidates may be tested in humans, the development candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as\n in vitro\n and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. Unless the FDA raises concerns, an IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. \nClinical trials\nThe clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational medicine to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with GCP requirements. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to clinical trial subjects and monitors the clinical trial until completed. Further, progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently in other situations, including the occurrence of serious adverse events. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website.\nUnder the U.S. National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines), supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee (IBC), a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. While the NIH Guidelines are only mandatory for research being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.\n36\nTable of Contents\nForeign studies conducted under an IND must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the United States. Data from a foreign study not conducted under an IND may be submitted in support of a BLA if the study was conducted in accordance with GCP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data.\nClinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap:\n•\nPhase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability, and safety of the investigational medicine.\n•\nPhase 2 clinical trials generally involve disease-affected patients to evaluate proof of concept and/or determine the dosing regimen(s) for subsequent investigations. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.\n•\nPhase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of disease-affected patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the investigational medicine for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the investigational medicine, and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.\nThe FDA may also require post-approval Phase 4 non-registrational studies to explore scientific questions to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of a drug.\nThe FDA or the clinical trial site may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a clinical trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the clinical trial. \nFDA review process\nFollowing completion of the clinical trials, data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA or NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry, and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. A BLA is a request for approval to market a biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the biologic’s safety, purity, and potency. An NDA for a new drug must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA or NDA must be obtained before a biologic or drug may be marketed in the United States. \nBefore approving a BLA or NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the facilities comply with cGMP requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee of expert advisors for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The committee makes a recommendation to the FDA that is not binding but is generally followed. \nAfter the FDA evaluates a BLA or NDA, it will grant marketing approval, request additional information or issue a complete response letter (CRL) outlining the deficiencies in the submission. The CRL may require additional testing or information, including additional preclinical or clinical data, for the FDA to reconsider the BLA or NDA. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may decide that the BLA or NDA still does not meet the standards for approval. If the FDA grants approval, it issues an approval letter that authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications.\nOrphan drug designation\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. \nIf a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to \n37\nTable of Contents\nmarket the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in very limited circumstances, such as if the latter product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product. \nExpedited development and review programs\nThe FDA may employ one of several tools to facilitate and expedite the development and review of a medicine, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review designation. Fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development and review of a medicine that treats a serious condition and fills an unmet medical need. Breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of a medicine that treats a serious condition and preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates substantial improvement over available therapies. Priority review designation means the FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within six months of filing. The FDA may grant priority review designation to a medicine that would provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of a treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition.\nA product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, such product must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM) that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials with due diligence. If the FDA concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require such post-marketing restrictions, as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (FDORA), the FDA is now permitted to require, as appropriate, that such trials be underway prior to approval or within a specific time period after the date of approval for a product granted accelerated approval. Additionally, under FDORA, the FDA has increased authority for expedited procedures to withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug or biologic if, for example, the confirmatory trial fails to verify the predicted clinical benefit of the product.\nEven if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval may not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval.\nEmergency Use Authorization (EUA)\nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) may authorize unapproved medical products to be marketed in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the U.S. government. The COVID-19 pandemic has been designated as such an emergency. After an emergency has been announced, the Secretary of HHS may authorize the issuance of and thereafter, the FDA Commissioner may issue EUAs for the use of specific products based on certain criteria, including that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing serious or life-threatening diseases when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. An EUA terminates when the emergency determination underlying the EUA terminates. An EUA is not a long-term alternative to obtaining FDA approval, licensure, or clearance for a product. The FDA may revoke an EUA for a variety of reasons, including if the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization.\nIn the United States, the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act) provides immunity for manufacturers from all claims under state or federal law for “loss” arising out of the administration or use of a “covered countermeasure.” However, injured persons may still bring a suit for “willful misconduct” against the manufacturer under some circumstances. “Covered countermeasures” include “qualified pandemic or epidemic products,” including products intended to diagnose or treat pandemic or epidemic disease, such as pandemic vaccines. For these immunities to apply, the Secretary of HHS must issue a declaration in cases of public health emergency or “credible risk” of a future public health emergency. \nOn March 17, 2020, the Secretary of HHS issued a declaration under the PREP Act and has issued subsequent amendments thereto to provide liability immunity for activities related to certain countermeasures against COVID-19. While we believe our products sold to the U.S. Government will continue to be covered under the provisions of the PREP Act, this cannot be assured.\nPediatric information\nUnder the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, all marketing applications for new active ingredients, indications, dosage forms, dosing regimens or routes of administration must contain an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in pediatric patients unless this requirement is waived, deferred or inapplicable.\nUnder the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, a product may be eligible for pediatric exclusivity, which adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued written request for such a study.\n38\nTable of Contents\nPost-approval requirements\nFollowing approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or NDA or BLA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.\nThe FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) to assure that the benefits of the product outweigh the risks. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, and other risk minimization tools. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures, including a REMS or the conduct of post-marketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards, or if problems occur following initial marketing.\nFDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP regulations. Entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics and their third-party manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Such entities are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. The discovery of violations could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including recall.\nU.S. patent term restoration and regulatory data exclusivity\nIn certain circumstances, some U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch Waxman Amendments. The Hatch Waxman Amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA or NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a BLA or NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for such an extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.\nIf the FDA approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved, the product is typically entitled to five years of non-patent regulatory data exclusivity. Other products may be entitled to three years of regulatory data exclusivity if approval was based on the FDA’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the NDA applicant. If the NDA applicant studies the product for use by children, the FDA may grant pediatric exclusivity, which extends by 180 days each existing exclusivity (patent and regulatory) related to the product. \nAn abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (the BPCI Act). Biosimilarity requires a showing that the product is “highly similar” to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product. A reference biological product is granted 12 years of regulatory data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. \n39\nTable of Contents\nDrug development in the European Economic Area (EEA)\nMedicinal products can be marketed in the EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU and Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authority has been obtained. Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the EU/EEA are subject to significant regulatory controls. Effective since January 2022, the Clinical Trials Regulation (EC) No. 536/2014 aims to streamline and harmonize the procedures for assessment and governance of clinical trials throughout the EU and to require that information on the authorization, conduct and results of each clinical trial conducted in the EU be publicly available.\nPediatric investigation plan\nAn application for marketing authorization of a medicinal product for human use that is not yet authorized in the EU must include a Pediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) pursuant to the Regulation No. 1901/2006 on medicinal products for pediatric use (known as the Paediatric Regulation), unless a waiver applies. A scientific committee established at the European Medicines Agency (EMA), the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) assesses the content of any PIP, waivers, and deferrals for a medicinal product submitted to it and formulates an opinion thereon.\nReview and approval process\nIn the EU/EEA, in order to obtain a marketing authorization from the applicable regulatory authority, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMPs), orphan medicinal products, or those medicines containing a new active substance and intended to treat specific diseases (HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases), and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative or contain a new active substance, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid throughout the EU/EEA. In addition to the centralized procedure, a marketing authorization can also be obtained in the EU/EEA through a national procedure, which requires a separate application to and approval determination by each country; a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision.\nA conditional marketing authorization may be granted in the EU when comprehensive clinical data for the safety and efficacy of the medicinal product have not been supplied but all the following requirements are met: (i) the risk-benefit balance of the medicine is positive; (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the comprehensive clinical data post-authorization; (iii) the medicine fulfills an unmet medical need; and (iv) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicine outweighs the risk that additional data is still required. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, on a renewable basis. The marketing authorization holder will be required to fulfil specific obligations within certain timeframes, which may include completing ongoing trials or conducting new trials to confirm that the benefit-risk balance is positive. Once such obligations are fulfilled, provided the benefit-risk balance is still positive, a conditional marketing authorization can be converted into a standard marketing authorization.\nEuropean regulatory data protection\nIn the EU, new innovative products authorized for marketing qualify for regulatory data protection consisting of eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market protection upon the grant of a marketing authorization. Data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s data when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization. \nDuring the additional two-year period of market protection, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market protection period. \nThere is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may not qualify for regulatory data protection.\nEuropean orphan designation and exclusivity\nOrphan drug designation is available in the EU to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of life threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU community, or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development, and in each case for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Medicinal products that receive and maintain orphan drug designation following approval are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity, which protects against applications for and the grant of marketing authorizations for similar medicinal products in the same therapeutic indication. This period may be \n40\nTable of Contents\nreduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met. During the period of market exclusivity, marketing authorization may only be granted to a similar medicinal product for the same therapeutic indication if: (i) a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar to the authorized product, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; (ii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or (iii) the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product \nThe aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.\nEuropean data protection regulations\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) governs the collection and use of personal data in the EU. The GDPR imposes strict requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the security and confidentiality of the personal data, data breach notification and the use of third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance, including the potential for fines of up to €20.0 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the infringer, whichever is greater. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with competent national data protection authorities, seek judicial remedies and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. Non-compliance could also result in the imposition of orders to stop data processing activities.\nThe UK has incorporated the GDPR into UK law (the UK GDPR). The UK GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018 set out the UK’s data protection regime, which is independent from but aligned to the EU’s data protection regime. Although the UK is regarded as a third country under the EU’s GDPR, the European Commission has issued a decision recognizing the UK as providing adequate protection under the EU GDPR and, therefore, transfers of personal data originating in the EU to the UK remain unrestricted. Like the GDPR, the UK GDPR restricts personal data transfers outside the UK to countries not regarded by the UK as providing adequate protection. The UK government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the UK to the EEA remain free flowing. Non-compliance with the UK GDPR may result in monetary penalties of up to £17.5 million or 4% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.\nMarketing of medicines in the EU\nSimilar to the Anti-Kickback Statute prohibition in the United States discussed below, the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU. Infringement of relevant EU laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Payments may be made to physicians in limited circumstances, and in certain EU Member States such payments must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians for the provision of services often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization, and/or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines, or imprisonment.\nRest of the world regulation\nOutside of the United States and the EU, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with such requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, or criminal prosecution.\nCoverage and reimbursement\nPatients who are provided medical treatment for their conditions generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their treatment. Coverage and adequate reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which drugs and treatments they will cover and the amount of reimbursement.\nIn the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. As a \nresult, obtaining coverage and reimbursement approval of a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide to each payor supporting scientific, clinical and cost-effectiveness data for the use of \n41\nTable of Contents\nour products on a payor-by-payor basis, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree. Even if we obtain coverage for a given product, the resulting reimbursement payment rates might not be adequate for us to achieve or sustain profitability or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Additionally, third-party payors may not cover, or provide adequate reimbursement for, long-term follow-up evaluations required following the use of product candidates, once approved. Patients are unlikely to use our product candidates, once approved, unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of their cost. There is significant uncertainty related to insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.\nNet prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. In addition, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average sales price and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely.\nWe expect that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Additionally, legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products.\nIn addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its Member States to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. A Member State may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.\nFor further information on certain risks associated with the pricing and reimbursement of our products see \n“Risk Factors\n—Sales of pharmaceutical products depend on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, and we may be adversely impacted by changes to such reimbursement policies or rules.\n”\nOther healthcare laws\nHealthcare providers, physicians, and third-party payors, including governmental payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid in the United States, will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any marketed products. Any arrangements with these parties implicate certain fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. In the United States, these laws include, among others:\n•\nThe Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug or any other good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. \n•\nThe federal False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government.\n•\nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme, or attempting to execute a scheme, to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors, or falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. \n•\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, which impose, among other things, requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information. \n•\nThe Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA), which requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs to disclose annually to the \n42\nTable of Contents\nfederal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians, teaching hospitals and certain other licensed health care practitioners. \n•\nFederal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs.\n•\nFederal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers.\n•\nAnalogous state fraud and abuse laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor. \nAdditionally, certain state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information. Such data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not pre-empted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA) established a comprehensive privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which took effect on January 1, 2023, has established additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information. The CPRA significantly modified the CCPA, including by expanding customers' rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the current versions of the CCPA and CPRA, other personal information is applicable due to the CPRA’s broader scope. Similar laws have been passed or proposed in numerous other states.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform. \nCurrent and future healthcare reform legislation\nIn the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our investigational medicines, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any approved products. The ACA, for example, contains provisions that subject biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars and may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and, annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Current laws, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price for any approved products.\nIn the United States, it is unclear whether the ACA will be overturned or further amended. We cannot predict what effect further changes to the ACA would have on our business. Additionally, other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted, including the Budget Control Act of 2011, which includes provisions to reduce the federal deficit. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare payments to providers, which began in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eliminated the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, previously set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, for single source and innovator multiple source drugs, beginning in 2024. These laws and regulations may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding and otherwise affect the prices we may obtain for any of our product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval or the frequency with which any such product candidate is prescribed or used. \nIn August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) was signed into law. The IRA includes several provisions that will impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that create a $2,000 out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, impose new manufacturer financial liability on all drugs in Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D pricing for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for drug prices that increase faster than inflation and delay the rebate rule that would require pass through of pharmacy benefit manager rebates to beneficiaries. The effect of IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known. \nFurther, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, the federal government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs, including price-controls and price transparency, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid health care costs. For example, the federal government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical \n43\nTable of Contents\nmanufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs.  \nEnvironment\nWe are subject to state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act. These and other laws govern the use, handling and disposal of various biologic, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment, breach of our regulatory obligations or expose individuals to harm, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. Equivalent laws have been adopted in foreign countries that impose similar obligations.\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 22, 2016.

    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors \nYou should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties, together with all other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the risk factors we describe \nbelow \ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks related to commercialization and our products \nUncertainty and evolving dynamics in the markets for COVID and RSV vaccines, and respiratory vaccines more generally, have in the past impacted and are likely to continue to impact our financial results.\nThere is significant uncertainty around the amount of future revenue we will recognize from sales of our COVID vaccine—which is our primary source of revenue—as well as sales of RSV and other respiratory vaccines. Accurately forecasting vaccination rates for our products, which directly impacts overall market size, has been difficult, and these difficulties may persist. Vaccination rates in the future may also be lower than our expectations, and are likely to be impacted by a number of factors, including public health authority recommendations, medical need, viral evolution and consumer motivation to vaccinate. Additionally, the recent Presidential election in the U.S. may impact policies and priorities related to our industry.  \nIn 2024, we recognized $3.1 billion of product sales, compared to $6.7 billion, $18.4 billion and $17.7 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. If demand for COVID vaccines continues to decline, we lose significant market share, or our products are subject to significant competitive pricing pressure, our product sales may not materialize consistent with our projections. Beyond COVID vaccines\n, in 2024, the overall RSV vaccine market was smaller than anticipated, in part due to recommendations from the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) regarding the frequency of vaccination and recommendations related to who, in terms of age or risk factors, should receive an RSV vaccine.\n \nThese recommendations were more limited than anticipated and future advisory committee recommendations (including with respect to RSV re-vaccination and age group recommendations) may continue to negatively impact the size of the market. \nIf we cannot effectively manage evolving market dynamics, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may suffer.\nWe have experienced commercial challenges and are likely to experience additional challenges in the future.\nWe face risks and uncertainties related to successfully commercializing our products. For example, in 2024, we faced commercial challenges that led to lower-than-expected sales and required us to adapt our business strategy. We experienced difficulties maintaining our COVID vaccine market share and gaining market share in the U.S. for our RSV vaccine, where we were third to market. Moving forward, we may need to dedicate greater resources to our commercial efforts than we anticipate, and we may not realize a return on this investment. Additionally, we may be unsuccessful in accurately anticipating future rates of return for our products, which may adversely impact our accounting estimates.\nFurthermore, we may seek to enter into agreements with others to utilize their marketing and distribution capabilities, but may be unable to enter into agreements on favorable terms, if at all. If we rely on others to commercialize our products, our revenues may be lower than if we commercialized these products ourselves. In addition, we may have little or no control over such third parties’ sales efforts. If our partners commit insufficient resources to commercialize our products, and we cannot independently develop necessary marketing capabilities, we may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain our business.\nThe vaccine market, and pharmaceutical market more generally, is intensely competitive, and we may not compete effectively in the market for existing or new products, treatment methods or technologies.\nWe compete with well-established, larger pharmaceutical companies for sales of our products, including against Pfizer and Sanofi for sales of our COVID vaccine and Pfizer and GSK for our RSV vaccine. These competitors (and others against whom we may compete now or in the future) have greater resources and experience than us across all stages of drug development and commercialization. For example, in 2024, our share of the COVID vaccine market declined due in part to increased commercial competition. Additionally, we faced continued exclusion from many European markets by a pandemic-era competitor contract with the European Commission. For RSV vaccines, we entered a market already occupied by two larger competitors and may continue to face difficulties achieving market share. These competitors have exploited and may in the future exploit their greater size, infrastructure, resources and experience to gain advantages in contracting with customers by, among other things, bundling their products, leveraging larger supply chains and greater purchasing power and utilizing their global networks.\nIn addition, certain U.S. private vaccine market practices, including regarding discounts, rebates and returns, may cause us to realize significantly lower revenues than list prices. We may also be adversely affected by similar market practices outside of the United \n45\nStates. In some instances, our competitors have been able to offer more attractive terms than we can, and they may continue to do so in the future.\nMore generally, the pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive and evolving. Other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research organizations are developing products that may compete with programs in our development pipeline. These competitors may have products that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community or are in later stages of development. For example, we are developing a seasonal flu vaccine, for which there is a well-developed market, \nand we may be unsuccessful in developing a product or achieving market share. We may need to offer more favorable terms to gain market share (which we may be unable to do), which may negatively impact our profitability. Additionally, \ncompetitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our products.\nAdditionally, any products that we develop may struggle to compete against those of our competitors for a variety of reasons, including relative safety and effectiveness, degree of any side effects, shelf-life, ease of administration and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, the availability and cost of manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sales capabilities, price, reimbursement coverage and patent protection. Even if our products demonstrate superiority to those of competitors, consumers, retailers and the public may fail to appreciate that benefit, or existing purchase commitments for a competitor’s product may discourage them from purchasing from us. These factors, or the perception of these factors, could lead to a competitor’s product being more successfully commercialized. Further, the mRNA medicines field is growing rapidly, with increased competitive pressure from large and more established pharmaceutical companies. The actual or perceived success or failure of others may adversely impact our ability to commercialize our products. \nWe may be unsuccessful in executing our cost efficiency and portfolio prioritization efforts.\nOur broad clinical success and recent commercial challenges have necessitated a more selective and paced approach to our research and development investment. If we do not successfully implement our cost efficiency and prioritization programs, we may fail to meet our cash breakeven goals. Furthermore, as we pursue and fund the development of our prioritized programs, we may forego or delay pursuit of other opportunities that could later prove to have greater commercial potential. If our prioritized programs are unsuccessful, or not as successful as other programs could have been, we may be unable to realize a sustainable return on our investments and or achieve long-term growth. \nWe have in the past, and may in the future, seek to resize our manufacturing infrastructure to reflect anticipated demand for our products.\n \nThis resizing may result in our incurring costs associated with exiting commitments, such as with suppliers for raw materials and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). Additionally, as a result of lower demand for our products, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, increased costs with respect to raw material suppliers as we seek to exit or modify our purchase commitments. Further, we have entered, and may in the future enter, into non-cancellable or take-or-pay purchase commitments for raw materials that require a long lead time to procure, increasing our commitment exposure. \nWe may be unsuccessful or delayed in updating our COVID vaccine to protect against future variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nNew SARS-CoV-2 strains may be more transmissible or cause more severe disease than earlier strains. Our COVID vaccines could be ineffective, or less effective than desired, in protecting against these new variants. Additionally, our decisions regarding vaccine development will be informed by guidance from the FDA and foreign regulators, which may impact the timing of development for our COVID vaccines. Different regulators have in the past and may in the future issue varying guidance regarding \nvaccine \ncomposition or populations who should receive a vaccine. If our efforts to develop variant-specific vaccines are not as successful as our competitors’, we could suffer reputational harm, loss of market share and adverse financial results. Additionally, we may expend significant resources adapting our vaccines or conducting clinical trials to protect against variants, but a market for our adapted vaccines \nmay \nfail to develop or demand may not align with our projections or cost expenditures.\nThe commercial success of our products depends on the degree of market acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors and others in the medical community.\nThe degree of market acceptance of our products will depend on numerous factors, including:\n•\nefficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments;\n•\nthe duration of protection provided by our products compared to those of our competitors;\n•\nacceptance of mRNA products generally and the availability of competing non-mRNA medicines that may be preferred by the medical community or the public;\n•\nsafety and the prevalence and severity of any side effects, including any limitations, restrictions (including for use together with other medicines) or warnings contained in a product’s approved labeling;\n46\n•\nthe prevalence and severity of any side effects resulting from checkpoint inhibitors or other products or therapies with which our products are co-administered;\n•\nrelative convenience and ease of administration;\n•\nthe willingness of the target patient population to try, and physicians to prescribe, new therapies;\n•\nthe strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products;\n•\nwhether our \nproduct \npresentation meets customer demand (e.g., for single-dose presentations, or combination vaccines\n);\n•\npublicity and health authority communications concerning our products or competing products and treatments; and \n•\nproduct cost and sufficient third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement, and patients’ willingness to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement.\nEven if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in clinical trials, market acceptance will be unknown until after it is launched. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our products may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nSales of pharmaceutical products depend on the availability and extent of reimbursement from third-party payors, and we may be adversely impacted by changes to such reimbursement policies or rules.\nSales of pharmaceutical products in general depends to a significant extent on adequate coverage, pricing and reimbursement from third-party payors. When a new product is approved, the availability and extent of government and private reimbursement, and the pricing, for that product may be uncertain. Additionally, pricing and reimbursement for any product we develop may be adversely affected by various factors, including:\n•\nchanges in, and implementation of, federal, state or foreign government regulations or private third-party payors’ reimbursement policies;\n•\npressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs; and\n•\nconsolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and, in some cases, the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value.\nOur ability to set the price for any product we develop will vary significantly by country. Our inability to obtain and maintain adequate prices in a particular country may limit the revenues from our products within that country and adversely affect our ability to secure acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets, which may limit market growth. This may create the opportunity for third-party cross-border trade or influence our decision whether to sell a product, thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenues.\nMany payors continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients, including more limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pay or co-insurance obligations and limitations on patients\n’\n use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs. Significant consolidation in the health insurance industry \nhas resulted in a few large insurers and pharmacy benefit managers exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers, significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage. Further consolidation among insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and other payors would increase the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers. Additional discounts, rebates, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products, particularly our therapeutic products or those that are individualized for a particular patient. Coverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend on various factors, including the third-party payor’s determination that use of a product is a covered benefit under its health plan, safe, effective and medically necessary, appropriate for the specific patient, cost-effective and neither experimental nor investigational.\nAdditionally, target patient populations for some of our product candidates may be small (e.g., for rare genetic diseases) or require individual customization (e.g., for our INTs). The pricing and reimbursement of our medicines, if approved, must be adequate to support commercial infrastructure. If we cannot obtain adequate levels of reimbursement, we may be unable to successfully market and sell our products. The manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our products (e.g., for administration to patients) is also important. Inadequate reimbursement for such services may discourage physicians from prescribing or recommending our products, adversely affecting our ability to market or sell those products.\nThe market opportunities for our products and product candidates may be smaller than we believe, or we may be unable to successfully identify clinical trial participants.\nWe focus certain of our research and product development activities on treatments for severe rare genetic diseases, where the patient populations are difficult to ascertain or small. \nAdditionally, \nour products may only be approved for certain populations or lines of treatment.\n47\nOur estimates of addressable patient populations are based on our beliefs, and have been derived from a variety of sources, including scientific literature, surveys of clinics, patient foundations or market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of trial participants may be lower than expected and potential clinical trial participants or patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our product candidates or products, or new clinical trial participants or patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to. Even if we obtain significant market share for our products, if approved, because the potential target populations are small, these medicines may never be profitable.\n Furthermore, the size of markets that we target may be impacted by health authority recommendations regarding who should receive our products, which may be impacted by the new U.S. federal government administration.\nRisks related to our pipeline, product development and regulatory review\nIf we cannot obtain, or are delayed in obtaining, regulatory approvals and advisory committee recommendations, we will be unable to effectively commercialize, or will be delayed in commercializing, our product candidates.\nAny products we may develop are subject to comprehensive regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulators. To obtain required regulatory approvals to commercialize any product candidate, we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our products are safe and effective for their intended use.\n In addition, regulators conduct pre-approval inspections and negative findings may lead to delay in approval and failure to commercialize a product candidate. Even once approved, products may be subject to recommendations from advisory committees, such as the ACIP, before or after they can be brought to market.  \nTo date, we have only received regulatory approvals for our COVID and RSV vaccines, and our current or future product candidates may never obtain regulatory approval or advisory committee recommendations\n. We may need to rely on third parties to assist us in making applications for marketing approvals. Preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulators elsewhere, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee approval in another. Regulators may require that we conduct additional clinical trials to support our applications for approval beyond our clinical development plans, which may result in increased expense and delays in bringing our products to market.\n \nAdditionally, the process of obtaining marketing approvals is expensive, time-consuming and uncertain, and can vary substantially based on many factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. Changes in marketing approval policies during the development period, changes in law or changes in regulatory review may delay the review of a submitted product application. The FDA and foreign regulators have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any marketing approval application or may decide that our data are insufficient for marketing approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval of a product candidate. Additional delays or non-approval may result if an FDA advisory committee or other regulator recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. \nClinical development is lengthy and uncertain, and our clinical programs may be delayed or terminated, or may be more costly to conduct than we anticipate.\nClinical testing is expensive, complex and lengthy, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved as products. Although we have demonstrated historical success with our platform technology, we may not continue to realize the same levels of success with clinical trials in the future.\n \nWe and our strategic collaborators also may experience unforeseen events during, or as a result of, any clinical trials that we or they conduct that could delay or prevent us or them from successfully developing our product candidates and gaining approval from regulators. Events that might prevent us from proceeding with clinical trials could include:\n•\nregulators, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) or ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site;\n•\nwe may experience delays in reaching, or fail to reach, agreement on favorable terms with prospective trial sites and prospective contract research organizations (CROs);\n•\nchanges to the scale or site of our manufacturing could cause significant delays or changes in our clinical trial designs;\n•\nthe outcome of our preclinical studies and our early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results;\n•\nwe may be unable to establish or achieve clinically meaningful endpoints for our studies;\n•\nif we make changes to our product candidates after clinical trials have commenced (which we have done in the past), we may be required to repeat earlier stages or delay later stages of clinical testing;\n•\nclinical trials of any product candidates may fail to show safety or efficacy, or may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, or we may decide to abandon product development programs;\n48\n•\nour product candidates, or other medicines in the same class as ours, may cause significant adverse events or other undesirable side effects, such as the immunogenicity of the LNPs or their components, the immunogenicity of the protein made by the mRNA or degradation products, any of which could lead to serious adverse events, or other effects;\n•\nour third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all, or may deviate from the applicable clinical trial protocol or withdraw from the applicable clinical trial, which may require that we add new clinical trial sites;\n•\nregulators may impose a complete or partial clinical hold on a clinical trial (or a trial of another company working on mRNA medicines), or we or our investigators, IRBs or ethics committees may suspend or terminate clinical research or trials for various reasons, including quality events, noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that participants are being exposed to an unacceptable benefit-risk ratio;\n•\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate;\n•\nsafety and efficacy concerns regarding our product candidates will be considered by us and by the FDA and other regulators as we pursue clinical trials of new product candidates, develop effective informed consent documentation and work with IRBs and scientific review committees (SRCs);\n•\nsafety or efficacy concerns could arise from nonclinical or clinical testing of other therapies targeting a similar disease state or other therapies, such as gene therapy, that are perceived as similar to ours;\n•\nadverse side effects could be observed in future clinical trials where our product candidates are administered in combination with other therapies (such as the co-administration of our INT product candidate, mRNA-4157\n);\n•\ndelays in developing assays acceptable to the FDA or other regulators; \nand\n•\na lack of adequate funding to continue a particular clinical trial, including due to higher-than-anticipated costs.\nAdditionally, we have conducted and may conduct in the future “open-label” clinical trials, where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate, an approved drug or a placebo. The results from an open-label clinical trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results from a controlled environment with a placebo or active control. Further, the FDA or other regulators may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials. Significant preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies or clinical trial delays for our product candidates could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and could harm our business.\nThere are risks unique to each of our programs and modalities and risks applicable across programs and modalities, which may delay or prevent our ability to advance one or more of our programs in clinical development, obtain regulatory approval or commercialize our products.\nCertain features in our product candidates, including those related to mRNA, chemical modifications, surface chemistries, LNPs and their components, may result in risks that apply to some or all of our programs and modalities. As our product candidates progress, we or others may determine that certain of our risk allocation decisions were incorrect or insufficient, we made platform-level technology mistakes, individual programs or our mRNA science in general has technology or biology risks that were unknown or under-appreciated, our choices on how to develop our infrastructure to support our scale will result in an inability to manufacture our product candidates for clinical trials or otherwise impair our manufacturing or we have allocated resources in such a way that we cannot recover large investments or rapidly re-direct capital.\nWe utilize earlier programs in a modality to understand the technology risks within the modality, including the program’s manufacturing and pharmaceutical properties. Even if our earlier programs in a modality are successful in any phase of development, other programs may fail at that stage, and any program may fail at a later phase of development\n. This may be a result of technical challenges or biology risk unique to that program. The biology risk across much of our pipeline represents targets and pathways not clinically validated by one or more approved drugs, and the risk that the targets or pathways that we have selected may not be effective will continue to apply across our current and future programs.\nAs we progress our programs through clinical development, new technical challenges may arise that cause an entire modality to fail. Additionally, any portfolio-spanning risks, whether known or unknown, such as an increased risk of a particular type of side effect, if realized in any one of our programs, would have a material and adverse effect on our other programs and on our overall business.\nThere are also specific additional risks to certain of our modalities and programs. For example, prophylactic vaccines typically require clinical testing in up to tens of thousands of healthy volunteers to define an approvable benefit-risk profile. The need to show a high degree of safety and tolerability when dosing healthy individuals could result in rare and even spurious safety findings, negatively impacting a program prior to or after commercial launch. Even if we observe positive safety, tolerability and levels of immunogenicity in early clinical trials, we may not observe acceptable safety or efficacy profiles in later-stage trials required for approval of these programs.\n49\nThere are many clinical and manufacturing challenges specific to our INT product candidates and any other neoantigen cancer vaccines we may develop. These risks include a rapid production turn-around time measured in weeks in order to supply patients in our clinical trials before further progression and mutation of their tumors, the significant costs incurred in making individualized medicines and potential lack of immune responses due to the biology of the tumor or immune status of the patient. These risks apply to our INT product candidates and other neoepitope investigational medicine programs. \nAdditionally, there may be challenges in delivering an adequate quantity of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) required to drive efficacy due to the limitation in volume of API that can be delivered to a specific location, like a tumor or injured tissue. Our investigational therapies for local injections often require specialized skills for conducting a clinical trial that could delay clinical trials or slow or impair commercialization of a product due to the poor adoption of injected local therapeutics. In addition, the uncertain translatability of target selection from preclinical animal models, including mouse and non-human primate models, to successful clinical trial results may be impossible, particularly for systemic therapies and cancer vaccines. In general, several biological steps are required for delivery of mRNA to translate into therapeutically active medicines. These processing steps may differ between individuals or tissues, potentially leading to variable levels of therapeutic protein, variable activity, immunogenicity or variable distribution to tissues for a therapeutic effect. Gene therapies and mRNA medicines may activate one or more immune responses against any and all components of the drug product (e.g., the mRNA or the delivery vehicle, such as an LNP) as well as against the encoded protein, giving rise to potential immune reaction related adverse events. Eliciting an immune response against the encoded protein may impede our ability to achieve a pharmacologic effect upon repeat administration or a side effect.\nWe may experience delays in enrolling participants in our clinical trials.\nEnrolling participants in our clinical trials is critical to our success. Difficulties or delays in enrolling a sufficient number of clinical trial participants may result in increased costs or affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trials, which could prevent trial completion and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates.\n \nParticipant enrollment is affected by many factors, including:\n•\nseverity of the disease under investigation;\n•\ncomplexity and design of the clinical trial protocol;\n•\nsize of the patient population;\n•\neligibility criteria for the clinical trial in question, including age-based eligibility criteria limiting subject enrollment to adolescent or pediatric populations;\n•\nproximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective trial participants;\n•\navailability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n•\npatient referral practices of physicians;\n•\nability to monitor trial participants adequately during and after treatment;\n•\nability to recruit qualified clinical trial investigators;\n•\nclinicians’ and trial participants’ perceptions as to the potential advantages and side effects of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating;\n•\nadverse results or other adverse safety signals in our trials or related to other product candidates, and the resulting negative publicity, could discourage potential clinical trial participants and their doctors from participating in our trials; and\n•\nour ability to obtain and maintain participant informed consent.\nAdditionally, we may have limited or no ability to influence enrollment in clinical trials where our collaborators control clinical development. Even if we or our strategic collaborators can enroll clinical trial participants, there is no guarantee that such participants will ultimately be dosed as part of, or complete, a clinical trial.\nmRNA drug development has substantial clinical development and regulatory risks due to the novel nature of this new class of medicines, and the negative perception of the efficacy, safety or tolerability profile of any product candidates that we or others develop could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business, advance our product candidates or obtain regulatory approvals.\nVery few mRNA medicines have been authorized or approved to date by the FDA or other regulators, and efficacy, safety and immunogenicity data and real-world evidence with respect to mRNA medicines continue to accumulate. We may observe new, more frequent or more severe adverse events in subjects participating in ongoing clinical trials or among individuals vaccinated with mRNA vaccines. For example, some studies have suggested that our COVID vaccine may be associated with higher rates of myocarditis and pericarditis in young males compared to other COVID vaccines. If similar observations are made in recipients of our other products or product candidates, or if other unexpected safety issues arise, we could suffer significant damage to our reputation and that of our mRNA platform. Such events \ncould\n lead to other issues, including delays in our other programs, the need to re-design our clinical trials and the need for significant additional financial resources. In addition, the FDA and other regulators may interpret data from our \n50\nclinical trials differently than we do and such agencies may require us to conduct additional studies or analyses, which could delay or prevent us from obtaining full regulatory approvals\n in certain jurisdictions\n or for certain demographics. For example, in October 2021, the FDA requested that we explore a lower dosage for our COVID vaccine in adolescents, which extended the length of clinical trials in this population prior to receiving regulatory authorization. In addition, local legislatures may attempt to regulate or restrict the use of mRNA medicines in their jurisdictions.\nSuccessful discovery and development of mRNA medicines by us or our strategic collaborators is highly uncertain and depends on many factors beyond our or their control. We constantly make business decisions and take calculated risks to advance our development efforts and pipeline, including those related to mRNA technology, delivery technology and manufacturing processes, which ultimately may be unsuccessful.\nOur product candidates that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to advance, experience delays in the clinic, experience clinical holds or fail to reach the market for many reasons, including:\n•\nnonclinical or preclinical study, or clinical trial, results may show potential mRNA medicines to be less effective than desired or to have harmful or problematic side effects or toxicities;\n•\nadverse results in our clinical trials, or in those of others developing similar products, or adverse effects relating to mRNA, or our LNPs, may lead to negative publicity or delays in or termination of our programs;\n•\nthe efficacy or safety of a combination vaccine product candidate could be less than that seen with the administration of the vaccine\ns separately, which could prevent the combination product from obtaining regulatory approval;\n•\nadverse events related to products that are perceived to be similar to mRNA medicines, such as those related to gene therapy or gene editing, could result in a decrease in the perceived benefit of one or more of our programs, increased regulatory scrutiny, decreased confidence by patients and clinical trial collaborators in our product candidates and less demand for any product that we may develop;\n•\nthe insufficient ability of our translational models to reduce risk or predict outcomes in humans, particularly given that each component of our product candidates may have a dependent or independent effect on safety, tolerability and efficacy, which may be species-dependent;\n•\nmanufacturing failures or insufficient supply of current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP)\n \nmaterials for clinical trials, or higher than expected cost could delay or set back clinical trials, or make mRNA medicines commercially unattractive;\n•\nchanges that we make to optimize our manufacturing, testing or formulating of cGMP materials could impact the safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of our product candidates;\n•\npricing or reimbursement issues or other factors that delay clinical trials or make any mRNA medicine uneconomical or noncompetitive with other therapies;\n•\nour large pipeline of product candidates could result in a greater quantity of reportable adverse events, including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions, other reportable negative clinical outcomes, manufacturing reportable events or material clinical events that could lead to clinical delay or hold by the FDA or applicable regulatory authority or other clinical delays, any of which could negatively impact the perception of one or more of our programs, as well as our business as a whole;\n•\nfailure to timely advance our programs or a failure or delay in receiving necessary regulatory approvals due to, among other factors, slow or failure to complete enrollment in clinical trials, withdrawal by trial participants from trials, failure to achieve trial endpoints, additional time requirements for data analysis, data integrity issues, preparation of a BLA or the equivalent application, discussions with the FDA or EMA, a regulatory request for additional nonclinical or clinical data or safety formulation or manufacturing issues may lead to our inability to obtain sufficient funding;\n•\nnew legislation or regulations passed by U.S., state or foreign governments in response to negative public perception of mRNA medicines; and\n•\nthe proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies that may prevent our mRNA medicines from being commercialized.\nBecause we are developing some of our product candidates for the treatment of diseases in which there is little clinical experience and, in some cases, using new endpoints or methodologies, the FDA or other regulators may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results.\nThere are no pharmacologic therapies approved to treat the underlying causes of many diseases that we are currently attempting to address or may address in the future. For instance, for many of the rare diseases for which we are developing treatments, few clinical trials have been attempted, and there are no approved drugs to treat these diseases. As a result, the design and conduct of clinical trials of product candidates for the treatment of these disorders may take longer, be more costly or be less effective due to the novelty of development in these diseases.\nEven if the FDA does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoint to a degree of statistical significance in our pivotal or other clinical trials. Further, even if we achieve the pre-\n51\nspecified criteria, our clinical trials may produce unpredictable or inconsistent results compared against the more traditional efficacy endpoints in the trial. The FDA could give overriding weight to other efficacy endpoints over a primary endpoint, even if we achieve statistically significant results on that endpoint, if we do not do so on our secondary efficacy endpoints. The FDA also weighs the benefits of a product against its risks and may view the efficacy results in the context of safety as not being supportive of licensure. Regulators in other countries may make similar findings with respect to these endpoints.\nCertain mRNA therapies are classified as gene therapies by the FDA and the EMA. The association of our products with gene therapies could result in increased regulatory burdens, impair the reputation of our products or negatively impact our platform or our business.\nThere are only a few approved gene therapy products in the United States or foreign jurisdictions, and there have been well-reported significant adverse events associated with their testing and use. Regulatory requirements governing gene therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future, and the implications for mRNA therapies are unknown. For example, the FDA has established an office, now called the Office of Therapeutics Products (OTP), within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products, and convenes the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. In the EU, certain mRNA therapies have been characterized as gene therapy medicinal products, which falls within a broader category known as Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products (ATMPs), which are subject to additional regulatory requirements. In certain countries, mRNA therapies have not yet been classified or any such classification is not known to us; for example, in Japan, the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency has not taken a position on the regulatory classification of mRNA therapies. Notwithstanding the differences between mRNA medicines and gene therapies, the classification of some of our mRNA product candidates as gene therapies in the U.S., the EU and potentially other countries could adversely impact our ability to develop our product candidates. For instance, a clinical hold on gene therapy products may apply to our mRNA product candidates irrespective of the differences between gene therapies and mRNA.\nAdverse events reported with respect to gene therapies could adversely impact one or more of our programs. Although our mRNA product candidates are designed not to make any permanent changes to cell DNA, regulatory agencies or others could believe that adverse effects of gene therapies caused by introducing new DNA and irreversibly changing the DNA in a cell could also be a risk for our mRNA investigational therapies, and as a result may delay one or more of our clinical trials or impose additional testing for long-term side effects. Any new requirements and guidelines promulgated by regulatory agencies may negatively affect our business by lengthening the regulatory review process, requiring us to perform additional or larger studies or increasing our development costs, any of which could lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent advancement or approval and commercialization of our product candidates, or lead to significant post-approval studies, limitations or restrictions. As we advance our product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory agencies and advisory committees and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of some or all of our product candidates.\nOur work in genomic editing is subject to all risks associated with gene therapies. Genome editing technologies are relatively new and their therapeutic utility is largely unproven. Public perception and related media coverage of potential therapy-related efficacy or safety issues, as well as ethical concerns related specifically to genome editing, may adversely influence the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical trials. In addition, any review conducted by an institutional biosafety committee may result in delay or prevent initiation of a gene therapy clinical trial.\nAdditionally, if any such therapeutic is approved, physicians and patients may be slow or fail to accept these novel and personalized treatments. Physicians, health care providers and third-party payors often are slow to adopt new products, technologies and treatment practices, particularly those that may also require additional upfront costs and training. Physicians may not be willing to undergo training to adopt these novel and potentially personalized therapies, may decide the particular therapy is too complex or potentially risky to adopt without appropriate training and may choose not to administer the therapy. Further, due to health conditions, genetic profile or other reasons, certain patients may not be candidates for the therapies. In addition, responses by federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments to negative public perception, ethical concerns or financial considerations may result in new legislation, regulations or medical standards that could limit our ability to develop or commercialize any product candidates, obtain or maintain regulatory approval or otherwise achieve profitability. Based on these and other factors, health care providers and payors may decide that the benefits of these new therapies do not or will not outweigh their costs.\nOur products are, and any future products will be, subject to regulatory scrutiny.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction, we may remain subject to significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product and ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies-such as those required under an accelerated approval by the FDA or other similar type of approval-or post-market surveillance. For example, the holder of an approved BLA must monitor and report adverse events and monitor and report any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the BLA, as well as submit new or supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product \n52\nlabeling, or manufacturing process. Additionally, pharmacovigilance obligations under the regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions where our products are distributed require us to collect, process, analyze and monitor safety \ndata and to identify\n and evaluate adverse reactions to our products\n as they are administered in those \njurisdic\ntions\n. If\n we or any of our partners assisting us in meeting these obligations cannot comply with\n relevant regulations, we may be subject to sanctions, increased costs and reputational harm, or our re\ngulatory authorizations to distribute our vaccines in the relevant jurisdiction\n may be revoked or curtailed.\nFurthermore, advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules and regulations and are subject to FDA review, in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws. In addition, regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe are required by the FDA to conduct post-marketing studies for our COVID vaccine (mRNA-1273), including to assess the risk of myocarditis and pericarditis and to evaluate outcomes in pregnant women and infants post-vaccination. We or others could identify previously unknown side effects, or known side effects could be observed as being more frequent or severe than in clinical trials or earlier post-marketing periods. If we, our contract manufacturers or other strategic collaborators fail to comply with applicable post-approval regulatory requirements, a regulator may issue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law, seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines, suspend or withdraw regulatory approval or revoke a license, suspend any ongoing clinical trials, refuse to approve a pending BLA or supplements to a BLA submitted by us, seize or recall products or product candidates, or require field alerts to physicians, pharmacists and hospitals or refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts. We could also be required to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials, or implement changes in labeling or to our manufacturing processes, specifications or facilities. Initiation of any government investigation or lawsuit, including class-action lawsuits, would require us to expend significant time and resources in response and would likely generate negative publicity. The occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize \nour COVID vaccine\n, or any future approved products, and generate revenues. Our COVID vaccine is still subject to an emergency use authorization (EUA) for pediatric populations, and this EUA could be revoked for a variety of reasons, including if the FDA determines that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization.\n \nAdditionally, the FDA or other foreign regulators could require us to adopt Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) for any product to ensure that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks for each potential patient, which may include, among other things, a medication guide outlining the risks of the product for distribution to patients, a communication plan to health care practitioners, extensive patient monitoring or distribution systems and processes that are highly controlled, restrictive and more costly than what is typical for the industry. Furthermore, if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by any product that we develop, several potentially significant negative consequences could result, including the suspension or withdrawal of approvals and licenses, the addition of warning labels, changes to the way a product is administered, the requirement to conduct further clinical trials, lawsuits or increased liability for harm to patients and their children and reputational harm to us. Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any products we develop.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2024 decision in \nLoper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo\n overturned the longstanding \nChevron\n doctrine, under which courts were required to give deference to regulatory agencies’ reasonable interpretations of ambiguous federal statutes. The \nLoper\n decision could result in additional legal challenges to regulations and guidance issued by federal agencies, including the FDA, on which we rely. Additionally, the \nLoper\n decision may result in increased regulatory uncertainty, inconsistent judicial interpretations and other impacts to the agency rule-making process. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action or as a result of legal challenges, either in the United States or abroad. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our business could be materially harmed.\nPreclinical development is lengthy and uncertain, especially for mRNA medicines.\nMuch of our pipeline is in preclinical development, and these programs could be delayed or not advanced into the clinic. Before we can initiate clinical trials for a product candidate, we must complete extensive preclinical studies, including IND-enabling good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology testing. We must also complete extensive work on Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) activities to be included in an IND submission. CMC activities for mRNA medicines require extensive manufacturing processes and analytical development, which is uncertain and lengthy. We have had and may in the future have difficulty identifying appropriate buffers and storage conditions to enable sufficient shelf life of batches of our product candidates. If we must produce new batches, our preclinical studies could be delayed. We cannot be certain of the timely completion of our preclinical testing and studies, whether the FDA or other regulators will accept the results or if the outcome of our preclinical testing, studies and CMC activities will ultimately support further development of our programs. As a result, we may be unable to submit INDs or similar applications for our preclinical programs on the timelines we expect, if at all, and such applications may not result in the FDA or other regulators allowing clinical trials to begin.\n53\nRisks related to the manufacturing of our commercial products and product candidates\nWe or our third-party manufacturers may encounter difficulties in manufacturing, product release, shelf life, testing, storage, supply chain management or shipping for any of our products.\nThe manufacturing processes for our mRNA medicines are novel and complex. We and our collaborators have experienced and may continue to encounter difficulties in manufacturing, product release, shelf life, testing, storage, supply chain management or shipping, including delays as our supply chain expands and grows more complex. We may experience difficulties effectively managing and executing the complexities of a larger and multi-product supply plan, including those resulting from complexities of producing batches at larger scale, equipment failure, human error, choice and quality of raw materials and excipients, analytical testing technology and product instability. Further, mRNA medicines encapsulated in LNPs must be developed and manufactured under well-controlled conditions, or pharmacological activity can be adversely impacted.\nIn an effort to optimize product features, we have in the past and may in the future make changes to our product candidates in their manufacturing and stability formulation and conditions. This has in the past and may in the future result in our having to resupply batches for preclinical or clinical activities when there is insufficient product stability during storage and insufficient supply. Insufficient stability or shelf life of our product candidates could materially delay our ability to continue clinical trials or require us to begin a new clinical trial with a newly formulated drug product, due to the need to manufacture additional preclinical or clinical supply.\nOur high rate of innovation causes a high degree of technology change that can negatively impact product comparability during and after clinical development. Furthermore, technology changes may drive the need for changes in, modification to, or the sourcing of new manufacturing infrastructure or may adversely affect third-party relationships.\nIn many cases, we may need to utilize multiple batches of drug substance and drug product to meet the supply requirement of a single preclinical study or clinical trial. Failure in our ability to scale up batch size or failure in any batch, which we have experienced in the past, may lead to a substantial delay in our clinical trials or in the commercialization of any approved product. For example, the changes we make as we continue developing new manufacturing processes for our drug substance and drug product may impact specification and stability of the drug product, and may lead to failure of batches, resulting in a substantial delay in delivery of commercial product or conduct of our clinical trials. Our mRNA product candidates may prove to have a stability profile that leads to a lower than desired shelf life of the final approved medicine. This poses risk in supply requirements, wasted stock and higher cost of goods.\nWe are dependent on a number of equipment providers who are also implementing novel technology. Further, we have developed our own custom manufacturing equipment for certain of our medicines. If we encounter unexpected performance issues with such equipment, we could encounter delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply. Due to the number of different programs, we may have cross contamination of product candidates inside of our factories, CROs, suppliers or in the clinic that affect the integrity of our product candidates.\nAs we scale the manufacturing output for commercial production and particular programs, we plan to continuously improve yield, purity and the pharmaceutical properties of our products and product candidates from\n \nIND-enabling studies through commercial launch, including shelf-life stability, and solubility properties of drug product and drug substance. Because of continuous improvement in manufacturing processes, we may switch processes for a particular program during development. However, after a change in process, more time will be required for pharmaceutical property testing, such as 6 or 12 month stability testing. That may require resupplying clinical material or making additional cGMP batches to keep up with clinical trial demand before such pharmaceutical property testing is completed.\nWe utilize a number of raw materials and excipients that have a single source of supply, are new to the pharmaceutical industry and are being employed in a novel manner. Some of these raw materials and excipients have not been scaled to a level to support commercial supply and could experience unexpected manufacturing or testing failures or supply shortages. Such issues with raw materials and excipients could cause delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply of our products or product candidates.\nWe have established several analytical assays and may have to establish several more to assess the quality of our mRNA product candidates. We may identify gaps in our analytical testing strategy that might prevent release of product or could require product withdrawal or recall. For example, we may discover new impurities that have an impact on product safety, efficacy or stability. This may lead to an inability to release mRNA product candidates until the manufacturing or testing process is rectified.\n54\nAs we grow as a commercial company and our drug development pipeline increases and matures, the increased demand for clinical and commercial supplies from our facilities and third parties may impact our ability to operate. We rely on third-party service providers, all of whom have inherent risks in their operations.\nCompletion of our trials and commercialization of our product candidates require access to, or development of, facilities to manufacture our vaccine candidates at sufficient yields and at commercial scale. We expect to continue to make significant investments in our manufacturing capacity and commercial network as we continue to expand our commercial launch efforts. \nWe expect to bring manufacturing plants online in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in 2025 and are subject to risks associated with operationalizing these facilities, including with respect to plant licensures\n.\nTo supplement our internal manufacturing infrastructure, we have entered into agreements for the production, as well as for commercial fill-finish manufacturing, of our products to supply markets globally. We may need to engage additional third parties in the future to meet our capacity needs. If we cannot enter into such arrangements on favorable terms, or at all, our ability to develop, manufacture and distribute our products would be adversely affected. Further, efforts to establish these capabilities may not meet initial expectations as to scheduling, scale-up, reproducibility, yield, purity, cost, potency or quality. If we are unable to institute necessary controls related to product development, manufacturing and quality, we may encounter difficulties producing our products on the timelines and in the quantities set forth in our supply agreements or to meet potential future demand.\nWe currently utilize, and expect to continue to utilize, third parties to, among other things, manufacture raw materials, components, parts, and consumables and to perform quality testing. If the field of mRNA and other nucleic acid medicines continues to expand, we may encounter increasing competition for these materials and services. Demand for third-party manufacturing or testing facilities may grow at a faster rate than their existing capacity, which could disrupt our ability to find and retain third-party manufacturers capable of producing sufficient quantities of such raw materials, components, parts and consumables required to manufacture our mRNA product candidates. The use of service providers and suppliers could expose us to risks, including:\n•\ntermination or non-renewal of supply and service agreements in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us;\n•\ndisruptions to the operations of these suppliers and service providers caused by conditions unrelated to our business or operations, including the bankruptcy of the supplier or service provider; and\n•\ninspections of third-party facilities by regulators that could have a negative outcome and result in delays to or termination of their ability to supply our requirements.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers may adversely affect our operations or result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control. Because of contractual restraints and the limited number of third-party manufacturers with the expertise, required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture our bulk vaccines on a commercial scale, replacement of a manufacturer may be expensive and time-consuming and may cause interruptions in the production of our vaccine. Regulators may also require us to register our facilities or those of another supplier if we terminate an existing third-party manufacturer relationship, which could lead to delays or our inability to supply a particular market. A third-party manufacturer may also encounter difficulties, delays or interruptions in production, including:\n•\ndifficulties with production costs, scale up and yields;\n•\navailability of raw materials and supplies;\n•\nquality control and assurance;\n•\nshortages of qualified personnel;\n•\ncompliance with strictly enforced regulations that vary in each country where products might be sold; and\n•\nlack of capital funding.\nWe are subject to operational risks associated with the physical and digital infrastructure at our manufacturing facilities and those of our external service providers.\nOur manufacturing facilities incorporate a significant level of automation of equipment with integration of several digital systems, including those that may utilize artificial intelligence (AI), to improve efficiency of operations. The digitization of our facilities exposes us to the risk of process equipment malfunctions. These risks include potential system failures or shutdowns due to internal or external factors including design issues, system compatibility or potential cybersecurity compromises, incidents or breaches. Upgrades or changes to our systems, infrastructure or the software that we implement, use, or upon which our business relies, may result in the introduction of new cybersecurity vulnerabilities and risks.\nOur facilities and infrastructure or those of our contract manufacturers or other third-party providers may also be subject to attacks or acts of sabotage by outside actors, contractors or employees. Any disruption in our or our contract manufacturers’ manufacturing capabilities could delay scaling up production capacity for our drug substances or products or shut down facilities, impose additional \n55\ncosts, cause us to fail to meet certain product volume or delivery timing obligations, or may require us to identify, qualify and establish an alternative manufacturing site, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs we expand our development and commercial capacities, we have and expect that we will continue to establish additional manufacturing capabilities in the United States, as well as in other countries, such as Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. This expansion may lead to regulatory delays or prove more costly than anticipated. If we fail to select suitable locations, complete construction in an efficient manner, engage effectively with local regulators, recruit the required personnel or manage our growth effectively, the development and production of products or our product candidates could be delayed or curtailed.\nOur products and product candidates are sensitive to shipping and storage conditions, which, in some cases, requires cold-chain logistics and subjects them to risk of loss or damage.\nOur products and product candidates are sensitive to temperature, storage and handling conditions, and we could lose medicines if the product or product intermediates are not stored or handled properly. Shelf life for our products and product candidates is variable, and they may expire prior to use. Cold-chain logistics are required for certain of our products and product candidates. If we or third-party distributors do not maintain effective cold-chain supply logistics, then we may experience returned or out of date products and product may be rendered unusable. This has led and could lead to additional manufacturing costs and delays in our ability to supply required quantities for clinical trials or commercial sale. In addition, the cost associated with such transportation services and the limited pool of vendors could cause supply disruptions.\nOur manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers may fail to meet regulatory requirements. Failure to meet cGMP requirements could delay approval of or increase production costs for our products.\nThe manufacturing of medicines for clinical trials or commercial sale is subject to extensive regulation, and components of such products must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements, which are enforced, in the case of the FDA, in part through its facilities inspection program. The regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures, including record keeping, and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of products and materials used in clinical trials. Poor control of cGMP production processes can lead to product quality failures that can impact our ability to supply product, resulting in cost overruns and delays to clinical timelines, which could be extensive. Such production process issues include:\n•\ncritical deviations in the manufacturing process;\n•\nfacility and equipment failures;\n•\ncontamination of the product due to an ineffective quality control strategy;\n•\nfacility contamination as assessed by the facility and utility environmental monitoring program;\n•\nraw material failures due to ineffective supplier qualification or regulatory compliance issues at critical suppliers;\n•\nineffective product stability;\n•\nineffective corrective actions or preventative actions taken to correct or avoid critical deviations due to our developing understanding of the manufacturing process as we scale; and\n•\nfailed or defective components or consumables.\nRegulators typically require representative manufacturing site inspections to assess adequate compliance with cGMP and manufacturing controls. If we or one of our third-party manufacturing sites fails to provide sufficient quality assurance or control, the product approval to commercialize may not be granted. Inspections by regulators may occur at any time during the\n \ndevelopment or commercialization of products and may be unannounced. The inspections may be product specific or facility specific, or as a follow up to market or development issues that the regulatory agency may identify. Deficient inspection outcomes, such as failure to comply with cGMP requirements, may negatively impact the ability of our third-party manufacturers or suppliers to fulfill their supply obligations, impacting or delaying supply or delaying programs.\nThe manufacturing process for our products is subject to regulatory approval. If we or our third-party manufacturers are unable to reliably produce products or product candidates to specifications acceptable to regulators, we or our strategic collaborators may not obtain or maintain the approvals needed to commercialize such products. Even if regulatory approval is obtained for any of our mRNA medicines, there is no assurance that either we or our CMOs will be able to manufacture the approved medicine to specifications acceptable to the FDA or other regulators. Any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials, require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidates, impair commercialization efforts or increase our cost of goods, which, in turn, could have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we may not have direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Our contract manufacturers supply or manufacture materials or products for other companies and their failure to meet applicable \nregulatory requirements may affect the regulatory status of their facilities. In addition, to the extent that \n56\nwe rely on foreign contract manufacturers, we are subject to additional risks, including the need to comply with import and export regulations.\nThe FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulators may require us to submit product samples of any lot of any approved product, together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests, at any time. In some cases, regulators may prohibit us from distributing a lot or lots until it authorizes release. Deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability, may cause unacceptable changes in the product, resulting in lot failures or product recalls. Our third-party contract manufacturers have experienced lot failures resulting in product recalls of our COVID vaccine. Lot failures have caused, and lot failures or product recalls in the future with respect to product produced by either our own or our third-party manufacturers’ facilities could cause, us and our strategic collaborators to delay clinical trials or product launches.\nWe and our manufacturing partners also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, quality control and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing processes and operations or those of our manufacturing partners, which could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Additionally, we may not be able to control for or detect intentional sabotage or negligence by any employee or contractor.\nOur INT product candidates are uniquely manufactured for each patient using a novel, complex manufacturing process and we may encounter difficulties in production.\nWe custom design and manufacture INTs tailored for each patient. Manufacturing unique lots of INTs is susceptible to product loss or failure due to issues with:\n•\nlogistics associated with the collection and shipping of a patient’s tumor, blood or other tissue sample;\n•\nnext-generation sequencing of the tumor mRNA and identification of appropriate tumor-specific mutations; \n•\nthe use of a software program, including proprietary and open source components, which is hosted in the cloud and a part of our product candidate, to assist with the design of the patient-specific mRNA, which software must be maintained and secured;\n•\neffective design of the patient-specific mRNA that encodes for the required neoantigens;\n•\nbatch specific manufacturing failures or issues that arise due to the uniqueness of each patient-specific batch;\n•\nquality control testing failures;\n•\nunexpected failures of batches placed on stability;\n•\nshortages or quality control issues with single-use assemblies, consumables or critical parts sourced from third-party vendors that must be changed out for each patient-specific batch;\n•\nsignificant costs associated with individualized manufacturing that may adversely affect our ability to continue development;\n•\nsuccessful and timely manufacture and release of the patient-specific batch;\n•\nshipment issues encountered during transport of the batch to the patient site of care; and\n•\nthe ability to define a consistent safety profile at a given dose when each participant receives a unique therapy.\nWe have built and installed custom manufacturing equipment for INTs incorporated into a dedicated unit at our Norwood, Massachusetts facility. This equipment may not function as designed, resulting in deviations in the drug product produced, which could lead to increased batch failure and the inability to supply patients enrolled in a clinical trial. Additionally, as we continue our current Phase 3 INT trials,\n expand to additional tumor types\n and prepare for commercialization, we anticipate an increase in manufacturing demand for our INTs that will require ongoing investments. Some of the additional equipment that will be required will be custom-made for us, which will lead to long lead times and expedited procurement to meet our timelines. In addition, it may take longer than anticipated to scale up our facilities and to complete our Marlborough, Massachusetts facility (which we expect to dedicate to INTs) to meet commercial demand, if our INT product candidate is approved. This expansion and addition of new facilities could also lead to product comparability issues, which could further delay introduction of new capacity.\nBecause our INTs are manufactured for each individual patient, we are required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to each patient’s tissue sample, sequence data derived from such tissue sample, results of analysis of such patient’s genomic analysis and the custom manufactured product for each patient. Maintaining such a chain of identity is difficult and complex, and failure to do so has resulted and may in the future result in product mix up, adverse patient outcomes, loss of product or regulatory action, including withdrawal of any approved products from the market. Further, as our INTs are developed through clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, we expect that multiple aspects of the complicated collection, analysis, manufacture and delivery process will be modified in an effort to optimize processes and results. These changes may not achieve the intended objectives, and any of these changes could cause our INTs to perform differently than we expect, potentially affecting the results of clinical trials.\n57\nRisks related to our reliance on third parties\nWe are dependent on single-source suppliers for some of the components and materials used in, and the manufacturing processes required to develop and commercialize, our products and product candidates.\nWe cannot ensure that the suppliers we rely on will remain in business, have sufficient capacity or supply to meet our needs or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that will cease working with us. Our use of single-source suppliers exposes us to several risks, including disruptions in supply, price increases, late deliveries or business interruptions. \nThere are, in general, few alternative sources of supply for substitute components. If we must switch suppliers, the manufacture and delivery of our products or product candidates could be interrupted for an extended period. Establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components or processes used in our products or product candidates, if required, may not be accomplished quickly, if at all. Any replacement supplier (or us, if we produced directly) would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory approval, resulting in further delay. Any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials, or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair our ability to meet the demand for our products or product candidates. Additionally, as part of the FDA’s approval of our product candidates, the FDA will review the manufacturing processes and facilities of our single-source suppliers.\nWe have entered, and may enter into, strategic alliances with third parties for product development and commercialization. If these alliances are unsuccessful, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe have entered into strategic alliances with collaborators that have provided, and may in the future provide, funding, intellectual property licenses and other resources for developing, manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates. Additionally, we have entered into, and may in the future enter into, strategic alliances where we agree to provide funding, intellectual property licenses and other resources to third parties. Our existing and any future strategic alliances may pose a number of risks, including:\n•\nstrategic collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected;\n•\nstrategic collaborators may cease or deprioritize development or commercialization of our products due to unfavorable clinical trial results, changes in their focus or funding, or other factors that divert their resources or create competing priorities, such as potential competition with their own products or candidates;\n•\nstrategic collaborators may delay, stop or provide insufficient funding or resources for clinical trials \n(whether as a result of a business decision or necessitated\n by financial difficulties of such collaborator);\n•\na strategic collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our products may commit insufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of any such product;\n•\ndisagreements with strategic collaborators, including over proprietary rights, contract interpretation or the course of development of any product candidates, may cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of such product candidates, lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to such product candidates or result in litigation or arbitration, any of which would be time-consuming and expensive;\n•\nstrategic collaborators may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our IP or proprietary information;\n•\ndisputes may arise with respect to the ownership of IP developed pursuant to our strategic alliances;\n•\nstrategic collaborators may infringe the IP rights of third parties, exposing us to potential litigation and liability;\n•\nfuture relationships may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing shareholders or disrupt our management and business; \n•\nany equity investments we make in collaborators could decrease in value or become worthless; \nand\n•\nour international operations through any future collaborations, acquisitions or joint ventures may expose us to certain operating, legal and other risks not encountered in the United States.\nOur strategic collaborators generally may materially amend or terminate their agreements with us, which has happened in the past. If any collaboration agreement is terminated, we may not receive anticipated future research or development funding or milestone, earn-out royalty, profit share or other contingent payments and the research or development of our product candidates may be delayed or discontinued. It may also be difficult to attract new strategic collaborators to continue development or commercialization of the applicable product candidate, and our reputation could be adversely affected. All the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization described elsewhere in these \nRisk Factors\n apply to our strategic \ncollaboration \nactivities.\n58\nWe may seek to establish additional strategic alliances and, if we are unable to establish them on commercially reasonable terms, we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans. Certain of our strategic alliance agreements may restrict our ability to develop certain products.\nOur development programs and the potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial cash to fund expenses. We may collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of some of our product candidates, and we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators. Our ability to establish additional strategic alliances will depend, among other things, on our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed strategic alliance and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors. Those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials, the likelihood of approval by the FDA or foreign regulators, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such product candidate to trial participants, the potential of competing drugs, the existence of uncertainty with respect to our or the proposed collaborator’s ownership of technology, which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge\n,\n and industry and market conditions generally.\nWe are also restricted under some of our existing strategic alliance agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential strategic collaborators to pursue other targets on our own. These restrictions on working with targets, polypeptides, routes of administration and fields could limit our ability to enter into strategic collaborations with other collaborators or to pursue certain potentially valuable product candidates.\nStrategic alliances are complex and time-consuming to negotiate and document. If we cannot enter into new strategic alliances on a timely basis, on favorable terms or at all, we may need to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities, or increase our expenditures and\n \nundertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense.\nWe expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct aspects of our research, preclinical studies, protocol development and clinical trials. If these third parties do not perform satisfactorily or comply with regulatory requirements, we may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe rely on third parties such as CROs to help manage certain preclinical work and our clinical trials, and on medical institutions, clinical investigators and CROs to assist in the design and review of, and to conduct, our clinical trials, including enrolling qualified patients. In addition, we engage third-party contractors and collaborators to support numerous other research, commercial and administrative activities, which reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities, such as ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocols. Moreover, the FDA requires us to comply with GLPs \nand good clinical practices for conducting, recording and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that in the case of clinical trials the rights, integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected. Such standards will evolve and subject us and third parties to new or changing requirements.\nIf third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may need to replace them, which could delay the affected clinical trial, drug development program or applicable activity. If clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements, action by regulators may significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of such trials or even require a clinical trial to be redone. Accordingly, our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates could be delayed. In addition, failure of any third-party contractor to conduct activities in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect the relevant research, development, commercial or administrative activity. Failure of any third-party contractor to timely provide access to our data in a format acceptable to us may result in delays or impediments to our regulatory submissions or other development activities.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nWe may be unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our discoveries and the intellectual property rights therein, or protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under the patent and other IP laws of the United States and other countries, so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information. Because certain U.S. patent applications are confidential until the patents issue, third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications. In addition, publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 \n59\nmonths after filing, if at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. We therefore may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing exclusivity. In the past, we have obtained licenses under third-party patents to market our products or conduct our research and development or other activities, and we may do so in the future if necessary. If licenses are not available to us on favorable terms, we may not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities.\nThe process of obtaining and enforcing patent protection is expensive and time-consuming and our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. Obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent applications may fail to result in valid enforceable patents, or our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated, for non-compliance with these requirements. If we or our strategic collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner, our business may be adversely affected.\nDespite our and our strategic collaborators’ efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. While issued patents are presumed valid, they may not survive a validity challenge and could be held unenforceable. Any patents we have obtained, or obtain in the future, may be challenged, invalidated, adjudged unenforceable or circumvented by parties seeking to design around our IP. Also, third parties or the USPTO may commence patent office proceedings involving our patents or patent applications. Any challenge to, finding of unenforceability or invalidation, or circumvention of, our patents or patent applications, would be costly, would require significant time and attention of our management, could reduce or eliminate royalty payments to us from third-party licensors and could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nThe standards that the USPTO and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. Similarly, the ultimate degree of protection that will be afforded to biotechnology inventions, including ours, in the United States and foreign countries, remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of the protection decided upon by patent offices, courts and lawmakers. One major provision of the America Invents Act changed U.S. patent practice from a first-to-invent to a first-to-file system. If we fail to file an invention before a competitor files on the same invention, we no longer can provide proof that we were in possession of the invention prior to the competitor’s filing date, and thus would not be able to obtain patent protection for our invention. There is also no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. In certain countries, for example, methods for the medical treatment of humans are not patentable.\nAccordingly, we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others. We also rely to a certain extent on trade secrets, know-how and technology, which are not protected by patents, to maintain our competitive position. We also rely on non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants and third parties. If any trade secret, know-how or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to obtain and maintain all available regulatory exclusivities and broad patent scope and to maximize patent term restoration or extension on patents covering our products may lead to loss of exclusivity and early biosimilar entry resulting in a loss of market share or revenue.\nIn addition, we may choose not to enforce our IP rights in certain circumstances or for certain periods of time. For example, in March 2022, we announced that we will not enforce our patents for COVID vaccines against companies manufacturing in or for the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC) countries, provided that the manufactured vaccines are solely for use in the AMC 92 countries. In addition, \nwe are willing to license our IP for COVID vaccines to manufacturers, but licensing of our IP may be limited, \nand our business may be otherwise adversely impacted if we are unable to enforce our IP.\nUncertainty over IP in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes, which is inherently costly and unpredictable and can have adverse financial and freedom-to-operate consequences.\nmRNA medicines are a relatively new scientific field and, as the field continues to mature, patent applications are being processed by national patent offices globally. There is uncertainty about which patents will issue, and, if they do, as to when, to whom and with what claims. Litigation is ongoing over the underlying technology to mRNA medicines between many mRNA market participants. It is likely that there will continue to be significant litigation and patent office proceedings in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the mRNA field.\nWe have issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in key markets around the world that claim many different methods, compositions and processes relating to the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of mRNA medicines and our delivery technology, including LNPs. \nOppositions and inter partes review petitions have been filed against some of \n60\nour patents, and we expect that further proceedings will be filed in the European Patent Office (EPO), USPTO and elsewhere relating to patents and patent applications in our portfolio.\n In many cases, the possibility of appeal exists for any party, and it may be years before final, unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions. The timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued patent claims. We cannot be certain that any patent will survive or that the claims will remain in the current form. Even if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes could lead to the weakening of our IP rights.\nIn certain instances, we have instituted and may in the future institute inter partes review proceedings against issued U.S. patents and opposition proceedings against European patents owned by third parties in the field of mRNA medicines. We have a number of these proceedings ongoing against third-party patents. If \nwe are unsuccessful in narrowing or invalidating such third-party patents, those third parties may attempt to assert those patents against our products. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that our products or product candidates may be subject to claims\n of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nWe have invested billions of dollars in creating our patented mRNA platform, which is integral to the development of our mRNA medicines, and we are involved in various intellectual property litigation as described under Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.” We expect to expend substantial financial and managerial resources in connection with these legal proceedings, and the ultimate outcome of each proceeding is uncertain.\nWe are, and may in the future become, involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights, we could incur substantial costs and expenses, substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts.\nThere may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, formulations, methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our products and product candidates, and third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that our technologies infringe upon these patents. If any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our products or product candidates, any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself, the holders of any such patents may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to commercialize such product unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents, or until such patents expire. Similarly, if any third-party patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations, processes for manufacture or methods of use, including combination therapy, the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable product or product candidate unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires.\nDefense of infringement and other claims, regardless of their merit, involves substantial litigation expense and diverts employee resources from our business. In the event of a successful infringement claim against us, we may have to pay substantial damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement, pay royalties, redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties, which may not be made available on commercially favorable terms, if at all, or may require substantial time and expense.\nIn addition, any such licenses are likely to be non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products, which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability, which could jeopardize our ability to sustain our operations. Moreover, we expect that a number of our collaborations will provide that royalties payable to us for licenses to our IP may be offset by amounts paid by our collaborators to third parties who have competing or superior IP positions in the relevant fields, which could result in significant reductions in our revenues from products developed through collaborations.\nIn addition, in connection with certain license and strategic alliance agreements, we have agreed to indemnify certain third parties for certain costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to IP rights or the subject matter of the agreements. The cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to IP rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial, and litigation would divert our management’s efforts. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could delay our research, development and commercialization efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations.\nIf third-party owners of any patent rights that we license do not properly or successfully obtain, maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses, our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed.\nWe may become party to licenses that give us rights to third-party IP necessary or useful for our business and our success may depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed IP. Our licensors may fail to \n61\nsuccessfully prosecute the patent applications we license, fail to maintain these patents, determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would. Without protection for the IP we license, other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale, which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects. In addition, we sublicense our rights under various third-party licenses to our strategic collaborators. Any impairment of these sublicensed rights could result in reduced revenues under our strategic alliance agreements or result in termination of an agreement by one or more of our strategic collaborators.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license IP rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business.\nWe license IP, which involves complex legal, business and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry. We are a party to certain IP license agreements and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future. Our existing license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various diligence, milestone payment, royalty and other obligations on us. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements, or we are subject to a bankruptcy, the licensor may have the right to terminate the license, in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license and may be subject to additional liabilities.\nIn certain cases, we control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed technology. In the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution, we may incur significant liability to our strategic collaborators. Disputes may arise regarding IP subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n•\nthe scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n•\nwhether our technology and processes that are not subject to the licensing agreement infringe on IP of the licensor;\n•\nthe sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n•\nour diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n•\nthe ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of IP by our licensors and us and our strategic collaborators; and\n•\nthe priority of invention of patented technology.\nIf disputes over IP that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on favorable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. We are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of IP that we license as we are for IP that we own. If we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this IP, our ability to commercialize products could suffer.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nWe employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. From time to time, we are subject to claims that we or our employees, consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed IP, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of third parties, including our employees’ former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. If we fail to defend such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable IP rights or personnel, which could adversely impact our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other IP.\nWe may be \nand have been \nsubject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other IP. Ownership disputes may arise, for example, from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable IP rights, including exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable IP. Such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distract management and other employees, and could impact or patenting strategy.\n62\nChanges in U.S. patent and regulatory law could impair our ability to protect our products.\nOur success is heavily dependent on IP, particularly patents. U.S. patent law continues to evolve, and certain\n U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. These rulings have increased uncertainty regarding our ability to obtain patents in the future, as well as with respect to the value of patents, once obtained.\n Depending on actions or decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future. \nWe may be unable to protect our IP rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents in every country would be prohibitively expensive, and our foreign IP rights can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect IP rights to the same extent as U.S. federal and state laws. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies to develop their own products in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection or may export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as in the United States.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending IP rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets and other IP protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our IP rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the IP that we develop or license.\nAdditionally, many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. For example, during the COVID pandemic, certain countries threatened steps to facilitate compulsory licenses to permit the distribution of a COVID vaccine in those countries. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the relevant patent rights. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired.\nOur reliance on government funding and collaboration from governmental and quasi-governmental entities for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research and development efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements related to IP rights and requirements that increase the costs of development, commercialization and production of any programs developed under those government-funded programs.\nContracts and grants funded by the U.S. government and its agencies, including our agreements funded by BARDA and DARPA and our collaboration with NIAID, include provisions that reflect the government’s substantial rights and remedies, many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts, including powers of the government to:\n•\nterminate agreements, in whole or in part, for any or no reason;\n•\nreduce or modify the government’s obligations under such agreements without our consent;\n•\nclaim rights, including IP rights, in products and data developed under such agreements;\n•\naudit contract-related costs and fees, including allocated indirect costs;\n•\nsuspend the contractor or grantee from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations;\n•\nimpose U.S. manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements;\n•\nsuspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government;\n•\ncontrol and potentially prohibit the export of products;\n•\npursue criminal or civil remedies under the False Claims Act, False Statements Act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements; and\n•\nlimit the government’s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the U.S. Congress on a fiscal-year basis, thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period.\n63\nWe may not have the right to prohibit the U.S. government from using certain technologies developed by us and we may be unable to prohibit other companies, including our competitors, from using those technologies in providing products and services to the\n \nU.S. government. The U.S. government generally takes the position that it has the right to royalty-free use of technologies that are developed under U.S. government contracts.\nIn addition, government contracts and grants, and subcontracts and subawards awarded in the performance of those contracts and grants, normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business, reduce our profits and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions. These requirements include, for example:\n•\nspecialized accounting systems unique to government contracts and grants;\n•\nmandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent;\n•\npublic disclosures of certain contract and grant information, which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program; and\n•\nmandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements, including labor standards, non-discrimination, and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements.\nFurther, under these agreements we are subject to the obligations to and the rights of the U.S. government set forth in the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 (Bayh-Dole Act). As a result, the U.S. government may have rights in certain inventions developed under these government-funded programs, including a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive or nonexclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that: (i) adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention; (ii) government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs; or (iii) government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations, also referred to as “march-in rights.”\nAny exercise of the march-in rights by the U.S. government could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. \nIn December 2023, the Biden administration released a proposed framework specifying for the first time that price can be a factor in considering whether an invention is sufficiently available to the public. The proposed framework could potentially enable march-in rights to be used as a tool to regulate drug pricing. The potential inclusion of price as a factor in a march-in determination is expected to draw extensive criticism and challenge, and the ultimate impact is currently unknown.\n If the U.S. government exercises such march-in rights, we may receive compensation deemed reasonable by the U.S. government in its sole discretion, which may be less than what we might be able to obtain in the open market. IP generated under a government-funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements, compliance with which may require us to expend substantial resources.\nWe have significant contracts with the U.S. and other governments, and as such are subject to related regulatory compliance obligations. If we fail to maintain compliance with those obligations, we may be subject to potential liability and to termination of our contracts.\nRisks related to our financial condition and results of operations\nWe incurred net losses in 2024 and 2023, and expect to incur additional losses in the future; we may not achieve long-term sustainable profitability.\nWe incurred net losses of \n$3.6 billion and $4.7 billion\n in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and other than in 2022 and 2021, we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception. Currently, our COVID and RSV vaccines are our only commercial products and our RSV sales have been minimal. While preparations are underway for additional potential product launches, the ultimate occurrence and timing of these launches is uncertain. Our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability to successfully develop and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our products.\nWe have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant costs associated with commercializing our products and our clinical development activities. Although we continue to implement cost efficiency and prioritization measures, we may be unsuccessful in reducing our costs in line with our expectations, which could require us to seek additional funding to continue operations. Our expenses could increase for many reasons, including if and as we:\n•\ninitiate additional clinical trials, particularly large pivotal trials;\n•\ncontinue to build out our manufacturing capabilities;\n•\nbuild out a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products;\n•\nacquire or in-license other product candidates and technologies; and\n•\nexperience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above.\n64\nOur quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate. As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our financing or funding ability, as well as our ability to exist as a standalone company.\nOur financial condition and operating results may fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year due to many factors, many of which are beyond our control. As such, a period-to-period comparison of our operating results may not be predictive of our future performance. In any particular quarter, our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, which could cause our stock price to decline. Our stock price could be affected by events not necessarily tied to our actual operating results, including recommendations by securities analysts, the timing of certain public disclosures by us, our collaborators or our competitors and our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner. Other factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include those described in these \nRisk Factors\n and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe investment of our cash, cash equivalents and investments is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately \n$9.5 billion \nin cash, cash equivalents and investments, which are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, inflation and interest rate risks. We may realize losses in the fair value of these investments. In addition, if our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us, our interest income would suffer. These and other market risks associated with our investment portfolio may adversely affect our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nRisks related to our business and operations\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing the development and expansion of our company.\nWe have expanded our scope of operations and number of employees rapidly over the last several years and we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems. Our management may need to divert significant attention away from our day-to-day activities to manage these development activities.\nSuccessfully developing products for and fully understanding the regulatory and manufacturing pathways for the many therapeutic areas and diseases we seek to address requires significant depth of talent, resources and corporate processes to allow simultaneous execution across multiple areas. We may be unable to effectively manage this simultaneous execution and expansion of our operations or recruit and train qualified personnel, which could cause weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. The physical expansion of our operations, including the expansion of our Norwood and Marlborough campuses in Massachusetts and the construction of manufacturing facilities overseas, may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of our product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our development and expansion, our financial performance and ability to commercialize our products may be affected negatively.\nWe are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the United States.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States. We are not permitted to market or promote any of our product candidates before we receive regulatory approval or other authorization from an applicable authority, and we may never receive such approval. To obtain regulatory approval in various jurisdictions, we must comply with numerous regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, manufacturing, commercial sales, pricing and distribution of our product candidates, and we may fail to obtain approval. We have rapidly expanded our global operations, establishing commercial subsidiaries and entering into arrangements to support the worldwide manufacture and distribution of our products, which is a complex task. For example, we are building regional manufacturing facilities and investing in research and development in several countries. Our business may be adversely affected by many factors associated with our expanding global business, including:\n•\nefforts to develop an international commercial sales, marketing and supply chain and distribution organization, including efforts to mitigate longer accounts receivable collection times, longer lead times for shipping and potential language barriers; \n•\nour customers’ ability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign markets;\n•\nour inability to directly control commercial activities because we rely on third parties;\n•\ndifferent medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace;\n•\nchanges in a specific country’s or region’s political and cultural climate or economic condition;\n•\nan increased legal and compliance burden to establish, maintain and operate legal entities in foreign countries;\n•\nthe burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory, tax, accounting, reporting and legal requirements, including the European General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR);\n65\n•\nthe interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute, and the difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions;\n•\ninadequate IP protection in foreign countries and the existence of potentially relevant third-party IP rights;\n•\ntrade-protection measures including trade restrictions, import or export licensing requirements such as Export Administration Regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Commerce and fines, penalties, or suspension or revocation of export privileges, the imposition of government controls and changes in tariffs;\n•\nthe effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences; and\n•\nsignificant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are also subject to extensive federal, state and foreign anti-bribery regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act and similar laws in other countries. Compliance with the FCPA is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries where corruption is a recognized problem. Additionally, the FCPA presents particular challenges to the pharmaceutical industry because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials. Certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to FCPA enforcement actions. Various laws, regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside the United States, or the sharing with certain non-U.S. nationals, of information classified for national security purposes, as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products. As we expand our presence outside the United States, we will need to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws, and these laws may preclude us from developing, manufacturing or selling certain products and product candidates outside the United States, which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs.\nAdditionally, in many jurisdictions outside the United States, we have or may become subject to additional industry-specific codes of conduct that impose additional compliance responsibilities on us.\n \nFailure to comply with these codes particularly as we enter new markets has, and could in the future, result in findings against us, which could result in financial sanctions or reputational harm.\n \nWe cannot guarantee that we, or our employees, consultants or third-party contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal, state and foreign regulations regarding bribery and corruption. Moreover, our strategic collaborators and third-party contractors outside the United States may have inadequate compliance programs or fail to respect the laws and guidance of the territories where they operate, which may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting. The SEC also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on U.S. exchanges for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity.\nOur failure to maintain our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nA\nny disruptions or difficulties using our newly upgraded global ERP system could adversely affect our controls, resulting in harm to our business, including our ability to forecast or make sales and collect our receivables. S\nignificant delays in documenting, reviewing and testing our internal controls could cause our non-compliance with our SEC reporting obligations related to our management\n’\ns assessment of our internal control over financial reporting\n, resulting in unanticipated costs and the diversion of management’s attention.\nOur success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nOur ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, scientific, technical, quality-control, manufacturing, medical, regulatory and commercial personnel. The turnover rate in our industry is high and we compete with other companies, as well as academic institutions, for individuals with certain skill sets. Failure to attract and retain personnel, or to maintain relationships with key consultants, contractors and advisors, could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements. In addition, negative business developments may make it difficult to recruit and retain qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on members of our management and scientific teams. Each of our executive officers and key employees are employed “at will,” and the loss of any of their services may adversely impact the achievement of our business objectives. We do not have “key person” insurance on any of our employees. Several of our executives have valuable, fully vested stock options or other long-term equity awards. Additionally, significant declines in our stock price have in the past reduced, and may in the future reduce, the retentive power of equity awards for our executives or other key personnel. We may not be able to retain these employees due to the competitive environment in the biotechnology industry, particularly in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n66\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture, we could lose the innovation, teamwork and passion that we believe contribute to our success.\nIt may be increasingly difficult to maintain our culture, which we have invested substantial resources in building. \nThe dramatic growth of our workforce, coupled with recent shifts in workplace and workstyle, increase this risk. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively pursue our strategic plans.\nOur internal computer systems and physical premises, or those of third parties with which we share sensitive data or information, may fail or suffer security breaches, including from cybersecurity incidents, which could materially disrupt our product development programs and manufacturing operations.\nOur internal computer systems and infrastructure and those of our strategic collaborators, vendors, contractors, consultants or regulators with whom we share confidential, protected or sensitive data or information, or upon which our business relies, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, misuse, natural disasters, terrorism, cybersecurity threats, war and telecommunication and electrical failures, as well as security compromises or breaches, which may compromise our systems, infrastructure, data or that of those with whom we share such data or information or upon which our business relies, or lead to data compromise, misuse, misappropriation or leakage. We have experienced, and may experience additional, cyber-attacks on our information technology systems and infrastructure by threat actors of all types (including nation states, criminal enterprises, individual actors or advanced persistent threat groups). In addition, we may experience intrusions on our physical premises by these threat actors. In addition to extracting sensitive information, such attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, digital extortion, business email compromises and denial-of-service attacks, social engineering (including phishing attacks) and other means to affect server reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information, systems or infrastructure. If any such cyber-attack or physical intrusion against us or those with whom we share confidential, protected or sensitive data or information, or upon which our business relies, were to result in a loss of or damage to our data, systems or infrastructure, or interrupt our operations, such as a material disruption of our development programs or our manufacturing operations, or due to a loss of any of our proprietary or confidential information, it would have a material adverse effect on us. For example, the loss of clinical trial data could delay our regulatory approval efforts and increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. In addition, because we run multiple clinical trials in parallel, any breach or compromise of our computer systems or infrastructure or physical premises may result in a loss of data or compromised data integrity across multiple programs in many stages of development. While we seek to take steps to address cybersecurity risks, our efforts may not wholly mitigate such risks. Further, our\n contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages or claims related to our privacy and data security obligations. Further, although we maintain cyber liability insurance, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities related to any experienced cybersecurity incident or breach. \nAny data breach, security incident or compromise of confidential, protected or personal information, including any clinical trial participant personal data, may also result in notification requirements or other disclosure obligations and may subject us to civil fines and penalties, litigation, regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or claims for damages under the GDPR and UK GDPR and relevant member state law in the EU, other foreign laws, and the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the United States including the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (the CCPA). We have from time to time received information that companies working on vaccine research and development may be a particular focus for those planning cyberattacks, including by nation states and affiliated cyber actors. To the extent that any disruption or security compromise incident or breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, our data, systems, infrastructure or applications, or inappropriate use or disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, including information related to the research and manufacturing of our products, we could incur liability, our competitive and reputational position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed.\nWe may use our financial and human capital to pursue a particular research program or product candidate and fail to capitalize on programs that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nWe pursue and fund the development of selected research programs or product candidates and may choose to forego or delay pursuit of other opportunities that could later prove to have greater commercial potential. For example, we are currently focusing our efforts on certain prioritized programs that we expect to file for approval over the next several years. Our resource allocation decisions, or our contractual commitments to provide resources to our strategic collaborators, may cause us to fail to capitalize on certain other commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Additionally, spending on research and development programs for product candidates may not yield commercially viable products. We may also seek to enter into strategic collaborations or financing arrangements pursuant to which we may relinquish valuable rights to product candidates, including the rights to a portion of future revenues, through a strategic alliance, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases where it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights. Additionally, we may allocate internal resources to a product candidate in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a strategic alliance.\n67\nIf we are not successful in discovering, developing and commercializing additional products, our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired.\nA key element of our longer-term strategy is to discover, develop and commercialize products beyond our current portfolio to treat various conditions and in a variety of therapeutic areas. We intend to do so by investing in our drug discovery efforts, exploring potential strategic alliances for the development of new products and in-licensing technologies. Identifying new product candidates requires substantial technical, financial and human resources. We may fail to identify promising candidates or to successfully develop and commercialize products for many reasons, which would impair our potential for growth.\nOur business could be harmed if we suffer damage to our reputation, including as a result of a product recall.\nThe FDA or foreign regulators could require the recall of our products. The FDA has authority to recall a biologic product if it finds that a batch, lot or other quantity of the biologic product presents an imminent or substantial hazard to the public health. In addition, foreign governmental bodies may require the recall of any products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may independently recall a product if a material deficiency in a product is found. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or our strategic collaborators could occur because of manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues, as occurred with the recall in 2021 of certain batches of our COVID vaccine shipped to Japan that were found to contain foreign particulate. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. A recall announcement could harm our reputation and negatively affect our sales. Our reputation could be further impacted by public discourse regarding our business and perception of our business strategy.\nProduct liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of our products.\nWe are exposed to product liability risk related to the development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of our products and product candidates in clinical trials. Product liability claims and related cross-claims and claims for indemnification may be brought against us by patients, healthcare providers or others using, prescribing, selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products or product candidates. For example, we may be sued if any product or product candidate allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical trials, manufacturing or, if approved, marketing, sale or commercial use. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against such claims, we could incur substantial liabilities.\nWe could also face product liability claims relating to the worsening of a patient’s condition, injury or death alleged to have been caused by our products or product candidates. Any such claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing or design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, including due to interactions with alcohol or other drugs, knowledge of risks, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. Claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts. Such claims might not be fully covered by product liability insurance. For any marketed products, product liability claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs, and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action, limitations on the approved indications for which they may be used, suspension or withdrawal of approvals or license revocation. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may cause decreased demand for our products, injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention, costs to defend the related litigation, withdrawal of clinical trial participants, loss of revenue, a diversion of management’s time and our resources, substantial monetary awards to trial participants, patients or their family members, payments to indemnify clinical trial sites and other clinical trial partners and a decline in our stock price. On occasion, large judgments have been awarded in individual, mass tort and class-action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects.\nWith respect to our COVID vaccine, although the U.S. and certain foreign governments contractually agreed to indemnify us or make statutory immunity available to us for sales during the pandemic public health emergency, such indemnification or statutory immunity may be unavailable to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from the research, development, manufacture, distribution or commercialization of the vaccine. Additionally, other foreign governments that we contract with have not provided us with similar contractual indemnity or statutory immunity, and we generally no longer have the benefit of such indemnities or immunities for future sales of our commercial products. Substantial claims arising from the vaccine outside the scope of or in excess of U.S. or foreign government indemnity or statutory immunity could harm our financial condition and operating results. Moreover, any adverse event or injury for which we are liable, even if fully covered under an indemnity or immunity, could negatively affect our reputation.\nWe may be unable to maintain our product liability insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability. If the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Likewise, if insurance coverage should become unavailable to us or become economically impractical, we would be required to operate our business without indemnity from commercial insurance providers. Additionally, even if we maintain insurance coverage for a type of liability, a particular claim may not be covered if it is subject to a \n68\ncoverage exclusion or we do not otherwise meet the conditions for coverage. If we operate our business with inadequate insurance, we could be responsible for paying claims or judgments against us, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nFederal legislation and actions by federal, state and local governments may permit reimportation into the United States of drugs from foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices.\nWe may face competition in the United States for our products from therapies sourced from foreign countries with price controls on pharmaceutical products. \nFor example, in October 2020, the FDA published a final rule that would allow for the importation of certain prescription drugs from Canada, where there are government price controls. In January 2024, the FDA approved Florida’s request to import certain lower-priced medications from Canada. While the full implications of the final rule are currently unknown, legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs could decrease the price we receive for any products we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and potential profitability.\nHealthcare legislative reform discourse and potential or enacted measures may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and legislative or political discussions surrounding the desire for and implementation of pricing reforms may adversely impact our business.\nIn the United States, federal and state legislatures, health agencies and third-party payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care. Legislative and regulatory proposals, enactments to reform health care insurance programs and increasing pressure from social sources could significantly influence the manner in which our products are prescribed and purchased. For example, provisions of the ACA have resulted in changes in the way health care is paid for by both governmental and private insurers, including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, the requirement that manufacturers participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under Medicare Part D and the expansion of the number of hospitals eligible for discounts under Section 340B of the PHSA. Additionally, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 includes several provisions such as drug pricing controls and Medicare redesign that are likely to impact our business to varying degrees, but its ultimate effect on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known. See “Business-Government Regulation-Current and future healthcare reform legislation.”\nWe may face uncertainties due to efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the ACA. There is no assurance that the ACA, as currently enacted or as amended in the future, will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nThere is increasing public attention on the costs of prescription drugs and there have been, and are expected to continue to be, legislative proposals to address prescription drug pricing, which could have significant effects on our business. These actions and the uncertainty about the future of the ACA and healthcare laws may put downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.\nThere is also significant economic pressure on state budgets that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for drugs or that would allow for importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the United States. State Medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid. Government efforts to reduce Medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by Medicaid programs. This may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding limitation on prices and reimbursement for our products, if approved.\nIn the EU and some other international markets, the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored health care system. Many countries have announced or implemented measures, and may in the future implement new or additional measures, to reduce health care costs to limit the overall level of government expenditures. These measures vary by country and may include, among other things, patient access restrictions, suspensions on price increases, prospective and possible retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates, recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lower-cost countries. These measures may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and false claims laws. If we cannot comply, or have not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors in the United States and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical \n69\nmanufacturers to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which such companies sell, market and distribute pharmaceutical products. In particular, the promotion, sales and marketing of healthcare items and services, as well as a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commission(s), certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements, are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, structuring and commissions, certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained during patient recruitment for clinical trials. Se\ne “Business-Government Regulation-Other healthcare laws.”\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, is time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business. If our operations are found to violate any of these laws or any other regulations, we may be subject to significant sanctions, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, reputational harm, exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs, contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations, as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance. Furthermore, if any physician or other healthcare provider or entity with whom we do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to similar penalties. Any action for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business. In addition, the approval and commercialization of any product candidate we develop outside the United States will subject us to foreign healthcare laws.\nThe provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the EU and the UK. The provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is also governed by the national anti-bribery laws of EU Member States, and the Bribery Act 2010 in the UK. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. The EU Directive \n(2001/83/EC, as amended)\n governing medicinal products for human use provides that, where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them, no gifts, pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied, offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy. This provision has been transposed into the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the UK despite its departure from the EU.\nPayments made to physicians in certain EU Member States must be publicly disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians often are the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his or her competent professional organization, or the regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes or professional codes of conduct, applicable in the EU Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.\nWe are subject to various and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal data, and our failure to comply could result in fines or criminal penalties and damage our reputation.\nPrivacy and data security are significant issues in the United States, Europe and many other jurisdictions where we operate or collect personal information. We are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that apply to the collection, storage, use, sharing and security of personal data, including health information, and impose significant compliance obligations. In addition, numerous other federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection and privacy laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure and security of personal information.\nThe GDPR and UK GDPR impose stringent obligations on us with respect to our processing and the cross-border transfer of personal data, including higher standards of obtaining consent or ensuring another appropriate legal basis or condition applies to the processing of personal data, more robust transparency requirements, data breach notification requirements, requirements for contractual language with our processors and stronger individual data rights. Different EEA Member States have interpreted the GDPR differently and many have imposed additional requirements, adding to the complexity of processing personal data in the EEA. The GDPR and UK GDPR also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA that are not considered to provide \n“adequate” protection to personal data\n, including the United States, and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations. Compliance with the GDPR and UK GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices. We could be subject to fines and penalties, litigation and reputational harm in connection with any activities falling within the scope of the GDPR or UK GDPR.\nIn the United States, at the federal level, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. In \n70\naddition, certain state laws govern privacy and security of personal information. For example, California has passed the CCPA and numerous other states have passed their own similar comprehensive consumer privacy laws. There are also states that are specifically regulating health information. Further, a small number of states have passed laws that regulate biometric data specifically. In addition, numerous states and the federal government are actively considering proposed legislation governing the protection of personal data. State laws are changing rapidly and there have been discussions in the U.S. Congress of new comprehensive federal data privacy laws to which we could become subject, if enacted. \nAdditionally, many foreign jurisdictions have passed data privacy legislation and others are considering various proposals for new privacy and data protection laws. Data privacy remains an evolving landscape at the domestic and international levels, with new laws and regulations being considered and coming into effect and continued legal challenges. We must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with the changing landscape in this area. Each law is also subject to various interpretations by courts and regulatory agencies, creating additional uncertainty, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with the evolving data protection laws could expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by authorities, private rights of action in some jurisdictions and potential significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant. Some of these laws and regulations also carry the possibility of criminal sanctions. For example, we could be subject to penalties, including criminal penalties, if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered health care provider or research institution that has not complied with HIPAA’s requirements for disclosing such information. Furthermore, the number of government investigations related to data security incidents and privacy violations continues to increase and government investigations typically require significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business and our reputation.\nThe Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No. 536/2014 (the Clinical Trial Regulation) and the EMA policy on publication of clinical data for medicinal products for human use both permit the EMA to publish clinical information submitted in marketing authorization approvals (MAAs). The ability of third parties to review or analyze data from our clinical trials may increase the risk of commercial confidentiality breaches and result in enhanced scrutiny of our clinical trial results. Such scrutiny could result in public misconceptions regarding our drugs and drug candidates. These publications could also result in the disclosure of information to our competitors that we might otherwise deem confidential, which could harm our business.\nOur use of GenAI and other AI technologies presents certain risks and challenges given the emerging nature of AI technologies.\nThe development and use of GenAI and other AI technologies (collectively, AI Technologies), along with an uncertain regulatory landscape, pose risks that could harm our reputation, expose us to liability or otherwise adversely affect our business. The integration of AI Technologies into our and our vendors’ systems (potentially without the vendor disclosing such use to us) subjects us to the risk that the providers of AI Technologies\n may not meet existing or rapidly evolving regulatory or industry standards with respect to privacy and data protection. Further, bad actors around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of AI technologies, to engage in illegal activities involving the theft and misuse of personal information, confidential information and intellectual property. \nThese factors may lead to breaches of security or privacy, reduced levels of service or experience, loss of intellectual property or exposure of confidential or proprietary information. Sophisticated cyber-attacks, including those using AI, could exacerbate these risks. Additionally, GenAI’s potential for producing false or misleading outputs, reflecting biases or generating content that may not be subject to IP protection or that infringes proprietary rights of others, poses additional risks to our business. Regulatory changes or reinterpretations could introduce new compliance risks, including potential government enforcement actions or civil lawsuits. Our competitors’ faster or more effective adoption of AI could also disadvantage us.\nWe could be adversely affected by outbreaks of epidemic, pandemic or other contagious diseases. \nI\nn the event of a future epidemic or pandemic,\n our clinical trials could be paused or delayed due to restrictions (such as quarantines or travel limitations) or re\nprioritization of resources\n. T\nravel limitations could also create challenges and potential delays in our development and production activities, increasing the expense and timelines for producing our products and product candidates.\nWe utilize third parties to, among other things, manufacture raw materials, components, parts and consumables, perform quality testing and ship our products. If these third parties were to experience delays or disruptions in providing their services in response to an epidemic or pandemic, our supply chain could be disrupted, limiting our ability to manufacture and sell our products and manufacture product candidates for our clinical trials, as well as negatively impacting our research and development operations. Such delays or disruptions could adversely impact our strategic collaborators’ ability to fulfill their obligations, which could affect the clinical development or regulatory approvals of product candidates under joint development.\nIn addition, during a global health crisis, one or more government entities could take actions (such as via the Defense Production Act in the U.S.) that diminish our rights or economic opportunities with respect to our products. Our third-party service providers could be impacted by government-imposed restrictions on services they might otherwise offer. Any such action could cause us to experience delays in the development, production, distribution or export of our products and product candidates and increased expenses. \n71\nEngaging in acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic collaborations may increase our capital requirements, dilute our shareholders and cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities.\nWe may engage in acquisitions, joint ventures and collaborations, including licensing or acquiring complementary products, IP rights, technologies or businesses. Such transactions and relationships may entail numerous risks, including:\n•\nincreased operating expenses and cash requirements;\n•\nassimilation of operations, IP and products, including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel;\n•\nthe diversion of management’s attention from our existing product programs and initiatives;\n•\nthe loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships;\n•\nrisks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction, including the prospects of that party and their existing products or product candidates and regulatory approvals; and\n•\nour inability to generate revenue from acquired technology or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs.\nIf we undertake acquisitions in the future, we may utilize cash, issue dilutive securities, assume or incur debt obligations, incur large one-time expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense. Moreover, if we cannot locate suitable acquisition or strategic collaboration opportunities, our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business may be impaired.\nThe illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or stolen versions of mRNA products could negatively impact our financial performance or reputation.\nThird parties could illegally distribute and sell, especially online, counterfeit versions of mRNA products that do not meet the rigorous cGMP manufacturing and testing standards. Counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances or the wrong dose, are frequently unsafe or ineffective and could be life-threatening. However, to distributors and users, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version.\nReports of adverse reactions to counterfeit products, increased levels of counterfeiting or unsafe mRNA products could materially affect patient confidence in our mRNA products. Adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit or other non-mRNA products could mistakenly be attributed to our mRNA products. In addition, thefts of inventory at warehouses, plants or while in-transit, which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels, could adversely impact patient safety, our reputation and our business. The public could lose confidence in the integrity of mRNA products because of counterfeiting, theft or improper manufacturing processes. \nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are exposed to physical risks (such as rising temperatures, flooding and severe storms), risks in transitioning to a low-carbon economy (such as additional legal or regulatory requirements, changes in customer behavior and cost and availability of raw materials) and social and human effects (such as population dislocations and harm to health and well-being) associated with climate change. These risks can be either acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). Climate-related physical risks to our facilities and those of our suppliers could disrupt our operations and supply chain, which may result in increased costs.\nNew legal or regulatory requirements may be enacted to prevent, mitigate or adapt to the implications of a changing climate and its effects on the environment. These regulations, which may differ across jurisdictions, could subject us to new or expanded carbon pricing or taxes, increased compliance costs, restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions, investment in new technologies, increased carbon disclosure and transparency, investments in data gathering and reporting systems, upgrades of facilities to meet new building codes and the redesign of utility systems, which could increase our operating costs, including the cost of electricity and energy we use. Our supply chain would likely be subject to these same transitional risks and would likely pass along any increased costs to us, which may affect our ability to procure raw materials or other supplies required to operate our business at the quantities and levels we require.\nOur aspirations, goals and disclosures related to environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters expose us to numerous risks.\nMany institutional and individual investors use ESG screening criteria to determine whether we qualify for inclusion in their investment portfolios. We are frequently asked by investors and other stakeholders to set ESG goals and provide new and more robust disclosure on goals, progress toward goals and other matters of interest to ESG stakeholders. In response, we have adapted the tracking and reporting of our corporate responsibility program to various evolving ESG frameworks, and we have established and \n72\nannounced goals and other objectives related to ESG matters. Statements about these goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately report on these goals and objectives, including with respect to environmental and diversity initiatives, are subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control, which could have a material negative impact, including on our reputation and stock price. Additionally, the increased focus on ESG matters by policymakers, regulators and investors has in some instances resulted in diverging expectations and standards, which could make it more difficult to comply with ESG-related regulations across our global business. \nFurther, the standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of consistent or meaningful comparative data from period to period. In addition, our processes and controls may not always comply with evolving standards for identifying, measuring and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals.\nIf our ESG practices do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, business partner or acquiror could be negatively impacted. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could also have similar negative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous and flammable materials and wastes, including chemicals and biological materials. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products, and we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from any use by us of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines, penalties or other sanctions for failure to comply with such laws and regulations. We may also incur substantial costs to comply with such laws and regulations, and these laws and regulations could impair our research, development or production efforts.\nOur workers’ compensation insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials.\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile, which could result in substantial losses for shareholders.\nOur stock price has been, and is expected to continue to be, subject to substantial volatility. \nSince our IPO in December 2018, o\nur stock price has ranged from a high of $497.49 to a low of $11.54 per share. Over the last several years, our stock has experienced pronounced and extended periods of volatility, which could cause our shareholders to incur substantial losses. Public statements by us, government agencies, the media, competitors, financial analysts or others, including those related to COVID-19, have resulted, and may result, in significant fluctuations in our stock price. Information in the public arena, whether or not accurate, has had and will likely continue to have an outsized impact (positive or negative) on our stock price. \nThe stock market in general, and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, and you may not be able to sell your shares at or above your initial purchase price. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n•\nour product sales and anticipated product revenue;\n•\nour ability to effectively reduce costs;\n•\nthe commercial launch of any additional products;\n•\ntiming and results of clinical trials or progress of our product candidates or those of our competitors;\n•\nthe exclusion or removal of our stock from market indices; \n•\nthe success of competitive products or technologies;\n•\nthe emergence or decline of new or existing variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus;\n•\ndevelopments regarding our manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization efforts, or information regarding such efforts by competitors;\n73\n•\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n•\ndevelopments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n•\nthe recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n•\nexpenses related to any of our products or clinical development programs;\n•\nthe results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates;\n•\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates of financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n•\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n•\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n•\neconomic, industry and market conditions generally, and in the biopharmaceutical sector specifically; and\n•\nannouncement by us or our competitors of the commencement or termination of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments.\nSecurities class-action litigation often has been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price. In 2024, class action and derivative litigations were filed against us related to statements made about our RSV vaccine. See Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.” We could incur substantial costs in defense of such litigation, or in defense of any future lawsuits that may be filed against us, and management’s attention and resources could be diverted.\nOur principal shareholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval.\nAs of February 14, 2025, our executive officers, directors and affiliated shareholders owned, directly or indirectly, approximately 8% of our outstanding common stock. In addition, non-affiliated five percent or greater shareholders owned approximately 27% of our outstanding common stock. These shareholders will have the ability to influence us through their ownership positions. For example, if they were to act together, they could exert significant influence over matters such as elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger, sale of assets or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that our shareholders may believe to be in their best interests.\nProvisions in our organizational documents, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult or costly for a third party to acquire us or remove our current management, even if doing so would benefit our shareholders.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation (charter), second amended and restated by-laws (by-laws) and Delaware law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a hostile takeover or change in control of us or changes in our management. Our charter and by-laws include provisions that:\n•\nauthorize “blank check” preferred stock, which could be authorized for issuance by our board of directors without shareholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n•\ncreate a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n•\nlimit shareholders’ ability to call a special meeting of shareholders to shareholders representing at least 20% of our outstanding shares;\n•\nprohibit shareholder action by written consent;\n•\nestablish an advance notice procedure for shareholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our shareholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n•\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n•\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n•\nspecify that no shareholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors;\n•\nexpressly authorize our board of directors to modify, alter or repeal our by-laws; and\n•\nrequire supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our charter and by-laws.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of shareholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Any provision of our charter, by-laws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\n74\nBecause we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, will be your sole source of gain.\nWe do not currently intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all of our future earnings, if any, to finance the growth and development of our business or to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases. In addition, the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future.\nOur by-laws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us.\nPursuant to by-laws, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for state law claims for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (2) any action asserting a claim of or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, or other employees to us or our shareholders, (3) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors, officers, employees or shareholders arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our by-laws or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine (the Delaware Forum Provision). The Delaware Forum Provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. Our by-laws further provide that the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts is the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act (the Federal Forum Provision). Our by-laws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision. \nThe Delaware Forum Provision and the Federal Forum Provision may impose additional litigation costs on shareholders in pursuing any such claims, particularly if the shareholders do not reside in or near the State of Delaware or the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as applicable. Additionally, the forum selection clauses in our by-laws may limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees, which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees, even though an action, if successful, might benefit our shareholders. The Federal Forum Provision may also impose additional litigation costs on shareholders who assert that the provision is unenforceable or invalid, and if the Federal Forum Provision is found to be unenforceable, we may incur additional costs in resolving such matters. The Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts, including courts where a shareholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action, and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our shareholders.\nGeneral risk factors\nOur employees, principal investigators and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, principal investigators leading our clinical trials and consultants. Such misconduct could include failures to comply with FDA regulations or similar regulations in other jurisdictions, provide accurate information to the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities, comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, comply with industry codes of conduct, report financial information or data accurately, or disclose unauthorized activities to us. Such misconduct also could involve improper use of information obtained during clinical trials or interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. Sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. It is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and we may fail to control unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or take steps that protect us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, including through the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nWe could face unfavorable U.S. or global economic conditions, including as a result of disease outbreak, war, conflict or other political instability, or geopolitical risks\n.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and financial markets, including disruptions caused by pandemic, war, conflict or other political instability, including related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and \n75\nresulting sanctions against Russia or conflict in the Middle East. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, and perceptions or expectations about current or future conditions, such as inflation, slowing growth, rising interest rates, the imposition of tariffs (either on imports or exports, which may impact us directly or indirectly through increased costs in our supply chain), rising unemployment and recession, could negatively affect our business and financial condition. Additionally, global events, including war, conflict, political instability or other adverse economic conditions have and may in the future cause governments to divert spending away from healthcare, negatively impacting\n the market for our products.\nAny severe or prolonged economic downturn could create a variety of risks to our business, including weakened demand for our medicines, and negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital or financing if needed on favorable terms, if at all. A weak or declining economy could strain our suppliers, possibly resulting in supply disruption, or cause delays in payments for our services by third-party payors or our collaborators. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business.\nAdditionally, geopolitical tensions could adversely impact our business and our commercial plans. For instance, restrictions by the U.S. government on the export of mRNA technology or our products to certain markets, or restrictions on the establishment of manufacturing in certain foreign jurisdictions, may prevent us from seeking commercial growth opportunities in a manner that harms our competitive position.\nEmployee litigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our future business.\nOur employees may, from time to time, bring lawsuits against us regarding injury, creating a hostile workplace, discrimination, wage and hour disputes, sexual harassment or other employment issues. Recently, there has been an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment claims generally. Coupled with the expansion of social media platforms and similar devices that allow individuals access to a broad audience, these claims have had a significant negative impact on some businesses. Certain companies that have faced employment- or harassment-related lawsuits have had to terminate management or other key personnel, and have suffered reputational harm.\nIneffective internal controls could adversely impact our business and operating results.\nOur internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, failure or interruption of information technology systems, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nInadequate funding for the FDA, CDC and other government agencies, including from government shut downs, or other disruptions to these agencies’ operations, could hinder their ability to hire and retain key leadership and other personnel, prevent new products and services from being developed or commercialized in a timely manner or otherwise prevent those agencies from performing normal business functions on which the operation of our business may rely\n.\nCurrently, federal agencies in the U.S. are operating under a continuing resolution that is set to expire on March 14, 2025. Without appropriation of additional funding to federal agencies, our business operations related to our product development activities for the U.S. market could be impacted. The ability of the FDA to review and approve new products can be affected by a variety of factors, including government budget and funding levels, the ability to hire and retain key personnel and accept the payment of user fees, and statutory, regulatory and policy changes. Average review times at the agency have fluctuated in recent years as a result. In addition, government funding of other government agencies on which our operations may rely, including those that fund research and development activities, is subject to the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Disruptions at the FDA, CDC and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new product candidates to be reviewed or approved, or for recommendations on use to be developed. If a prolonged government shutdown occurred, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions.\nChanges in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to evolving and complex tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The rules dealing with U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. income taxation are constantly under review by legislative and tax authorities. Changes to tax laws (which could apply retroactively) could adversely affect us and our shareholders. In recent years, such changes have been made and changes are likely to occur in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\n76\nThe increasing use of social media platforms presents risks and challenges.\nSocial media is increasingly being used to communicate about our research, product candidates, commercial products and the diseases our products and product candidates are designed to treat. Social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear. This uncertainty creates risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business, resulting in potential regulatory actions against us. For example, subjects may use social media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing blinded clinical trial or to report an alleged adverse event. When such disclosures occur, we may fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may be unable to defend our business in the face of political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our product candidates. There is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website. If any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could incur liability, face regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business.",

    "item1c": "Item 1C. Cybersecurity\nCyber Risk Management and Strategy                                 \nOur cybersecurity organization’s mission is to provide a targeted set of services, support and capabilities to reduce the risk of cyberattacks, rapidly detect and contain threats, and mitigate risks to critical data.\nRecognizing the threat of security breaches and cyberattacks globally, we have developed a cybersecurity program, overseen by our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), that is designed to protect patient trust, defend the Moderna brand, and reduce the risk and impact of cyber-attacks.\n \nOur cybersecurity program is informed by industry standards and includes periodic risk assessments and security testing supported by cybersecurity technologies, including third-party security solutions, vulnerability management, and monitoring tools, designed to monitor, identify, and manage risks from cyber threats. In addition, we have implemented employee security and awareness training.\n \nManagement has established a cyber incident response plan (CIRP) designed to assess, identify and manage risks from cybersecurity threats and enable prompt response in the event that a cybersecurity incident is detected. We have a process in place for notification to our leadership response team in the event of a significant cyber incident, and for escalation of these events to our Audit Committee and Board, as appropriate\n. \nTo date, we have not experienced a cybersecurity incident that has had a material impact on our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition\n.\nWe undergo several annual internal compliance audits and external reviews to evaluate our controls, including cybersecurity controls. In an effort to minimize third-party risk, we have established a process to assess the security practices of third-party suppliers and related risks, including through review of relevant supplier certifications and security and responses to standardized information gathering (SIG) questionnaires, as applicable and appropriate.\n \nGovernance Related to Cybersecurity Risks\nOur Board of Directors oversees Moderna’s overall risk management strategy. The Board exercises oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats primarily through its Audit Committee, which oversees our risk management processes for information security and technology risks. Our cybersecurity risk management processes are integrated into our overall risk management strategy, which is overseen by the Audit Committee. At least annually, the Audit Committee discusses our risk management program, including information security and technology risks and findings from any audits, with our internal audit staff.\n \nThe Audit Committee receives cyber-related updates from management, including our CISO at committee meetings. During meetings, our CISO updates the committee on Moderna’s cybersecurity posture, potential threats and risk mitigation strategies, and the progress of the Company’s cybersecurity initiatives, as appropriate. The Chair of the Audit Committee and management provide regular briefings on such matters to the full \nBoard of Directors\n, as appropriate.\n \nAt the management level, our \nCISO\n is primarily responsible for leading our cybersecurity strategy for assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats.\n \nOur current CISO has over 25 years of cybersecurity experience across a wide array of industries, most recently serving in leadership positions at two different public companies and previous roles of increasing responsibility at multinational technology companies.\n Our CISO reports directly to our Chief People and Digital Technology Officer, who is a member of our Executive Committee and reports to our Chief Executive Officer. \n77\nWe have built a cybersecurity leadership team designed to align with key services, with a separate lead overseeing each service offering, all reporting to the CISO. We also maintain relationships with law enforcement and industry groups to support our cybersecurity intelligence and risk management efforts."
