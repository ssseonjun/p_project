The Company’s accounting cycle resulted in a 52-week year for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. \nGeneral\nSales grew 2.1%, or $1.1 billion to $54.4 billion in fiscal 2025, largely due to higher average sales prices in our Beef, Pork and Prepared Foods segments, partially offset by $653 million of increased legal contingency accruals which reduced sales. We reported operating income of $1,098 million in fiscal 2025 as compared to an operating income of $1,409 million in fiscal 2024, as we experienced lower operating income in our Beef and Pork segments, partially offset by higher operating income in our Chicken and Prepared Foods segments and International/Other.\nIn fiscal 2025, our operating income was impacted by $738 million of legal contingency accruals, $343 million of goodwill and intangible impairments, $45 million of restructuring and related charges, $41 million of charges related to a product recall and $23 million related to brand and product line discontinuations. In fiscal 2024, our results were impacted by $182 million of plant closure and disposal charges, $174 million of legal contingency accruals and $31 million of restructuring and related charges.\nMarket Environment \nAccording to the most recently published USDA data, domestic protein production (beef, pork, chicken and turkey) decreased slightly in fiscal 2025 compared to fiscal 2024. The Beef segment continues to experience limited supply of market-ready cattle as well as increased cattle costs. Additionally, uncertainty exists regarding the timing of the anticipated cattle herd rebuilding. The Pork segment experienced sufficient supply of market-ready hogs and increased hog costs. The Chicken segment experienced reduced feed ingredient costs, but costs began to stabilize in the back half of fiscal 2025. The Prepared Foods segment is currently experiencing increased raw material costs primarily due to higher meat costs. \nWe are subject to changes in import and export policies, including trade restrictions, new or increased tariffs or quotas, and customs restrictions through our international sales and operations. Our exports account for less than 10% of our business, primarily composed of chicken leg quarters and paws, boxed beef and variety meats of all proteins. As a result of the recent changes in trade policies and tariffs both domestically and internationally, we may experience some sales disruptions and other impacts associated with tariffs. There is uncertainty regarding the impact the current changes will have on the price and demand of our products in the affected countries, commodity pricing and other general economic conditions, and uncertainty in future changes that may have a material impact.\nMargins\nOur total operating margin was 2.0% in fiscal 2025. Operating margins by segment were as follows:\n•\nBeef – (5.2)%\n•\nPork – (3.4)%\n•\nChicken – 8.5%\n•\nPrepared Foods – 9.0%\n24\nStrategy\nWe are a world-class food company and recognized leader in protein. Our strategy is to deliver margins in the core protein business by driving efficiencies and valuing-up offerings to better serve consumers; grow branded portfolio by innovating new occasions, categories and channels; and scale in international markets by delivering profitable value-added food offerings in high growth categories. \nDuring fiscal 2025, the Company initiated a network optimization plan to optimize our global operations and logistics network. We anticipate recognizing total pretax charges of $86 million related to actions approved through September 27, 2025, which include $99 million that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $94 million of non-cash charges, partially offset by $107 million gain recognized from the sale of storage facilities. Additionally, we received $252 million in proceeds associated with the sale of storage facilities during fiscal 2025. We expect to incur costs related to the network optimization plan over a multi-year period and anticipate additional charges in the future as further actions are approved.\nIn fiscal 2025, we recognized charges of $45 million related to the network optimization plan, which included a gain of $107 million from the sale of storage facilities. The charges primarily included the closure of two facilities in the Prepared Foods segment, a non-harvesting facility closure in the Beef segment, asset write-offs in the Chicken and Prepared Foods segments and International/Other as well as severance and related costs and contract and lease termination costs.

Based on our current expectations, we believe our liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to operate our business. However, we may take advantage of opportunities to generate additional liquidity or refinance existing debt through capital market transactions. The amount, nature and timing of any capital market transactions will depend on our operating performance and other circumstances; our then-current commitments and obligations; the amount, nature and timing of our capital requirements; any limitations imposed by our current credit arrangements; and overall market conditions. \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nin millions\n2025\n2024\nNet income\n$\n507 \n$\n822 \nNon-cash items in net income\n1,754 \n1,544 \nNet changes in operating assets and liabilities:\n(Increase) decrease in accounts receivable\n(121)\n59 \n(Increase) decrease in inventories\n(449)\n153 \nIncrease (decrease) in accounts payable\n184 \n(205)\nIncrease in income taxes payable/receivable\n7 \n89 \nNet changes in other operating assets and liabilities\n273 \n128 \nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,155 \n$\n2,590 \n•\nNon-cash items in net income primarily included depreciation and amortization of $1,361 million and $1,400 million in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively, and a $343 million goodwill impairment in fiscal 2025.\n•\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2025 was $2.2 billion, a decrease of $435 million compared to fiscal 2024, due to $105 million of lower earnings, net of non-cash items, and a $330 million decrease in cash provided by the net changes in operating assets and liabilities which was primarily impacted by:\n•\nA decrease of $602 million due to an increase in inventory of $449 million in fiscal 2025, compared to a decrease of $153 million in fiscal 2024, primarily due to increased average cost of inventory and higher volume of livestock.\n•\nA decrease of $180 million due to an increase in accounts receivable of $121 million in fiscal 2025, compared to a decrease of $59 million in fiscal 2024 as days sales outstanding increased more during fiscal 2025 than fiscal 2024 driven largely by increased average sales prices.\n•\nPartially offset by:\n•\nAn increase of $389 million due to an increase in accounts payable of $184 million during fiscal 2025, compared to a decrease of $205 million in fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher input costs and increase in days payables outstanding.\n•\nAn increase of $145 million due to an increase of $273 million in the net changes in other operating assets and liabilities in fiscal 2025, compared to an increase of $128 million in fiscal 2024, primarily driven by an increase in legal accruals net of payments offset by an increase in fiscal 2024 performance-based compensation.\n31\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nin millions\n2025\n2024\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment\n$\n(978)\n$\n(1,132)\n(Purchases of)/Proceeds from marketable securities, net\n(4)\n(3)\nProceeds from sale of business\n— \n174 \nProceeds from sale of storage facilities\n252 \n— \nAcquisition of equity investments\n(11)\n(29)\nOther, net\n76 \n102 \nNet cash used for investing activities\n$\n(665)\n$\n(888)\n•\nAdditions to property, plant and equipment included spending for production growth, safety, animal well-being, new equipment, infrastructure replacements and upgrades to maintain competitive standing and position us for future opportunities. \n•\nApproximately $520 million will be necessary to complete buildings and equipment under construction at September 27, 2025. \n•\nWe expect capital expenditures between $0.7 billion and $1.0 billion for fiscal 2026.

A portion of the net proceeds from the issuances were used to repay $250 million of the amount outstanding under our term loan facility due May 2026 and we used the remainder of the proceeds to retire the $1,250 million notes due August 2024.\n•\nPurchases of Tyson Class A common stock included:\n•\n$174 million of cash paid for shares repurchased pursuant to our share repurchase program in fiscal 2025.\n•\n$22 million and $49 million for shares repurchased to fund certain obligations under our equity compensation plans in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n•\nDividends paid during fiscal 2025 included a 2% increase to our fiscal 2024 quarterly dividend rate.\n32\nLiquidity\nin millions\nCommitments\nExpiration Date\nFacility\nAmount\nOutstanding Letters of Credit (no draw downs)\nAmount\nBorrowed\nAmount Available at September 27, 2025\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,229 \nShort-term investments\n— \nRevolving credit facility\nApril 2030\n$\n2,500 \n$\n— \n$\n— \n2,500 \nCommercial paper\n— \nTotal liquidity\n$\n3,729 \n•\nLiquidity includes cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and availability under our revolving credit facility, less the outstanding commercial paper balance.\n•\nAt September 27, 2025, we had current debt of $909 million, which we intend to pay with cash generated from our operating activities and other existing or new liquidity sources. \n•\nThe revolving credit facility supports our short-term funding needs and also serves to backstop our commercial paper program. We had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility during fiscal 2025. \n•\nIn April 2025, we terminated our previous revolving credit facility with a maturity date of September 2026 and entered into a new $2.5 billion revolving credit facility. The new revolving credit facility will mature, and the commitments thereunder will terminate, in April 2030 with options for two one-year extensions. Under the terms of this revolving credit facility, we have the option to establish incremental commitment increases of up to an aggregate amount of $500 million if certain conditions are met. The covenants and other terms of the new facility are generally consistent with those of the terminated facility. \n•\nWe expect net interest expense will approximate $395 million for the 53 weeks of fiscal 2026.\n•\nOur ratio of short-term assets to short-term liabilities (“current ratio”) was 1.6 to 1 and 2.0 to 1 at September 27, 2025, and September 28, 2024, respectively. The decrease in fiscal 2025 was primarily due to lower cash and cash equivalents and increased current debt.\n•\nAt September 27, 2025, $725 million of our cash was held in the international accounts of our foreign subsidiaries. Generally, we do not rely on the foreign cash as a source of funds to support our ongoing domestic liquidity needs. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by reviewing available funds among our foreign subsidiaries and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. We intend to repatriate any excess cash (net of applicable withholding taxes) not subject to regulatory requirements and to indefinitely reinvest outside of the United States the remainder of cash held by foreign subsidiaries. We do not expect the regulatory restrictions or taxes on repatriation to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial condition or the results of operations for the foreseeable future.\nCapital Resources\nCredit Facility\nCash flows from operating activities and cash on hand are our primary sources of liquidity for funding debt service, capital expenditures, dividends and share repurchases. We also have a revolving credit facility, with a committed capacity of $2.5 billion, to provide additional liquidity for working capital needs and to backstop our commercial paper program.\nAt September 27, 2025, amounts available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility totaled $2.5 billion. Our revolving credit facility is funded by a syndicate of 17 banks, with commitments ranging from $50 million to $225 million per bank.\nCommercial Paper Program\nOur commercial paper program provides a low-cost source of borrowing to fund general corporate purposes including working capital requirements. The maximum borrowing capacity under the commercial paper program is $1.75 billion, which increased in April 2025 in conjunction with the execution of the new revolving credit facility. The maturities of the notes may vary, but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issuance. As of September 27, 2025, we had no commercial paper outstanding. Our ability to access commercial paper in the future may be limited or its costs increased.\nCapitalization\nTo monitor our credit ratings and our capacity for long-term financing, we consider various qualitative and quantitative factors. We monitor the ratio of our net debt to EBITDA as support for our long-term financing decisions. At September 27, 2025, and September 28, 2024, the ratio of our net debt to EBITDA was 3.0x and 2.8x, respectively. Refer to Other Key Financial Measures below for an explanation and reconciliation to comparable Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) measures. The increase in this ratio at September 27, 2025 is due to a decrease in EBITDA of $377 million partially offset by a decrease in net debt of $459 million. \n33\nCredit Ratings\nTerm Loan Facility due May 2028\nStandard & Poor’s Rating Services’, a Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC business (“S&P”), applicable rating is “BBB”. Moody’s Investor Service, Inc.’s (“Moody’s”) applicable rating is “Baa2”. The below table outlines the commitment fee on any unused borrowing capacity and the borrowing spread on the outstanding principal balance of our term loan facility due May 2028 that corresponds to the applicable ratings levels from S&P and Moody’s.\nRatings Level (Moody’s/S&P)\nCommitment Fee\nBorrowing Spread\nBaal/BBB+ or above\n0.100 \n%\n1.625 \n%\nBaa2/BBB (current level)\n0.125 \n%\n1.750 \n%\nBaa3/BBB- or lower\n0.175 \n%\n1.875 \n%\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe below table outlines the fees paid on the unused portion of the facility (“Facility Fee Rate”) and letter of credit fees and borrowings (“Borrowing Spread”) that corresponds to the applicable ratings levels from S&P and Moody's. S&P's applicable rating is “BBB.” Moody's applicable rating is “Baa2.”\nRatings Level (Moody's/S&P)\nFacility Fee Rate\nBorrowing Spread\nA3/A- or above\n0.090 \n%\n0.785 \n%\nBaal/BBB+\n0.100 \n%\n0.900 \n%\nBaa2/BBB (current level)\n0.110 \n%\n1.015 \n%\nBaa3/BBB-\n0.150 \n%\n1.100 \n%\nBa1/BB+ or lower\n0.200 \n%\n1.175 \n%\nIn the event the ratings fall within different levels, the applicable rate will be based upon the higher of the two Levels or, if there is more than a one-notch split between the two Levels, then the Applicable Rate will be based upon the Level that is one Level below the higher Level.\nDebt Covenants\nOur revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain a minimum interest expense coverage ratio.\nOur senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets. \nWe were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 27, 2025 and expect that we will maintain compliance.\nPension Plans\nAs further described in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans is defined as the amount the projected benefit obligation exceeds the plan assets. The funded status of the plans is an underfunded position of $146 million at the end of fiscal 2025 as compared to an underfunded position of $158 million at the end of fiscal 2024. We contributed $14 million in fiscal 2025 and expect to contribute approximately $15 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2026. The exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements. As a result, the actual funding in fiscal 2026 may be different from the estimate.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements material to our financial position or results of operations. The off-balance sheet arrangements we have are guarantees of obligations related to certain outside third parties, including leases, debt and livestock grower loans, and residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. See Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion.\n34\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of September 27, 2025 (in millions): \nPayments Due by Period\n2026\n2027-2028\n2029-2030\n2031 and thereafter\nTotal\nDebt principal payments\n (1)\n$\n909 \n$\n1,899 \n$\n1,648 \n$\n4,448 \n$\n8,904 \nInterest payments\n (2)\n423 \n777 \n597 \n2,817 \n4,614 \nGuarantees\n (3)\n10 \n14 \n25 \n18 \n67 \nOperating lease obligations\n (4)\n232 \n321 \n207 \n268 \n1,028 \nPurchase obligations\n (5)\n556 \n866 \n601 \n3,245 \n5,268 \nCapital expenditures \n(6)\n410 \n110 \n— \n— \n520 \nOther long-term liabilities\n (7)\n— \n— \n— \n— \n937 \nTotal contractual commitments\n$\n2,540 \n$\n3,987 \n$\n3,078 \n$\n10,796 \n$\n21,338 \n(1)\nIn the event of a default on payment, acceleration of the principal payments could occur.\n(2)\nInterest payments include interest on all outstanding debt. Payments are estimated for variable rate and variable term debt based on effective interest rates at September 27, 2025, and expected payment dates.\n(3)\nAmounts include guarantees of obligations related to certain outside third parties, which consist of leases, debt and livestock grower loans, all of which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets, as well as residual value guarantees covering certain operating leases for various types of equipment. The amounts included are the maximum potential amount of future payments.\n(4)\nFor additional information regarding operating leases, refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6: Leases.\n(5)\nAmounts include agreements with a remaining term in excess of one year to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The purchase obligations amount included items, such as future purchase commitments for grains and livestock purchase contracts, that provide terms that meet the above criteria. For certain grain purchase commitments with a fixed quantity provision, we have assumed the future obligations under the commitment based on available commodity futures prices as published in observable active markets as of September 27, 2025. Additionally, the purchase obligations amount includes purchase commitments associated with long-term cold storage service agreements entered into as part of the sale of multiple Tyson-owned and operated storage facilities during fiscal 2025. We have excluded future purchase commitments for contracts that do not meet these criteria. Purchase orders are not included in the table, as a purchase order is an authorization to purchase and is cancellable. Contracts for goods or services that contain termination clauses without penalty have also been excluded. \n(6)\nAmounts include estimated amounts to complete buildings and equipment under construction as of September 27, 2025.\n(7)\nOther long-term liabilities primarily consist of deferred compensation, deferred income, self-insurance and asset retirement obligations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount and timing of the remaining payments beyond fiscal 2025; therefore, we have only included the total liability in the table above. We also have employee benefit obligations consisting of pensions and other postretirement benefits of $165 million that are excluded from the table above. A discussion of the Company's pension and postretirement plans, including funding matters, is included in Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits.\nIn addition to the amounts shown above in the table, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $153 million and related interest and penalties of $73 million at September 27, 2025, recorded in Other Liabilities and Other current liabilities. \nOur maximum commitment associated with our cash flow assistance programs is limited to the fair value of each participating livestock supplier's net tangible assets. The potential maximum obligation as of September 27, 2025 was approximately $240 million and we did not have significant net receivables outstanding under these programs.\n35\nOTHER KEY FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe following are other key financial measures used by the Company for the purposes of assessing performance and highlighting operational trends as well as our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt:\nin millions, except ratio data\n2025\n2024\n2023\nNet income (loss)\n$\n507 \n$\n822 \n$\n(649)\nLess: Interest income\n(73)\n(89)\n(30)\nAdd: Interest expense\n449 \n481 \n355 \nAdd/(Less): Income tax expense (benefit)\n262 \n270 \n(29)\nAdd: Depreciation\n1,093 \n1,159 \n1,100 \nAdd: Amortization (a)\n257 \n229 \n229 \nEBITDA\n$\n2,495 \n$\n2,872 \n$\n976 \nTotal gross debt\n8,830 \n9,787 \n9,506 \nLess: Cash and cash equivalents\n(1,229)\n(1,717)\n(573)\nLess: Short-term investments\n— \n(10)\n(15)\nTotal net debt\n$\n7,601 \n$\n8,060 \n$\n8,918 \nRatio Calculations:\nGross debt/EBITDA\n3.5x\n3.4x\n9.7x\nNet debt/EBITDA\n3.0x\n2.8x\n9.1x\nReturn on invested capital (b)\n2.8%\n3.9%\n(1.4%)\nTotal debt to capitalization (c)\n32.6%\n34.6%\n34.2%\nBook value per share (d)\n$\n51.63\n$\n52.03\n$\n51.37\n(a)\nExcludes the amortization of debt issuance and debt discount expense of $11 million, $12 million, $10 million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, as it is included in Interest expense.\n(b)\nReturn on invested capital is calculated by dividing after-tax operating income (loss), calculated by applying the Company’s effective tax rate to operating income (loss), by the average of beginning and ending total debt and shareholders’ equity less cash and cash equivalents.\n(c)\nFor the total debt to capitalization calculation, capitalization is defined as total debt plus total shareholders’ equity.\n(d)\nBook value per share is calculated by dividing shareholders’ equity by the sum of Class A and B shares outstanding.\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Net debt to EBITDA represents the ratio of our debt, net of cash and short-term investments, to EBITDA. EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA are presented as supplemental financial measurements in the evaluation of our business. We believe the presentation of these financial measures helps investors to assess our operating performance from period to period, including our ability to generate earnings sufficient to service our debt, enhances understanding of our financial performance and highlights operational trends. These measures are widely used by investors and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies; however, the measurements of EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA may not be comparable to those of other companies, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA are not measures required by or calculated in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as substitutes for net income or any other measure of financial performance reported in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of operating cash flow or liquidity. EBITDA is a useful tool for assessing, but is not a reliable indicator of, our ability to generate cash to service our debt obligations because certain of the items added to net income to determine EBITDA involve outlays of cash. As a result, actual cash available to service our debt obligations will be different from EBITDA. Investors should rely primarily on our GAAP results, and use non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally, in making investment decisions.\nRECENTLY ISSUED/ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to the discussion under Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1: Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 2: Changes in Accounting Principles. \n36\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of certain accounting estimates we consider critical. These estimates require levels of subjectivity and judgment, which could result in actual results differing from our estimates.\nContingent liabilities\nDescription\nWe are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to wage and hour/labor, antitrust, environmental, product, taxing authorities and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses.\nA determination of the amount of reserves and disclosures required, if any, for these contingencies is made after considerable analysis of each individual issue. We accrue for contingent liabilities when an assessment of the risk of loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. We disclose contingent liabilities when the risk of loss is reasonably possible or probable.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nOur contingent liabilities contain uncertainties because the eventual outcome will result from future events, and determination of current reserves requires estimates and judgments related to future changes in facts and circumstances, differing interpretations of the law and assessments of the amount of damages, and the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond our control.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our contingent liabilities during the past three fiscal years. As set forth in Part II, Item 8, Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 20: Commitments and Contingencies, we recognized $698 million and $174 million of charges in fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively, from legal accruals related to our broiler antitrust civil litigation, broiler chicken grower litigation, pork antitrust litigation, beef antitrust litigation and wage rate litigation based on our assessment of the likelihood and amount of probable losses. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our contingent liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.\nRevenue recognition\nDescription\nWe recognize revenue for the sale of our product at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale. Revenue is measured by the transaction price, which is defined as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing goods to customers. The transaction price is adjusted for estimates of known or expected variable consideration, which includes consumer incentives, trade promotions, and allowances, such as coupons, discounts, rebates, volume-based incentives, cooperative advertising, and other programs. Variable consideration related to these programs is recorded as a reduction to revenue based on amounts we expect to pay.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nThe transaction price contains estimates of known or expected variable consideration. We base these estimates on current performance, historical utilization, and projected redemption rates of each program. We review and update these estimates regularly until the incentives or product returns are realized and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to recognize revenue. As noted above, estimates are made based on historical experience and other factors. Typically, programs that are offered have a short duration, and historically, the difference between actual experience compared to estimated redemptions and performance has not been significant to the quarterly or annual financial statements. However, if the level of redemption rates or performance were to vary significantly from estimates, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. We have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to recognize revenue during the past three fiscal years.\nAccrued self-insurance\nDescription\nWe are self-insured for certain losses related to health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability claims. We use an independent third-party actuary to assist in determining our self-insurance liability. We and the actuary consider a number of factors when estimating our self-insurance liability, including claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. We periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third-party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our self-insurance liability. Our policy is to maintain an accrual at the actuarial estimated median.\n37\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nOur self-insurance liability contains uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgments used. Costs to settle our obligations, including legal and healthcare costs, could increase or decrease causing estimates of our self-insurance liability to change. Incident rates, including frequency and severity, could increase or decrease causing estimates in our self-insurance liability to change.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our self-insurance liability. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material. A 10% change in the actuarial estimate at September 27, 2025, would not have a significant impact on our liability.\nIncome taxes\nDescription\nWe estimate total income tax expense based on statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in various jurisdictions in which we earn income. Income tax includes an estimate for withholding taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries expected to be remitted but does not include an estimate for taxes on earnings considered to be indefinitely invested in the foreign subsidiary. Deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded when it is likely a tax benefit will not be realized for a deferred tax asset. We record unrecognized tax benefit liabilities for known or anticipated tax issues based on our analysis of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nChanges in projected future earnings could affect the recorded valuation allowances in the future. Our calculations related to income taxes contain uncertainties due to judgment used to calculate tax liabilities in the application of complex tax regulations across the tax jurisdictions where we operate. Our analysis of unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties based on judgment used to apply the more likely than not recognition and measurement thresholds.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nDue to the complexity of some of these judgments and uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. To the extent we prevail in matters for which unrecognized tax benefit liabilities have been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our recorded unrecognized tax benefit liabilities, our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. An unfavorable tax settlement would require use of our cash and generally result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. A favorable tax settlement would generally be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution. Changes in tax laws and rates could affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future. Other than those potential impacts, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the tax related balances or valuation allowances.\nDefined benefit pension plans\nDescription\nWe sponsor four defined benefit pension plans that provide retirement benefits to certain team members. We also participate in a multi-employer plan that provides defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements. Such plans are usually administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives. We use independent third-party actuaries to assist us in determining our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. We and the actuaries review assumptions that include estimates of the present value of the projected future pension payment to all plan participants, taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience. We accumulate and amortize the effect of actuarial gains and losses over future periods. Net periodic benefit cost for the defined benefit pension plans was $7 million in fiscal 2025. The projected benefit obligation was $176 million at the end of fiscal 2025. Unrecognized actuarial gain was $2 million at the end of fiscal 2025. We currently expect net periodic benefit cost associated with our pension plans to be approximately $7 million in fiscal 2026. We expect to contribute approximately $15 million of cash to our pension plans in fiscal 2026. The exact amount of cash contributions made to pension plans in any year is dependent upon a number of factors, including minimum funding requirements.\n38\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nOur defined benefit pension plans contain uncertainties due to assumptions required and judgments used. The key assumptions used in developing the required estimates include such factors as discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, retirement rates, and mortality. These assumptions can have a material impact upon the funded status and the net periodic benefit cost. The expected liquidation of certain plans has been considered along with these assumptions. The discount rates were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate. In determining the long-term rate of return on plan assets, we first examined historical rates of return for the various asset classes within the plans. We then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return based on expected returns. Investment, management and other fees paid out of plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. Retirement rates are based primarily on actual plan experience, while standard actuarial tables are used to estimate mortality. It is reasonably likely that changes in external factors will result in changes to the assumptions used to measure pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost in future periods. \nThe risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans. The net pension cost of the multi-employer plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our team members. The future cost of these plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations. \nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost during the past three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate our pension obligations and net periodic benefit cost. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, they are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore generally affect the net periodic benefit cost in future periods. A 1% change in the discount rate at September 27, 2025, would not have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligation or net periodic benefit cost. A 1% change in the return on plan assets at September 27, 2025, would not have a significant impact on net periodic benefit cost. The sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time with the remaining assumptions held constant. Economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effect of changes in assumptions are not necessarily linear.\nImpairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets\nDescription\nGoodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite life intangible asset is less than its carrying value. We have elected to make the first day of the fourth quarter the annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets outside of the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business, sustained decline in market capitalization or significant changes in macro-economic factors such as increased interest and discount rates.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative goodwill test is necessary. If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may more likely than not be less than its carrying value or if significant changes to macro-economic factors related to the reporting unit have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test would be required. The quantitative test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. Additionally, we can elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test. Upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. \nFor indefinite life intangible assets, a qualitative assessment can also be performed to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates it is more likely than not an intangible asset is impaired. Similar to goodwill, we can also elect to forgo the qualitative test for indefinite life intangible assets and perform the quantitative test. Upon performing the quantitative test, if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\n39\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method) and another technique being a market approach (guideline public company method), which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. We include assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Assumptions are also made for varying growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. Generally, we utilize operating margin assumptions based on future expectations, macro-economic trends, operating margins historically realized in the reporting units’ industries and industry marketplace valuation multiples. We consider reporting units that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying value to have a heightened risk of impairment. \nDuring fiscal 2023, we experienced lower than anticipated operating results and changing market fundamentals, as well as a drop in our market capitalization to below book value and an increase in long-term treasury rates which caused a net 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Based on quantitative assessments in fiscal 2023, we recognized $781 million of goodwill impairment charges including $333 million to partially impair the goodwill of the Beef reporting unit, $238 million to fully impair the goodwill of two of our International/Other reporting units and $210 million to partially impair the goodwill of a Chicken segment reporting unit. \nOur fiscal 2024 goodwill impairment analysis did not result in impairment charges. Following the annual fiscal 2024 assessment, our Beef and two Chicken segment reporting units, with a total goodwill of approximately $3.3 billion in fiscal 2024, were at heightened risk of impairment.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2025, our Beef reporting unit experienced lower than anticipated supply of market-ready cattle and an increased carrying value primarily associated with higher cattle costs. Additionally, our forecasts indicated the timing of the recovery of market-ready cattle associated with the anticipated cattle herd rebuilding would be longer than previously estimated. Consequently, we determined the fair value of our Beef reporting unit was more likely than not less than the carrying amount and proceeded to perform a quantitative assessment. Based on this quantitative assessment, we determined the fair value of our Beef reporting unit had decreased to below its carrying value. Accordingly, we recognized a $343 million impairment during the third quarter of fiscal 2025 to fully impair its remaining goodwill.\nWe performed our annual impairment assessment as of the first day of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and determined it was necessary to perform a quantitative assessment for one of our International/Other reporting units, which had goodwill of $0.2 billion at September 27, 2025, as it had lower than previously anticipated operating results. Based on this assessment, we determined that the International/Other reporting unit's estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value, and thus, did not recognize a goodwill impairment. In estimating its fair value, we generally assumed operating margins in future years would normalize over time as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. The current year results are not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to the impact of macroeconomic factors which we expect to be mostly temporary in nature. As of the date of the assessment, we estimate discount rates utilized in the discounted cash flow method would have to increase by more than approximately 125 basis points, with all other assumptions unchanged, before the carrying value of the International/Other reporting units would exceed their fair value. Following the annual fiscal 2025 assessment, this reporting unit was at heightened risk of impairment.\nWe performed a qualitative assessment for the remaining reporting units in our Chicken, Prepared Foods and Pork segments, which had goodwill of $9.3 billion at September 27, 2025, and determined none of them were at heightened risk of impairment following the fiscal 2025 annual assessment. As of the latest fair value assessments, we estimate discount rates utilized in the discounted cash flow method would have to increase by more than approximately 75 basis points, with all other assumptions unchanged, before the carrying value of any of the Chicken, Prepared Foods and Pork reporting units would exceed their fair value.\nThe fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets is calculated principally using multi-period excess earnings and relief-from-royalty valuation approaches, which uses significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy, and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. We consider indefinite life intangible assets that have 20% or less excess fair value over carrying value to have a heightened risk of impairment. Our fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 indefinite life intangible assets impairment analyses did not result in an impairment charge.\n40\nAll of our indefinite life intangible assets' estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values by more than 20% at the date of the most recent estimated fair value determination. We performed our annual impairment assessment as of the first day of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 and determined it was necessary to perform quantitative assessments for two of our Prepared Foods brands with carrying values of $0.5 billion and $0.3 billion at September 27, 2025. For these two brands, we estimate the discount rate would need to increase over 150 basis points as of the date of the most recent estimated fair value, with all other assumptions unchanged, to cause the carrying value to approximate its fair value. We generally assumed growth rates in future years would normalize over time as we believe this is consistent with market participant views in an exit transaction. Had we assumed future growth rates consistent with those realized in fiscal 2025, we would have failed the impairment quantitative test, which may have resulted in material impairment losses. The current year growth rate is not indicative of future market participant expectations in an exit transaction primarily due to the impacts of rapid inflationary pressures and volatile market conditions which impacts we expect to be mostly temporary in nature. We do not currently consider any of our indefinite life intangible assets, which had an aggregate value of $4.1 billion at September 27, 2025, to be at heightened risk of impairment.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nWe have not made material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate impairment of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets during the last three years.\nOur impairment analysis contains inherent estimates and assumptions, many of which are outside the control of management including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, market EBITDA comparables and credit ratings, which could positively or negatively impact the anticipated future economic and operating conditions. The assumptions and estimates used in determining fair value require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. These assumptions can change in future periods as a result of overall economic conditions, including the impacts of inflationary pressures, increased interest and discount rates, global supply chain constraints and decreased market capitalization, amongst others. As a result, there can be no assurance that estimates and assumptions made for the purpose of assessing impairments will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. Potential circumstances that could have a negative effect on the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets include, but are not limited to, lower than forecasted growth rates or operating margins and changes in discount rates. A reduction in the estimated fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets could trigger an impairment in the future. We cannot predict the occurrence of certain events or changes in circumstances that might adversely affect the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets.\nWe continuously evaluate the changing macro-economic conditions including inflationary pressures, rising interest rates, demand outlook and export markets, and the Company's market capitalization. Although all our reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets had more than 20% excess fair value over carrying value as of the most recent assessment, other than one reporting unit with goodwill of $0.2 billion as of September 27, 2025, they remain susceptible to impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors significantly change in the future.\nImpairment of long-lived assets and definite life intangibles\nDescription\nLong-lived assets and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use the asset, a change in its physical condition, or an unexpected change in financial performance.\nWhen evaluating long-lived assets and definite life intangibles for impairment, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated undiscounted future cash flows. An impairment is indicated if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset group. For assets held for sale, we compare the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value. The impairment is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.\nWe recorded charges related to impairments, disposals and write-offs of long-lived assets of $126 million, $131 million and $101 million, in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nOur impairment analysis contains uncertainties due to judgment in assumptions, including useful lives and intended use of assets, observable market valuations, forecasted sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows to determine fair value.\n41\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to evaluate the impairment of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles during the last three fiscal years. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate impairments or useful lives of long-lived assets or definite life intangibles. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate estimated future cash flows, we may be exposed to impairment losses that could be material. We periodically conduct projects to strategically evaluate optimization of such items as network capacity, manufacturing efficiencies and business technology. If we have a significant change in strategies, outlook, or a manner in which we plan to use these assets, we may be exposed to future impairments. \nBusiness Combinations\nDescription\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nWe use various models to determine the value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed such as net realizable value to value inventory, cost method and market approach to value property, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings to value intangibles and discounted cash flow to value goodwill.\nFor significant acquisitions we may use independent third-party valuation specialists to assist us in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. \nJudgments and Uncertainties\nSignificant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, particularly intangible assets. We make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including sales growth, operating margins, attrition rates and discount rates based on historical results, business plans, expected synergies, perceived risk and marketplace data considering the perspective of marketplace participants. \nDetermining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ From Assumptions\nWhile management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions, which could result in subsequent impairments. For more information regarding business combinations, refer to Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3: Acquisitions and Dispositions.\nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nMarket risk relating to our operations results primarily from changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, as well as credit risk concentrations. To address certain of these risks, we enter into various derivative transactions as described below. If a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or be recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. \nFurther, we hold certain positions, primarily in grain and livestock futures that either do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or are not designated as hedges. With the exception of normal purchases and normal sales that are expected to result in physical delivery, we record these positions at fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are reported in earnings at each reporting date. \nThe sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential changes in fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities. Sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to changes, nor do they consider the effects such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity. Actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes.\n42\nCOMMODITIES RISK\nWe purchase certain commodities, such as grains and livestock, during normal operations. As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards and options, to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity. However, as the commodities underlying our derivative financial instruments can experience significant price fluctuations, any requirement to mark-to-market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges could result in volatility in our results of operations. Contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. We generally do not hedge anticipated transactions beyond 18 months. The following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of 10% in market prices as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, on the fair value of open positions. The fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted forward and option prices. The market risk exposure analysis included both derivatives designated as hedge instruments and derivatives not designated as hedge instruments.\nEffect of 10% change in fair value\nin millions\n2025\n2024\nLivestock:\nLive Cattle\n$\n18 \n$\n11 \nLean Hogs\n46 \n24 \nGrain:\nCorn\n19 \n11 \nSoybean Meal\n23 \n16 \nINTEREST RATE RISK\nAt September 27, 2025, we had variable rate debt of $484 million with a weighted average interest rate of 5.9%. A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates effective at September 27, 2025 would increase annualized interest expense by approximately $3 million.\nAdditionally, changes in interest rates impact the fair value of our fixed-rate debt. At September 27, 2025, we had fixed-rate debt of $8,346 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.8%. Market risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value, resulting from a hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would have changed the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by approximately $231 million at September 27, 2025 and $230 million at September 28, 2024. The fair values of our debt were estimated based on quoted market prices and/or published interest rates.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk associated with our pension and post-retirement benefit obligations. Changes in interest rates impact the liabilities associated with these benefit plans as well as the amount of income or expense recognized for these plans. Declines in the value of the plan assets could diminish the funded status of the pension plans and potentially increase the requirements to make cash contributions to these plans. See Part II, Item 8, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 15: Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits for additional information.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\nWe have foreign exchange exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates primarily as a result of certain receivable and payable balances. The primary currencies we have exposure to are the Brazilian real, the British pound sterling, the Canadian dollar, the Chinese renminbi, the European euro, the Malaysian ringgit, the Mexican peso and the Thai baht. We periodically enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge some portion of our foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign exchange rates related to the foreign exchange forward and option contracts would have had a $21 million and $25 million impact on pretax income at September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively.\nCONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK\nOur financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables. Our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to our large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral. At September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, 15.6% and 15.5%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Walmart Inc. No other single customer or customer group represented 10% or greater of net accounts receivable.\n43\nITEM 8.

1: \nBUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDescription of Business\nTyson Foods, Inc. (collectively, “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), is a world-class food company and recognized leader in protein. Founded in 1935 by John W. Tyson, it has grown under four generations of family leadership. The Company is unified by this purpose: Tyson Foods. We Feed the World Like Family™ and has a broad portfolio of iconic products and brands including Tyson®, Jimmy Dean®, Hillshire Farm®, Ball Park®, Wright®, State Fair®, Aidells® and ibp®. Tyson Foods is dedicated to bringing high-quality food to every table in the world, safely, and affordably, now and for future generations.\nConsolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly-owned subsidiaries, as well as majority-owned subsidiaries over which we exercise control and, when applicable, entities for which we have a controlling financial interest or variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n \nFiscal Year\nWe utilize a 52- or 53-week accounting period ending on the Saturday closest to September 30. The Company’s accounting cycle resulted in a 52-week year for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents consist of investments in short-term, highly liquid securities having original maturities of three months or less, which are made as part of our cash management activity. The carrying values of these assets approximate their fair values. We primarily utilize a cash management system with a series of separate accounts consisting of lockbox accounts for receiving cash, concentration accounts where funds are moved to, and several zero-balance disbursement accounts for funding payroll, accounts payable, livestock procurement, livestock grower payments, etc. As a result of our cash management system, checks issued, but not presented to the banks for payment, may result in negative book cash balances. These negative book cash balances are included in accounts payable and other current liabilities. Checks outstanding in excess of related book cash balances totaled approximately $\n100\n million at September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024.\nAccounts Receivable\nWe record accounts receivable at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated credit losses to reflect any loss anticipated on the accounts receivable balances and charged to the allowance for credit losses. We calculate this allowance based on our history of write-offs, future economic conditions, level of past due accounts, and relationships with and economic status of our customers. At September 27, 2025, and September 28, 2024, our allowance for credit losses was $\n49\n million and $\n38\n million, respectively. We generally do not have collateral for our receivables, but we do periodically evaluate the credit worthiness of our customers.\nInventories\nProcessed products, livestock and supplies and other are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes purchased raw materials, live purchase costs, livestock growout costs (primarily feed, livestock grower pay and catch and haul costs), labor and manufacturing and production overhead, which are related to the purchase and production of inventories. At September 27, 2025, the cost of inventories was determined by either the first-in, first-out method or the weighted-average method, which is consistent with the methods used at September 28, 2024. Inventories are presented net of lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments of $\n138\n million and $\n115\n million as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively.\n \nThe following table reflects the major components of inventory as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\n2025\n2024\nProcessed products\n$\n3,086\n \n$\n2,897\n \nLivestock\n1,729\n \n1,460\n \nSupplies and other\n866\n \n838\n \nTotal inventory\n$\n5,681\n \n$\n5,195\n \n49\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost and generally depreciated on a straight-line method over the estimated lives for buildings and leasehold improvements of \n10\n to \n33\n years, machinery and equipment of \n3\n to \n15\n years and land improvements and other of \n3\n to \n20\n years. Major repairs and maintenance costs that significantly extend the useful life of the related assets are capitalized. Normal repairs and maintenance costs are charged to operations. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets at each balance sheet date if indication of impairment exists. Recoverability is assessed using undiscounted cash flows based on historical results and current projections of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We measure impairment as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of an asset group. The fair value of an asset group is generally measured using discounted cash flows including market participant assumptions of future operating results and discount rates.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nDefinite life intangibles are initially recorded at fair value and amortized over the estimated period of benefit. Brands and trademarks are generally amortized using the straight-line method over \n20\n years or less. Customer relationships and supply arrangements are generally amortized over \n7\n to \n30\n years based on the pattern of revenue expected to be generated from the use of the asset. The gross cost and accumulated amortization of intangible assets are removed when the recorded amounts are fully amortized and the asset is no longer in use or the contract has expired. Amortization expense is generally recognized in selling, general, and administrative expense. We review the carrying value of definite life intangibles at each balance sheet date if indications of impairment exists. Recoverability is assessed using undiscounted cash flows based on historical results and current projections of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. We measure impairment as the excess of carrying value over the fair value of the definite life intangible asset group. We use various valuation techniques to estimate fair value, with the primary techniques being discounted cash flows, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings valuation approaches, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. \nGoodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. The first day of the fourth quarter is our annual impairment assessment date for goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets. However, we could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets outside of the required annual assessment if, among other things, we experience disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the business, sustained decline in market capitalization or significant changes in macro-economic factors such as increased interest and discount rates.\nOur goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are evaluated for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative test is necessary. If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite life intangible asset may more likely than not be less than the carrying value, or if significant changes to macro-economic factors have occurred that could materially impact fair value, a quantitative impairment test would be required. The quantitative test is to identify if a potential impairment exists by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite life intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit or indefinite life intangible asset exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill or the indefinite life intangible asset.\nWe estimate the fair value of our reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method), with another technique being a market approach (guideline public company method), which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy. We include assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples which consider our budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data, and are believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Assumptions are also made for varying perpetual growth rates for periods beyond the long-term business plan period. Generally, we utilize operating margin assumptions based on future expectations, operating margins historically realized in the reporting units' industries and industry marketplace valuation multiples.\nThe fair value of our indefinite life intangible assets when performing a quantitative assessment is calculated principally using multi-period excess earnings and relief-from-royalty valuation approaches, which use significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as defined by the fair value hierarchy, and is believed to reflect market participant views which would exist in an exit transaction. Under these valuation approaches, we are required to make estimates and assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, royalty rates and discount rates based on budgets, business plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data. \nSome of the inherent estimates and assumptions used in determining fair value of the reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets are outside the control of management, including interest rates, cost of capital, tax rates, market EBITDA comparables and credit ratings. While we believe we have made reasonable estimates and assumptions to calculate the fair value of the reporting units, it is possible a material change could occur. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions used to calculate fair value, it could result in material impairments of our goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets.\n50\nDuring fiscal 2023, we experienced lower than anticipated operating results and changing market fundamentals, as well as a drop in our market capitalization to below book value and an increase in long-term treasury rates which caused a net 50 basis point increase in the discount rates used in estimating the fair value of the reporting units. Based on quantitative assessments in fiscal 2023, we recognized $\n781\n million of goodwill impairment charges, including $\n333\n million to partially impair the goodwill of the Beef reporting unit, $\n238\n million to fully impair the goodwill of two of our International/Other reporting units and $\n210\n million to partially impair the goodwill of a Chicken segment reporting unit. During fiscal 2024, we determined none of our reporting units’ fair values were below their carrying values. Additionally, during the third quarter of fiscal 2025, our Beef reporting unit experienced lower than anticipated supply of market-ready cattle and an increased carrying value primarily associated with higher cattle costs. Also, our forecasts indicated the timing of the recovery of market-ready cattle associated with the anticipated cattle herd rebuilding would be longer than previously estimated. Consequently, we determined the fair value of our Beef reporting unit was more likely than not less than the carrying value and performed a quantitative assessment. Based on this quantitative assessment, we recognized a $\n343\n million goodwill impairment charge to fully impair the remaining goodwill of the Beef reporting unit.\nDuring fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, we determined the fair value of each of our indefinite life intangible assets exceeded its carrying value. \nWe consider reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets that have \n20\n% or less excess fair value over carrying value to have a heightened risk of impairment. One of our International/Other reporting units, which had goodwill of $\n0.2\n billion at September 27, 2025, was considered at heightened risk of impairment as of the date of the most recent estimated fair value determination. All of our other remaining reporting units and all our indefinite life intangible assets’ estimated fair values exceeded their carrying values by more than \n20\n% as of their most recent assessments. Although the remaining reporting units and indefinite life intangible assets had more than \n20\n% excess fair value over carrying value as of the date of the most recent estimated fair value determination, they remain susceptible to impairments if any assumptions, estimates, or market factors significantly change in the future.\nLeases\nWe determine if an agreement is or contains a lease at its inception by evaluating if an identified asset exists that we control for a period of time. When a lease exists, we classify it as a finance or operating lease and record a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and a corresponding lease liability at lease commencement. We have elected to not record leases with a term of 12 months or less in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and accordingly, lease expense for these short-term leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease assets are presented within Net Property, Plant and Equipment, and finance lease liabilities are presented within Current and Long-Term Debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating ROU assets are presented within Other Assets, and operating lease liabilities are recorded within Other current liabilities and Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease assets are subject to review for impairment within the related long-lived asset group.\nROU assets are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the present value of the corresponding liabilities and are adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received or initial direct costs incurred. The measurement of our ROU assets and liabilities includes all fixed payments and any variable payments based on an index or rate. Variable lease payments which do not depend on an index, or where rates are unknown, are excluded from lease payments in the measurement of the ROU asset and lease liability, and accordingly, are recognized as lease expense in the period the obligation for those payments is incurred. The present value of lease payments is based on our incremental borrowing rate according to the lease term and information available at the lease commencement date, as our lease arrangements generally do not provide an implicit interest rate. The incremental borrowing rate is derived using a hypothetically-collateralized borrowing cost, based on our revolving credit facility, plus a country risk factor, where applicable. We consider our credit rating and the current economic environment in determining the collateralized rate.\nOur lease arrangements can include fixed or variable non-lease components, such as common area maintenance, taxes and labor. We account for each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single lease component for all asset classes, except production and livestock grower asset classes embedded in service and supply agreements, and other asset classes that include significant maintenance or service components. We account for lease and non-lease components of an agreement separately based on relative stand-alone prices either observable or estimated if observable prices are not readily available. For asset classes where an election was made not to separate lease and non-lease components, all costs associated with a lease contract are disclosed as lease costs. The accounting for some of the Company's leases may require significant judgment when determining whether a contract is or contains a lease, the lease term, and the likelihood of exercising renewal or termination options. Our leases can include options to extend or terminate use of the underlying assets. These options are included in the lease term used to determine ROU assets and corresponding liabilities when we are reasonably certain we will exercise the option. Additionally, certain leases can have residual value guarantees, which are included within our operating lease liabilities when considered probable. Our lease agreements do not include significant restrictions or covenants. \n51\nRecognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease will depend on classification as a finance or operating lease. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, whereas the amortization of finance lease assets is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the underlying asset or the lease term. Operating lease expense and finance lease amortization are presented in Cost of Sales or Selling, General and Administrative in our Consolidated Statements of Income depending on the nature of the leased item. Interest expense on finance lease obligations is recorded over the lease term and is presented in Interest expense, based on the effective interest method. All operating lease cash payments and interest on finance leases are presented within Cash flows from operating activities and all finance lease principal payments are presented within cash flows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nInvestments\nWe have investments in joint ventures and other entities. The equity method of accounting is used for entities in which we exercise significant influence but do not have a controlling interest or a variable interest in which we are the primary beneficiary. Under the equity method of accounting, the initial investment is recorded at cost and the investment is subsequently adjusted for its proportionate share of earnings or losses and dividends, including consideration of basis differences resulting from the difference between the initial carrying amount of the investment and the underlying equity in net assets, as applicable. Equity method investments totaled $\n566\n million and $\n550\n million at September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively.\nInvestments not accounted for using the equity method do not have readily determinable fair values and do not qualify for the practical expedient to measure the investment using a net asset value per share. These investments are recorded using the measurement alternative in which our equity interests are recorded at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. At each reporting period, we assess if these investments continue to qualify for this measurement alternative. An impairment is recorded when there is evidence that the expected fair value of the investment has declined to below the recorded cost. Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Investments in joint ventures and other entities are reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Assets.\nWe also have investments in marketable debt securities. We have determined all of our marketable debt securities are available-for-sale investments. These investments are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices as of the balance sheet date, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. \nThe amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization is recorded in interest income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of debt securities and declines in value due to credit-related factors are recorded on a net basis in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAccrued Self-Insurance\nWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms in an effort to mitigate the potential liabilities for health and welfare, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability risks. Liabilities associated with our risks retained are estimated, in part, by considering claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions.\nOther Current Liabilities\nOther current liabilities as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, include (in millions):\n \n2025\n2024\nAccrued salaries, wages and benefits\n$\n909\n \n$\n912\n \nTaxes payable\n193\n \n210\n \nAccrued current legal contingencies\n712\n \n349\n \nOther\n1,065\n \n840\n \nTotal other current liabilities\n$\n2,879\n \n$\n2,311\n \nDefined Benefit Plans\nWe recognize the funded status of defined pension and postretirement plans in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation. We measure our plan assets and liabilities at the end of our fiscal year. For a defined benefit pension plan, the benefit obligation is the projected benefit obligation; for any other defined benefit postretirement plan, such as a retiree health care plan, the benefit obligation is the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Any overfunded status is recognized as an asset and any underfunded status is recognized as a liability. Any transitional asset/liability, prior service cost or actuarial gain/loss that has not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic cost is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Accumulated other comprehensive income will be adjusted as these amounts are subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic benefit costs in future periods.\n \n52\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe purchase certain commodities, such as grains and livestock, during normal operations. As part of our commodity risk management activities, we use derivative financial instruments, primarily futures and options, to reduce our exposure to various market risks related to these purchases, as well as to changes in foreign currency exchange and interest rates. Contract terms of a financial instrument qualifying as a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item, providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation. Contracts designated and highly effective at meeting risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting. If a derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the instrument either will be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings, or be recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Instruments we hold as part of our risk management activities that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings. Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities relating to inputs of forward sales contracts, inventories on hand and anticipated purchases of inventories are recorded in Cost of Sales. Changes in market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities related to interest rates are recorded in Interest expense. Changes in the market value of derivatives used in our risk management activities related to foreign exchange contracts are recorded in Other, net. We generally do not hedge anticipated transactions beyond 18 months.\n \nLitigation Accruals\nThere are a variety of legal proceedings pending or threatened against us. Accruals are recorded when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law, progress of each case, opinions and views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar matters and intended response to the litigation. These amounts, which are not discounted and are exclusive of claims against third parties, are adjusted periodically as assessment efforts progress or additional information becomes available. We expense amounts for administering or litigating claims as incurred. Accruals for legal proceedings are included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSupplier Financing Programs\nWe have supplier financing programs with financial institutions, in which we agree to pay the financial institution the stated amount of confirmed invoices on the invoice due date for participating suppliers. Participation in these programs is optional and solely up to the supplier, who negotiates the terms of the arrangement directly with the financial institution and may allow early payment. Supplier participation in these programs has no bearing on the Company's amounts due. The payment terms that we have with participating suppliers under these programs are generally up to 120 days. We do not have an economic interest in a supplier's participation in the program or a direct financial relationship with the financial institution funding the program. We are responsible for ensuring that participating financial institutions are paid according to the terms negotiated with the supplier. The outstanding payment obligations due to the financial institutions as of the end of a period are included in accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The activity related to these programs is reflected within the operating activities section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n \nChanges in the amounts outstanding on our supplier financing programs were (in millions):\nSeptember 27, 2025\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the beginning of year\n$\n45\n \nInvoices confirmed\n288\n \nConfirmed invoices paid\n(\n281\n)\nConfirmed obligations outstanding at the end of year\n$\n52\n \nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue mainly through retail, foodservice, international, industrial and other distribution channels. Our revenues primarily result from contracts with customers and are generally short term in nature with the delivery of product as the single performance obligation. We recognize revenue for the sale of the product at the point in time when our performance obligation has been satisfied and control of the product has transferred to our customer, which generally occurs upon shipment or delivery to a customer based on terms of the sale. We elected to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of the product as a fulfillment cost rather than an additional promised service. Our contracts are generally less than one year, and therefore we recognize costs paid to third party brokers to obtain contracts as expenses. Additionally, items that are not material in the context of the contract are recognized as expense. Any taxes collected on behalf of government authorities are excluded from net revenues.\n53\nRevenue is measured by the transaction price, which is defined as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for providing goods to customers. The transaction price is adjusted for estimates of known or expected variable consideration, which includes consumer incentives, trade promotions, and allowances, such as coupons, discounts, rebates, volume-based incentives, cooperative advertising, and other programs. Variable consideration related to these programs is recorded as a reduction to revenue based on amounts we expect to pay. We base these estimates on current performance, historical utilization, and projected redemption rates of each program. We review and update these estimates regularly until the incentives or product returns are realized and the impact of any adjustments are recognized in the period the adjustments are identified. In many cases, key sales terms such as pricing and quantities ordered are established on a regular basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a duration of less than one year. Amounts billed and due from customers are short term in nature and are classified as receivables since payments are unconditional and only the passage of time is required before payments are due. Additionally, we do not grant payment financing terms greater than one year. Freight expense associated with products shipped to customers is recognized in cost of sales.\nAdvertising Expenses\nAdvertising expense is charged to operations in the period incurred and is recorded as selling, general and administrative expense. Advertising expense totaled $\n244\n million, $\n267\n million, and $\n339\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively\n.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development costs totaled $\n126\n million, $\n106\n million, $\n114\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for acquired businesses using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control of a business is obtained, 100% of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses including transaction and integration costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe use various models to determine the value of assets acquired such as net realizable value to value inventory, cost method and market approach to value property, relief-from-royalty and multi-period excess earnings to value intangibles, and discounted cash flow to value goodwill. We make estimates and assumptions about projected future cash flows including sales growth, operating margins, attrition rates, and discount rates based on historical results, business plans, expected synergies, perceived risk, and marketplace data considering the perspective of marketplace participants. Determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may be considered to have indefinite useful lives.\nGovernment Assistance Programs\nWe periodically receive government assistance typically in the form of cash grants or refundable tax credits (collectively “Grants”). The Grants generally specify conditions that must be met in order for the Grants to be earned, such as employment, employee retention targets, and construction or acquisition of property and equipment and are often time-bound. If conditions are not satisfied or if the duration period for the arrangement is not met, the Grants may be subject to reduction, repayment, or termination.\nDuring fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, we received amounts related to Grants that were \nnot\n material to the financial statements; however, this conclusion can change based on additional grants received in the future. To the extent amounts have been received by the Company in advance of completion of the conditions, they have been recognized in other current liabilities or other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate.\nUse of Estimates\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. During fiscal 2023, we revised estimates and recorded adjustments of approximately $\n30\n million primarily to reduce certain employee compensation accruals recorded as of October 1, 2022.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn September 2025, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued authoritative guidance to modernize the accounting for internal-use software costs including the elimination of the stage-based capitalization model and updated disclosure requirements. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, our fiscal 2029, and interim reporting periods within those annual reporting periods. Amendments can be applied using a prospective transition approach, a modified transition approach, or a retrospective transition approach. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on disclosures in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to disclose certain additional expense information including, among other items, purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization included within each Consolidated Statement of Income expense caption. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, our fiscal 2028, and interim reporting periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, our fiscal 2029. Amendments can be applied using either the prospective or the retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on disclosures in our consolidated financial statements.\n54\nIn December 2023, the \nFASB issued authoritative guidance to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures primarily related to the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid information. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, our fiscal 2026, and should be applied on a prospective basis with the option to apply retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on disclosures in our consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 2: \nCHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES\nIn November 2023, \nthe \nFASB issued authoritative guidance to improve the disclosures about a public entity's reportable segments and address requests from investors for additional, more detailed information about a reportable segment's expenses. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, our fiscal 2025, and interim reporting periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, our fiscal 2026. Amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We adopted this guidance and included the required disclosure in the notes to our annual consolidated financial statements for our fiscal year ending September 27, 2025. \nIn March 2023, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to address issues related to arrangements between entities under common control such as terms and conditions an entity should consider for determining whether a lease exists and the classification and accounting for that lease as well as accounting for leasehold improvements associated with leases between entities under common control. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2023, our fiscal 2025 and can be applied using either the prospective or retrospective approach. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued guidance that requires additional disclosures for supplier finance programs to allow users to better understand the nature, activity and potential magnitude of the programs. The guidance, except for a requirement for rollforward information, is effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022, our fiscal 2024. Disclosure of rollforward information is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, our fiscal 2025. Early adoption is permitted and the retrospective transition method should be applied for all amendments except rollforward information, which should be applied prospectively. We elected to early adopt the initial disclosure requirement for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. We adopted the rollforward requirement in the notes to our annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2025.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued authoritative guidance intended to provide consistent and transparent disclosures around government assistance by requiring disclosures of the type of government assistance, our method of accounting for the government assistance and the effect on our financial statements. This guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021, our fiscal 2023, and can be applied using either the prospective or retrospective approach. We adopted this guidance for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as amounts received from government assistance programs were not material.\n \nNOTE 3: \nACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS\n \nAcquisitions\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we acquired Williams Sausage Company for $\n220\n million, net of cash acquired, as part of our growth strategy to increase our capacity and product portfolio. Its results, subsequent to the acquisition closing, are included in our Prepared Foods segment and through September 27, 2025 were insignificant to our Consolidated Statements of Income. The purchase price allocation included $\n15\n million of net working capital, including $\n3\n million of cash acquired, $\n67\n million of Property, Plant and Equipment, $\n107\n million of Goodwill, $\n65\n million of Intangible Assets, and $\n31\n million of Deferred Income Taxes. Intangible Assets include brands and trademarks and customer relationships which will be amortized over a life of \n20\n and \n12\n years, respectively. $\n50\n million of the goodwill is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. The acquisition of Williams Sausage Company was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. \nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we completed the acquisition of a \n60\n% equity stake in Supreme Foods Processing Company (\"SFPC\"), a producer and distributor of value-added and cooked chicken and beef products, and a \n15\n% equity stake in Agricultural Development Company (\"ADC\"), a fully integrated poultry company, for a total purchase price of $\n75\n million, net of cash acquired. Both SFPC and ADC were subsidiaries of Tanmiah Food Company. The results of SFPC, subsequent to the acquisition closing, are included in International/Other for segment presentation and through September 27, 2025 were insignificant to our Consolidated Statements of Income. We are accounting for the investment in ADC under the equity method. \nAcquisition of equity method investments in fiscal 2023, which totaled $\n115\n million, primarily included ADC and the purchase of a minority interest in a global insect-based ingredients company as well as deferred payments related to a prior year investment.\n55\nDispositions\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we completed the sale of our Vienna, Georgia facility, which was included in our Chicken segment, for $\n174\n million. As a result of the sale, we recorded a pretax gain of $\n16\n million, which was reflected in Cost of Sales in our Consolidated Statement of Income for our fiscal 2024. The facility's $\n158\n million carrying value primarily consisted of fixed assets and inventory, and included $\n63\n million of goodwill that was not deductible for tax purposes. The Company concluded the sale of the facility was not a significant disposal and did not represent a strategic shift, and therefore, was not classified as a discontinued operation for any of the periods presented.\nNOTE 4: \nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following table reflects major categories of property, plant and equipment and accumulated depreciation as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\n2025\n2024\nLand\n$\n209\n \n$\n220\n \nBuilding and leasehold improvements\n7,079\n \n6,981\n \nMachinery and equipment\n12,015\n \n11,457\n \nLand improvements and other\n575\n \n600\n \nBuildings and equipment under construction\n509\n \n705\n \n20,387\n \n19,963\n \nLess accumulated depreciation\n11,183\n \n10,521\n \nNet property, plant and equipment\n$\n9,204\n \n$\n9,442\n \nNOTE 5: \nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following table reflects goodwill activity for fiscal years 2025 and 2024 (in millions):\nBeef\nPork\nChicken\nPrepared Foods\nInternational/Other\nConsolidated\nBalance at September 30, 2023 \n(a)\n$\n343\n \n$\n423\n \n$\n3,064\n \n$\n5,904\n \n$\n144\n \n$\n9,878\n \nFiscal 2024 Activity:\nMeasurement period adjustments\n— \n— \n— \n(\n13\n)\n— \n(\n13\n)\nSale of business\n— \n— \n(\n63\n)\n— \n— \n(\n63\n)\nCurrency translation\n— \n— \n—\n \n— \n17\n \n17\n \nBalance at September 28, 2024\n (a)\n$\n343\n \n$\n423\n \n$\n3,001\n \n$\n5,891\n \n$\n161\n \n$\n9,819\n \nFiscal 2025 Activity:\nSale of business\n— \n— \n—\n \n— \n(\n4\n)\n(\n4\n)\nImpairment losses\n(\n343\n)\n— \n—\n \n— \n—\n \n(\n343\n)\nCurrency translation\n— \n— \n—\n \n— \n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nBalance at September 27, 2025\n(a)\n$\n—\n \n$\n423\n \n$\n3,001\n \n$\n5,891\n \n$\n154\n \n$\n9,469\n \n(a) Included in goodwill for fiscal 2025 are accumulated impairment losses of $\n1,236\n million in Beef, $\n210\n million in Chicken and $\n295\n million in International/Other.

We estimate amortization expense on intangible assets for the next five fiscal years subsequent to September 27, 2025, will be: 2026 - $\n207\n million; 2027 - $\n195\n million; 2028 - $\n187\n million; 2029 - $\n174\n million; 2030 - $\n166\n million.\nNOTE 6: \nLEASES\nWe lease certain equipment, buildings and land related to transportation, distribution, storage, production, livestock grower assets and office activities. These lease arrangements can be structured as a standard lease agreement or embedded in a service or supply agreement.

We are reporting on actions approved through the end of fiscal 2025 as we are currently unable to make an estimate of the cost of the entire network optimization plan. We anticipate recognizing total pretax charges of $\n86\n million related to the actions approved through September 27, 2025, which include $\n99\n million of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $\n94\n million of non-cash charges, partially offset by $\n107\n million gain recognized from the sale of storage facilities. Additionally, we have received $\n252\n million in proceeds associated with the sale of storage facilities during fiscal 2025. We expect to incur costs related to the network optimization plan over a multi-year period and anticipate additional charges in the future as further actions are approved. \nIn fiscal 2025, we recognized net charges of $\n45\n million related to the network optimization plan, which included a gain of $\n107\n million from the sale of storage facilities. The charges primarily included the closure of two facilities in the Prepared Foods segment, a non-harvesting facility closure in the Beef segment, and asset write-offs in the Chicken and Prepared Foods segments and International/Other, as well as severance and related costs and contract and lease termination costs. Additionally, in fiscal 2025, we executed various long-term cold storage service agreements and sold multiple Tyson-owned and operated storage facilities which primarily support our Chicken and Prepared Foods segments. As part of the sale agreements, we leased back the storage facilities for various periods ranging from approximately \none\n to \nthree\n years, and entered into long-term cold storage service agreements associated with several fully automated cold storage facilities. We expect this will reduce network complexity, streamline inventory flow, simplify processes and reduce operating expenses.\nThe following table reflects pretax (income) expense related to the network optimization plan during fiscal 2025 (in millions):\nBeef\nPork\nChicken\nPrepared Foods\nInternational/Other\nTotal\nCost of Sales:\nSeverance and related costs\n$\n6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n18\n \nAccelerated depreciation\n38\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n39\n \nAsset write-offs\n3\n \n—\n \n33\n \n34\n \n12\n \n82\n \nContract and lease terminations\n1\n \n—\n \n3\n \n7\n \n—\n \n11\n \nGain on sale of storage facilities\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n38\n)\n(\n69\n)\n—\n \n(\n107\n)\nTotal Cost of Sales\n$\n48\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n(\n26\n)\n$\n14\n \n$\n43\n \nSelling, General and Administrative:\nSeverance and related costs\n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \nTotal Selling, General and Administrative\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \nTotal\n$\n48\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n(\n26\n)\n$\n14\n \n$\n45\n \nAs of September 27, 2025, there was $\n34\n million of network optimization plan liability, net of $\n19\n million of payments during fiscal 2025 in addition to a receivable of $\n43\n million for the deferred purchase price from the sale of storage facilities, which is expected to be received in fiscal 2026. \n59\n2022 Program \nThe Company approved a restructuring program in fiscal 2022 (the \"2022 Program\"), to improve business performance, increase collaboration, enhance team member agility, enable faster decision-making and reduce redundancies. In conjunction with the 2022 Program, the Company relocated all its corporate team members from its former Chicago, Downers Grove and Dakota Dunes area corporate locations to its world headquarters in Springdale, Arkansas. The 2022 Program and associated expenses were completed in our fiscal 2024, and accordingly, disclosures for certain years have been omitted as they have been deemed to be immaterial. \nThe following table reflects the pretax impact of the 2022 Program's restructuring and related charges during fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively, by reportable segment (in millions):\nBeef\nPork\nChicken\nPrepared Foods\nInternational/Other\nTotal\nSeverance costs\n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4\n \nRelocation and related costs\n3\n \n1\n \n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n8\n \nAccelerated depreciation\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nContract and lease terminations\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n19\n \n—\n \n19\n \nProfessional and other fees\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2024 Total\n$\n4\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n31\n \nBeef\nPork\nChicken\nPrepared Foods\nInternational/Other\nTotal\nSeverance costs\n$\n8\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n55\n \nRelocation and related costs\n18\n \n6\n \n2\n \n16\n \n—\n \n42\n \nAccelerated depreciation\n5\n \n2\n \n—\n \n12\n \n—\n \n19\n \nContract and lease terminations\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \nProfessional and other fees\n2\n \n1\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n6\n \n2023 Total\n$\n33\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n16\n \n$\n49\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n124\n \nIncluded in the above results are cash charges of $\n21\n million and $\n108\n million in fiscal 2024 and 2023, respectively.

We ceased operations and shifted production to other facilities throughout fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024.\nDuring fiscal 2024 and 2023, as a result of the plant closures and disposals, we recorded charges of $\n198\n million and $\n322\n million, respectively, primarily related to grower contract terminations, accelerated depreciation, severance, retention and related costs, and recorded a gain of $\n16\n million during fiscal 2024 related to the sale of a Chicken segment facility. During fiscal 2025, we recorded $\n23\n million of additional charges related to contract termination costs, partially offset by $\n6\n million of proceeds received related to a China plant relocation, which will collectively result in cash flows. Additionally, during fiscal 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of $\n17\n million related to the discontinuation of a product line in the Prepared Foods segment. These charges, net of gains, are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Cost of Sales. Included in the results for fiscal 2024 are $\n24\n million of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $\n174\n million in non-cash charges. Included in the results for fiscal 2023 are $\n201\n million of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $\n138\n million of non-cash charges. \n60\nThe following table reflects our liability related to plant closures as of September 27, 2025 (in millions):\nBalance at September 28, 2024\nPlant Closure Charges\nPayments\nBalance at September 27, 2025\nContract termination\n$\n98\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n(\n49\n)\n$\n72\n \nSeverance and retention\n5\n \n—\n \n(\n5\n)\n—\n \nTotal\n$\n103\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n(\n54\n)\n$\n72\n \nDuring fiscal 2024, we experienced a fire at a production facility in the Netherlands which is included in International/Other for segment presentation, and subsequently approved the sale of the facility. For fiscal 2024, charges totaled $\n86\n million primarily related to property, plant and equipment impairments, severance costs, inventory write-offs and clean-up costs, partially offset by insurance proceeds. The net charges are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Cost of Sales and, for fiscal 2024, included $\n31\n million of charges that have resulted or will result in cash outflows and $\n64\n million of non-cash charges, offset by $\n9\n million of insurance proceeds. In fiscal 2025, we recognized additional net insurance proceeds of $\n18\n million.\nWe continue to strategically evaluate optimization of such items as network capacity, manufacturing efficiencies and business technology. If we have a significant change in strategies, outlook, or a manner in which we plan to use these assets, we may experience future charges.\nNOTE 8: \nDEBT\nThe following table reflects major components of debt as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\n2025\n2024\nRevolving credit facility\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nCommercial paper\n—\n \n—\n \nSenior notes:\n4.00% Notes due March 2026 (“2026 Notes”)\n800\n \n800\n \n3.55% Notes due June 2027\n1,350\n \n1,350\n \n7.00% Notes due January 2028\n18\n \n18\n \n4.35% Notes due March 2029 (“2029 Notes”)\n1,000\n \n1,000\n \n5.40% Notes due March 2029 (\"5.40% 2029 Notes\")\n600\n \n600\n \n6.13% Notes due November 2032 \n157\n \n157\n \n5.70% Notes due March 2034 (\"5.70% 2034 Notes\")\n900\n \n900\n \n4.88% Notes due August 2034 \n500\n \n500\n \n5.15% Notes due August 2044 \n497\n \n500\n \n4.55% Notes due June 2047\n733\n \n750\n \n5.10% Notes due September 2048 (“2048 Notes”)\n1,490\n \n1,500\n \nDiscount on senior notes\n(\n34\n)\n(\n36\n)\nTerm loans:\nTerm loan facility due May 2026\n—\n \n750\n \nTerm loan facility due May 2028 (5.99% at September 27, 2025)\n440\n \n750\n \nFinance leases\n168\n \n126\n \nOther\n251\n \n168\n \nUnamortized debt issuance costs\n(\n40\n)\n(\n46\n)\nTotal debt\n8,830\n \n9,787\n \nLess current debt\n909\n \n74\n \nTotal long-term debt\n$\n7,921\n \n$\n9,713\n \nAnnual maturities of debt for the five fiscal years subsequent to September 27, 2025 are: 2026 - $\n909\n million; 2027 - $\n1,400\n million; 2028 - $\n499\n million; 2029 - $\n1,626\n million; 2030 - $\n22\n million.\n61\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn April 2025, we terminated our previously existing revolving credit facility and entered into a new $\n2.5\n billion revolving credit facility that supports short-term funding needs and serves as a backstop to our commercial paper program. The new revolving credit facility will mature, and the commitments thereunder will terminate, in April 2030 with options for two one-year extensions. Under the terms of the revolving credit facility, we have the option to establish incremental commitment increases of up to an aggregate amount of $\n500\n million if certain conditions are met. The covenants and other terms of the new facility are generally consistent with those of the terminated facility. \nAt September 27, 2025, amounts available for borrowing under this facility totaled $\n2.5\n billion and we had \nno\n outstanding borrowings and \nno\n outstanding letters of credit issued under this facility. At September 27, 2025, we had $\n83\n million of bilateral letters of credit issued separately from the revolving credit facility, none of which were drawn upon. Our letters of credit are issued primarily in support of workers’ compensation insurance programs and other legal obligations. In the future, if any of our subsidiaries shall guarantee any of our material indebtedness, such subsidiary shall be required to guarantee the indebtedness, obligations and liabilities under this facility.\nCommercial Paper Program\nWe have a commercial paper program under which we may issue unsecured short-term promissory notes up to an aggregate maximum principal amount of $\n1.75\n billion. As of September 27, 2025, we had \nno\n commercial paper outstanding. Our ability to access commercial paper in the future may be limited or its costs increased.\nIn April 2025, we increased the aggregate maximum principal amount to $\n1.75\n billion in conjunction with the execution of the new revolving credit facility.\n5.40% 2029 Notes/5.70% 2034 Notes\nIn March 2024, we issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of $\n1.5\n billion, consisting of $\n600\n million due March 2029 (\"5.40% 2029 Notes\") and $\n900\n million due March 2034 (\"5.70% 2034 Notes\"). A portion of the net proceeds from the issuances were used to repay $\n250\n million of the amount outstanding under our term loan facility due May 2026, and we used the remainder of the proceeds to retire the August 2024 notes. Interest payments on the 5.40% 2029 Notes and 5.70% 2034 Notes are due semi-annually on March 15 and September 15, beginning September 15, 2024. After the original issue discounts of $\n3\n million, we received net proceeds of $\n1,497\n million and incurred debt issuance costs of $\n14\n million related to the issuances.\nTerm Loan Facilities\nThe term loan facilities may be prepaid under certain conditions and contain covenants that are similar to those contained in the revolving credit facility. In fiscal 2024, we borrowed the full $\n750\n million available under a term loan facility that matures in May 2028 and used it to repay $\n592\n million of outstanding commercial paper obligations, and during fiscal 2025, we repaid $\n310\n million of this term loan using cash on hand. Additionally, during fiscal 2025, we fully repaid the $\n750\n million term loan due May 2026 using cash on hand.\nSenior Note Repayments \nDuring fiscal 2025, we repurchased $\n30\n million of senior notes on the open market.\nDebt Covenants\nOur revolving credit and term loan facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens and encumbrances; incur debt; merge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate; make acquisitions and investments; dispose of or transfer assets; change the nature of our business; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; and enter into hedging transactions, in each case, subject to certain qualifications and exceptions. In addition, we are required to maintain a minimum interest expense coverage ratio.\nOur senior notes also contain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, may limit or restrict our ability to: create liens; engage in certain sale/leaseback transactions; and engage in certain consolidations, mergers and sales of assets.\nWe were in compliance with all debt covenants at September 27, 2025.\nNOTE 9: \nEQUITY \nCapital Stock\nWe have \ntwo\n classes of capital stock, Class A Common stock, $\n0.10\n par value (“Class A stock”) and Class B Common Stock, $\n0.10\n par value (“Class B stock”). Holders of Class B stock may convert such stock into Class A stock on a share-for-share basis. Holders of Class B stock are entitled to \n10\n votes per share, while holders of Class A stock are entitled to \none\n vote per share on matters submitted to shareholders for approval. As of September 27, 2025, TLP owned \n99.987\n% of the outstanding shares of Class B stock and the TLP and members of the Tyson family owned, in the aggregate, \n2.56\n% of the outstanding shares of Class A stock, giving them, collectively, control of approximately \n71.94\n% of the total voting power of the outstanding voting stock.\n62\nThe Class B stock is considered a participating security requiring the use of the two-class method for the computation of basic earnings per share. The two-class computation method for each period reflects the cash dividends paid for each class of stock, plus the amount of allocated undistributed earnings (losses) computed using the participation percentage, which reflects the dividend rights of each class of stock. Basic earnings per share were computed using the two-class method for all periods presented. The shares of Class B stock are considered to be participating convertible securities since the shares of Class B stock are convertible on a share-for-share basis into shares of Class A stock. Diluted earnings per share, if dilutive, were computed assuming the conversion of the Class B shares into Class A shares as of the beginning of each period.\nDividends \nCash dividends cannot be paid to holders of Class B stock unless they are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The per share amount of the cash dividend paid to holders of Class B stock cannot exceed \n90\n% of the cash dividend simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. We pay quarterly cash dividends to Class A and Class B shareholders. We paid Class A dividends per share of $\n2.00\n, $\n1.96\n, and $\n1.92\n in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We paid Class B dividends per share of $\n1.80\n, $\n1.76\n, and $\n1.73\n in fiscal 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Effective November 7, 2025, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend previously declared on August 7, 2025, to $\n0.51\n per share on our Class A stock and $\n0.459\n per share on our Class B stock. The increased quarterly dividend is payable on December 15, 2025, to shareholders of record at the close of business on December 1, 2025. We had dividends payable of $\n174\n million and $\n171\n million at September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively.\nShare Repurchases\nOn August 7, 2025, our Board of Directors approved an increase of \n43\n million shares authorized under our share repurchase program. As of September 27, 2025, \n47.2\n million shares remained available for repurchase. The program has no fixed or scheduled termination date, and the timing and extent to which we repurchase shares will depend upon, among other things, our working capital needs, markets, industry conditions, liquidity targets, limitations under our debt obligations and regulatory requirements. In addition to the share repurchase program, we purchase shares on the open market to fund certain obligations under our equity compensation plans.\nA summary of cumulative share repurchases of our Class A stock for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in millions):\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nSeptember 30, 2023\nShares\nDollars\nShares\nDollars\nShares\nDollars\nShares repurchased:\nUnder share repurchase program\n3.1\n \n$\n174\n \n—\n \n$\n—\n \n4.7\n \n$\n300\n \nTo fund certain obligations under equity compensation plans\n0.4\n \n22\n \n0.9\n \n49\n \n0.9\n \n54\n \nTotal share repurchases\n3.5\n \n$\n196\n \n0.9\n \n$\n49\n \n5.6\n \n$\n354\n \n63\nNOTE 10: \nINCOME TAXES\nDetail of the provision for income taxes from continuing operations consisted of the following for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\n2025\n2024\n2023\nFederal\n$\n124\n \n$\n188\n \n$\n(\n39\n)\nState\n54\n \n34\n \n(\n38\n)\nForeign\n84\n \n48\n \n48\n \n \n$\n262\n \n$\n270\n \n$\n(\n29\n)\nCurrent\n$\n338\n \n$\n315\n \n$\n154\n \nDeferred\n(\n76\n)\n(\n45\n)\n(\n183\n)\n \n$\n262\n \n$\n270\n \n$\n(\n29\n)\nThe reasons for the difference between the statutory federal income tax rate and our effective income tax rate from continuing operations are as follows for fiscal years 2025, 2024 and 2023:\n2025\n2024\n2023\nFederal income tax rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nState income taxes\n4.7\n \n3.4\n \n(\n0.7\n)\nUnrecognized tax benefits, net\n1.2\n \n0.7\n \n1.8\n \nDeferred income tax remeasurement\n—\n \n(\n0.9\n)\n3.8\n \nGeneral business credits\n(\n2.1\n)\n(\n1.9\n)\n3.4\n \nCompany-owned life insurance\n(\n1.3\n)\n(\n1.7\n)\n1.3\n \nOfficer compensation expense\n1.9\n \n1.1\n \n(\n0.6\n)\nForeign rate differences and valuation allowances\n(\n1.8\n)\n0.3\n \n(\n1.2\n)\nGoodwill\n9.4\n \n1.2\n \n(\n24.2\n)\nOther\n1.1\n \n1.6\n \n(\n0.3\n)\n34.1\n \n%\n24.8\n \n%\n4.3\n \n%\nDuring fiscal 2025, state tax expense, net of federal impact, was $\n36\n million. Additionally, the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate due to the impact of a $\n343\n million non-deductible goodwill impairment. Changes in foreign valuation allowances include $\n9\n million benefit due to legislation enacted in fiscal 2025. \nDuring fiscal 2024, state tax expense, net of federal impact, was $\n28\n million, which included $\n14\n million benefit from operating loss carryforwards and $\n9\n million benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes, primarily due to legislation decreasing state tax rates enacted in fiscal 2024. Additionally, the effective tax rate is higher than the statutory rate due to the impact of $\n63\n million of non-deductible goodwill associated with the sale of our Vienna, Georgia facility.\nDuring fiscal 2023, state tax benefit, net of federal impact, was $\n21\n million, which included $\n26\n million benefit related to the remeasurement of deferred income taxes, primarily due to legislation decreasing state tax rates enacted in fiscal 2023. Non-deductible goodwill impairments unfavorably impacted the effective tax rate by \n24.2\n%. The tax benefit from income tax credits was $\n23\n million. \nApproximately $\n278\n million, $\n864\n million and ($\n643\n) million of income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, were from our operations based in the United States.\nWe recognize deferred income taxes for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.\n64\nThe tax effects of major items recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, are as follows (in millions):\n2025\n2024\nAssets\nLiabilities\nAssets\nLiabilities\nProperty, plant and equipment\n$\n—\n \n$\n1,112\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,128\n \nIntangible assets\n—\n \n1,433\n \n—\n \n1,460\n \nROU assets\n—\n \n257\n \n—\n \n206\n \nAccrued expenses\n504\n \n—\n \n412\n \n—\n \nLease liabilities\n251\n \n—\n \n191\n \n—\n \nNet operating loss and credit carryforwards\n159\n \n— \n198\n \n— \nOther\n210\n \n327\n \n260\n \n332\n \n$\n1,124\n \n$\n3,129\n \n$\n1,061\n \n$\n3,126\n \nValuation allowance\n$\n(\n173\n)\n$\n(\n193\n)\nNet deferred tax liability\n$\n2,178\n \n$\n2,258\n \nAt September 27, 2025, our gross state net operating loss carryforwards approximated $\n1,305\n million, of which $\n1,079\n million expire in fiscal years 2026 through 2045, and the remainder has no expiration. Gross foreign net operating loss carryforwards approximated $\n297\n million, of which $\n63\n million expire in fiscal years 2026 through 2042, and the remainder has no expiration. We also have tax credit carryforwards of approximately $\n37\n million which expire in fiscal years 2026 through 2050. We maintain a valuation allowance against the majority of our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.\nWe have accumulated undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately $\n689\n million at September 27, 2025. Our undistributed earnings are generally expected to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States, except for excess cash (net of an insignificant amount of applicable withholding taxes) not subject to regulatory requirements. Dividends after December 31, 2017 from foreign subsidiaries are generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes. Accordingly, no deferred income taxes have been provided on our indefinitely reinvested earnings. Due to the uncertainty of the manner in which the outside basis difference associated with these earnings would reverse, it is not currently practicable to estimate the tax liability that might be payable on the repatriation of these foreign earnings; however, we do not expect any tax due to be material. \nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits as of September 27, 2025, September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023 (in millions):\n2025\n2024\n2023\nBalance as of the beginning of the year\n$\n151\n \n$\n131\n \n$\n152\n \nIncreases related to current year tax positions\n19\n \n22\n \n7\n \nIncreases related to prior year tax positions\n9\n \n12\n \n1\n \nReductions related to prior year tax positions\n(\n4\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n12\n)\nReductions related to settlements\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nReductions related to expirations of statutes of limitations\n(\n6\n)\n(\n12\n)\n(\n17\n)\nBalance as of the end of the year\n$\n168\n \n$\n151\n \n$\n131\n \nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, that would impact our effective tax rate was $\n110\n million at September 27, 2025 and $\n104\n million at September 28, 2024. We classify interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense. At September 27, 2025, and September 28, 2024, before tax benefits, we had $\n73\n million and $\n59\n million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties on unrecognized tax benefits.\n65\nIn December 2021, we received an assessment from the Mexican tax authorities related to the 2015 sale of our direct and indirect equity interests in subsidiaries which collectively held our Mexico operation. At September 27, 2025, the assessment totaled approximately $\n499\n million (\n9.2\n billion Mexican pesos), which included tax, inflation adjustment, interest and penalties. Based on analysis of our assessment in accordance with guidance related to unrecognized tax benefits, we have not recorded a liability related to our assessment. Additionally, the purchaser in the transaction also received an assessment from the Mexican tax authorities related to the sale of the indirect equity interest, which was affirmed in January 2025 by a circuit court in Mexico, but remains subject to potential further judicial review under a petition filed by the purchaser. The transaction agreement contains certain mutual indemnification provisions, and both parties have provided notice of indemnification claims to the other party. We believe any final assessment levied against and collected from the purchaser should prohibit potential assessment against us related to the sale of the same indirect equity interest because the Mexican tax authorities cannot collect twice for the same alleged underlying tax liability. We do not reasonably expect that the total amount sought in indemnification could exceed our assessment total at this time. In fiscal 2025, we recorded a pretax liability of $\n40\n million for the estimated probable loss related to the indemnification provisions with the purchaser.\nAs of September 27, 2025, certain United States federal income tax returns are subject to examination for fiscal years 2021 through 2024. We are currently under examination for fiscal years 2021 and 2022 and are responding to requests from the Internal Revenue Service but have not received any proposed adjustments. We are also subject to income tax examinations by major state and foreign jurisdictions for fiscal years 2014 through 2024 and 2020 through 2024, respectively. We do not expect material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.\nOn July 4, 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (\"OBBBA\") was enacted into law. The OBBBA makes permanent key elements of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including 100% bonus depreciation, domestic research cost expensing and the business interest expense limitation. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions effective in 2025 and others implemented through 2027. The legislation did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2025 effective tax rate or consolidated financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact in fiscal 2026 but is expected to result in lower cash tax payments in fiscal 2026. We continue to review the OBBBA tax provisions to assess impacts to our consolidated financial statements.\n \n66\nNOTE 11: \nEARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE \nThe earnings and weighted average common shares used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows for fiscal years ended 2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions, except per share data):\n2025\n2024\n2023\nNumerator:\nNet Income (Loss)\n$\n507\n \n$\n822\n \n$\n(\n649\n)\nLess: Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n33\n \n22\n \n(\n1\n)\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Tyson\n474\n \n800\n \n(\n648\n)\nLess dividends declared:\nClass A\n574\n \n563\n \n554\n \nClass B\n126\n \n124\n \n122\n \nUndistributed earnings (losses)\n$\n(\n226\n)\n$\n113\n \n$\n(\n1,324\n)\nClass A undistributed earnings (losses)\n$\n(\n185\n)\n$\n92\n \n$\n(\n1,084\n)\nClass B undistributed earnings (losses)\n(\n41\n)\n21\n \n(\n240\n)\nTotal undistributed earnings (losses)\n$\n(\n226\n)\n$\n113\n \n$\n(\n1,324\n)\nDenominator:\nDenominator for basic earnings (loss) per share:\nClass A weighted average shares\n285\n \n284\n \n284\n \nClass B weighted average shares\n70\n \n70\n \n70\n \nDenominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share:\nClass A weighted average shares\n285\n \n284\n \n284\n \nClass B weighted average shares under if-converted method for diluted earnings (loss) per share\n(a)\n70\n \n70\n \n— \nEffect of dilutive securities: Stock options, restricted stock and performance units\n2\n \n2\n \n—\n \nDenominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share – weighted average shares and assumed conversions\n(a)\n357\n \n356\n \n284\n \nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Tyson:\nClass A Basic\n$\n1.37\n \n$\n2.31\n \n$\n(\n1.87\n)\nClass B Basic\n$\n1.22\n \n$\n2.06\n \n$\n(\n1.68\n)\nDiluted\n(a)\n$\n1.33\n \n$\n2.25\n \n$\n(\n1.87\n)\nDividends Declared Per Share:\nClass A\n$\n2.010\n \n$\n1.970\n \n$\n1.940\n \nClass B\n$\n1.809\n \n$\n1.773\n \n$\n1.746\n \n(a) For fiscal 2023, as the Company was in a net loss position, the impact of the Class B shares under the if-converted method was antidilutive and therefore we have not assumed conversion. As a result, the Class B weighted average shares, dividends declared and undistributed losses were excluded for the purposes of calculating Net Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Tyson on a diluted basis.\nApproximately \n6\n million, \n7\n million, and \n9\n million of our stock-based compensation shares were antidilutive for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. These shares were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. \nWe have \ntwo\n classes of capital stock, Class A stock and Class B stock. Cash dividends cannot be paid to holders of Class B stock unless they are simultaneously paid to holders of Class A stock. The per share amount of cash dividends paid to holders of Class B stock cannot exceed \n90\n% of the cash dividends paid to holders of Class A stock.\nWe allocate undistributed earnings (losses) based upon a \n1\n to \n0.9\n ratio per share to Class A stock and Class B stock, respectively. We allocate undistributed earnings (losses) based on this ratio due to historical dividend patterns, voting control of Class B shareholders and contractual limitations of dividends to Class B stock.\n67\nNOTE 12: \nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nOur business operations give rise to certain market risk exposures mostly due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We manage a portion of these risks through the use of derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. Our risk management programs are periodically reviewed by our Board of Directors’ Audit Committee. These programs and risks are monitored by senior management and may be revised as market conditions dictate. Our current risk management programs utilize various industry-standard models that take into account the implicit cost of hedging. Credit risks associated with our derivative contracts are not significant as we minimize counterparty exposure by dealing with credit-worthy counterparties and utilizing exchange traded instruments, margin accounts or letters of credit. Additionally, our derivative contracts are mostly short-term in duration and we generally do not make use of credit-risk-related contingent features. No significant concentrations of credit risk existed at September 27, 2025.\nWe had the following aggregated outstanding notional amounts related to our derivative financial instruments (in millions, except soybean meal tons):\nMetric\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nCommodity:\nCorn\nBushels\n93\n \n29\n \nSoybean Meal\nTons\n1,221,711\n \n623,400\n \nLive Cattle\nPounds\n30\n \n136\n \nLean Hogs\nPounds\n828\n \n351\n \nForeign Currency\nUnited States dollar\n$\n208\n \n$\n245\n \nWe recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the exception of normal purchases and normal sales expected to result in physical delivery. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we designate the hedging instrument based upon the exposure being hedged (i.e., cash flow hedge or fair value hedge). We designate certain forward contracts as follows:\n•\nCash Flow Hedges – include certain commodity forward and option contracts of forecasted purchases (i.e., grains), interest rate swaps and locks, and certain foreign exchange forward contracts.\n•\nFair Value Hedges – include certain commodity forward contracts of firm commitments (i.e., livestock).\nCash Flow Hedges\nDerivative instruments are designated as hedges against changes in the amount of future cash flows related to procurement of certain commodities utilized in our production processes as well as interest rates to our variable rate debt. For the derivative instruments we designate and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Based on market prices as of September 27, 2025, we have net pretax losses of $\n20\n million for our commodity contracts, which are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months. Additionally, we have $\n9\n million of realized losses related to treasury rate locks in connection with the issuance of the 2026, 2029 and 2048 Notes, which will be reclassified to earnings over the lives of these notes. During fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, we did not reclassify significant pretax gains or losses into earnings as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges. \nThe following table sets forth the pretax impact of cash flow hedge derivative instruments recognized in Other Comprehensive Income (in millions):\nGain (Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives\n2025\n2024\n2023\nCash flow hedge - derivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nCommodity contracts\n$\n(\n44\n)\n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n—\n \nFair Value Hedges\nWe designate certain derivative contracts as fair value hedges of firm commitments to purchase livestock for harvest. Our objective of these hedges is to minimize the risk of changes in fair value created by fluctuations in commodity prices associated with fixed price livestock firm commitments. For these derivative instruments we designate and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings in the same period. We include the gain or loss on the hedged items (i.e., livestock purchase firm commitments) in the same line item, Cost of Sales, as the offsetting gain or loss on the related livestock forward position. Ineffectiveness related to our fair value hedges was not significant during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. \nThe carrying amount of fair value hedge (assets) liabilities as of fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were as follows (in millions): \nConsolidated Balance Sheets Classification\n2025\n2024\n2023\nInventories\n$\n65\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n16\n \n68\nUndesignated Positions\nIn addition to our designated positions, we also hold derivative contracts for which we do not apply hedge accounting. These include certain derivative instruments related to commodities price risk, including grains, livestock, energy and foreign currency risk. We mark these positions to fair value through earnings at each reporting date. \nReclassification to Earnings\nThe following table sets forth the total amounts of each income and expense line item presented in the Consolidated Statements of Income in which the effects of hedges are recorded for fiscal years ended 2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\nConsolidated Statements of Income Classification\n2025\n2024\n2023\nCost of Sales\n$\n50,879\n \n$\n49,682\n \n$\n50,250\n \nInterest Expense\n449\n \n481\n \n355\n \nOther, net\n(\n47\n)\n(\n75\n)\n(\n42\n)\nThe following table sets forth the pretax impact of the cash flow, fair value and undesignated derivative instruments in the Consolidated Statements of Income for fiscal years ended 2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\nConsolidated Statements of Income Classification\n2025\n2024\n2023\nCost of Sales\nGain (Loss) on cash flow hedges reclassified from OCI to Earnings:\nCommodity contracts\n$\n(\n33\n)\n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n—\n \nGain (Loss) on fair value hedges:\nCommodity contracts (a) \n(\n87\n)\n12\n \n(\n19\n)\nGain (Loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nCommodity contracts\n53\n \n(\n66\n)\n(\n98\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n67\n)\n$\n(\n55\n)\n$\n(\n117\n)\nInterest Expense\nGain (Loss) on cash flow hedges reclassified from OCI to Earnings:\nInterest rate contracts\n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n(\n2\n)\nOther, net\nGain (Loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n7\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n3\n \n(a) Amounts represent gains/(losses) on commodity contracts designated as fair value hedges of firm commitments that were realized during the period presented, which were offset by a corresponding gain/(loss) on the underlying hedged inventory.

The fair value hierarchy contains three levels as follows:\nLevel 1\n — Unadjusted quoted prices available in active markets for the identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date.\nLevel 2\n — Other observable inputs available at the measurement date, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, either directly or indirectly, including:\n•\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\n•\nQuoted prices for identical or similar assets in non-active markets;\n•\nInputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and\n•\nInputs derived principally from or corroborated by other observable market data.\nLevel 3 —\n Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management’s estimates of market participant assumptions.\n69\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. In instances where the inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the fair value measurement has been determined based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the significance of a particular item to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, including the consideration of inputs specific to the asset or liability. \nThe following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, our financial assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis, according to the valuation techniques we used to determine their fair values as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nSeptember 27, 2025\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nNetting (a)\nTotal\nOther Current Assets:\nDerivative financial instruments:\nDesignated as hedges\n$\n—\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n5\n \nUndesignated \n—\n \n113\n \n—\n \n(\n20\n)\n93\n \nAvailable for sale securities (current)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n— \n—\n \nOther Assets:\nAvailable for sale securities (non-current)\n—\n \n90\n \n27\n \n— \n117\n \nDeferred compensation assets\n21\n \n501\n \n—\n \n— \n522\n \nTotal Assets\n$\n21\n \n$\n710\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n(\n21\n)\n$\n737\n \nOther Current Liabilities:\nDerivative financial instruments:\nDesignated as hedges\n$\n—\n \n$\n82\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n82\n)\n$\n—\n \nUndesignated \n—\n \n135\n \n—\n \n(\n126\n)\n9\n \nTotal Liabilities\n$\n—\n \n$\n217\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n208\n)\n$\n9\n \nSeptember 28, 2024\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nNetting (a)\nTotal\nOther Current Assets:\nDerivative financial instruments:\nDesignated as hedges\n$\n—\n \n$\n15\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n13\n \nUndesignated\n—\n \n79\n \n—\n \n2\n \n81\n \nAvailable for sale securities (current)\n—\n \n10\n \n—\n \n— \n10\n \nOther Assets:\nAvailable for sale securities (non-current)\n—\n \n75\n \n28\n \n— \n103\n \nDeferred Compensation assets\n22\n \n461\n \n—\n \n— \n483\n \nTotal Assets\n$\n22\n \n$\n640\n \n$\n28\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n690\n \nOther Current Liabilities:\nDerivative financial instruments:\nDesignated as hedges\n$\n—\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n19\n)\n$\n—\n \nUndesignated\n—\n \n71\n \n—\n \n(\n35\n)\n36\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n—\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n54\n)\n$\n36\n \n(a) Our derivative assets and liabilities are presented in our Consolidated Balance Sheets on a net basis when a legally enforceable master netting arrangement exists between the counterparty to a derivative contract and us. Additionally, at September 27, 2025, and September 28, 2024, we had $\n187\n million and $\n54\n million, respectively, of net cash collateral posted with various counterparties where master netting arrangements exist and held no cash collateral.\n70\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between the beginning and ending balance of marketable debt securities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the table above that used significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n28\n \n$\n30\n \nTotal realized and unrealized gains (losses):\nIncluded in other comprehensive income (loss)\n—\n \n1\n \nPurchases\n9\n \n5\n \nSettlements\n(\n10\n)\n(\n8\n)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n27\n \n$\n28\n \nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument:\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nOur derivative financial instruments primarily include exchange-traded and over-the-counter contracts which are further described in Note 12: Derivative Financial Instruments. We record our derivative financial instruments at fair value using quoted market prices, adjusted where necessary for credit and non-performance risk and internal models that use readily observable market inputs as their basis, including current and forward market prices and rates. We classify these instruments in Level 2 when quoted market prices can be corroborated utilizing observable current and forward commodity market prices on active exchanges or observable market transactions.\nAvailable for Sale Securities\nOur investments in marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value based on pricing models and quoted market prices adjusted for credit and non-performance risk. Short-term investments with maturities of less than \n12\n months are included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and primarily include certificates of deposit and commercial paper. All other marketable debt securities are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and have maturities ranging up to \n44\n years. \nWe classify our investments in U.S. government, U.S. agency, certificates of deposit and commercial paper debt securities as Level 2 as fair value is generally estimated using discounted cash flow models that are primarily industry-standard models that consider various assumptions, including time value and yield curve as well as other readily available relevant economic measures. We classify certain corporate, asset-backed and other debt securities as Level 3 as there is limited activity or less observable inputs into valuation models, including current interest rates and estimated prepayment, default and recovery rates on the underlying portfolio or structured investment vehicle. Significant changes to assumptions or unobservable inputs in the valuation of our Level 3 instruments would not have a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table sets forth our available-for-sale securities’ amortized cost basis, fair value and unrealized gain (loss) by significant investment category as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nAmortized\nCost Basis\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nGain/(Loss)\nAmortized\nCost Basis\nFair\nValue\nUnrealized\nGain/(Loss)\nAvailable for Sale Securities:\nDebt Securities:\nUnited States Treasury and Agency\n$\n91\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n86\n \n$\n85\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\nCorporate and Asset-Backed\n27\n \n27\n \n—\n \n28\n \n28\n \n—\n \nUnrealized holding gains (losses), net of tax, are excluded from earnings and reported in OCI until the security is settled or sold. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate whether losses related to our available-for-sale securities are due to credit or non-credit factors. Losses on debt securities where we have the intent, or will more than likely be required, to sell the security prior to recovery, would be recorded as a direct write-off of amortized cost basis through earnings. Losses on debt securities where we do not have the intent, or would not more than likely be required to sell the security prior to recovery, would be further evaluated to determine whether the loss is credit or non-credit related. Credit-related losses would be recorded through an allowance for credit losses through earnings and non-credit related losses through OCI.\nWe consider many factors in determining whether a loss is credit-related, including the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, borrower repayment characteristics for asset-backed securities, and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. We recognized no direct write-offs or allowances for credit losses in earnings in fiscal 2025, 2024 or 2023.\n71\nDeferred Compensation Assets\nWe maintain non-qualified deferred compensation plans for certain executives and other highly compensated team members. Investments are generally maintained within a trust and include money market funds, mutual funds and life insurance policies. The cash surrender value of the life insurance policies is invested primarily in mutual funds. The investments are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices and are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We classify the investments which have observable market prices in active markets in Level 1 as these are generally publicly-traded mutual funds. The remaining deferred compensation assets are classified in Level 2 as fair value can be corroborated based on observable market data. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on deferred compensation are included in earnings.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, we record assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of impairment charges and, with respect to our equity investments without readily determinable fair values, recorded by applying the measurement alternative for which such investments are recorded at cost and adjusted for an observable price change in an orderly transaction for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. \nDuring fiscal 2025, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n343\n million in our Beef segment. We estimated the fair value utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flow method) valuation technique, which incorporated significant unobservable Level 3 inputs. Additionally, in fiscal 2025, we recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of $\n19\n million as a result of our decision to sell a storage facility. This charge was recorded in Cost of Sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income and was derived using Level 3 inputs, including management's estimate of the proceeds from the disposal of the asset. We also recorded impairment charges of $\n28\n million in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, related to our equity investments, including $\n24\n million accounted for under the equity method. These equity investments are included in Other Assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, do not have readily determinable fair values and were measured using a market approach which utilized Level 3 inputs.\nDuring fiscal 2024, we recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of $\n33\n million in Cost of Sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a result of our decision to sell our Netherlands facility. The charge was derived using Level 3 inputs and was driven by management's estimate of the potential proceeds from the disposal of the assets. In fiscal 2023, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $\n333\n million, $\n210\n million and $\n238\n million in our Beef and Chicken segments and International/Other, respectively. We estimated the fair value of our reporting units utilizing various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method) and another technique being a market approach (guideline public company method), which incorporated significant unobservable Level 3 inputs. We did not have any other significant measurements of assets or liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition during the twelve months ended September 27, 2025, September 28, 2024, or September 30, 2023.\nOther Financial Instruments\nFair value of our debt is principally estimated using Level 2 inputs based on quoted prices for those or similar instruments. Fair value and carrying value for our debt are as follows as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nSeptember 27, 2025\nSeptember 28, 2024\nFair\nValue\nCarrying\nValue\nFair\nValue\nCarrying\nValue\nTotal Debt\n$\n8,658\n \n$\n8,830\n \n$\n9,638\n \n$\n9,787\n \nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nOur financial instruments exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas. We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and generally do not require collateral. At September 27, 2025, and September 28, 2024, \n15.6\n% and \n15.5\n%, respectively, of our net accounts receivable balance was due from Walmart Inc. No other single customer or customer group represented greater than \n10\n% of net accounts receivable.\n72\nNOTE 14: \nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe issue shares under our stock-based compensation plans by issuing Class A stock from treasury. The total number of shares available for future grant under the Tyson Foods, Inc. 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (“Incentive Plan”) was \n8,769,043\n at September 27, 2025.\nStock Options\nShareholders approved the Incentive Plan in January 2001. The Incentive Plan is administered by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board of Directors (“Compensation Committee”). The Incentive Plan includes provisions for granting incentive stock options for shares of Class A stock at a price not less than the fair value at the date of grant. Nonqualified stock options may be granted at a price equal to or more than the fair value of Class A stock on the date the option is granted. Stock options under the Incentive Plan generally become exercisable ratably over \nthree years\n from the date of grant and must be exercised within \n10\n years from the date of grant. Our policy is to recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Forfeitures are recognized as they occur. \nShares Under\nOption\nWeighted\nAverage Exercise\nPrice Per Share\nWeighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (in Years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic Value\n(in millions)\nOutstanding, September 28, 2024\n7,114,663\n \n$\n64.02\n \nExercised\n(\n669,987\n)\n49.82\n \nForfeited or expired\n(\n623,291\n)\n66.64\n \nGranted\n1,648,774\n \n64.54\n \nOutstanding, September 27, 2025\n7,470,159\n \n$\n65.19\n \n6.4\n$\n9\n \nExercisable, September 27, 2025\n4,851,416\n \n$\n68.57\n \n5.2\n$\n4\n \nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of options granted in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $\n13.94\n, $\n12.70\n and $\n15.82\n, respectively. The fair value of each option grant is established on the date of grant using a binomial lattice method. We use historical volatility for a period of time comparable to the expected life of the option to determine volatility assumptions. Expected life is calculated based on the contractual term of each grant and takes into account the historical exercise and termination behavior of participants. Risk-free interest rates are based on the five-year Treasury bond rate. \nAssumptions used in the fair value calculation are as of the grant dates and are outlined in the following table.\n2025\n2024\n2023\nExpected life (in years)\n4.6\n4.5\n4.5\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.2\n \n%\n4.5\n \n%\n3.9\n \n%\nExpected volatility\n26.8\n \n%\n31.9\n \n%\n31.2\n \n%\nExpected dividend yield\n3.0\n \n%\n2.7\n \n%\n2.9\n \n%\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, net of income taxes, of $\n19\n million, $\n19\n million and $\n13\n million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The related tax benefit was $\n3\n million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. We had \n1.1\n million, \n1.1\n million and \n1.2\n million options vest in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with a grant date fair value of $\n16\n million, $\n15\n million and $\n18\n million, respectively.\nIn fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, we received cash of $\n21\n million, $\n14\n million and $\n11\n million, respectively, for the exercise of stock options. Shares are issued from treasury for stock option exercises. The related tax benefit realized from stock options exercised during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, was $\n2\n million, $\n1\n million and $\n1\n million, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, was $\n3\n million, $\n2\n million and $\n1\n million, respectively.\nAs of September 27, 2025, we had $\n11\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option plans that will be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.8\n years. \n73\nRestricted Stock\nWe issue restricted stock awards and units at the market value as of the date of grant, with restrictions expiring over periods through fiscal 2028. Beginning in fiscal 2025, we changed from granting restricted stock awards to restricted stock units which generally vest at a rate of one-third each year over a \nthree\n-year period from the date of the grant and have dividend equivalent provisions in which additional restricted stock units are issued upon the payment of dividends to Class A shareholders. The fair value of each restricted stock unit is determined using the Class A stock price on the date of the grant and unearned compensation is recognized ratably over the vesting period.\nNumber of \nShares or Units\nWeighted\nAverage Grant-\nDate Fair Value\nPer Share/Unit\nWeighted Average\nRemaining\nContractual Life\n(in Years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic Value\n(in millions)\nNonvested, September 28, 2024\n1,866,591\n \n$\n59.35\n \nGranted\n818,233\n \n63.49\n \nDividends\n65,562\n \n59.72\n \nVested\n(\n862,968\n)\n63.70\n \nForfeited\n(\n191,133\n)\n58.38\n \nNonvested, September 27, 2025\n1,696,285\n \n$\n59.26\n \n1.4\n$\n92\n \nAs of September 27, 2025, we had $\n35\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards and units that will be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.9\n years.\nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and units, net of income taxes, of $\n39\n million, $\n39\n million and $\n32\n million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The related tax benefit for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $\n8\n million, $\n9\n million and $\n9\n million, respectively. We had \n0.9\n million, \n0.6\n million and \n0.7\n million restricted stock awards and units vest in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, with a grant date fair value of $\n55\n million, $\n41\n million and $\n53\n million, respectively.\nPerformance-Based Shares\nWe award performance-based shares of our Class A stock to certain team members. These awards are typically granted once a year. Performance-based shares vest based upon the passage of time and the achievement of performance or market performance criteria, ranging from \n0\n% to \n200\n%, as determined by the Compensation Committee prior to the date of the award. Vesting periods for these awards are typically \nthree years\n. We review progress toward the attainment of the performance criteria each quarter during the vesting period. When it is probable the minimum performance criteria for an award will be achieved, we begin recognizing the expense equal to the proportionate share of the total fair value of the Class A stock price on the grant date. The total expense recognized over the duration of performance awards will equal the Class A stock price on the date of grant multiplied by the number of shares ultimately awarded based on the level of attainment of the performance criteria. For grants with market performance criteria, the fair value is determined on the grant date and is calculated using the same inputs for expected volatility, expected dividend yield, and risk-free rate as stock options, noted above, with a duration of \nthree years\n. The total expense recognized over the duration of the award will equal the fair value, regardless if the market performance criteria is met.\nThe following table summarizes the performance-based shares at the maximum award amounts based upon the respective performance share agreements. Actual shares that will vest depend on the level of attainment of the performance-based criteria. \nNumber of Shares\nWeighted\nAverage Grant-\nDate Fair Value\nPer Share\nWeighted Average\nRemaining\nContractual Life\n(in Years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic Value\n(in millions)\nNonvested, September 28, 2024\n2,375,302\n \n$\n46.57\n \nGranted\n993,144\n \n54.42\n \nVested\n(\n220,933\n)\n48.74\n \nForfeited\n(\n651,623\n)\n57.58\n \nNonvested, September 27, 2025\n2,495,890\n \n$\n46.63\n \n1.3\n$\n135\n \nWe recognized stock-based compensation expense related to performance shares, net of income taxes, of $\n28\n million, $\n25\n million and $\n2\n million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The related tax benefit was $\n3\n million for fiscal 2025, $\n4\n million for fiscal 2024, and inconsequential for fiscal 2023. As of September 27, 2025, we had $\n40\n million of total unrecognized compensation based upon our progress toward the attainment of criteria related to performance-based share awards that will be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.9\n years.\n74\nNOTE 15: \nPENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nWe have \nfour\n defined benefit pension plans consisting of \none\n frozen and noncontributory funded qualified plan and \nthree\n frozen unfunded non-qualified plans. The benefits provided under these plans are based on a formula using years of service and either a specified benefit rate or compensation level. The non-qualified defined benefit plans are for certain officers and use a formula based on years of service and final average salary. We also have other postretirement benefit plans for which substantially all of our team members may receive benefits if they satisfy applicable eligibility criteria. The postretirement healthcare plans are contributory with participants’ contributions adjusted when deemed necessary.\nAdditionally, we have defined contribution retirement programs for various groups of team members and recognized expenses of $\n114\n million, $\n111\n million and $\n113\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nWe use a fiscal year end measurement date for our defined benefit plans and other postretirement plans. We recognize the effect of actuarial gains and losses into earnings immediately for other postretirement plans rather than amortizing the effect over future periods. Other postretirement benefits include postretirement medical costs and life insurance. \nDuring fiscal 2024, we amended and discontinued one of the Company's other postretirement benefit plans which resulted in the recognition of a gain of $\n16\n million, recorded in Other, net in our Consolidated Statements of Income. \nBenefit Obligations and Funded Status\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations, assets and funded status as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 (in millions):\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement\nQualified\nNon-Qualified\nBenefits\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nChange in benefit obligation\nBenefit obligation at beginning of year\n$\n21\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n167\n \n$\n158\n \n$\n34\n \n$\n50\n \nService cost\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \n2\n \nInterest cost\n1\n \n1\n \n7\n \n9\n \n1\n \n1\n \nCurtailment gain\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n16\n)\nActuarial (gain)/loss\n(\n1\n)\n3\n \n(\n4\n)\n14\n \n(\n3\n)\n—\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nBenefit obligation at end of year\n20\n \n21\n \n156\n \n167\n \n31\n \n34\n \nChange in plan assets\nFair value of plan assets at beginning of year\n30\n \n27\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nActual return on plan assets\n1\n \n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEmployer contributions\n—\n \n—\n \n14\n \n14\n \n3\n \n3\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n3\n)\nFair value of plan assets at end of year\n30\n \n30\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nFunded status\n$\n10\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n(\n156\n)\n$\n(\n167\n)\n$\n(\n31\n)\n$\n(\n34\n)\nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 consist of (in millions):\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement\nQualified\nNon-Qualified\nBenefits\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nOther assets\n$\n10\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nOther current liabilities\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n14\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n8\n)\n(\n7\n)\nOther liabilities\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n142\n)\n(\n153\n)\n(\n23\n)\n(\n27\n)\nTotal assets (liabilities)\n$\n10\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n(\n156\n)\n$\n(\n167\n)\n$\n(\n31\n)\n$\n(\n34\n)\n75\nPre-tax amounts recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 consist of (in millions):\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement\nQualified\nNon-Qualified\nBenefits\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nAccumulated other comprehensive (income)/loss:\n   Actuarial (gain) loss\n$\n1\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4\n \n   Prior service (credit) cost\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n4\n)\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive (income)/loss:\n$\n1\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nWe had \nthree\n pension plans as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, that had an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets. \nPlans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets are as follows (in millions):\nPension Benefits\nQualified\nNon-Qualified\n2025\n2024\n2025\n2024\nProjected benefit obligation\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n156\n \n$\n167\n \nAccumulated benefit obligation\n—\n \n—\n \n156\n \n167\n \nFair value of plan assets\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all qualified pension plans was $\n20\n million and $\n21\n million at September 27, 2025, and September 28, 2024, respectively.\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost (Credit)\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost (credit) for pension and postretirement benefit plans recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income are as follows for fiscal years ended 2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement\nQualified\nNon-Qualified\nBenefits\n2025\n2024\n2023\n2025\n2024\n2023\n2025\n2024\n2023\nService cost\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n2\n \nInterest cost\n1\n \n1\n \n1\n \n7\n \n9\n \n8\n \n1\n \n1\n \n1\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n2\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAmortization of prior service cost\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \n1\n \n—\n \n4\n \n5\n \nRecognized actuarial loss (gain), net\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n3\n)\n1\n \n—\n \n(\n5\n)\nNet periodic benefit cost (credit)\n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n6\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n3\n \nAll of the components other than the service cost component were recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income in Other, net.

We then determined a long-term projected rate-of-return based on expected returns. Our discount rate assumptions used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflect the rates at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rates for our plans were determined using a cash flow matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, were applied to the benefit obligations to determine the appropriate discount rate. \nWe have \neight\n other postretirement benefit plans, of which \nfive\n are healthcare and life insurance related. \nTwo\n of these plans, with benefit obligations totaling $\n7\n million at September 27, 2025, were not impacted by healthcare cost trend rates as \none\n consists of fixed annual payments and \none\n is life insurance related. \nTwo\n of the healthcare plans, with benefit obligations less than $\n1\n million at September 27, 2025, were not impacted by healthcare cost trend rates due to previous plan amendments. The remaining plan, with benefit obligations less than $\n3\n million, at September 27, 2025, utilized assumed healthcare cost trend rates of \n8.9\n%. The healthcare cost trend rates for one of the plans will be grading down to an ultimate rate of \n4.5\n% in 2032. \nContributions\nOur policy is to fund at least the minimum contribution required to meet applicable federal employee benefit and local tax laws. In our sole discretion, we may from time to time fund additional amounts. Expected contributions to pension plans for fiscal 2026 are approximately $\n15\n million. For fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, we funded $\n14\n million, $\n14\n million and $\n13\n million, respectively, to pension plans.\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nThe following benefit payments are expected to be paid (in millions):\nPension Benefits\nOther Postretirement\nQualified\nNon-Qualified\nBenefits\n2026\n$\n1\n \n$\n14\n \n$\n2\n \n2027\n—\n \n14\n \n2\n \n2028\n1\n \n13\n \n2\n \n2029\n1\n \n13\n \n2\n \n2030\n1\n \n13\n \n2\n \n2031-2035\n4\n \n59\n \n7\n \nThe above benefit payments for other postretirement benefit plans are not expected to be offset by Medicare Part D subsidies in fiscal 2026.\nMulti-Employer Plan\nAdditionally, we participate in \none\n multi-employer plan that provides defined benefits to certain team members covered by collective bargaining agreements. Such plans are usually administered by a board of trustees composed of the management of the participating companies and labor representatives. \nThe risks of participating in multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans. Assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to team members of other participating employers. If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligation of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. If we stop participating in a plan, we may be required to pay that plan an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability. \n77\nThe net pension cost of the plan is equal to the annual contributions determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Contributions to the plan were $\n1\n million and $\n2\n million in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, respectively. Assets contributed to such plans are not segregated or otherwise restricted to provide benefits only to our team members. The future cost of the plans is dependent on a number of factors including the funded status of the plans and the ability of the other participating companies to meet ongoing funding obligations. \nOur participation in the multi-employer plan for fiscal 2025 is outlined below. The EIN/Pension Plan Number column provides the Employer Identification Number (“EIN”) and the three-digit plan number. The most recent Pension Protection Act (“PPA”) zone status available in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024 is for the plan’s year beginning January 1, 2025, and 2024, respectively. The zone status is based on information that we have received from the plan and is certified by the plan’s actuaries. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65 percent funded. Plans that are critical and declining status are projected to have an accumulated funding deficiency. The FIP/RP Status column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (“FIP”) or rehabilitation plan (“RP”) is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration date of the collective-bargaining agreement to which the plan is subject. \nIn addition to regular contributions, we could be obligated to pay additional contributions (known as complete or partial withdrawal liabilities) if it has unfunded vested benefits. \nPPA Zone Status\nFIP/RP Status\nContributions \n(in millions)\nSurcharge Imposed\nPension Fund Plan Name\nEIN/Pension Plan Number\n2025\n2024\nImplemented\n2025\n2024\n2023\n2025\nExpiration Date of Collective Bargaining Agreement\nBakery and Confectionery Union and Industry International Pension Fund\n52-6118572/001\nRed\nRed\nNov 2012\n$\n1\n$\n2\n$\n2\n10\n%\n2027-08-01\n78\nNOTE 16: \nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 are as follows (in millions):\n \n2025\n2024\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes:\nUnrealized net hedging loss\n$\n(\n22\n)\n$\n(\n15\n)\nUnrealized net gain (loss) on investments\n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nCurrency translation adjustment\n(\n170\n)\n(\n152\n)\nPostretirement benefits reserve adjustments\n2\n \n(\n2\n)\nTotal accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n(\n191\n)\n$\n(\n170\n)\nThe before and after tax changes in the components of other comprehensive income (loss) are as follows for fiscal years ended 2025, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\n2025\n2024\n2023\nBefore Tax\nTax\nAfter Tax\nBefore Tax\nTax\nAfter Tax\nBefore Tax\nTax\nAfter Tax\nDerivatives accounted for as cash flow hedges:\n(Gain) loss reclassified to interest expense\n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2\n \n(Gain) loss reclassified to cost of sales\n33\n \n(\n9\n)\n24\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nUnrealized gain (loss)\n(\n44\n)\n11\n \n(\n33\n)\n(\n9\n)\n2\n \n(\n7\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nInvestments:\nUnrealized gain (loss)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n5\n \n(\n1\n)\n4\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \nCurrency translation:\nTranslation adjustment \n(a)\n(\n9\n)\n2\n \n(\n7\n)\n103\n \n(\n3\n)\n100\n \n29\n \n—\n \n29\n \nTranslation loss reclassified to cost of sales\n3\n \n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPostretirement benefits:\nUnrealized gain (loss)\n5\n \n(\n1\n)\n4\n \n(\n12\n)\n3\n \n(\n9\n)\n6\n \n(\n1\n)\n5\n \nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)\n$\n(\n10\n)\n$\n3\n \n$\n(\n7\n)\n$\n89\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n38\n \n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n37\n \n(a) Before and after tax translation adjustment for the twelve months ended September 28, 2024 included $\n14\n million of Comprehensive Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest.

Includes $\n156\n million of a legal contingency accrual for the Chicken segment for the fiscal year 2023.\nOur largest customer, Walmart Inc., accounted for \n18.7\n%, \n18.4\n% and \n18.6\n% of consolidated sales in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Sales to Walmart Inc. were included in all the segments. Any extended discontinuance of sales to this customer could, if not replaced, have a material impact on our operations.\nThe majority of our operations are domiciled in the United States. Approximately \n95\n% of sales to external customers for each of fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were sourced from the United States. At September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, intangibles, financial instruments and deferred tax assets, located in the United States were approximately $\n9.5\n billion and $\n9.5\n billion, respectively, and approximately $\n0.7\n billion and $\n0.8\n billion, respectively, were located in foreign locations, primarily Brazil, China, New Zealand, Malaysia, the Middle East and Thailand.\nWe sell certain products in foreign markets, primarily Canada, Central America, China, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, the Middle East, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. Our export sales from the United States totaled $\n4.8\n billion, $\n5.2\n billion and $\n5.1\n billion for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Substantially all of our export sales are facilitated through unaffiliated brokers, marketing associations and foreign sales offices. Sales of products produced in a country other than the United States were less than \n10\n% of consolidated sales for each of fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. \nThe following tables further disaggregate our sales to customers by major distribution channels (in millions):\nTwelve months ended September 27, 2025\nRetail\n(a)\nFoodservice\n(b)\nInternational\n(c)\nIndustrial and Other\n(d)\nTotal External Customers\nIntersegment\nTotal\nBeef\n$\n10,920\n \n$\n5,786\n \n$\n2,249\n \n$\n2,150\n \n$\n21,105\n \n$\n518\n \n$\n21,623\n \nPork\n1,880\n \n548\n \n1,186\n \n767\n \n4,381\n \n1,400\n \n5,781\n \nChicken\n6,942\n \n6,660\n \n1,104\n \n2,028\n \n16,734\n \n103\n \n16,837\n \nPrepared Foods\n5,788\n \n3,636\n \n242\n \n264\n \n9,930\n \n—\n \n9,930\n \nInternational/Other\n—\n \n—\n \n2,291\n \n—\n \n2,291\n \n—\n \n2,291\n \nIntersegment\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n(\n2,021\n)\n(\n2,021\n)\nTotal\n$\n25,530\n \n$\n16,630\n \n$\n7,072\n \n$\n5,209\n \n$\n54,441\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n54,441\n \nTwelve months ended September 28, 2024\nRetail\n(a)\nFoodservice\n(b)\nInternational\n(c)\nIndustrial and Other\n(d)\nTotal External Customers\nIntersegment\nTotal\nBeef\n$\n9,915\n \n$\n5,215\n \n$\n2,659\n \n$\n2,245\n \n$\n20,034\n \n$\n445\n \n$\n20,479\n \nPork\n1,804\n \n498\n \n1,364\n \n1,078\n \n4,744\n \n1,159\n \n5,903\n \nChicken\n6,994\n \n6,432\n \n957\n \n1,944\n \n16,327\n \n98\n \n16,425\n \nPrepared Foods\n5,794\n \n3,629\n \n225\n \n203\n \n9,851\n \n—\n \n9,851\n \nInternational/Other\n—\n \n—\n \n2,353\n \n—\n \n2,353\n \n—\n \n2,353\n \nIntersegment\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n(\n1,702\n)\n(\n1,702\n)\nTotal\n$\n24,507\n \n$\n15,774\n \n$\n7,558\n \n$\n5,470\n \n$\n53,309\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n53,309\n \nTwelve months ended September 30, 2023\nRetail\n(a)\nFoodservice\n(b)\nInternational\n(c)\nIndustrial and Other\n(d)\nTotal External Customers\nIntersegment\nTotal\nBeef\n$\n8,947\n \n$\n4,839\n \n$\n2,633\n \n$\n2,395\n \n$\n18,814\n \n$\n511\n \n$\n19,325\n \nPork\n1,677\n \n477\n \n1,235\n \n1,338\n \n4,727\n \n1,041\n \n5,768\n \nChicken\n7,483\n \n6,589\n \n1,007\n \n1,901\n \n16,980\n \n80\n \n17,060\n \nPrepared Foods\n5,795\n \n3,690\n \n213\n \n147\n \n9,845\n \n—\n \n9,845\n \nInternational/Other\n—\n \n—\n \n2,515\n \n—\n \n2,515\n \n—\n \n2,515\n \nIntersegment\n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n(\n1,632\n)\n(\n1,632\n)\nTotal\n$\n23,902\n \n$\n15,595\n \n$\n7,603\n \n$\n5,781\n \n$\n52,881\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n52,881\n \n(a) Includes external sales to consumer products and food retailers, such as grocery retailers, warehouse club stores, and internet-based retailers.\n(b) Includes external sales to foodservice distributors, restaurant operators, hotel chains and noncommercial foodservice establishments such as schools, convenience stores, healthcare facilities and the military.\n(c) Includes external sales to international markets related to internationally produced products and export sales of domestically produced products.\n83\n(d) Includes external sales to industrial food processing companies that further process our product to sell to end consumers and any remaining sales not included in the Retail, Foodservice or International categories.

Tyson Revocable Trust (for which Mr. John H. Tyson, Chairman of the Company, is a trustee), Berry Street Waste Water Treatment Plant, LP (\n90\n% of which is owned by the TLP), and the sisters of Mr. Tyson. As of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, one lease was classified as a finance lease with a debt balance of $\n6\n million which is primarily recognized as Long-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The other lease was classified as an operating lease with a lease liability balance of $\n1\n million and $\n1\n million as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively, which is primarily recognized within Other Liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Total payments of approximately $\n1\n million in each of fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were paid to lease the facilities.\nAs of September 27, 2025, the TLP, of which John H. Tyson and director Barbara Tyson are general partners, owned \n70\n million shares, or \n99.987\n% of our outstanding Class B stock and, along with the members of the Tyson family, owned \n7.2\n million shares of Class A stock, giving it control of approximately \n71.94\n% of the total voting power of our outstanding voting stock. \nIn fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company provided administrative services to the TLP, the beneficial owner of \n70\n million shares of Class B stock, and the TLP, through TLP Investment, L.P., reimbursed the Company $\n0.4\n million in fiscal 2025, and $\n0.2\n million in each of fiscal 2024 and 2023.\nIn fiscal 2025, the Company sold fourteen pieces of artwork from its offices to North Ark Bahamas, LLC, an entity owned by John H. Tyson, John R. Tyson and Olivia L. Tyson, for the aggregate price of $\n0.2\n million.\nIn fiscal 2024, the Company purchased real estate located in Springdale, Arkansas for $\n0.8\n million from TBB Land Holdings LLC. TBB Land Holdings LLC is wholly owned by John H. Tyson.\nNOTE 20: \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nCommitments\nWe guarantee obligations of certain outside third parties, consisting primarily of grower loans, which are substantially collateralized by the underlying assets. The remaining terms of the underlying obligations cover periods up to 7 years, and the maximum potential amount of future payments as of September 27, 2025, was \nnot\n significant. The likelihood of material payments under these guarantees is not considered probable. At September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, \nno\n significant liabilities for guarantees were recorded.\nWe have cash flow assistance programs in which certain livestock suppliers participate. Under these programs, we pay an amount for livestock equivalent to a standard cost to grow such livestock during periods of low market sales prices. The amounts of such payments that are in excess of the market sales price are recorded as receivables and accrue interest. Participating suppliers are obligated to repay these receivables balances when market sales prices exceed this standard cost, or upon termination of the agreement. Our maximum commitment associated with these programs is limited to the fair value of each participating livestock supplier’s net tangible assets. The potential maximum obligation as of September 27, 2025, was approximately $\n240\n million. At September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, we did \nnot\n have significant net receivables outstanding under these programs.\nWhen constructing new facilities or making major enhancements to existing facilities, we will occasionally enter into incentive agreements with local government agencies in order to reduce certain state and local tax expenditures. These funds are generally considered restricted cash, which is reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other Assets. We had \nno\n deposits at September 27, 2025 or September 28, 2024. Additionally, under certain agreements, we transfer the related assets to various local government entities and receive Industrial Revenue Bonds. We immediately lease the facilities from the local government entities and have an option to re-purchase the facilities for a nominal amount upon tendering the Industrial Revenue Bonds to the local government entities at various predetermined dates. The Industrial Revenue Bonds and the associated obligations for the leases of the facilities offset, and the underlying assets remain in property, plant and equipment. At September 27, 2025, total amounts under these types of arrangements totaled $\n845\n million.\n84\nAdditionally, we enter into other purchase commitments for various items such as grains, livestock contracts and variable livestock grower commitments that are estimable and have a remaining term in excess of one year, which as of September 27, 2025 were (in millions):\nPurchase Obligations\n2026\n$\n556\n \n2027\n509\n \n2028\n357\n \n2029\n313\n \n2030\n288\n \n2031 and beyond\n3,245\n \nTotal\n$\n5,268\n \nContingencies\nIn the normal course of business, we are involved in various claims, lawsuits, investigations and legal proceedings, including those specifically identified below. Each quarter, we determine whether to accrue for loss contingencies based on our assessment of whether the potential loss is probable, reasonably possible or remote and to the extent a loss is probable, whether it is reasonably estimable. We record accruals in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements for matters that we conclude are probable and the financial impact is reasonably estimable. The Company further determines whether a range of possible loss, if any, in excess of the recorded accrual is reasonably estimable. Regardless of the manner of resolution, frequently the most significant changes in the status of a matter may occur over a short time period, often following a lengthy period of little substantive activity. While these accruals reflect the Company’s best estimate of the probable loss for those matters as of the dates of those accruals, the recorded amounts may differ materially from the actual amount of the losses for those matters. Listed below are certain claims made against the Company for which the magnitude of the potential exposure could be material to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nBroiler Antitrust Civil Litigation and Related Matters\nBeginning in September 2016, a series of putative federal class action lawsuits styled\n In re Broiler Chicken Antitrust Litigation\n (the “Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation”) were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against us and certain of our poultry subsidiaries, as well as several other poultry processing companies and Agri Stats, Inc. (\"Agri Stats\"), an information service provider. As described below, the Company reached agreements to settle all outstanding claims brought against it by the putative classes, and the Court has granted final approval to these settlements.\nCertain putative class members chose to opt out of the classes and pursue individual claims against the Company and other defendants in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The operative complaints allege that beginning in January 2008, the defendants conspired and combined to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize the price of broiler chickens and that the defendants manipulated and artificially inflated the Georgia Dock price index. The plaintiffs further allege that the defendants concealed this conduct from the plaintiffs and the members of the putative classes. The plaintiffs seek treble damages, injunctive relief, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees under the United States antitrust laws and various state unfair competition laws, consumer protection laws, and unjust enrichment common laws.\nThe Court divided the case into two tracks. Plaintiffs electing to proceed in the first track (“Track One”) chose to forego claims relating to the DOJ criminal investigation described below. Plaintiffs electing to proceed in the second track (“Track Two”) could pursue those claims but needed to wait until the completion of the Track One proceedings before doing so.\nThe first trial in this matter, which involved claims brought by the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class and certain direct-action plaintiffs, began on September 12, 2023 and concluded with a jury verdict in favor of the defendant on October 25, 2023. The Company did not participate in the first trial because it had previously settled all of the claims brought by the plaintiffs that participated in that trial. The second and third scheduled trials in this matter, which were to involve claims brought by the Commercial and Institutional Indirect Purchaser Class and the End-User Consumer Plaintiff Class, respectively, were scheduled to begin in March 2024 and September 2024, respectively. Both of these trials were cancelled because all claims brought by these classes were resolved before trial. This completed the Track One proceedings.\nOn February 11, 2025, the Court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the allegations brought by the Track Two plaintiffs. On March 7, 2025, the Court lifted the stay of discovery that had applied to the Track Two claims, with fact discovery currently ongoing. The Court entered a case schedule under which the first Track Two trial will begin on April 5, 2027. \n85\nSettlements\nOn January 19, 2021, we announced that we had reached agreements to settle certain class claims related to the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation. Settlement terms were reached with the putative Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class, the putative Commercial and Institutional Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff Class and the putative End-User Plaintiff Class (collectively, the “Classes”). Under the terms of the settlements, we agreed to pay the Classes an aggregate amount of $\n221.5\n million in settlement of all outstanding claims brought by the Classes. On June 29, 2021, December 20, 2021 and April 18, 2022, the Court granted final approval to the settlements with the Direct Purchaser Plaintiff Class, the End-User Plaintiff Class and the Commercial and Institutional Indirect Purchaser Plaintiff Class, respectively. The foregoing settlements do not settle claims made by plaintiffs who have opted out of the Classes in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation. \nWe are currently pursuing settlement discussions with the remaining opt-out plaintiffs with respect to the remaining claims. While we do not admit any liability as part of the settlements, we believe that the settlements we have entered into have been in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation.\nGovernment Investigations\nU.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) Antitrust Division\n. On June 21, 2019, the DOJ filed a motion to intervene and sought a limited stay of discovery in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation, which the court granted in part. Subsequently, we received a grand jury subpoena from the DOJ seeking additional documents and information related to the chicken industry. On June 2, 2020, a grand jury for the District of Colorado returned an indictment charging four individual executives employed by two other poultry processing companies with conspiracy to engage in bid-rigging in violation of federal antitrust laws. On June 10, 2020, we announced that we uncovered information in connection with the grand jury subpoena that we had previously self-reported to the DOJ and have been cooperating with the DOJ as part of our application for leniency under the DOJ’s Corporate Leniency Program. Subsequently, the DOJ announced indictments against additional individuals, as well as other poultry processing companies, alleging a conspiracy to fix prices and rig bids for broiler chicken products from at least 2012 until at least early 2019. None of these indictments remain pending. In August 2021, the Company was granted conditional leniency by the DOJ for the matters we self-reported, which means that provided the Company continues to cooperate with the DOJ, neither the Company nor any of our cooperating employees will face prosecution or criminal fines or penalties. We continue to cooperate with the DOJ in connection with the ongoing federal antitrust investigation.\nState Attorney General Matters\n. The Offices of the Attorneys General in Washington, New Mexico and Alaska have filed complaints against us and certain of our poultry subsidiaries, as well as several other poultry processing companies and Agri Stats based on allegations similar to those asserted in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation. These complaints alleged violations of state antitrust, unfair trade practice, and unjust enrichment laws. We are cooperating with various state governmental agencies and officials, including the Offices of the Attorneys General for Florida and Louisiana, investigating or otherwise seeking information, testimony and/or documents, regarding the conduct alleged in the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation and related matters. In October 2022, we reached an agreement to settle all claims with the Washington Attorney General, and the court entered a consent decree on October 24, 2022. On February 16, 2024, the Company and the State of Alaska filed a stipulation and proposed consent decree reflecting a settlement of the claims against the Company asserted by the Office of the Attorney General of Alaska. The court approved this settlement on April 24, 2024. On April 19, 2024, the Company and the State of New Mexico filed a proposed consent judgment reflecting a settlement of the claims against the Company asserted by the Office of the Attorney General of New Mexico. The Court approved this settlement on July 23, 2024. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims that have been made, we believe that these settlements are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation. \nThe Company recorded aggregate legal contingency accruals of $\n156\n million and $\n545\n million in fiscal years 2023 and 2021, respectively. During fiscal years \n2025,\n \n2024 and 2023\n, the Company reduced its total recorded legal contingency accrual by $\n22\n million, $\n98\n million and $\n94\n million, respectively, for amounts it had paid related to these matters. At \nSeptember 27, 2025\n and \nSeptember 28, 2024\n, the legal contingency accrual for claims related to the Broiler Antitrust Civil Litigation matters described above was $\n64\n million and $\n86\n million, respectively. The Company does not believe that a range of possible loss, if any, in excess of the recorded accrual is reasonably estimable at this time.\n86\nBroiler Chicken Grower Litigation and Investigation\nOn January 27, 2017 and March 26, 2017, putative class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our poultry subsidiaries, as well as several other vertically integrated poultry processing companies, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma styled \nIn re Broiler Chicken Grower Litigation\n. The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that the defendants colluded not to compete for broiler raising services “with the purpose and effect of fixing, maintaining, and/or stabilizing grower compensation below competitive levels.” The plaintiffs also alleged that the defendants “agreed to share detailed data on [g]rower compensation with one another, with the purpose and effect of artificially depressing [g]rower compensation below competitive levels.” The plaintiffs contended these alleged acts constitute violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act and Section 202 of the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921. The plaintiffs sought treble damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees on behalf of the putative class. Additional named plaintiffs filed similar class action complaints in federal district courts in North Carolina, Colorado, Kansas and California. All actions were subsequently consolidated in the Eastern District of Oklahoma. In June 2021, we reached an agreement to settle with the putative class of broiler chicken farmers all claims raised in this consolidated action on terms not material to the Company. The Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on August 23, 2021 and final approval on February 18, 2022, and the Company paid the settlement during fiscal 2022. On July 1, 2025, a similar class of growers filed a putative class action complaint in the same federal district court against certain poultry processing companies not named as defendants in the Broiler Chicken Grower Litigation and arising from a similar set of allegations. The Company is not a defendant in this case and does not expect to be named as a defendant.\nIn October 2022, the DOJ’s Antitrust Division opened a civil investigation into broiler chicken grower contracts and alleged non-competitive practices involving performance-based compensation sharing for the purpose of stabilizing compensation below competitive levels. We continue to cooperate with the investigation. The Company has not recorded any liability for this matter as it does not believe a loss is probable, nor does it believe that a range of possible loss, if any, is reasonably estimable at this time.\nPork Antitrust Litigation \nBeginning June 18, 2018, a series of putative class action complaints were filed against us and certain of our pork subsidiaries, as well as several other pork processing companies, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota styled \nIn re Pork Antitrust Litigation\n (the “Pork Antitrust Civil Litigation”). The plaintiffs allege, among other things, that beginning in January 2009, the defendants conspired and combined to fix, raise, maintain, and stabilize the price of pork and pork products in violation of federal antitrust laws. The complaints on behalf of the putative classes of indirect purchasers also include causes of action under various state unfair competition laws, consumer protection laws, and unjust enrichment common laws. The plaintiffs seek treble damages, injunctive relief, pre- and post-judgment interest, costs, and attorneys’ fees on behalf of the putative classes. Since the original filing, certain putative class members have opted out of the matter and are proceeding with individual direct actions making similar claims, and others may try to do so in the future.\nThe Offices of the Attorney General in New Mexico and Alaska have filed complaints against us and certain of our pork subsidiaries, as well as several other pork processing companies and Agri Stats. The complaints are based on allegations similar to those asserted in the Pork Antitrust Civil Litigation and allege violations of state antitrust, unfair trade practice, and unjust enrichment laws based on allegations of conspiracies to exchange information and manipulate the supply of pork. On October 18, 2024, we reached a settlement with the State of Alaska to resolve all claims made against the Company for an immaterial amount. The court approved the settlement on January 7, 2025. On May 9, 2025, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the State of New Mexico to resolve all claims made against the Company for an immaterial amount. This agreement remains subject to Court approval. While the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims that have been made, we believe that this settlement is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we filed and joined motions for summary judgment. On March 31, 2025, the court denied those summary judgment motions as to the claims against the Company. The Company anticipates multiple trials in this matter in various federal districts, with various classes of plaintiffs as well as opt-out plaintiffs, with the first trial expected to begin in fiscal 2026. While we believe we have valid and meritorious defenses to the claims that have been made in the Pork Antitrust Civil Litigation and the related Attorney General matters, we are exploring the possibility of entering into settlements as a way to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation. On April 11, 2025, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the direct purchase class plaintiffs to settle their claims in this matter for an aggregate of $\n50\n million. On April 28, 2025, the Court granted preliminary approval of this settlement. On September 25, 2025, the Company reached an agreement with the consumer indirect purchaser class to settle their claims in this matter for an aggregate of $\n85\n million, subject to court approval.\nThe Company recorded aggregate legal contingency accruals of $\n380\n million and $\n45\n million in fiscal years \n2025\n and 2024, respectively. During fiscal \n2025\n, the Company reduced its total recorded legal contingency accrual by $\n50\n million for amounts it had paid related to these matters. At\n September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, the legal contingency accrual for claims related to\n the Pork Antitrust Civil Litigation matter described above was $\n268\n million and $\n45\n million, respectively\n. \nThe Company does not believe that a range of possible loss, if any, in excess of the recorded accrual is reasonably estimable at this time. However, \nif facts and circumstances of the matter or assumptions based on present conditions used to determine our estimated liability were to significantly change, we may be exposed to additional material losses.\n87\nBeef Antitrust Litigation and Related Matters\nBeginning on April 23, 2019, a series of class action complaints were filed against us and our beef and pork subsidiary, Tyson Fresh Meats, Inc. (“Tyson Fresh Meats”), as well as other beef packer defendants, in various federal district courts, including the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, and the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, by putative classes of direct purchasers, cattle ranchers, indirect purchasers, and indirect cattle producers. The putative classes in these cases allege that the defendants engaged in one or more conspiracies beginning in roughly January 2015 with the aim of reducing fed cattle prices, manipulating the price of live cattle futures and options traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, artificially increasing the cost of beef, and reducing the price of cows, cattle, calves, steers or heifers. The putative classes allege that this conduct violated federal antitrust laws, the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921, the Commodities Exchange Act, and various state unfair competition, consumer protection, and unjust enrichment laws. Their complaints seek, among other things, treble monetary damages, punitive damages, restitution, and pre- and post-judgment interest, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. Since the original filing, certain putative class members have opted out of the matter and are proceeding with individual direct actions making similar claims, and others may do so in the future. These cases have been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota for pretrial purposes. The fact discovery phase ended in early April 2025, and the parties are now engaged in expert discovery. Additionally, the putative classes filed motions for class certification on September 25, 2024, which remain pending before the court. On September 29, 2025, the Company reached an agreement with the consumer indirect purchaser plaintiff class to settle their claims in this matter for an aggregate of $\n55\n million, subject to court approval.\nOn February 18, 2022, a putative class action was commenced against us, Tyson Fresh Meats, and other beef packer defendants in the Supreme Court of British Columbia styled \nBui v. Cargill, Incorporated et al.\n The putative class is comprised of direct and indirect beef purchasers in Canada between January 1, 2015 and the present, and alleges that the defendants conspired to fix, maintain, increase, or control the price of beef, as well as to fix, maintain, control, prevent, or lessen the production or supply of beef. The complaint alleges a violation of the Competition Act, civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, and a violation of the Civil Code of Québec. It seeks declarations regarding the alleged conspiracy, general damages, aggravated, exemplary, and punitive damages, injunctive relief, costs, and interest.\n \nOn March 24, 2022, a putative class action was commenced against the same defendants in the Superior Court of Québec styled \nDe Bellefeuille v. Cargill, Incorporated et al, \nraising\n substantially similar allegations and seeking compensatory damages, costs of investigation and interest. \nWhile we believe we have valid and meritorious defenses to the claims that have been made in the Beef Antitrust Civil Litigation and related matters, we are also exploring opportunities to reach settlements if it would be in the best interest of the Company, as doing so could avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation. \nOn May 22, 2020, December 23, 2020 and October 29, 2021, we received civil investigative demands (“CIDs”) from the DOJ’s Civil Antitrust Division. The CIDs requested information related to the fed cattle and beef packing markets. We have cooperated with the DOJ with respect to the CIDs. The Offices of the Attorney General for multiple states participated in the investigation and coordinated with the DOJ. \nAccordingly, during \nfiscal 2025, we recorded a legal contingency accrual of $\n318\n million for claims related to the Beef Antitrust Civil Litigation matter, which remains outstanding as of September 27, 2025. \nThe Company does not believe that a range of possible loss, if any, in excess of the recorded accrual is reasonably estimable at this time. However, \nif facts and circumstances of the matter or assumptions based on present conditions used to determine our estimated liability were to significantly change, we may be exposed to additional material losses.\nWage Rate Litigation and Related Matters\nPoultry. \nOn August 30, 2019, a putative class of non-supervisory production and maintenance employees at chicken processing plants in the continental United States filed class action complaints against us and certain of our subsidiaries, as well as several other poultry processing companies, in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants directly and through a wage survey and benchmarking service exchanged information regarding labor rates in an effort to depress and fix the rates of wages for non-supervisory production and maintenance workers in violation of federal antitrust laws. Additional lawsuits making similar allegations were consolidated including an amended consolidated complaint containing additional allegations concerning turkey processing plants naming additional defendants. On May 10, 2024 and June 3, 2024, the Company participated in mediation with the putative class plaintiffs. Following the mediation, on June 14, 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the putative class plaintiffs to settle all claims in the case for an aggregate amount of $\n115.5\n million. On February 11, 2025, the court entered an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement. If the court grants final approval to the settlement, it will completely resolve all claims made against the Company in this matter. While we believe we have valid and meritorious defenses against the allegations, we believe that the proposed settlement is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation. During fiscal \n2025, settlement payments of the accrued amount were paid as a result of the preliminary court approval\n. At \nSeptember 27, 2025, there was \nno\n remaining accrual re\nlated to\n the Poultry wage rate litigation matter described above\n.\n88\nThe DOJ’s Antitrust Division has opened a civil investigation into human resources at several poultry companies. We are cooperating with the investigation. The Company has not recorded any liability for this matter as it does not believe a loss is probable, nor does it believe that a range of possible loss, if any, is reasonably estimable at this time.\nFresh Meats.\n On November 11, 2022, a putative class of employees at beef-processing and pork-processing plants in the continental United States filed a class action complaint against us and certain of our subsidiaries, as well as several other beef-processing and pork-processing companies, in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants directly and through a wage survey and benchmarking service exchanged information regarding labor rates in an effort to depress and fix the rates of wages for employees in violation of federal antitrust laws. \nOn December 22, 2023, after a mediation between the parties, the Company and the putative class plaintiffs reached an in-principle agreement to settle. While we believe we have valid and meritorious defenses against the allegations, we believe that the proposed settlement is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to avoid the uncertainty, risk, expense and distraction of protracted litigation. Under the terms of the settlement, the Company agreed to pay the putative class an aggregate amount of $\n72.5\n million to completely resolve all claims made against the Company in this matter. The court approved the settlement on January 15, 2025. During fiscal \n2024\n, the Company recorded an accrual for the $\n72.5\n million settlement which was paid during fiscal \n2025\n as a result of the court approval.\nOther Matters\nOur subsidiary, The Hillshire Brands Company (formerly named Sara Lee Corporation), is a party to a consolidation of cases filed by individual complainants with the Republic of the Philippines, Department of Labor and Employment and the National Labor Relations Commission (“NLRC”) from 1998 through July 1999. The complaint was filed against Aris Philippines, Inc., Sara Lee Corporation, Sara Lee Philippines, Inc., Fashion Accessories Philippines, Inc., and Attorney Cesar C. Cruz (collectively, the “respondents”). The complaint alleges, among other things, that the respondents engaged in unfair labor practices in connection with the termination of manufacturing operations in the Philippines in 1995 by Aris Philippines, Inc., a former subsidiary of The Hillshire Brands Company. In late 2004, a labor arbiter ruled against the respondents and awarded the complainants approximately $\n59\n million in damages and fees. From 2004 through 2014, the parties filed numerous appeals, motions for reconsideration and petitions for review, certain of which remained outstanding for several years. On December 15, 2016, we learned that the NLRC rendered its decision on November 29, 2016, regarding the respondents’ appeals from the labor arbiter’s 2004 ruling in favor of the complainants. The NLRC increased the award for \n4,922\n of the total \n5,984\n complainants to approximately $\n255\n million. However, the NLRC approved a prior settlement reached with the group comprising approximately \n18\n% of the class of \n5,984\n complainants, pursuant to which The Hillshire Brands Company agreed to pay each settling complainant approximately $\n1,200\n. The parties filed numerous appeals, motions for reconsideration and petitions for review related to the NLRC award and settlement payment. The Court of Appeals of the Philippines subsequently vacated the NLRC’s award on April 12, 2018. Complainants filed motions for reconsideration with the Court of Appeals which were denied. Claimants have since filed petitions for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court of the Philippines, which have been accepted. The Company continues to maintain an accrual in an immaterial amount for estimated probable losses for this matter in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not believe that a range of possible loss, if any, in excess of the\nrecorded accrual is reasonably estimable at this time.\nVarious claims have been asserted against the Company, its subsidiaries, and its officers and agents by, and on behalf of, team members who claim to have contracted COVID-19 in our facilities. The Company has not recorded any liability for these matters as it does not believe a loss is probable, nor does it believe that a range of possible loss, if any, is reasonably estimable at this time, because it believes the allegations in the claims are without merit and that the Company has valid and meritorious defenses against the allegations.\nFor a tax-related matter involving the Company, refer to Part II, Item 8. Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10: Income Taxes.\n89\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Tyson Foods, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Tyson Foods, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, and the related consolidated statements of income, of comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2025, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2025 appearing under Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n90\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nInterim Goodwill Impairment Assessment – Beef Reporting Unit\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance was $9,469 million as of September 27, 2025. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If it is determined, based on qualitative factors, the fair value of the reporting unit may more likely than not be less than carrying amount, a quantitative impairment test would be required. Management estimates the fair value of reporting units considering the use of various valuation techniques, with the primary technique being an income approach (discounted cash flow method). Management includes assumptions about sales growth, operating margins, discount rates and valuation multiples which consider budgets, business plans, economic projections and marketplace data. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company’s Beef reporting unit experienced lower than anticipated supply of market-ready cattle and an increased carrying value primarily associated with higher cattle costs. Management determined the fair value of the Beef reporting unit was more likely than not less than the carrying value and performed a quantitative assessment. Based on the quantitative assessment, the Company recognized a $343 million impairment to fully impair its remaining goodwill.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the interim goodwill impairment assessment of the Beef reporting unit are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the reporting unit; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to sales growth, operating margin, and discount rate, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s interim goodwill impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the Beef reporting unit. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the Beef reporting unit; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method used by management; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the discounted cash flow method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to sales growth, operating margin, and discount rate. Evaluating management’s assumptions related to sales growth and operating margin involved evaluating whether the assumptions used were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the reporting unit; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the discounted cash flow method and (ii) the reasonableness of the sales growth and discount rate assumptions. \n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nSpringdale, Arkansas\nNovember 10, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2009.\nITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE\nNot applicable.\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nAn evaluation was performed, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “1934 Act”)). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that, as of September 27, 2025, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\n91\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Our internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025. In making this assessment, we used criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework \n(2013). Based on this evaluation under the framework in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by COSO, management concluded the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 27, 2025.\nThe Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who has audited the fiscal 2025 financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, has also audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2025 as stated in its report which appears in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the 1934 Act) during the quarter ended September 27, 2025 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nITEM 9B.
