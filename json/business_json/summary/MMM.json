The Company accrues an estimated liability for legal proceeding claims that are both probable and reasonably estimable . Pension and Postretirement Obligations:  The Company applies certain estimates for the discount rates and expected return on plan assets .\n The Company measures the present value of these future benefits by projecting benefit payment cash flows for each future period and discounting these cash flows back to the measurement date . Service cost and interest cost are measured separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation . Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows .\n For the primary U.S. qualified pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2025 is 8.00%, an increase from the weighted average of 7.63% in 2024 .

Net periodic benefit cost (benefit) is $1,044,044; Service cost is $123; interest cost is $522; interest is $417; service cost  $123 cost cost is $2,000 .\n Continuing operations: Continuing operations (continuing operations) - continuing operations (benefit) - discontinued operations: Continuing operations (benefits) - discontinued operations) – discontinued operations (Benefits) (Benefit) (benefit): Continuation) (benefit) Amortization of prior service benefit: Amortization of transition asset: transitional assortments, special termination benefits and other)\n The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year . The Company determines the discount rate and related assumption used to measure plan liabilities as of the applicable measurement date for the pension and postretirement benefit plans . The company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation .\n The Company measures service cost and interest cost separately using the spot yield curve approach applied to each corresponding obligation . Service costs are determined based on duration-specific spot rates applied to the service cost cash flows . The Company’s 2025 expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is  currently 8.00% .\n The Society of Actuaries did not release an update to the Scale MP-2021 in 2023 or 2024 . The actual net rate of return on plan assets in 2024, 2023 and 2022 was .2.3.3% . The average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past . the past . years has been .6.6% and .7% .\n 3M transferred eligible Solventum employees and retirees to new U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement plans with the same benefits of their current plans . The net impact of the remeasurement of the plans was a decrease of approximately $70.70.m in the non-current liability for pension and retirement benefits (and corresponding decrease in accumulated comprehensive loss, before deferred taxes).\n As of March 31, 2024, there were several small international pension plans remeasured for purposes of transferring Solventum employees to new pension plans, the impact of which was not material . The Company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its U.S. plans in 2025 . Future contributions will depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors .\n The investment strategy has used long duration cash bonds and derivative instruments to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of U.S. pension liabilities . Normally, 3M does not buy or sell any of its own securities as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds . The investment policies include a target strategic asset allocation .\n Acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from strategic targets . The portfolios will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges . 401(h) account assets are in the same trust as the primary U.S. pension plan . The allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans .\n In accordance with ASC 820-10, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy . The NAV is based on fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding .\n The level 3 activity attributable to U.S. pension and postretirement plans assets was insignificant for the periods ended December 31, 31, 2024 and 2023 . The disclosure below of asset categories is below the disclosure of the asset categories . The private equity portfolio consists of partnership interests in hedge funds, hedge fund of funds or other private fund vehicles .\n The Company provides standard funding and investment guidance to all international plans with more focused guidance to the larger plans . There is significant variation in asset allocation policy from country to country . The asset allocations are reviewed periodically and rebalanced when necessary . The fair values of the assets held by the international pension plans by asset class are as follows .\n Fixed Income investments include domestic and foreign government, and corporate debt securities . Real estate consists of property funds and REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts) REITS are valued at NAV with published prices provided by the custodians . Insurance consists of insurance contracts, which are valued using cash surrender values which is the amount the plan would receive if the contract was cashed out at year end .\n In 2024 the aggregate of net purchases and net unrealized gains and losses decreased this balance by $395.43.76.00 million and the change in currency exchange rates decreased this balance by $37.37 million . At December 31, 2024 the net payable includes a payable of $705.88 million to the Canadian Solventum pension . The balances of and changes in the fair values of the international pension plans’ level 3 assets consist primarily of insurance contracts under the absolute return asset class .\n The Company uses interest rate swaps and foreign exchange forward and option contracts to manage risks . The activity in 2024 included approximately $1.5.5-billion of invoices confirmed and $.2billion paid . Additional information relative to cash flow hedges, fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is included below as applicable .\n The Company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies . The settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings . Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings .\n The Company may use forward starting interest rate contracts and treasury rate lock contracts to hedge exposure to variability in cash flows from interest payments on forecasted debt issuances . The Company had a balance of $15.2 million associated with the after-tax net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n The Company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt . The mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense . The Company may enter into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million . These swaps converted $500.5 million and $700 million of 3M’s $1.0 billion and $680 million principal amount of fixed rate notes due 2049 and 2050 .\n In the fourth quarter of 2024, 3M expanded its net investment hedge activity by entering into foreign exchange forward/option contracts with a gross notional value at inception of $4.2 billion and tenor of five years . 3M’s use of foreign currency denominated debt balances can vary by time period depending on when foreign currency . debt balances designated in such relationships are de-designated, matured, or are newly issued and designated .\n At December 31, 2024, 3M has a principal amount of long-term debt instruments designated in net investment hedges totaling  1.8 billion euros . Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include de-designated foreign currency forward and option contracts that formerly were designated in cash flow hedging relationships .\n The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes . Derivatives designated as hedging instruments are not designated as instruments . For periods prior to the April 1, 2024 separation of Solventum, these include certain insignificant amounts attributable to discontinued operations . The following tables summarize the fair value of 3M’s derivative instruments, excluding non-derivative instruments used as hedges instruments, and their location in the consolidated balanc .\n The Company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts . The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits . 3M enters into master netting arrangements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk .\n Derivatives not subject to master netting agreements are not eligible for net presentation . The Company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties . 3M estimates that year-on-year foreign currency transaction effects, including hedging impacts, decreased pre-tax income from continuing operations by approximately $395.395 million in 2024 .\n The information in the following paragraphs and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities . There were no material fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the Company’s financial statements on a recurring basis for 2024 and 2023 . 3M classifies U.S. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities are classified as level 2 .\n The Company’s derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, are required to be recorded at fair value . 3M has determined that foreign currency forward and option contracts and interest rate swaps will be considered level 2 measurements . The Company uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset, such as foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates .\n The following table provides information by level for material assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2024 and 2023 . Industry standard data providers are 3M’s primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates . The resulting valuations are periodically validated through third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value model .\n In 2022, management committed to a plan to exit and dispose of net assets in Russia through an intended sale of related subsidiaries . As of December 31, 2022 the amounts of major assets and liabilities of this held-for-sale disposal group primarily included approximately $395.50 million . In 2023, 3M closed on the sale of these subsidiaries, resulting in an immaterial loss .\n In 2022, 3M committed to a plan to exit per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) manufacturing by the end of 2025 . The plan affects each of the Electronics Materials Solutions Division and Advanced Materials Division asset groupings/reporting units . Underlying fair values were determined primarily using discounted cash flow models based on assumptions of projected sales, EBITDA margins, capital expenditures, and discount rates .\n The carrying amount of long-term debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges . The fair values reflected in the sections above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity . 3M’s accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are estimated at approximately $.49.5 million at December 31, 2024, and $.52 million at Dec.31, 2023 .\n ome of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits and regulatory proceedings worldwide . These claims, lawsuits and proceedings relate to matters including, but not limited to, commercial; products liability (involving products that the Company now or formerly manufactured and sold) Unless otherwise stated, the Company is vigorously defending all such litigation and proceedings .\n The outcomes of legal proceedings and regulatory matters are often difficult to predict . A determination that the Company’s operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, and equitable remedies, including disgorgement, suspension or debarment, or injunctive relief .\n The Company records liabilities in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and when the loss is probable . The Company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable . As a result, the current accruals and/or estimates of loss and the potential impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings will likely change over time .\n Many of the matters described herein are at varying stages, seek an indeterminate amount of damages, or seek damages in amounts that the Company believes are not indicative of the ultimate losses that may be incurred . As a matter progresses, the Company may receive information, through plaintiff demands, through discovery, in the form of reports of purported experts, or in the context of settlement or mediation discussions, that purport to quantify an amount of alleged damages .\n On April 1, 2024, the Company completed the planned spin-off of its Health Care business as an independent company known as Solventum . The Company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it concludes as recognizable from the Company’s insurance program . For those insured legal proceedings where the Company has recorded an accrued liability in its financial statements, the company also records .\n The separation and distribution agreement governs the allocation of liabilities related to PFAS between the Company and Solventum . The Company will retain all PFAS-related liabilities resulting from the business, operations, and activities of (x) the Company’s business (as defined in the separation and . distribution agreement) and (y) Solventums' business prior to April 1, 2024 .\n The Company will also retain PFAS liabilities for product claims (x) arising from the Company’s products, (y) and (z)  arising from certain products sold by Solventum at or after April 1, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2026 (subject to the exceptions described below)\n As of December 31, 2024, the Company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts . The vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the Company allege use of some of the Company’s mask and respirator products . The number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, is lower than it experienced at the peak of filings in 2003 .\n In the last twelve months, 3M has successfully defended  two respirator product liability trials . Claims of persons alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma, other malignancies, and black lung disease, are costlier to litigate and resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons . The Company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the Company’s respiratory protection products . The average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher .\n 3M's 8710 respirators were last sold by the Company by 1998 in the United States . The State alleges that each respirator sold constitutes a separate violation under the Consumer Credit Protection Act . 3M disputes the expert's estimates and the State's position regarding what constitutes a different violation of the Act . The amount, if any, of any civil penalties upon a finding of liability would be determined through subsequent trial proceedings .\n The Company regularly conducts a comprehensive legal review of its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities . No liability has been recorded for any portion of this matter because the Company believes that liability is not probable and reasonably estimable at this time . The Company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss due to open factual and legal questions .\n As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an accrual for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities (excluding Aearo accruals) of $523,000 . The Company cannot estimate the amount or upper end of the range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the Accrual the Company has established because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted .\n As of December 31, 2024, the Company had an immaterializable receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation . The Company continues to seek coverage under the policies of certain insolvent and other insurers . Aearo Technologies is named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the Company, in numerous lawsuits .\n Responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is shared in an informal arrangement among Aearo, Cabot, American Optical Corporation and a subsidiary of Warner Lambert and their respective insurers . Liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the “AO Safety” brand .\n Developments may occur that could affect the estimate of Aearo’s liabilities . If any of these developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the amount accrued . The Company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate .\n The Company may be jointly and severally liable, sometimes with other potentially responsible parties, for the costs of investigation and remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations where hazardous substances have been released or disposed of . The Company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide .\n The Company may have some liability for remediation of contamination under applicable environmental laws . Please refer to the section entitled “Environmental Liabilities and Insurance Recovery” that follows for information on the amount of the accrual for such liabilities . The Company no longer manufactures certain PFAS compounds including PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and their precursor compounds .\n 3M announced in December 2022 it will take two actions with respect to PFAS: exiting all PFAS manufacturing by the end of 2025, and working to discontinue the use of PFAS across its product portfolio . The Company continues to evaluate the availability and feasibility of third-party products that do not contain PFAS .\n Regulatory and legislative activities concerning PFAS are accelerating in the United States, Europe and elsewhere . The Company intends to continue to evaluate beyond the end of 2025 the adoption of third-party products that do not contain PFAS to the extent such products are available and such adoption is feasible . Regulatory limits for PFAS in emissions and in environmental media such as soil and water (including drinking water) are being set at increasingly low levels .\n There is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required . PFOA, PFOS and PFHxS (and their related compounds) are listed under several Annexes of the POPs Regulation . In February 2023, an EU-wide restriction on the manufacturing, use, placing on the market and use as well as some waste management requirements of these substances in EU Member States .\n In September 2024, the EU adopted a restriction on certain uses of perfluorohexanoic acid (“PFHxA”) in consumer goods . In February 2023, the European Chemicals Agency published a proposal to restrict the manufacture, placing on the market, and use of PFAS under REACH .\n The EU regulates PFAS in drinking water via a Drinking Water Directive . January 2023 was the deadline for Member States to implement the Directive in their countries . Some Member States, including Germany, adopted more restrictive limits for certain PFAS substances . This change may impact 3M, but any such impact is unknown at this time .\n All PFAS manufacturing was completed and discontinued at the Zwijndrecht facility in 2024 as part of the Company’s previously-announced global exit of all PAS manufacturing by the end of 2025 . Dyneon also continues to engage with the authorities about potential remedial actions, which may be required in the future to address soil and groundwater . The Flemish Government approved 3M Belgium's latest application for a water discharge permit required for continued pump and treat operations .\n 3M Belgium is evaluating the potential impact of this action and potential next steps . Environmental Inspectorate imposed a safety measure on 3M in October 2022 . Environmental inspectors said safety measures were insufficient to reduce PFAS emissions . 3M says it is uncertain if it will be able to meet the current wastewater treatment system to meet permit limits .\n 3M Belgium and the Flemish Government announced an agreement (the Remediation Agreement) in connection with the Zwijndrecht facility in July 2022 . The agreement contains certain provisions ending litigation and providing certain releases of liability for 3M . In connection with these actions, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $700,000 in the first half of 2022 .\n In December 2022, the Flemish Cabinet took steps to implement an executive action (the ‘Site Decision’) designed to expand 3M Belgium’s remedial obligations around the Zwijndrecht site . An accredited third-party soil remediation expert has conducted these DSIs . The full impact of the Site Decision remains to be determined .\n In December 2023, 3M Belgium submitted a petition for annulment of the temporary action framework to the Belgian Council of State . The full impact of the temporary action framework remains to be determined . As of December 31, 2024, a total of 17 pending actions against 3M are pending in Belgian civil courts . The pending cases include claims by individuals, municipalities, and other entities .\n Approximately 1,400 individuals have petitioned to intervene in a second \"follow-on action\" alleging primarily nuisance claims . The Belgian court has not yet determined that the interventions will be permitted . Criminal complaints have been filed against 3M Belgium with an Antwerp investigatory judge . The parties are engaged in mediation regarding the dispute .\n In May 2023, the government of the Netherlands sent 3M Belgium a notice of liability stating that it holds 3M . liable for damages related to alleged PFAS contamination in the Netherlands . In December 2024 a lawsuit was filed in a Dutch court by the Dutch Fishermen's Association . The lawsuit generally alleges that PFAS from 3M. Belgium’s Zwijndrecht facility impacted certain aspects of the Dutch fishing industry .\n The province alleges that the defendants manufactured, marketed, distributed, and sold PFAS-containing products, including AFFF, knowing that they would contaminate the environment and threaten human health . The lawsuit asserts claims for public nuisance, private nuisance, negligent design, failure to warn, conspiracy, and breaches of the Competition Act .\n A putative nationwide consumer class action was filed against 3M Canada, 3M Company, and other defendants in the British Columbia Supreme Court on behalf of all persons who purchased carpeting treated with PFAS-containing products before January 1, 2020 . Canada’s Minister of the Environment announced in July 2024 a mandatory survey on the manufacture, import, and use of 312 PFAS due on January 29, 2025 . The Canadian government approved 3M's request to extend its reporting deadline to May 8, 2025.\n The Company is aware of a writ of summons that was filed in Australia on behalf of individuals with connections to property that has been allegedly impacted by 3M PFAS products . The ultimate impact, if any, of this and other executive actions on proposed rules not yet finalized, and on new rulemaking, remains unclear .\n Public drinking water suppliers in the United States will have five years to meet the limits . Multiple petitions challenging the rule have been filed in federal court . In May 2022, EPA added five PFAS substances – HFPO-DA, PFOS, PFOA PFNA, and PFHxS - to its list of Regional Screening and Removal Management Levels .\n EPA proposed two rules under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) One of the proposed rules would list nine PFAS as \"hazardous constituents\" under RCRA . The other proposed rule would expand the definition of hazardous waste subject to corrective action . The Company submitted comments to the proposal in August 2023 . EPA finalized Aquatic Life Criteria for PFOA and PFOS in October 2024 .\n EPA has taken several actions to increase reporting and restrictions regarding PFAS under the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Toxics Release Inventory . EPA has added at least 196 PFAS compounds to the list of substances that must be included in TRI reports . In October 2023, EPA finalized a rule that requires TRI reporting of de minimis uses of those TRI-listed PFAS .\n In August 2024, three states petitioned EPA to list PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and HFPO-DA as hazardous air pollutants under Clean Air Act . 3M has not manufactured or processed NMeFOSE for over 20 years and, in January 2025, EPA confirmed that 3M is not subject to the test order .\n Some states have also been evaluating or have taken actions relating to PFOA, PFOS and other PFAS compounds in products . In 2021 and 2022, the State of Maine passed its Act To Stop Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoralkyl Substances Pollution, which banned intentionally added PFAS in products effective January 1, 2030 .\n Minnesota enacted a law that includes broad PFAS prohibitions and reporting obligations in May 2023 . Maine legislature has since enacted legislation retroactive to January 1, 2023, that includes changes to the product bans and notification requirements in the original legislation . Certain states have enacted restrictions on PFAS in certain categories of products, including textiles, children’s products, cosmetics and cosmetics .\n There is currently significant uncertainty about the potential costs to industry and communities associated with remediation and control technologies that may be required . 3M cannot predict what additional regulatory or legislative actions in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere arising from the foregoing or other proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken .\n In February 2023, Muscle Shoals, Alabama filed a lawsuit against 3M and several co-defendants alleging that discharge from operations in Decatur, Alabama has contaminated the Tennessee River . The JPML issued a conditional transfer order of this case to the AFFF federal Multi-District Litigation (\"MDL\") in December 2024 .

The other lawsuit is proceeding in state court pending a ruling by the federal court of appeals on 3M’s appeal of the order remanding the case to state court .\n In March 2023, the Maine Attorney General filed two lawsuits alleging contamination of the state's drinking water supplies and other natural resources from PFAS-containing products . In August 2024, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the order remanding the case to state court . The other lawsuit is proceeding in state court pending a ruling by the federal court of appeals on 3M's appeal .\n In January 2024, the Connecticut Attorney General filed two lawsuits alleging contamination of the state's drinking water supplies and other natural resources from PFAS-containing products . 3M filed a motion to dismiss, which was denied in July 2024 . In January 2025, 3M removed the case to federal court and remanded the other lawsuit to state court .\n As of December 31, 2024, more than 6,000 lawsuits alleging injuries or damages from PFAS contamination or exposure allegedly caused by AFFF use are pending against 3M (along with other defendants) in various state and federal courts . Plaintiffs seek damages for personal injury, property damage, water treatment costs, medical monitoring, natural resource damages, and punitive damages .\n 3M entered into a class-action settlement to resolve a wide range of drinking water claims by public water systems in the United States . The PWS Settlement provides that 3M does not admit any liability or wrongdoing and does not waive any defenses . The settlement calls for 3M to make payments from 2024 through 2036 .\n The actual amounts that 3M will pay will be determined in part by which class members that do not have a positive test result for the presence of PFAS in their drinking water (as defined by the PWS Settlement) as of the date of the settlement and those that receive such a test result by the end of 2025 . The parties continue to negotiate processes for bellwethers of certain other personal injury claims .\n Starting in 2017, 3M has been served with individual and putative class action complaints in various state and federal courts . The Company anticipates seeking to have most of these cases removed to federal court and transferred to the AFFF MDL . Several cases are expected to remain pending in state courts, including a case in Illinois state court brought by an oil refinery worker .\n Several companies have been sued along with 3M, including DuPont, Chemours, and various carpet, paper, and textile manufacturers . The plaintiffs in these cases generally allege that 3M failed to warn its customers about the hazards of improper disposal of PFOA and PFOS . The cases brought on behalf of drinking water providers described below will be covered by the PWS Settlement if the water providers did not opt out of the settlement .\n 3M is also defending a mass action filed in Alabama in June 2024 by hundreds of individual customers of the Water Works and Sewer Board for the City of Gadsden, Alabama, alleging emotional distress and property damage related to PFAS contamination of their drinking water . The Town of Pine Hill, Alabama filed suit alleging that PFAS discharges from paper mills currently owned by International Paper have contaminated its water supply .\n In May 2021, the City of Summerville, Georgia filed a motion to intervene in the lawsuit, which was granted in March 2022 .

The Company has completed its production of information and documents responsive to the information request .\n The Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Decatur plant pursuant to an NPDES permit issued by ADEM . In April 2019, the Company voluntarily disclosed the releases to the U.S. EPA and ADEM. The Company took steps to fully control the aforementioned processes by capturing all wastewater produced by the processes and treating all air emissions. These processes are no longer in use.\n 3M and ADEM agreed to the terms of an interim Consent Order in July 2020 to cover all PFAS-related wastewater discharges and air emissions from the Company’s Decatur facility . The Company is currently installing a new wastewater treatment system to address PFAS . Company is authorized to discharge wastewater from its Cottage Grove plant pursuant to an NPDES permit issued by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency .\n Under this agreement, the Company’s principal obligations include (i) evaluating releases of certain PFAS compounds from these sites and proposing response actions, including actions to provide treatment or alternative drinking water . In January 2021, MPCA issue a Notice of Violation that included measures requiring the Company to address the presence of  the presence of PFOA and PFOS .\n In June 2022, MPCA directed that the Company address the presence of PFAS in its stormwater discharge from the Cottage Grove facility .
