Our s\nustainability framework\n is guided by our commitment to help the energy sector address the \nenergy trilemma of reliability, affordability, and sustainability.\nTo operationalize this commitment, we have built the sustainability governance framework of “the Control Room.” The Control Room is led \nby our Chief Sustainability Officer, who supervises a cross-functional, global team, and chairs our Sustainability Council. Further, we have a \nSafety and Sustainability Committee of the Board of Directors, which guides and oversees our sustainability goals, impacts, risks, and \nefforts. Our operational efforts are aligned with our business strategy, the priorities of our stakeholders, our commitments, and our aim to \ndeliver innovative technologies to create a more sustainable electric power system.\nThe four pillars of our sustainability framework: Electrify, Decarbonize, Conserve, and Thrive:\n•\nElectrify: Catalyze access to more secure, sustainable, reliable, and affordable electricity, while helping to drive global \neconomic development. \nWe seek to add power generation and grid capacity to strengthen current electricity infrastructure and \nprovide critical redundancy, support electrification in underserved regions, and encourage economic development.\n•\nDecarbonize: Invent, deploy, and service technology to help decarbonize and electrify the world. \nWe seek to advance both \nthe near-term impact by improving the trajectory on carbon intensity and the long-term impact by deploying products that are \nincreasingly capable of lower carbon emissions once supporting infrastructure is deployed at scale.\n \n•\nConserve: Innovate more while using less.\n We are working to reduce both our direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions \nand have set a goal to achieve carbon neutrality for our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030. We also support the transition \nto a more circular economy and recognize the importance of critical raw materials and nature in our mission. We are working to \ntrack 90% of our top products as part of our circularity framework by 2030, including principles such as eco-design. \n•\nThrive: Advance safe, responsible, \nand inclusive\n working conditions in our operations and across our value chain.\n We \nare committed to prioritizing safety, building and fostering an inclusive workplace globally and in the communities in which we \noperate, promoting a culture of compliance and ethics, and advancing human rights across our supply chain. \n*Non-GAAP Financial Measure\n2024 FORM 10-K \n5\nThe global shift towards a variety of energy sources, evolving and increased environmental regulations and requirements, and climate \nchange effects, present both challenges and opportunities that may impact our business.

    "item1a": "Item 1A. \"Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Technology and Intellectual Property\" for further information about these \nrisks. We outsource certain cybersecurity functions and will continue to look for opportunities to utilize managed security service providers. \nIn addition, we collaborate with GE Aerospace on certain cybersecurity functions and will continue to do so during a transition period \nfollowing our Spin-Off. These arrangements increase our overall cyber risk given the degree of our interconnectedness with these third \nparties and the potential impact on our outsourced functions that could be caused by an attack on them.\nThe Audit Committee of the GE Vernova’s Board of Directors is responsible for board-level oversight of cybersecurity risk, and the Audit \nCommittee reports back to the full Board about this and other areas within its responsibility\n. \nAs part of its oversight role, the Audit \nCommittee receives reporting about GE Vernova’s practices, programs, notable threats or incidents, and other developments related to \ncybersecurity throughout the year, including through periodic updates from our \nChief Information Security Officer (CISO)\n. The Audit \nCommittee also receives information about cybersecurity risks as part of GE Vernova’s enterprise risk management framework and \nreporting. In addition to receiving reports from the Audit Committee, the Board also periodically receives direct reports from the CISO on the \nCompany's cybersecurity risk management.\nGE Vernova’s CISO reports to GE Vernova’s Chief Information Officer and leads our overall cybersecurity function\n. \nThe CISO has over 20 \nyears of experience in managing and leading IT or cybersecurity teams and participates in various cyber security organizations.\n \nThe CISO \ncollaborates with business unit CISOs to identify and analyze cybersecurity risks to GE Vernova; consider industry trends; implement \ncontrols, as appropriate and feasible, to mitigate these risks; and enable business leaders to make risk-based business decisions that \nimplicate cybersecurity considerations. \nThe CISO meets with senior leadership\n to review and discuss GE Vernova’s cybersecurity program, \nincluding emerging cyber risks, threats, and industry trends. The CISO also supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate \ncybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, including by collaborating with internal security personnel and business \nstakeholders, and incorporating threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public, or private sources to inform \nour cybersecurity technologies and processes.",
    "item1c": "ITEM 1C. \nCYBERSECURITY\n. \nThe description in this section addresses certain cybersecurity matters relating to GE Vernova following \nthe Spin-Off.\nGE Vernova has processes for assessing, identifying, and managing cybersecurity risks that are \nbuilt into our risk management program \nand IT functions\n. These processes are designed to help protect our information assets from internal and external cyber threats, protect \nemployee information from unauthorized access or attack, and secure our networks, systems, and products. We have developed and \nimplemented a cybersecurity framework intended to assess, identify, and manage risks from threats to the security of our information, \nsystems, products, and networks using a risk-based approach.\n The framework is informed in part by industry standards such as the \nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and International Organization for Standardization 27001 \n(ISO 27001) Framework. This approach does not imply that GE Vernova meets all technical standards, specifications, or requirements \nunder the NIST Cybersecurity Framework or ISO 27001.\n2024 FORM 10-K \n32\nOur key cybersecurity processes include:\n•\nRisk-based controls for information systems and information on our network.\n We seek to maintain an IT infrastructure that \nimplements physical, administrative, and technical controls that are calibrated based on risk and designed to protect the \nconfidentiality, integrity, and availability of our information systems and information stored on the Company’s networks, including \ncustomer information, employee information, IP, and proprietary information.\n•\nCybersecurity incident response plan and testing.\n We have a cybersecurity incident response plan and a dedicated team to \nrespond to cybersecurity incidents. When a cybersecurity incident occurs or a vulnerability is identified, GE Vernova has cross-\nfunctional teams that are responsible for leading the initial assessment of priority and severity. External experts may also be \nengaged as appropriate. GE Vernova’s cybersecurity team assists in responding to incidents depending on severity levels and \nseeks to improve our cybersecurity incident management plan through periodic tabletops or simulations at the enterprise and \nbusiness levels.\n•\nTraining.\n We provide security awareness training to help employees understand their information protection and cybersecurity \nresponsibilities. We also provide additional role-based training to applicable employees based on customer requirements, \nregulatory obligations, and industry risks.\n•\nSupplier risk assessments.\n We have implemented a \nthird-party risk management process\n that includes expectations regarding \ninformation protection and cybersecurity. That process, among other things, provides for GE Vernova to perform cybersecurity \nassessments on certain suppliers based on their risk profile and a related rating process. GE Vernova also seeks contractual \ncommitments from key suppliers to appropriately secure and maintain their IT systems and protect our information that is \nprocessed on their systems.\n•\nThird-party assessments.\n We have third-party cybersecurity companies engaged to periodically assess GE Vernova’s \ncybersecurity posture and assist in identifying and remediating risks from cybersecurity threats.\nGE Vernova considers cybersecurity, along with other top risks, within our enterprise risk management framework. The enterprise risk \nmanagement framework includes internal reporting at the enterprise level with consideration of key risk indicators, trends, and \ncountermeasures for cybersecurity and other types of significant risks.\n \nGE Vernova does not believe that there are currently any known \nincidents from cybersecurity threats that are reasonably likely to materially affect GE Vernova or its business strategy, results of operations, \nor financial condition\n. As is the case for all large, global companies, we face certain ongoing risks from cybersecurity threats that, if \nrealized, are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company, including our operations, business strategy, results of operations, or \nfinancial condition.
