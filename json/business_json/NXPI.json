Semiconductors vary significantly depending upon the specific function or application of the end product in which the semiconductor is used and the customer who is deploying it. Semiconductors also vary on a number of technical characteristics including the degree of integration, level of customization, programmability and the process technology utilized to manufacture the semiconductor. Advances in semiconductor technology have increased the functionality and performance of semiconductors, improving their features and power consumption characteristics while reducing their size and cost. These advances have resulted in growth of semiconductors and electronic content across a diverse array of products. The semiconductor market totaled $627.6 billion in 2024.\nBusiness Combinations\nOn December 17, 2024, NXP entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aviva Links for $242.5 million in cash.

The four end markets are Automotive, Industrial & IoT, Mobile, and Communication Infrastructure & Other. \nAutomotive\nIndustrial & IoT\nMobile\nComm Infra & Other\nCore\nAuto MCU (non-S32)\nIn-vehicle infotainment (IVI)\nIn-vehicle networking (IVN)\nAdvanced Analog\nSecure Car Access\nProcessors\nAnalog & Security\nConnectivity\nSecure Mobile payment &\nAccess Solutions\nCustom Analog Interfaces\nSecure Card Solutions\nLegacy Networking\nProcessors\nRF Power Amplifiers\nAccelerated Growth\nSDV\nRadar Systems\nElectrification\nConnectivity\nIntelligent Edge Systems\ni.\nAutomotive\nGrowth in automotive semiconductor sales relies on (1) global vehicle sales and production trends and (2) the increase in semiconductor content per vehicle. In the past few years, and going forward, we believe the latter will be the most important driver for growth in the automotive semiconductor market, while the stagnation of global vehicle sales and production will make the former less relevant. The increase of the average semiconductor content is being driven by the proliferation of electronic features throughout the vehicle, especially for driver assistance (ADAS), and by the increasing penetration of electrified vehicles, which have much higher semiconductors content. \nWe believe three mega-trends will drive the semiconductor content increase in the future: Autonomous driving, electrification and the software defined vehicle. Each of the megatrends involve new functions and each new function requires new technologies. The path to full autonomy is driving the increase of driver assistance systems in the car already today. In the same way, strict emissions regulations as well as consumer willingness for energy efficient cars are accelerating the penetration of electrification. Last but not least, many consumers want their cars to be service oriented, hyper-connected, configurable and upgradeable, in the same way as they are used to with their smartphones. We expect such consumer demands will lead to new vehicle architectures and eventually to software defined vehicles (SDV). \nSemiconductor content per vehicle continues to increase due to government regulation of safety and emissions, standardization of higher-end options across a greater number of vehicle classes as well as consumer demand for greater fuel efficiency, advanced safety, multimedia applications and connectivity. Automotive safety features are evolving from passive safety systems to active safety systems with Advanced Driving Assisted Systems (ADAS) such as radar and vision systems. Semiconductor content is also increasing in engine management and fuel economy applications, like Battery Management Systems (BMS). Comfort and convenience systems and user interface applications, as well as infotainment features such as digital audio broadcasting are also areas with high semiconductor content increases. In addition, the use of networking in automotive applications continues to increase as various subsystems communicate within the automobile and with external devices and networks. Furthermore, we believe networking will play a key role in the electrical/electronic architecture transformation towards domain and zonal architectures. Smart car access, automotive Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and Near-Field Communication (NFC) are gaining ground in automotive as well, enabling the connection of vehicles and car keys to portable devices and the infrastructure. Data integrity and security hardware features for safeguarding memory, communication and system data are also increasing in importance.   \nDue to the high degree of regulatory scrutiny and safety requirements, the automotive semiconductor market is characterized by stringent qualification processes, zero defect quality processes, functionally safe design architecture, high reliability, extensive design-in timeframes and long product life cycles, which results in significant barriers to entry. \n4\nii.\nIndustrial & IoT\n \nThe world is becoming smarter, more connected and more data driven, and the Industrial & IoT market sits at the center of this global digital transformation. The Industrial & IoT market is highly fragmented with a diverse collection of products and applications such as factory automation, home and building automation, appliances, home entertainment, power and energy and healthcare solutions.   \nThe need for productivity increase requiring real-time insights and efficient processes for factory automation, the reduction of resource consumption and better energy efficiency for smart factories and buildings, the enhancement in consumer convenience security and comfort for smart homes, the increase in performance requirements for processing content in smart consumer devices, the need for better health prevention and monitoring solutions, are some of the key use-cases and trends driving growth in Industrial & IoT. Carbon emissions reduction efforts (global net zero emission commitments) will also be a key growth driver with large transformations expected of our energy systems. Factories, buildings and homes will need to rely much more on renewable energy (e.g., solar, wind) and increase efficient use of energy. The way we generate and store energies will likely be more distributed. The energy ecosystem needs to develop and ensure smart, efficient and reliable power delivery.\nThese trends drive the replacement of traditional mechanical equipment by smart, energy-saving and connected electronic equipment using various sensors, processors, connectivity, analog and security chipsets that align well with NXP’s portfolio and ability to provide customers with system solutions across these applications segments. \nFinally, with the growing number of connected devices and increasing data generation, latency, privacy and bandwidth have become critical limiting factors. Intelligent edge solutions solve this by bringing the intelligence closer to the source. Edge systems reduce the tendency on the cloud, lowering power consumption, strengthening data protection. They are, most of the time, autonomous and real-time. They handle data and do decisions locally. NXP's scalable low power solutions across the entire embedded processing spectrum are ideally suited here.  \niii.\nMobile\n \nMobile includes applications such as smartphones, feature phones, tablets, wearables and mobile accessories. NXP has a strong focus on mobile wallet, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and specialty custom analog solutions. The demand for faster speeds, improved battery life, fast charging, mobile wallets, highly secure localization and sensing technology, mobile transit and authentication is driving increased semiconductor content for NXP. The growth in this market is mainly driven by the increasing attach rate of these features across devices, vendors and regions, from flagship smartphones down to feature phones, from developed countries to emerging regions. UWB, thanks to its unique precision, robustness, and reliability, is emerging as a secure, fine-ranging technology capable of enabling a wide range of innovative location-based user experiences. The technology is gaining momentum thanks to wider chipset availability, adoption across various devices by multiple brands, and the formation of a strong UWB ecosystem across the whole supply chain where NXP is well positioned. \niv.\nCommunication Infrastructure & Other\n \nThe Communication Infrastructure & Other end market is a combination of three different application markets, namely secure edge identification, 5G radio power and digital network communication solutions. \nIn secure edge identification solutions, NXP has extensive experience providing customers with solutions for applications demanding the highest security and reliability (ePassports, eID credentials, transportation & payment cards. Included as well is the growing RFID market that uses wireless technology for identification and tracking of objects. Further digitalization of governmental services, the trend towards secure contactless payment and the need to improve tracking, traceability and authentication of products are driving demand across these applications.\nMost countries in the world have migrated their wireless infrastructure to 5G network technology. This application market provides base station radio units with power amplifiers for improved signal throughput and efficiency.\n5\nFinally, the increasing number of connected devices exchanging more data in the cloud and on the device edge, combined with demand for improved digital communication drives demand in the network communications market. \nProducts \nWe offer customers a broad portfolio of semiconductor products, including microcontrollers, application processors, communication processors, connectivity chipsets, analog and interface devices, RF power amplifiers, security controllers and sensors.

Nearly all of our security products consist of multi-functional solutions comprised of passive RF connectivity devices facilitating information transfer from the user document to reader infrastructure; secure, tamper-proof microcontroller devices in which information is securely \n7\nencrypted (“secure element”); and secure real-time operating system software products to facilitate the encryption-decryption of data, and the interaction with the reader infrastructure systems. Our solutions are developed to provide extreme levels of security of user information, undergoing stringent and continued global governmental and banking certification processes, and to deliver a high level of device performance enabling significant throughput and productivity to our customers. \nviii.\nSensors\n \nSensors serve as a primary interface in embedded systems for advanced human interface and contextual awareness that mimic the human “5 senses” interaction with the external environment. We provide several categories of semiconductor-based environmental and inertial sensors for the Automotive market, including pressure, inertial, magnetic and gyroscopic sensors that provide orientation detection, gesture recognition, tilt to scroll functionality and position detection. \nManufacturing \nWe manufacture semiconductors through a combination of wholly owned manufacturing facilities, a manufacturing facility operated jointly with another semiconductor company and third-party foundries and assembly and test subcontractors. We manage our manufacturing assets together through one centralized organization to ensure we realize scale benefits in asset utilization, purchasing volumes and overhead leverage across businesses. \nThe manufacturing of a semiconductor involves several phases of production, which can be broadly divided into “front-end” and “back-end” processes. Front-end processes take place at highly complex wafer manufacturing facilities (called fabrication plants or “wafer fabs”), and involve the imprinting of substrate silicon wafers with the precise circuitry required for semiconductors to function. The front-end production cycle requires high levels of precision and involves as many as 300 process steps. Back-end processes involve the assembly, test and packaging of semiconductors in a form suitable for distribution. In contrast to the highly complex front-end process, back-end processing is generally less complicated, and as a result we tend to determine the location of our back-end facilities based more on cost factors than on technical considerations. \nWe primarily focus our internal and joint venture wafer manufacturing operations on running proprietary specialty process technologies that enable us to differentiate our products on key performance features, and we generally outsource wafer manufacturing in process technologies that are available at third-party wafer foundries when it is economical to do so. In addition, we increasingly focus our in-house manufacturing on our competitive 8-inch wafer facilities, which predominantly run manufacturing processes in the 140 nanometer, 180 nanometer and 250 nanometer process nodes. This focus increases our return on invested capital and reduces capital expenditures. \nOur front-end manufacturing facilities use a broad range of production processes and proprietary design methods, including complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), bipolar, bipolar CMOS (BiCMOS) and double-diffused metal on silicon oxide semiconductor (DMOS) technologies. Our wafer fabs produce semiconductors with line widths ranging from 90 nanometers to 3 microns for integrated circuits and 0.5 microns to greater than 4 microns for discretes. This broad technology portfolio enables us to meet increasing demand from customers for system solutions, which require a variety of technologies. \nOur back-end manufacturing facilities test and package many different types of products using a wide variety of processes. To optimize flexibility, we use shared technology platforms for our back-end assembly operations. Most of our assembly and test activities are maintained in-house. \n8\nThe following table shows selected key information with respect to our major operating front-end and back-end facilities:\nSite\nOwnership\nWafer sized used\nLine widths used (vm)\nTechnology/Products\n(Microns)\nFront-end\nSingapore (SSMC)¹⁾\n61.2 \n%\n8”\n0.14-0.25\nCMOS, eNVM, Power, BCDMOS, RF\nNijmegen, the Netherlands\n100 \n%\n8”\n0.14-1.00\nCMOS, BCDMOS, RF, Power MOSFET\nChandler, United States\n100 \n%\n8”\n0.18-0.50\nCMOS, eNVM, BCDMOS\nChandler RF, United States\n100 \n%\n6”\n0.25-0.40\nGaN\nAustin (Ed Bluestein), United States\n100 \n%\n8”\n0.09-0.18\nCMOS, eNVM, BCDMOS, Radar\nBack-end\nKaohsiung, Taiwan\n100 \n%\n— \n—\n \nNFC, Automotive Car-access, In-Vehicle Networking, Micro-controllers, ADAS (Radar), Analog, Mixed-Signal and Power\nBangkok, Thailand\n100 \n%\n— \n— \nAutomotive In-Vehicle Networking and Sensors, Analog, RFID, Banking and e-Passport modules, Power Management\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia\n100 \n%\n— \n— \nMicro-processors, ADAS/Radar, Micro-controllers, Advanced Audio Processor, Sensors, Power Management, Analog and Mixed Signal, RF devices\nTianjin, China\n100 \n%\n— \n— \nMicro-processors, Micro-controllers, Power Management, Battery Management, Analog and Mixed Signal\n1)\n    Joint venture with TSMC.  \nWe use a large number of raw materials in our front- and back-end manufacturing processes, including silicon wafers, chemicals, gases, lead frames, substrates, molding compounds and various types of precious and other metals. Our most important raw materials are the raw, or substrate, silicon wafers we use to make our semiconductors. We purchase these wafers, which must meet exacting specifications, from a limited number of suppliers in the geographic region in which our fabrication facilities are located. At our wholly owned fabrication plants, we use raw wafers ranging from 6 inches to 8 inches in size. Our SSMC wafer fab facility, which produces 8 inch wafers, is jointly owned by TSMC and ourselves. Emerging fabrication technologies employ larger wafer sizes and, accordingly, we expect that our production requirements will in the future shift towards larger substrate wafers. \nWe typically source our other raw materials in a similar fashion as our wafers, although our portfolio of suppliers is more diverse. Some of our suppliers provide us with materials on a just-in-time basis, which permits us to reduce our procurement costs and the negative cash flow consequences of maintaining inventories, but exposes us to potential supply chain interruptions. We purchase most of our raw materials on the basis of fixed price contracts. \nIn recent years, as a result of constraints in the semiconductor supply chains, there has been a tendency towards longer term supply contracts with suppliers in exchange for capacity. From an operational perspective, all of our manufacturing facilities continue to operate around the world in accordance with guidance issued by local and national government authorities.\n9\nNXP also has equity investments in the following joint venture manufacturing companies:\n•\nEuropean Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC) GmbH will build and operate a new 300mm semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility in Dresden, Germany. ESMC is 70% owned by TSMC, with Bosch, Infineon, and NXP each owning 10%. NXP is entitled to 10% of the fab facility capacity. Initial production at ESMC is currently targeted to begin in 2027.\n•\nVisionPower Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Pte. Ltd. (VSMC) will build and operate a new 300mm semiconductor wafer manufacturing facility in Singapore. VSMC is 60% owned by Vanguard International Semiconductor Corporation and 40% owned by NXP. NXP is entitled to 40% of the fab facility capacity. Initial production at VSMC is currently targeted to begin in 2027.\nSales, Marketing and Customers \nWe market our products and solutions worldwide to a variety of OEMs, Electronic Manufacturing Service customers (EMSs) and Distributors. We generate demand for our products by delivering product solutions to our customers, and supporting their system design-in activities by providing application architecture expertise and local field application engineering support. \nOur sales and marketing teams are organized into six regions, which are EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa), the Americas, Japan, South Korea, China and South Asia Pacific. These sales regions are responsible for managing customer relationships and creating demand for our solutions through the full ecosystem development. In addition, our sales and marketing teams in the regions partner with our distributors and our large number of mass market customers. \nOur sales and marketing strategy focuses on key defined verticals in Automotive, Industrial & IoT, Communication Infrastructure, and Mobile deepening our relationship with our top OEMs and EMSs, expanding our reach to our mass market customers, startups and our distribution partners and becoming their preferred supplier, which we believe assists us in reducing sales volatility in challenging markets. We have long-standing customer relationships with most of our customers. Our 10 largest OEM end customers, some of whom are supplied by distributors, in alphabetical order, are Apple, Aptiv, Bosch, Continental, Denso, Harman Auto, Hyundai, LGE Automotive, Samsung and Visteon. We also have a strong position with our distribution partners, including our five largest in alphabetical order, Arrow, Avnet, Nexty, WT Micro and World Peace. \nOur revenue is primarily the sum of our direct sales to OEMs, EMSs plus our distributors’ resale of NXP products. Avnet accounted for 22% of our revenue in 2024 and 21% in 2023. No other distributor accounted for greater than 10% of our revenue. No OEM for which we had direct sales to accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2024 or 2023. \nResearch and Development \nWe believe that our future success depends on our ability to both improve our existing products and to develop new products for both existing and new markets. We direct our research and development efforts largely to the development of new semiconductor solutions where we see significant opportunities for growth. We target applications that require stringent overall system and subsystem performance. As new and challenging applications proliferate, we believe that many of these applications will benefit from our solutions. We have assembled a global team of highly skilled semiconductor and embedded software design engineers with expertise in RF, analog, power management, interface, security and digital processing. \nWith the intent to outpace market growth we invest in research and development to extend or create leading market positions, with an emphasis on fast growing sizable market segments, such as ADAS, in-vehicle networks and power management, as well as Edge computing to support the successful deployment in the IoT with our cross-over processing technology, but also in emerging markets, such as massive MIMO in RF Power and mmWave for 5G. In addition, we invest a few percent of our total research and development expenditures in research activities that develop fundamental new technologies or product categories that could contribute significantly to our company's growth in the future. \n10\nWe annually perform a fundamental review of our business portfolio and our related new product and technology development opportunities in order to decide on changes in the allocation of our research and development resources. For products targeting established markets, we evaluate our research and development expenditures based on clear business need and risk assessments. For break-through technologies and new market opportunities, we look at the strategic fit and synergies with the rest of our portfolio and the size of the potential addressable market. Overall, we allocate our research and development to maintain a healthy mix of emerging growth and mature businesses. \nSubsidies and Grants\nWe receive subsidies and grants from governments in some countries in the form of direct grants as well as tax credits for R&D activities. Such funding is generally provided to encourage R&D activities, industrialization and local economic development and is generally available to all companies. The conditions for the receipt of government grants and subsidies may include eligibility restrictions, approval by relevant authorities, annual budget appropriations, compliance with relevant regulations or contingent return provisions, as well as specifications regarding objectives and results. The approval process for such funding may last up to several years.  Certain specific contracts require compliance with extensive regulatory requirements and set forth certain conditions relating to the funded programs.  There could be penalties if these objectives are not fulfilled. \nOur direct grants include those awarded under the European 2nd Important Project of Common European Interest on Microelectronics and Communication Technologies (“IPCEI ME/CT”). During 2023 and 2024, the Company was granted IPCEI ME/CT government assistance in multiple EU member states. The duration of the IPCEI ME/CT grants is planned to run until the end of 2029. The conditions to receive the IPCEI ME/CT government assistance include restrictions on eligible expenditures, employment retention, annual budget appropriations by the member states, compliance with member states’ regulations and project objectives and results, as well as repayment conditions. Our dedicated R&D teams across the involved member states under the IPCEI ME/CT program seek to innovate in core technologies across automotive, industrial and cybersecurity. This includes 5nm, advanced driving assistance and battery management systems in automotive, 6G and Ultra-Wideband as well as artificial intelligence (AI), RISC-V and post-quantum cryptography.\nIntellectual Property \nThe creation and use of intellectual property is a key aspect of our strategy to differentiate ourselves in the marketplace. We seek to protect our proprietary technologies by obtaining patents, trademarks, domain names, retaining trade secrets and defending, enforcing and utilizing our intellectual property rights, where appropriate. We believe this strategy allows us to preserve the advantages of our products and technologies, and helps us to improve the return on our investment in research and development. We have a broad portfolio of approximately 9,600 patent families (each patent family includes all patents and patent applications originating from the same invention). To protect confidential technical information and software, we rely on copyright and trade secret law and enter into confidentiality agreements as applicable. In situations where we believe that a third party has infringed on our intellectual property, we enforce our rights through all available legal means to the extent that we determine the benefits of such actions to outweigh the costs and risks involved. \nWe own a number of trademarks that are used in the conduct of our business. Where we consider it desirable, we develop names for our new products and secure trademark protection. Our trademarks allow us to further distinguish our company and our products and are important in our relationships with customers, suppliers, partners and end-users. \nWhile our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights constitute valuable assets, we do not view any individual right or asset as material to our operations as a whole. We believe it is the combination of our proprietary technology, patents, know-how and other intellectual property rights and assets that creates an advantage for our business. \nIn addition to obtaining our own patents and other intellectual property rights, we have entered into licensing agreements and other arrangements authorizing us to use intellectual property rights, confidential technical \n11\ninformation, software and other technology owned by third parties. We also engage, in certain instances, in licensing and selling of certain of our technology, patents and other intellectual property rights. \nCompetition \nWe compete with many different semiconductor companies on a global basis, including with both integrated device manufacturers (“IDMs”) as well as fabless companies. Nearly all our competitors invest extensively in research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing capabilities across a broad spectrum of product lines. Many of our competitors are focused on single applications or market segments. Most of our competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our product lines.  \nOur primary key public competitors in alphabetical order include, but are not limited to, Analog Devices Inc., Broadcom Inc., Infineon Technologies AG, Microchip Technology Inc., Qualcomm Inc., Renesas Electronics Corp., STMicroelectronics NV and Texas Instruments Inc. \nThe basis on which we compete varies across end markets and geographic regions. This includes competing on the basis of our ability to develop new products and the underlying intellectual property in a timely manner to meet customer requirements in terms of product features, quality, performance, warranty, availability and cost. In addition, we are asked to deliver full system capabilities which include multiple NXP devices and enabling software. This requires in-depth knowledge of specific applications in target markets in order to develop robust system solutions and qualified customer support resources.  \nSeasonality\nHistorically, our net revenue does not display consistent or predictable seasonal patterns.\nGovernment Regulation, including Environmental Regulation\nThe information set forth under the “Environmental remediation” caption of Note 15 of our notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report is incorporated herein by reference. For additional discussion of certain risks associated with government and environmental regulation, see Part I,",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”\nGovernance\nOur management is directly responsible for executing the Company’s risk management processes. Our Board is responsible for overseeing these risk management processes.\n \nIn exercising its oversight, the Board and, as appropriate, the relevant Board committees, assesses the material risks facing the Company and evaluate management’s plans for managing material risk exposures. The Company conducts a formal annual risk assessment to identify, analyze and report on enterprise risks. The results of this risk assessment are reported to and discussed with the Board.\nOur \nBoard\n performs this oversight function through periodic reports from management and Board committees. While our Board generally has ultimate oversight responsibility of the Company’s risk management processes, it has delegated to its committees the responsibility to oversee risk management processes associated with their respective areas of responsibility and expertise. \nThe Audit Committee has oversight responsibility for reviewing the effectiveness of NXP’s governance and management of IT risks, including those relating to business continuity, cybersecurity, malware, regulatory compliance and data management.\n \nNXP senior leadership\n regularly briefs the Audit Committee on cybersecurity matters and briefs the full Board on these issues at least annually or as needed.\nNXP’s CISO has over 20 years of relevant experience managing cybersecurity risks and is primarily responsible for managing the cybersecurity risks identified in the ERM process. This includes performing risk assessments, prioritizing the most likely and impactful risk elements, and recommending appropriate measures to mitigate the risk.",

    "item1c": "Item 1C. Cybersecurity\nRisk Management and Strategy\nNXP, similar to other semiconductor companies, operates in a complex and rapidly changing environment that involves many risks, including information and cybersecurity risks. As a leading technology company, we are committed to helping strengthen internet security and to implementing measures designed to protect our company against illicit activities, including cyberattacks and malware.\nNXP’s cybersecurity initiatives focus on strengthening our Core IT infrastructure and services against external threats, securing our manufacturing operations from compromise, limiting damage through processes and controls, and protecting our intellectual property. On a day-to-day basis, NXP identifies vulnerabilities, breach attempts, and possible criminal activity by external threat actors. Additionally, NXP has a supplier security framework that helps with monitoring and accessing the security of suppliers and third-party service providers. As part of the framework, we conduct due diligence which covers topics such as data protection, confidentiality, security, business continuity and incident management. These activities are covered by our process for cybersecurity risk management under our  Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”).\nNXP uses a multi-layer approach to identify and mitigate information security risks. On a tactical level, NXP maintains a 24x7 Security Operating Center (SOC) that actively monitors for and identifies cyber security threats and initiates appropriate mitigation processes. The SOC reports to the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), who can in case of an incident establish a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). When needed, a task force containing Security, IT, Communications, Legal and Business representatives is established. This task force leads mitigation activities where the potential threat or risk is elevated. In addition to SOC, the NXP IT Service Desk and NXP employees are trained to identify Cyber Security issues and to escalate them to correct owners. Furthermore, NXP has an Identify and Access Management System integrated with HR systems which helps manage employee life cycle processes, including both onboarding and offboarding NXP workers. \nThese systems are audited by internal and external audit teams.\n On a strategic level, NXP’s information technology risk management program is a component of the ERM process described below.\n \nNXP is certified and externally audited to ISO 27001 with certain additional certifications such as Common Criteria 6+, PCI DSS and GSMA Security for focused functions.\n We have multiple cybersecurity training initiatives as part of our information security training and compliance program. We regularly deploy simulated attacks and \n29\nrelated trainings. We deliver a Cyber Security orientation to new employees and maintain a library of cyber security learning sessions available to our employees. \nWhere appropriate, we use external service providers to assess, evaluate, test or otherwise assist with aspects of our security controls and processes.\nNXP’s program for Information Technology (IT) Risk Management is a component of NXP’s overall process for ERM.\nThe objectives of ERM are to:\n•\nIdentify our key risks in a timely manner, based upon quantitative and qualitative factors.\n•\nMitigate risk and keep risk impact at acceptable levels, particularly those risks that could result in a strategic impact event.\n•\nEnsure there is an effective risk-management framework in place which covers our key risks and is supported by risk-monitoring mechanisms.\n•\nPrioritize and align risk-management efforts, to use resources effectively.\n•\nEnsure risk-management governance, including quarterly monitoring, reporting and evaluation.\nKey ERM activities include:\n•\nAssessment (identification and evaluation of risks)\n•\nResponse (building capabilities, mitigation)\n•\nManagement Assurance (effective management methods, clear accountabilities)\n•\nMonitoring (audit, inquire, verify)\n•\nCommunication (internally and externally)\n•\nPeriodically evaluate effectiveness method\nTo date, we have experienced no cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected NXP, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition. We do not believe that cybersecurity threats resulting from any previous cybersecurity incidents of which we are aware are reasonably likely to materially affect NXP.
