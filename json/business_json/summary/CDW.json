Factors not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business . A reduction in vendor partner programs or funding or our failure to timely react to changes could have an adverse effect .\n A significant portion of our sales are derived from products manufactured by Apple, Cisco, Dell Technologies, HP Inc., Lenovo and Microsoft . There is no assurance that, as our vendor partners continue to sell directly to end users and through resellers, they will not limit or curtail the availability of their products to solutions providers like us .\n The technology industry is characterized by rapid innovation and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced hardware, software and services . A decrease in the rate of innovation, a lack of adoption of innovations by our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or cash flows . We have been and will continue to be dependent on innovations in technology, as well as the adoption of those innovations by customers .\n Certain of the hardware, software and services we offer increasingly utilize increasingly utilize AI .

If we use, enable or offer solutions that draw controversy due to their perceived or actual impact on society, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm and/or legal liability .\n AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition in the market and from other companies regarding such technologies . The responsible development and deployment of AI requires ongoing investment in research, development and governance, which could adversely affect our results of operation or cash flows . Substantial competition could reduce our market share and significantly harm our financial performance .\n Some of our competitors may reduce their prices in an attempt to stimulate their sales, which may require us to reduce our prices . Some of these companies have increased their services capabilities, which could potentially increase competition in the market to provide comprehensive technology solutions to customers . We need to focus on providing high quality service to gain new customers and retain existing customers .\n The success of our business depends on the continuing development, maintenance and operation of our information technology systems . If such a reduction in prices occurs and we are unable to attract new customers and sell increased quantities of products, our sales growth and profitability could be adversely affected . The quality and our utilization of the information generated by our information . systems could adversely affect, among other things, our ability to: conduct business with our customers, including delivering services and solutions to them .\n We have taken steps to protect our information technology systems from a variety of threats, both internal and external, and from human error, but there can be no guarantee that those steps will be effective . Software vulnerabilities within the third-party information technology software and systems we use are discovered and reported on nearly a daily basis . We take steps designed to contain and limit the impact on our business .\n If our information technology systems are not properly maintained or enhanced, the attention of our coworkers could be diverted and our ability to provide the level of service our customers demand could be constrained for some time . We may acquire new companies, businesses or sites with cybersecurity and data protection systems which may not conform with our standards . It may require significant time and expense to upgrade and integrate such systems and controls .\n We have privacy and data security policies, practices and controls in place that are designed to prevent security breaches . As newer technologies evolve, as more business is conducted over the internet and remotely, we have been subject to breaches in security .

Our future success will depend to a significant extent on the efforts of our leadership team, as well as the effectiveness of our succession planning and efforts to develop and promote top talent .\n A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our coworker base could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain coworkers . If we fail to effectively manage our workforce, we may need to terminate or reposition coworkers within our Company to eliminate an abundance of or to reconfigure resources .\n Failure by these outsource partners to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, including cybersecurity protections, could negatively impact our operations, expected cost savings or efficiencies .
