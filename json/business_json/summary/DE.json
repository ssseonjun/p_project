  "item1_summary": " The risks described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Forward-Looking Statements in this report are not the only risks we face . The risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated . Our financial results largely depend upon the agricultural market business cycle . Negative conditions in the agricultural industry and general economy cause weakened demand for our equipment and services .\n The demand for our products and services depends on the fundamentals in the markets in which we operate . Downturns in the agricultural industry due to these and other factors, which could vary by market, have resulted in decreases in demand for agricultural equipment . We expect certain of these conditions to persist in fiscal year 2025 .\n We may be unable to manage increasing political, economic, and social uncertainty in certain regions of the world, which could significantly change the dynamics of our product offerings . In Argentina, the government has certain capital and currency controls that restrict our ability to operate in the country . In some cases, these countries have greater political and economic volatility, greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions .\n Changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on various foreign countries could affect our ability to collect receivables, provide aftermarket warranty support for our equipment, and sell products . We may be affected by changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of renewable energy, which could impact the price of farm commodities . This could result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements .\n Changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials, components, and whole goods have resulted and could result in disruptions to the supply chain causing production disruptions, increased costs, and lower profits on sales of our products . Global logistics network challenges resulted in delays, shortages of key manufacturing components, increased order backlogs, increased transportation costs, which increased our overall production and overhead costs .\n We rely on our suppliers to acquire the raw materials, components, and whole goods required to manufacture their products . Disruptions to supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials and components have and could continue to adversely affect our ability to meet commitments to our customers . Failure by our supply base to use ethical business practices may adversely affect business, financial condition, and operational results .\n If suppliers or retail partners fail to comply with laws, regulations, safety codes, employment practices, human rights standards, quality standards, environmental standards, or other obligations, norms, identification and reporting requirements, or ethical standards . A lack of compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in product shortages .\n U.S. companies say unexpected weather events could negatively affect their business . They say they have closed some of their operations temporarily due to adverse weather conditions . Such events could also affect the supply of products from some of the world's largest companies . The company says it is not prepared to deal with the impact of these events .\n The potential physical impacts of climate change on our facilities, suppliers, and customers, and therefore on our operations, are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions . We heavily rely on certain trademarks to protect our identity and customer recognition of our products and services . The rationalization or restructuring of our manufacturing facilities may cause capacity constraints, inventory fluctuations, and other issues .\n Changes in tax rates, tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on our business . Manufacturing facilities, including relocating production or closing facilities, may result in temporary constraints on our ability to produce the quantity of products necessary to fill orders and thereby complete sales in a timely manner . New or expanded manufacturing operations in emerging markets, such as Brazil, could increase the risk of production delays .\n Certain assets and other reported items are denominated in foreign currencies, creating currency exchange and translation risk . Changes in interest rates or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect our financials and our earnings and/or cash flows . In Argentina, we have employed mechanisms to convert Argentine pesos into U.S. dollars to the extent possible .\n High interest rates can have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of our customers . Credit rating agencies, such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks, can affect the availability and cost of funding for us . Government policies on spending can also affect us, especially the CF segment, due to the impact of government spending .\n Negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact our operations and financial results . The financial services segment provides financing for a significant portion of our sales worldwide . Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of our Smart Industrial Operating Model and related business strategies in production systems, precision technologies, and aftermarket support could adversely affect our business .\n Several factors could impact our ability to successfully execute our Smart Industrial Operating Model . Failure to accurately assess market opportunities and the technology required to address such opportunities, among other things . The adoption of new regulations or policies supporting and/or subsidizing outputs that are inconsistent with our strategy, such as policies that have the effect of encouraging or supporting the use of conventional sources of energy .\n We compete on product performance, innovation and quality, distribution, sustainability, customer service, and price . Aggressive pricing or other strategies of competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing delays, or our failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs, adversely affects our business, results of operations, and financial condition . We need to have a thorough understanding of our existing and potential customers on a global basis, particularly in growth markets such as Argentina and Brazil .\n Failure to accurately forecast our needs may result in unmet market demand, parts shortages, manufacturing delays or inefficiencies . We rely on a network of independent dealers to manage the distribution of our products and services . If our dealers are unsuccessful with their sales and business operations, it could have an adverse effect on our overall sales and revenue .\n Our dealers carry inventories of finished products as part of their operations . If the inventory levels of our dealers are higher than they desire, they may postpone equipment purchases from us . Dealers could also have trouble funding their day-to-day cash flow needs and paying their obligations . The unavailability of specialized technicians to service our equipment may result in overburdening dealers’ .\n From time to time, we make strategic acquisitions and divestitures and participate in joint ventures . Acquisitions and joint ventures involve significant challenges and risks, including that the acquisitions or joint ventures do not advance our business strategy, or fail to produce satisfactory returns on investment . Other risks include: We may encounter difficulties integrating acquisitions with our operations, applying internal control processes to these acquisitions, managing strategic investments, assimilating new capabilities .\n Divestitures of businesses or dissolutions of joint ventures may involve significant challenges and risks, including failure to advance our business strategy, costs and disruptions to us, and negative effects on our product offerings, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition . Our brand depends on the ability to maintain a positive customer perception of the business .\n In fiscal year 2024, we experienced negative social media campaigns related to our approach to diversity and inclusion . Failure to attract, develop, engage, and retain qualified employees could impair our ability to execute our business strategy . If the reputation, culture, or image of our brands are damaged, or we receive negative publicity, our sales, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected .\n Failure to preserve our culture or focus on our values could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit talent . Disruptions to our manufacturing and parts-distribution facilities through various forms of labor disputes could adversely affect us . We may also conduct other workforce reductions in the future, if deemed appropriate for our business .\n Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise our information as well as information of our employees, customers, suppliers, and/or dealers . The secure operation of these information technology networks, and the processing and maintenance of this information, could affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition .\n Our information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to intrusion, damage, disruptions, or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals, employees’, suppliers’ or dealers’ error or malfeasance, supply chain compromise, power outages, computer viruses, ransomware or other malware, telecommunication or utility failures, terrorist acts, natural disasters .\n Some of our products include connectivity hardware and software typically used for remote system updates . Malicious threat actors have attempted, and may attempt in the future, to gain unauthorized access to such products . Any unauthorized access could result in loss of sales based on customers’ loss of confidence in our products, legal claims or proceedings against us .\n The use of artificial intelligence is a novel business model without an established track record . Data sourcing, technology, integration and process issues, programmed bias in decision-making algorithms, concerns over intellectual property, security concerns, and the protection of privacy could impair the adoption and acceptance of autonomous machine solutions . The development of our own artificial intelligence applications may require additional investment in the development of proprietary systems, models, or datasets, which are often complex .\n Failure of our technology systems to operate properly or effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, or difficulty in integrating new systems, could adversely affect our business . Changes to or reallocation of radio frequency (RF) bands could disrupt or degrade the reliability of our high precision augmented GPS System (GPS) or other RF technology .\n In January 2024, we entered into an agreement with SpaceX and its Starlink network to provide satellite communications (SATCOM) service to farmers facing rural connectivity challenges, with an initial focus on Brazil . If regulators sanction Starlink or Starlink is otherwise subject to other issues that impair its ability to operate its SATCOM solution, our rural connectivity offering would be adversely affected .\n Our global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations, the violation of which could expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, and other adverse effects . Changes to existing laws or regulations could adversely affect our business by increasing compliance costs, limiting our ability to offer a product or service, requiring changes to our business practices, or otherwise making our products and services less attractive to customers .\n In fiscal year 2024, we agreed to pay approximately $10.0 million to the Commission to resolve charges that the Company violated the FCPA arising out of improper payments by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Wirtgen Thailand . Restricted access to global markets could impair our ability to export goods and services from various manufacturing locations around the world .\n Trade restrictions, negotiation of new trade agreements, non-tariff trade barriers, local content requirements, and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products, including developments in U.S.-China trade relations, have limited, and could continue to limit, our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets .\n There is global consensus that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to alter the composition of Earth’s atmosphere . These considerations have led to new international, national, regional, and local legislative and regulatory responses . Regulators in Europe and the U.S. have also focused efforts on increasing disclosures by companies related to climate change and mitigation efforts .\n Legal proceedings, disputes and government inquiries and investigations could harm our business, financial condition, reputation, and brand . Environmental risk, which are continually evolving, could affect the financing operations and climate-risk processes developed by the segment . We are subject to a consolidated multidistrict class action lawsuit in the Northern District of Illinois alleging that we have engaged in attempted monopolization, exclusionary conduct, and restraint of the market for repair services for John Deere brand agricultural equipment .\n If our equipment fails to perform as expected, we may receive warranty claims and may have to perform post-sales repairs or recalls . We may also be subject to regulatory requirements and penalties that will impact our ability to develop, market, and sell equipment . This could also lead to product liability, breach of warranty, and consumer protection claims .\n At the management level, we maintain a dedicated global team of cybersecurity professionals (Cybersecurity Team) to prevent, detect, and respond to cyberthreats while monitoring and adapting to the evolving threat and technology landscapes . The Audit Review Committee of the Board of Directors shares oversight responsibilities of our cybersecurity program, including oversight of related risks, with the full Board .\n We use a risk-based, multi-layered information security strategy to assess, identify, and manage risks from cybersecurity threats . Our Cybersecurity Team meets frequently to monitor, assess, and address cybersecurity threats and incidents . We maintain cybersecurity policies, standards, and procedures, which include a cyber incident response plan .\n Cybersecurity Incident Response Team is responsible for cybersecurity incident oversight and response, as needed, depending on incident severity . Cybersecurity risks, including as a result of any previous cybersecurity incident, have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially affect, our business strategy, results of operations, or financial condition . However, we have seen an increase in cyberattack volume, frequency, and sophistication in the digital environment ."
