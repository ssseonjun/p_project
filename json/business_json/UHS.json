    "item1": "ITEM 1.  \nB\nusiness\n\n\nOur principal business is owning and operating, through our subsidiaries, acute care hospitals and outpatient facilities and behavioral health care facilities.\n \n\n\nAs of February 26, 2025, we owned and/or operated 359 inpatient facilities and 60 outpatient and other facilities, including the following, located in 39 states, Washington, D.C., the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico:\n\n\nAcute care facilities located in the U.S.:\n\n\n•\n28 inpatient acute care hospitals;\n\n\n•\n33 free-standing emergency departments, and;\n\n\n•\n10 outpatient centers & 1 surgical hospital.\n\n\nBehavioral health care facilities (331 inpatient facilities and 16 outpatient facilities):\n \n\n\nLocated in the U.S.:\n\n\n•\n181 inpatient behavioral health care facilities, and;\n\n\n•\n14 outpatient behavioral health care facilities. \n\n\nLocated in the U.K.:\n\n\n•\n147 inpatient behavioral health care facilities, and;\n\n\n•\n2 outpatient behavioral health care facilities.\n\n\nLocated in Puerto Rico:\n\n\n•\n3 inpatient behavioral health care facilities.\n\n\nNet revenues from our acute care hospitals, outpatient facilities and commercial health insurer accounted for 56% of our consolidated net revenues during 2024 and 57% during 2023. Net revenues from our behavioral health care facilities and commercial health insurer accounted for 44% of our consolidated net revenues during 2024 and 43% during 2023.\n \n\n\nOur behavioral health care facilities located in the U.K. generated net revenues of approximately $880 million in 2024 and $761 million in 2023. Total assets at our U.K. behavioral health care facilities were approximately $1.358 billion as of December 31, 2024 and $1.327 billion as of December 31, 2023.\n \n\n\nServices provided by our hospitals include general and specialty surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics, emergency room care, radiology, oncology, diagnostic care, coronary care, pediatric services, pharmacy services and/or behavioral health services. We provide capital resources as well as a variety of management services to our facilities, including central purchasing, information services, finance and control systems, facilities planning, physician recruitment services, administrative personnel management, marketing and public relations.\n\n\nAvailable Information\n\n\nWe are a Delaware corporation that was organized in 1979. Our principal executive offices are located at Universal Corporate Center, 367 South Gulph Road, P.O. Box 61558, King of Prussia, PA 19406. Our telephone number is (610) 768-3300.\n\n\nOur website is located at \nwww.uhs.com\n. Copies of our annual, quarterly and current reports that we file with the SEC, and any amendments to those reports, are available free of charge on our website. Our filings are also available to the public at the website maintained by the SEC, \nwww.sec.gov\n. The information posted on our website is not incorporated into this Annual Report. Our Board of Directors’ committee charters (Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, Nominating & Governance Committee and Quality and Compliance Committee), Code of Business Conduct and Corporate Standards applicable to all employees, Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, Corporate Governance Guidelines and our Code of Conduct, Corporate Compliance Manual and Compliance Policies and Procedures are available free of charge on our website. Copies of such reports and charters are available in print to any stockholder who makes a request. Such requests should be made to our Secretary at our King of Prussia, PA corporate headquarters. We intend to satisfy the disclosure requirement under Item 5.05 of Form 8-K relating to amendments to or waivers of any provision of our Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers by promptly posting this information on our website.\n\n\nIn accordance with Section 303A.12(a) of the New York Stock Exchange Listed Company Manual, we submitted our CEO’s certification to the New York Stock Exchange in 2024. Additionally, contained in Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, are our CEO’s and CFO’s certifications regarding the quality of our public disclosures under Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur Mission\n\n\nOur company mission is:\n\n\nTo provide superior quality healthcare services that\n \n\n\nPATIENTS recommend to families and friends,\n \n\n\nPHYSICIANS prefer for their patients,\n \n\n\nPURCHASERS select for their clients,\n \n\n\nEMPLOYEES are proud of, and\n \n\n\nINVESTORS seek for long-term returns.\n\n\nTo achieve this, we have a commitment to:\n\n\n•\nservice excellence\n\n\n•\ncontinuous improvement in measurable ways\n\n\n•\nemployee development\n\n\n•\nethical and fair treatment of all\n\n\n•\nteamwork\n\n\n•\ncompassion\n\n\n•\ninnovation in service delivery\n\n\nBusiness Strategy\n\n\nWe believe community-based hospitals will remain the focal point of the healthcare delivery network and we are committed to a philosophy of self-determination for both the company and our hospitals.\n\n\nAcquisition of Additional Hospitals.\n  We selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by acquiring, constructing or leasing additional hospital facilities. We are committed to a program of rational growth around our core businesses, while retaining the missions of the hospitals we manage and the communities we serve. Such expansion may provide us with access to new markets and new healthcare delivery capabilities. We also continue to examine our facilities and consider divestiture of those facilities that we believe do not have the potential to contribute to our growth or operating strategy. In recent years our behavioral health services segment has been focused on efforts to partner with non-UHS acute care hospitals to help operate their behavioral health services.  These arrangements include hospital purchases, leased beds and joint venture operating agreements.\n\n\nImprovement of Operations of Existing Hospitals and Services.\n  We also seek to increase the operating revenues and profitability of owned hospitals by the introduction of new services, improvement of existing services, physician recruitment and the application of financial and operational controls.\n\n\nWe are involved in continual development activities for the benefit of our existing facilities. From time-to-time applications are filed with state health planning agencies to add new services in existing hospitals in states which require certificates of need, or CONs. Although we expect that some of these applications will result in the addition of new facilities or services to our operations, no assurances can be made for ultimate success by us in these efforts.\n\n\nQuality and Efficiency of Services.\n  Pressures to contain healthcare costs and technological developments allowing more procedures to be performed on an outpatient basis have led payers to demand a shift to ambulatory or outpatient care wherever possible. We are responding to this trend by emphasizing the expansion of outpatient services. In addition, in response to cost containment pressures, we continue to implement programs at our facilities designed to improve financial performance and efficiency while continuing to provide quality care, including more efficient use of professional and paraprofessional staff, monitoring and adjusting staffing levels and equipment usage, improving patient management and reporting procedures and implementing more efficient billing and collection procedures. In addition, we will continue to emphasize innovation in our response to the rapid changes in regulatory trends and market conditions while fulfilling our commitment to patients, physicians, employees, communities and our stockholders.\n\n\nIn addition, our aggressive recruiting of highly qualified physicians and developing provider networks help to establish our facilities as an important source of quality healthcare in their respective communities.\n\n\nHospital Utilization\n\n\nWe believe that the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital include the quality and market position of the hospital and the number, quality and specialties of physicians providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe that the ability of a hospital to meet the health care needs of its community is determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that affect utilization include\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ngeneral and local economic conditions, market penetration of managed care programs, the degree of outpatient use, the availability of reimbursement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and demographic changes such as the growth in local populations. Utilization across the industry also is being affected by improvements in clinical practice, medical technology and pharmacology. Current industry trends in utilization and occupancy have been significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies of third party payers. We are also unable to predict the extent to which these industry trends will continue or accelerate. In addition, our acute care services business is typically subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, such as higher patient volumes and net patient service revenues in the first and fourth quarters of the year.\n\n\nSources of Revenue\n\n\nWe receive payments for services rendered from private insurers, including managed care plans, the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid programs and directly from patients. See \nItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Sources of Revenue\n for additional disclosure. Other information related to our revenues, income and other operating information for each reporting segment of our business is provided in \nNote 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, Segment Reporting.\n\n\nRegulation and Other Factors\n\n\nOverview:\n The healthcare industry is subject to numerous laws, regulations and rules including, among others, those related to government healthcare participation requirements, various licensure and accreditations, reimbursement for patient services, health information privacy and security rules, and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse provisions (including, but not limited to, federal statutes and regulations prohibiting kickbacks and other illegal inducements to potential referral sources, false claims submitted to federal or state health care programs and self-referrals by physicians). Providers that are found to have violated any of these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to significant fines or penalties and/or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to additional governmental inquiries or actions, or that we would not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties if so subjected. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, a significant governmental inquiry or action under one of the above laws, regulations or rules could have a material adverse impact on us.\n\n\nLicensing, Certification and Accreditation:\n All of our U.S. hospitals are subject to compliance with various federal, state and local statutes and regulations in the U.S. and receive periodic inspection by state licensing agencies to review standards of medical care, equipment and cleanliness. Our hospitals must also comply with the conditions of participation and licensing requirements of federal, state and local health agencies, as well as the requirements of municipal building codes, health codes and local fire departments. Various other licenses and permits are also required in order to dispense narcotics, operate pharmacies, handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment.  Our facilities in the United Kingdom are also subject to various laws and regulations.\n \n\n\nAll of our eligible hospitals have been accredited by The Joint Commission. All of our acute care hospitals and most of our behavioral health centers in the U.S. are certified as providers of Medicare and Medicaid services by the appropriate governmental authorities.\n\n\nIf any of our facilities were to lose its Joint Commission accreditation or otherwise lose its certification under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, the facility may be unable to receive reimbursement from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other payers. We believe our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal, state, local and independent review body regulations and standards. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel and services in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on operations.\n\n\nCertificates of Need:\n Certain of the states in which we operate hospitals have certificates of need (“CON”) laws as a condition prior to hospital capital expenditures, construction, expansion, modernization or initiation of major new services. Failure to obtain necessary state approval can result in our inability to complete an acquisition, expansion or replacement, the imposition of civil or, in some cases, criminal sanctions, the inability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement or the revocation of a facility’s license, which could harm our business. In addition, significant CON reforms have been proposed in a number of states that would increase the capital spending thresholds and provide exemptions of various services from review requirements. In the past, we have not experienced any material adverse effects from those requirements, but we cannot predict the impact of these changes upon our operations.\n\n\nConversion Legislation:\n Many states have enacted or are considering enacting laws affecting the conversion or sale of not-for-profit hospitals to for-profit entities. These laws generally require prior approval from the attorney general, advance notification and community involvement. In addition, attorneys general in states without specific conversion legislation may exercise discretionary authority over these transactions. Although the level of government involvement varies from state to state, the trend is to provide for increased governmental review and, in some cases, approval of a transaction in which a not-for-profit entity sells a health care facility\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nto a for-profit entity. The adoption of new or expanded conversion legislation and the increased review of not-for-profit hospital conversions may limit our ability to grow through acquisitions of not-for-profit hospitals.\n\n\nUtilization Review:\n Federal regulations require that admissions and utilization of facilities by Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed in order to ensure efficient utilization of facilities and services. The law and regulations require Quality Improvement Organizations (“QIOs”) to review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of diagnosis related group (“DRG”) classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay. QIOs may deny payment for services provided, assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that a provider that is in substantial non-compliance with the standards of the QIO be excluded from participating in the Medicare program. We have contracted with QIOs in each state where we do business to perform the required reviews.\n\n\nAudits:\n Most hospitals are subject to federal audits to validate the accuracy of Medicare and Medicaid program submitted claims. If these audits identify overpayments, we could be required to pay a substantial rebate of prior years’ payments subject to various administrative appeal rights. The federal government contracts with third-party “recovery audit contractors” (“RACs”) and “Medicaid integrity contractors” (“MICs”), on a contingent fee basis, to audit the propriety of payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers. Similarly, Medicare zone program integrity contractors (“ZPICs”) target claims for potential fraud and abuse. Additionally, Medicare administrative contractors (“MACs”) must ensure they pay the right amount for covered and correctly coded services rendered to eligible beneficiaries by legitimate providers. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) consolidated many of these Medicare and Medicaid program integrity functions into new unified program integrity contractors (“UPICs”), though it remains unclear what effect, if any, this consolidation may have. We have undergone claims audits related to our receipt of federal healthcare payments during the last three years, the results of which have not required material adjustments to our consolidated results of operations. However, potential liability from future federal or state audits could ultimately exceed established reserves, and any excess could potentially be substantial. Further, Medicare and Medicaid regulations also provide for withholding Medicare and Medicaid overpayments in certain circumstances, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\n\n\nSelf-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation\n\n\nThe Stark Law:\n The Social Security Act includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” This law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they or any of their immediate family members have a financial relationship, unless an exception is met. These types of referrals are known as “self-referrals.” Medicare may deny payment for all services related to a prohibited referral and a hospital that has billed for prohibited services may be obligated to refund the amounts collected.  In addition, sanctions for violation of the Stark Law may include civil penalties or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. There are a number of exceptions to the self-referral prohibition, including an exception for a physician’s ownership interest in an entire hospital as opposed to an ownership interest in a hospital department unit, service or subpart. However, federal laws and regulations now limit the ability of hospitals relying on this exception to expand aggregate physician ownership interest or to expand certain hospital facilities. This regulation also places a number of compliance requirements on physician-owned hospitals related to reporting of ownership interest. There are also exceptions for many of the customary financial arrangements between physicians and providers, including employment contracts, leases and recruitment agreements that adhere to certain enumerated requirements.  CMS issued a final rule in 2020 that created a new Stark exception for value-based models. Although the final regulations provide exceptions to the Stark Law, there may remain regulatory risks for participating hospitals, as well as financial and operational risks.\n\n\nWe monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Nonetheless, because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, there can be no assurance that federal regulatory authorities will not determine that any of our arrangements with physicians violate the Stark Law.\n\n\nAnti-kickback Statute:\n A provision of the Social Security Act known as the “anti-kickback statute” prohibits healthcare providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying money or other remuneration to other individuals and entities in return for using, referring, ordering, recommending or arranging for such referrals or orders of services or other items covered by a federal or state health care program. However, changes to the anti-kickback statute have reduced the intent required for violation; one is no longer required to have actual knowledge or specific intent to commit a violation of the anti-kickback statute in order to be found in violation of such law.\n\n\nThe anti-kickback statute contains certain exceptions, and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) has issued regulations that provide for “safe harbors,” from the federal anti-kickback statute for various activities. These activities, which must meet certain requirements, include (but are not limited to) the following: investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, donation of technology for electronic health records and referral agreements for specialty services. In 2020, the OIG\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nissued a final rule that established an anti-kickback statute safe harbor for value based models. Although the final regulations provide safe harbors, there may remain regulatory risks for participating hospitals, as well as financial and operational risks.  The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or exception does not automatically render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the anti-kickback statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.\n\n\nAlthough we believe that our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance that all arrangements comply with an available safe harbor or that regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements do not violate the anti-kickback statute or other applicable laws. Violations of the anti-kickback statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $100,000 for each violation or imprisonment, however, under 18 U.S.C. Section 3571, this fine may be increased to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for organizations. Civil money penalties may include fines and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid.\n\n\nSimilar State Laws:\n Many of the states in which we operate have adopted laws that prohibit payments to physicians in exchange for referrals similar to the anti-kickback statute and the Stark Law, some of which apply regardless of the source of payment for care. These statutes typically provide criminal and civil penalties as well as loss of licensure. In many instances, the state statutes provide that any arrangement falling in a federal safe harbor will be immune from scrutiny under the state statutes. However, in most cases, little precedent exists for the interpretation or enforcement of these state laws.\n\n\nThese laws and regulations are extremely complex and, in many cases, we don’t have the benefit of regulatory or judicial interpretation. It is possible that different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our current or past practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities, equipment, personnel, services, capital expenditure programs and operating expenses. A determination that we have violated one or more of these laws, or the public announcement that we are being investigated for possible violations of one or more of these laws (see Item 3. Legal Proceedings), could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations and our business reputation could suffer significantly. In addition, we cannot predict whether other legislation or regulations at the federal or state level will be adopted, what form such legislation or regulations may take or what their impact on us may be.\n\n\nIf we are deemed to have failed to comply with the anti-kickback statute, the Stark Law or other applicable laws and regulations, we could be subjected to liabilities, including criminal penalties, civil penalties (including the loss of our licenses to operate one or more facilities), and exclusion of one or more facilities from participation in the Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs. The imposition of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n\nFederal False Claims Act and Similar State Regulations:\n A current trend affecting the health care industry is the increased use of the federal False Claims Act, and, in particular, actions being brought by individuals on the government’s behalf under the False Claims Act’s qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions. Whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government by alleging that the defendant has defrauded the Federal government.\n\n\nWhen a defendant is determined by a court of law to have violated the False Claims Act, the defendant may be liable for up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim. There are many potential bases for liability under the False Claims Act. Liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (“FERA”) amended and expanded the number of actions for which liability may attach under the False Claims Act, eliminating requirements that false claims be presented to federal officials or directly involve federal funds. FERA also clarifies that a false claim violation occurs upon the knowing retention, as well as the receipt, of overpayments. In addition, recent changes to the anti-kickback statute have made violations of that law punishable under the civil False Claims Act. Further, a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit on behalf of the state in state court. The False Claims Act require that federal healthcare program overpayments be returned within 60 days from the date the overpayment was identified, or by the date any corresponding cost report was due, whichever is later. Failure to return an overpayment within this period may result in additional civil False Claims Act liability.\n\n\nOther Fraud and Abuse Provisions:\n The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for submitting false claims to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services not rendered, billing for services without prescribed documentation, misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement and cost report fraud. Like the anti-kickback statute, these provisions are very broad.\n\n\nFurther, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) broadened the scope of the fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud offenses that apply to all health benefit programs, whether or not payments under such programs are paid pursuant to federal programs. HIPAA also introduced enforcement mechanisms to prevent fraud and abuse in Medicare. There are civil penalties for prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to billing for medically unnecessary products or services.\n\n\n5\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy Requirements:\n The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HIPAA also established federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information, including recently proposed updates to HIPAA security rule requirements. The privacy and security regulations address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed. Violations of HIPAA can result in both criminal and civil fines and penalties.\n\n\nWe believe that we are in material compliance with the privacy regulations of HIPAA, as we continue to develop training and revise procedures to address ongoing compliance. The HIPAA security regulations require health care providers to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of patient information. HITECH has since strengthened certain HIPAA rules regarding the use and disclosure of protected health information, extended certain HIPAA provisions to business associates, and created new security breach notification requirements. HITECH has also extended the ability to impose civil money penalties on providers not knowing that a HIPAA violation has occurred. We believe that we have been in substantial compliance with HIPAA and HITECH requirements to date. HIPAA regulations may result in greater compliance requirements for healthcare providers, including obligations to report breaches of unsecured patient data, as well as potential liabilities resulting from the actions of parties acting as business associates on our behalf.\n\n\nRed Flags Rule:\n In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Red Flags Rule requires financial institutions and businesses maintaining accounts to address the risk of identity theft. The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010, signed on December 18, 2010, appears to exclude certain healthcare providers from the Red Flags Rule, but permits the FTC or relevant agencies to designate additional creditors subject to the Red Flags Rule through future rulemaking if the agencies determine that the person in question maintains accounts subject to foreseeable risk of identity theft. Compliance with any such future rulemaking may require additional expenditures in the future.\n\n\nPatient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005:\n On July 29, 2005, the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 was enacted, which has the goal of reducing medical errors and increasing patient safety. This legislation establishes a confidential reporting structure in which providers can voluntarily report “Patient Safety Work Product” (“PSWP”) to “Patient Safety Organizations” (“PSOs”). Under the system, PSWP is made privileged, confidential and legally protected from disclosure. PSWP does not include medical, discharge or billing records or any other original patient or provider records but does include information gathered specifically in connection with the reporting of medical errors and improving patient safety. This legislation does not preempt state or federal mandatory disclosure laws concerning information that does not constitute PSWP. PSOs are certified by the Secretary of the HHS for three-year periods and analyze PSWP, provide feedback to providers and may report non-identifiable PSWP to a database. In addition, PSOs are expected to generate patient safety improvement strategies.\n\n\nEnvironmental Regulations:\n Our healthcare operations generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations. Infectious waste generators, including hospitals, face substantial penalties for improper disposal of medical waste, including civil penalties of up to $25,000 per day of noncompliance, criminal penalties of up to $50,000 per day, imprisonment, and remedial costs. In addition, our operations, as well as our purchases and sales of facilities are subject to various other environmental laws, rules and regulations. We believe that our disposal of such wastes is in material compliance with all state and federal laws.\n\n\nCorporate Practice of Medicine:\n Several states, including Florida, Nevada, California and Texas, have laws and/or regulations that prohibit corporations and other entities from employing physicians and practicing medicine for a profit or that prohibit certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers that are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes and/or regulations vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies. We do not expect these state corporate practice of medicine proscriptions to significantly affect our operations. Many states have laws and regulations which prohibit payments for referral of patients and fee-splitting with physicians. We do not make any such payments or have any such arrangements.\n\n\nEMTALA:\n All of our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This federal law generally requires hospitals with an emergency department that are certified providers under Medicare to conduct a medical screening examination of every person who visits the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from a medical emergency, to either stabilize the patient’s condition or transfer the patient to a facility that can better handle the condition. Our obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In addition to any liabilities that a hospital may incur under EMTALA, an injured patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a\n \n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\ndirect result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital unrelated to the rights granted under that statute.\n\n\nThe federal government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which patients do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. EMTALA does not generally apply to patients admitted for inpatient services; however, CMS has sought industry comments on the potential applicability of EMTALA to hospital inpatients and the responsibilities of hospitals with specialized capabilities, respectively. CMS has not yet issued regulations or guidance in response to that request for comments. The government also has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the future. We believe that we operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.\n\n\nHealth Care Industry Investigations:\n We are subject to claims and suits in the ordinary course of business, including those arising from care and treatment afforded by our hospitals and are party to various government investigations and litigation. Please see \nItem 3. Legal Proceedings\n included herein for additional disclosure. In addition, currently, and from time to time, some of our facilities are subjected to inquiries and/or actions and receive notices of potential non-compliance of laws and regulations from various federal and state agencies. Providers that are found to have violated these laws and regulations may be excluded from participating in government healthcare programs, subjected to potential licensure, certification, and/or accreditation revocation, subjected to fines or penalties or required to repay amounts received from the government for previously billed patient services.\n\n\nWe monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigation or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with industry practices, including ours. Although we believe our policies, procedures and practices comply with governmental regulations, no assurance can be given that we will not be subjected to inquiries or actions, or that we will not be faced with sanctions, fines or penalties in connection with the investigations. Even if we were to ultimately prevail, the government’s inquiry and/or action in connection with these matters could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results.\n\n\nOur substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings may result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate additional investigations or litigation in the future and that such matters could result in significant penalties as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and/or managers could be included as targets or witnesses in governmental investigations or litigation and/or named as defendants in private litigation.\n\n\nRevenue Rulings 98-15 and 2004-51:\n In March 1998 and May 2004, the IRS issued guidance regarding the tax consequences of joint ventures between for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals. As a result of the tax rulings, the IRS has proposed, and may in the future propose, to revoke the tax-exempt or public charity status of certain not-for-profit entities which participate in such joint ventures or to treat joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income to them. The tax rulings have limited development of joint ventures and any adverse determination by the IRS or the courts regarding the tax-exempt or public charity status of a not-for-profit partner or the characterization of joint venture income as unrelated business taxable income could further limit joint venture development with not-for-profit hospitals, and/or require the restructuring of certain existing joint ventures with not-for-profits.\n\n\nState Rate Review:\n Some states where we operate hospitals have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, state rate reviews and indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations.\n\n\nMedical Malpractice Tort Law Reform:\n Medical malpractice tort law has historically been maintained at the state level. All states have laws governing medical liability lawsuits. Over half of the states have limits on damages awards. Almost all states have eliminated joint and several liability in malpractice lawsuits, and many states have established limits on attorney fees. Many states had bills introduced in their legislative sessions to address medical malpractice tort reform. Proposed solutions include enacting limits on non-economic damages, malpractice insurance reform, and gathering lawsuit claims data from malpractice insurance companies and the courts for the purpose of assessing the connection between malpractice settlements and premium rates. Reform legislation has also been proposed, but not adopted, at the federal level that could preempt additional state legislation in this area.\n\n\nCompliance Program:\n Our company-wide compliance program has been in place since 1998. Currently, the program’s elements include a Code of Conduct, risk area specific policies and procedures, employee education and training, an internal system for reporting concerns, auditing and monitoring programs, and a means for enforcing the program’s policies.\n\n\nSince its initial adoption, the compliance program continues to be expanded and developed to meet the industry’s expectations and our needs. Specific written policies, procedures, training and educational materials and programs, as well as auditing and monitoring activities have been prepared and implemented to address the functional and operational aspects of our business. Specific areas identified through regulatory interpretation and enforcement activities have also been addressed in our program. Claims preparation and submission, including coding, billing, and cost reports, comprise the bulk of these areas. Financial arrangements with physicians and other referral sources, including compliance with anti-kickback and Stark laws and emergency department treatment and transfer requirements are also the focus of policy and training, standardized documentation requirements, and review and audit.\n\n\n7\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nUnited Kingdom Regulation: \nOur operations in the United Kingdom are also subject to a high level of regulation relating to registration and licensing requirements, employee regulation, clinical standards, environmental rules as well as other areas. We are also subject to a highly regulated business environment, and failure to comply with the various laws and regulations applicable to us could lead to substantial penalties and other adverse effects on our business.\n\n\nHuman Capital Management\n\n\nEmployees and Medical Staff\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had approximately 99,000 total employees consisting of: (i) approximately 86,000 employees located in the U.S., of which approximately 63,000 were employed full-time, and; (ii) approximately 13,000 employees located in the U.K. Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians who have been admitted to the medical staff of individual hospitals. In a number of our markets, physicians may have admitting privileges at other hospitals in addition to ours. Within our acute care division, approximately 370 physicians are employed by physician practice management subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals also serve on the medical staffs of hospitals not owned by us and may terminate their affiliation with our hospitals at any time. In addition, within our behavioral health division, approximately 510 physicians are employed by subsidiaries of ours either directly or through contracts with affiliated group practices structured as 501A corporations. Each of our hospitals is managed on a day-to-day basis by a chief executive officer employed by a subsidiary of ours. In addition, a Board of Governors, including members of the hospital’s medical staff, governs the medical, professional and ethical practices at each hospital. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.\n \n\n\nLabor Relations\n\n\nApproximately 970 of our employees at three of our hospitals are unionized. At Valley Hospital Medical Center, housekeeping and dietary employees are represented by the Culinary Workers Union, Local 226, and engineers are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers. At Brooke Glen Behavioral Hospital, unionized employees are represented by the Teamsters, and registered nurses are represented by the Northwestern Nurses Association/Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals. At the George Washington University Hospital, registered nurses are represented by the District of Columbia Nurses Association.\n\n\nCulture and Work Environment\n\n\nDuring orientation, newly hired employees learn our mission, vision, principles and values, key policies and procedures, a summary of the various benefits and resources available, and perhaps most notably, an overview of our founding principle, Service Excellence. Learning key attributes of our Service Excellence standards, which include continuous improvement, employee development, ethical and fair treatment of all, teamwork, quality, compassion and innovation in service delivery, provides newly hired employees a thorough understanding of our company culture. Other components of our Service Excellence standards, which include treating everyone as a guest, demonstrating professionalism and excellence and practicing teamwork, are shared to help guide the desired approach to day-to-day activities.\n \n\n\nService Excellence Facilitator Certification Workshops are available for facility employees identified by their leadership for consistently upholding and demonstrating our Service Excellence standards. Certified facilitators foster the Service Excellence culture and deliver training at their facilities.  In 2024, we held 12 workshops with 137 individuals certified as Service Excellence Facilitators.\n\n\nDuring 2024, we strengthened our recruitment efforts, improved the overall hiring and onboarding experience (89% very satisfied/satisfied with overall recruitment process), expanded the training resources employees need to do their jobs effectively and safely, facilitated more teamwork and collaboration, addressed burnout, expanded mentorship and increased employee engagement.\n\n\nWe conducted an Employee Engagement Survey and had an overall participation rate of 72% across the organization. 83% of staff indicated “I feel included on my team/work unit.” Engagement efforts such as services awards, safety programs and employee-led service excellence/culture committees has assisted with increased employee retention.\n \n\n\nEthical Standards\n\n\nEach member of our Board of Directors and senior management is committed to healthcare operations that are ethical and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\n\nWe are committed to fostering a culture of accountability at all levels and encourage our employees to report anything they believe could be noncompliant with our values. We prohibit retaliation for the good faith reporting of compliance concerns and offer the ability for individuals to anonymously elevate any concerns. Our commitment to fairness and integrity extends to everyone with whom we interact and do business.\n\n\nHealth and Safety\n\n\nPolicies and training programs to encourage work safety are a major focus in our organization. We continue to promote the \nemployee assistance program which has provided a superior level of service to all our employees and members of their households.\n \n\n\n8\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nW\ne have continuous training on workplace safety and launched a “We Care” program guide to ensure our hospitals support employees in a detailed way in the event of an employee injury.\n \n\n\nEmployee Development\n\n\nIn keeping with our culture of continuous improvement, training opportunities are available for all employees, regardless of level or status. These include formal instructor-led, in-person or virtual training, informal mentoring or networking opportunities, or self-administered online courses.\n \n\n\nTraining programs are designed to assist with personal and skill development, career advancement and succession planning. In addition to mandatory training that focus on keeping employees mindful and informed of key policies and skill sets, many are voluntary. All training is tailored to include potential Americans with Disabilities Act accommodations.\n \n\n\nAcross the company, we offer educational and work opportunities, including internships, externships and clinical field placement opportunities. We have partnered with Chamberlin University and Drexel University to provide their students with opportunities to earn clinical experience at our healthcare facilities. In 2024, Chamberlin University students participated in more than 1,000 clinical rotations at various acute care and behavioral health care facilities of ours nationwide.\n \n\n\nWe also offer financial assistance programs, such as  educational reimbursement, to support employees participating in degree, certification and continuing education programs.\n\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity\n\n\nWe are committed to the principle of Equal Employment Opportunity (\"EEO\") for all employees and applicants. As an EEO Employer we support, and are fully committed, to recruitment, selection, placement, promotion and compensation of all individuals without regard to race, color, religion, age (40 and over or as otherwise defined by applicable law), sex (including pregnancy, gender identity, and sexual orientation), genetic information (including family medical history), national origin, disability status, protected veteran status or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws.\n\n\nWe value each member of our team and are committed to treating everyone with dignity and respect. Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion includes regularly monitoring employment practices to ensure inclusivity regardless of an employee’s gender, race or ethnicity and championing for inclusive behaviors through leadership example, policies and procedures, training and special events.\n\n\nEmployee Assistance\n \n\n\nWe continue to support the overall health and financial well-being of our employees across the extensive programs and benefit plans that we offer. Employees can access the UHS Resource Guide which provides details on access to the benefits, resources and support tools available to employees throughout our organization.\n\n\nIn 2024, the UHS Foundation continued to support employees and their families who suffered losses due to natural disasters across the country, including tornados in Arkansas and Tennessee, Hurricane Beryl (in Texas) and Hurricanes Debby, Milton and Helene (in Florida).\n \n\n\nEnvironmental\n\n\nWe have implemented environmentally sustainable practices and we comply with applicable legal and regulatory environmental standards to protect our patients, visitors, staff and local communities. Our environmental stewardship includes following best practices when managing energy usage, constructing and designing new builds and/or major renovations and protecting the local environment.\n \n\n\n•\nSmart building technology and automation are used across our enterprise to monitor and inform energy management decisions. Centralized Utility Billing Management System effectively monitors energy usage across our U.S. facilities, signaling significant deviations from normal usage consumption patterns. Automatic fault detection and diagnostics software is implemented in approximately 75% of our acute care hospitals to monitor the efficiencies of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning operations. Most of these facilities also utilize retro-commissioning and monitoring-based commissioning. \n\n\n•\nAll of our newly built facilities, or those undergoing major renovation, are required to meet, or exceed, all federal, state and local energy efficient codes, use mechanical-electrical-plumbing systems to optimize energy efficiencies and water conservation and be equipped with 100% emergency back-up generators, with 96 hours of fuel.\nNew construction or major renovation projects costing at least $20 million are required to be assessed for Green Globes® and/or U.S. Green Building Council’s Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design certifications. All newly constructed acute care facilities are also expected to achieve an ENERGY STAR® Portfolio Manager Score of 90 or higher. \n\n\n9\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nOur facilities have policies and procedures that are compliant with the applicable laws from the Environmental Protection Agency, local departments of health and other regulators who oversee the responsible disposal of pollution and waste. \nOur Water Management Program (“WMP”), which is co-managed jointly by a third-party company specializing in water safety, oversees programs for potable and process water (e.g., surgical instrument processing) as well as utility water (e.g., cooling tower, boilers) through active management and hazard control validation. The WPM is designed to ensure safe water throughout our buildings and meets ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 188 (Legionellosis: Risk Management for Building Water Systems). The WPM recently incorporated current ANSI/AAMI ST108: 2023 Water standards for the processing of medical devices and standardized ”flushing protocols” for facilities to use during terminal cleaning process. \n\n\n•\nOur facilities located in the U.K. advanced several environmentally friendly initiatives in 2024 and continued to procure 100% of their electricity from renewable sources. To date, the emission reduction targets for these facilities include:\n\n\no\nNet zero carbon for direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions by 2035.\n\n\no\nNet zero carbon emissions in supply chain (Scope 3) by 2040.\n\n\n•\nBy January 2024,  a vehicle tracking and driver training device program, Lightfoot, was installed on all company-owned vehicles utilized in the U.K. Collectively, the program has reduced CO2 emissions by 236 metric tons across the vehicle fleet since it was introduced in 2020.   \n\n\nOur leadership teams actively manage opportunities and risks related to our facilities, including those related to climate change and other environmental risks.\n \n\n\nRevenue and volume trends may be affected by seasonal and severe weather conditions, including the effects of extreme low temperatures, hurricanes and tornadoes, earthquakes, climate change, current local economic and demographic changes. We have a high concentration of facilities in various geographic areas, including states that have a potentially higher risk of experiencing events such as severe weather conditions and earthquakes. Given the location of our facilities, we are particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase, or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, earthquakes, or tornadoes. Any significant loss due to a natural disaster may not be covered by insurance and may lead to an increase in the cost of insurance or unavailability on acceptable terms. Climate change may also have effects on our business by increasing the cost of property insurance or making coverage unavailable on acceptable terms. To the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our facilities are located, we may experience increased frequency of severe weather conditions or natural disasters or other changes to weather patterns, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, or cash flow may be adversely affected.\n \n\n\nIn addition, operations may be subject to increases in energy prices as well as increased government regulation, such as the limiting of greenhouse gas emissions, intended to mitigate the impact of climate change, severe weather patterns, or natural disasters. These could result in additional required capital and/or operational expenditures to comply with such regulation without a corresponding increase in our revenues.\n\n\nCompetition\n\n\nThe health care industry is highly competitive. In recent years, competition among healthcare providers for patients has intensified in the United States due to, among other things, regulatory and technological changes, increasing use of managed care payment systems, cost containment pressures and a shift toward outpatient treatment. In all of the geographical areas in which we operate, there are other facilities that provide services comparable to those offered by our facilities. In addition, some of our competitors include hospitals that are owned by tax-supported governmental agencies or by nonprofit corporations and may be supported by endowments and charitable contributions and exempt from property, sale and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to us.\n\n\nIn some markets, certain of our competitors may have greater financial resources, be better equipped and offer a broader range of services than us. Certain hospitals that are located in the areas served by our facilities are specialty or large hospitals that provide medical, surgical and behavioral health services, facilities and equipment that are not available at our hospitals. The increase in outpatient treatment and diagnostic facilities, including outpatient surgical centers and addiction treatment centers offering medically assisted treatments, also increases competition for us.  In addition, some of our hospitals face competition from hospitals or surgery centers that are physician owned.\n\n\nThe number and quality of the physicians on a hospital’s staff are important factors in determining a hospital’s success and competitive advantage. Typically, physicians are responsible for making hospital admissions decisions and for directing the course of patient treatment. We believe that physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the patient’s needs and insurance coverage, the quality of other physicians on the medical staff, the location of the hospital and the breadth and scope of services offered at the hospital’s facilities. We strive to retain and attract qualified doctors by maintaining high ethical and professional standards and providing adequate support personnel, technologically advanced equipment and facilities that meet the needs of those physicians.\n\n\n10\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, we depend on the efforts, abilities, and experience of our medical support personnel, including our nurses and other health care professionals, as well as non-professionals such as mental health technicians. We compete with other health care providers in recruiting and retaining qualified hospital management, nurses and other medical personnel.\n \n\n\nCertain states in which we operate hospitals have CON laws. The application process for approval of additional covered services, new facilities, changes in operations and capital expenditures is, therefore, highly competitive in these states. In those states that do not have CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See “Regulation and Other Factors.”\n\n\nOur ability to negotiate favorable service contracts with purchasers of group health care services also affects our competitive position and significantly affects the revenues and operating results of our hospitals. Managed care plans, including managed Medicare and Medicaid plans, attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and to demand that we accept lower rates of payment. In addition, employers and traditional health insurers are increasingly interested in containing costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges. In return, hospitals secure commitments for a larger number of potential patients. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care service purchasers on the basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. The importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market depending on the market strength of such organizations.\n\n\nAn element of our growth strategy is expansion through the acquisition of additional hospitals in select markets. The competition to acquire hospitals is significant. We compete for acquisitions with other for-profit health care companies, private equity and venture capital firms, as well as not-for-profit entities. Some of our competitors have greater resources than we do. We intend to selectively seek opportunities to expand our base of operations by adhering to our disciplined program of rational growth, but may not be successful in accomplishing acquisitions on favorable terms.\n\n\nRelationship with Universal Health Realty Income Trust\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we held approximately 5.7% of the outstanding shares of Universal Health Realty Income Trust (the “Trust”). We serve as Advisor to the Trust under an annually renewable advisory agreement, which is scheduled to expire on December 31\nst\n of each year, pursuant to the terms of which we conduct the Trust’s day-to-day affairs, provide administrative services and present investment opportunities. The advisory agreement was renewed by the Trust for 2025 at the same rate in place for 2024, 2023 and 2022, providing for an advisory computation at 0.70% of the Trust’s average invested real estate assets. We earned an advisory fee from the Trust, which is included in net revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, of approximately $5.5 million during 2024, approximately $5.3 million during 2023 and $5.1 million during 2022.\n\n\nIn addition, certain of our officers and directors are also officers and/or directors of the Trust. Management believes that it has the ability to exercise significant influence over the Trust, therefore we account for our investment in the Trust using the equity method of accounting.\n\n\nOur pre-tax share of income from the Trust was $1.1 million during 2024, $874,000 during 2023 and $1.2 million during 2022, which are included in other income (expense), net, on the accompanying consolidated statements of income for each year. We received dividends from the Trust amounting to $2.3 million during each of 2024 and 2023 and $2.2 million during 2022.  The carrying value of our investment in the Trust was $5.8  million and $7.0 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The market value of our investment in the Trust was $29.3 million at December 31, 2024 and $34.1 million at December 31, 2023, based on the closing price of the Trust’s stock on the respective dates.\n\n\nThe Trust commenced operations in 1986 by purchasing certain hospital properties from us and immediately leasing the properties back to our respective subsidiaries. The base rents are paid monthly and the bonus rents, which effective as of January 1, 2022 are applicable only to McAllen Medical Center, are computed and paid on a quarterly basis, based upon a computation that compares current quarter revenue to a corresponding quarter in the base year. The leases with those subsidiaries are unconditionally guaranteed by us and are cross-defaulted with one another.\n\n\nOn December 31, 2021, we entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with the Trust, which was amended during the first quarter of 2022, pursuant to the terms of which: (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours purchased from the Trust the real estate assets of the Inland Valley Campus of Southwest Healthcare System located in Wildomar, California, at its fair market value; (ii)  two wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours transferred to the Trust, at their respective fair-market values, the real estate assets of Aiken Regional Medical Center (“Aiken”), located in Aiken, South Carolina (which includes a 211-bed acute care hospital and a 62-bed behavioral health facility), and Canyon Creek Behavioral Health (“Canyon Creek”), located in Temple, Texas, and; (iii) we received approximately $4.1 million in cash from the Trust.\n\n\nAs a result of the purchase options within the lease agreements for Aiken and Canyon Creek, the asset purchase and sale transaction is accounted for as a failed sale leaseback in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have accounted for the asset exchange and substitution transaction with the Trust as a financing arrangement and, since we did not derecognize the real property related to Aiken\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nand Canyon Creek, we will continue to depreciate the assets. Our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 reflects a financial liability of $73.8 million and $77.5 million, respectively, which is included in debt, for the fair value of real estate assets that we exchanged as part of the transaction. Our monthly lease payments payable to the Trust will be recorded to interest expense and as a reduction to the outstanding financial liability. The amount allocated to interest expense is determined using our incremental borrowing rate and is based on the outstanding financial liability.\n\n\nThe aggregate rent payable to the Trust in connection with the leases on McAllen Medical Center, Wellington Regional Medical Center, Aiken Regional Medical Center and Canyon Creek Behavioral Health was approximately $21.2 million during 2024 and $20.6 million during 2023.\n \n\n\nPursuant to the Master Leases by certain subsidiaries of ours and the Trust as described in the table below, dated 1986 and 2021 (“the Master Leases”) which govern the leases of McAllen Medical Center and Wellington Regional Medical Center (each of which is governed by the Master Lease dated 1986), and Aiken Regional Medical Center and Canyon Creek Behavioral Health (each of which is governed by the Master Lease dated 2021), we have the option to renew the leases at the lease terms described above and below by providing notice to the Trust at least 90 days prior to the termination of the then current term. We also have the right to purchase the respective leased hospitals at their appraised fair market value upon any of the following: (i) at the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms; (ii) upon one month’s notice should a change of control of the Trust occur, or; (iii) within the time period as specified in the lease in the event that we provide notice to the Trust of our intent to offer a substitution property/properties in exchange for one (or more) of the hospital properties leased from the Trust should we be unable to reach an agreement with the Trust on the properties to be substituted.  In addition, we have rights of first refusal to: (i) purchase the respective leased facilities during and for a specified period after the lease terms at the same price, terms and conditions of any third-party offer, or; (ii) renew the lease on the respective leased facility at the end of, and for a specified period after, the lease term at the same terms and conditions pursuant to any third-party offer.\n\n\nIn addition, we are the managing, majority member in a joint venture with an unrelated third-party that operates Clive Behavioral Health, a 100-bed behavioral health care facility located in Clive, Iowa. The real property of this facility, which was completed and opened in late 2020, is also leased from the Trust (annual rental of approximately $2.8 million, $2.7 million and $2.6 million during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively) pursuant to the lease terms as provided in the table below. In connection with the lease on this facility, the joint venture has the right to purchase the leased facility from the Trust at its appraised fair market value upon either of the following: (i) by providing notice at least 270 days prior to the end of the lease terms or any renewal terms, or; (ii) upon 30 days' notice anytime within 12 months of a change of control of the Trust (UHS also has this right should the joint venture decline to exercise its purchase right). Additionally, the joint venture has rights of first offer to purchase the facility prior to any third-party sale.\n\n\nThe table below provides certain details for each of the hospitals leased from the Trust as of January 1, 2025:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHospital Name\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAnnual\nMinimum\nRent\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nEnd of Lease Term\n\n\n \n\n\nRenewal\nTerm\n(years)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMcAllen Medical Center\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,485,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember,\n \n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWellington Regional Medical Center\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,805,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember,\n \n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5\n\n\n \n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAiken Regional Medical Center/Aurora Pavilion Behavioral Health Services\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n4,164,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember,\n \n2033\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n \n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanyon Creek Behavioral Health\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,882,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember,\n \n2033\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n \n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClive Behavioral Health\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,851,000\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember,\n \n2040\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n \n\n\n(d)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\nWe have one 5-year renewal option at existing lease rates (through 2031).\n\n\n(b)\nWe have one 5-year renewal option at fair market value lease rates (through 2031).  On each January 1\nst\n through 2026, the annual rent will increase by 2.50% on a cumulative and compounded basis.\n\n\n(c)\nWe have seven 5-year renewal options at fair market value lease rates (2034 through 2068).  On each January 1\nst\n through 2033, the annual rent will increase by 2.25% on a cumulative and compounded basis.\n\n\n(d)\nThis facility is operated by a joint venture in which we are the managing, majority member and an unrelated third-party holds a minority ownership interest. The joint venture has three, 10-year renewal options at computed lease rates as stipulated in the lease (2041 through 2070) and two additional, 10-year renewal options at fair market values lease rates (2071 through 2090). In each January through 2040 (and potentially through 2070 if three, 10-year renewal options are exercised), the annual rental will increase by 2.75% on a cumulative and compounded basis.  \n\n\n In addition, certain of our subsidiaries are tenants in several medical office buildings (“MOBs”) and two free-standing emergency departments (\"FED\") owned by the Trust or by limited liability companies in which the Trust holds 95% to 100% of the ownership interest.  In connection with these two FEDs, in October, 2024, our subsidiaries exercised their 5-year renewal options on the facilities which are located in Weslaco and Mission, Texas.  Each renewal option covers the period of February 1, 2025 through January 31, 2030 (the current lease terms were scheduled to expire on January 31, 2025; with aggregate annual lease rates of\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\napproximately $979,000). Pursuant to terms of the leases, and consistent with the terms of the leases currently in effect for each property, the lease rates are scheduled to increase 2% per year through the end of the renewed lease terms. Our subsidiaries have five, 5-year renewal options remaining on each of these FEDs, with the first three renewal options (covering the years 2030 through 2044) providing for 2% annual increases to the lease rates, and the remaining two, 5-year renewal options (covering the years 2045 through 2054) providing for lease rates at the then fair market value. These leases are cross-defaulted with one another and our subsidiaries have the option to purchase the leased properties upon the expiration of each five-year extended term at the fair market value at that time.\n \n \n \n\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2023, the Trust acquired the McAllen Doctor's Center, a 79,500 rentable square feet medical office building located in McAllen, Texas.  A master lease was executed between a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and the Trust, pursuant to the terms of which our subsidiary will master lease 100% of the rentable square feet of the MOB at an initial minimum rent of $624,000 annually.  The master lease commenced during August, 2023 and is scheduled to expire in twelve years from that date.\n\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2023, the Trust substantially completed construction on a new 86,000 rentable square foot multi-tenant MOB that is located on the campus of Northern Nevada Sierra Medical Center in Reno, Nevada. Northern Nevada Sierra Medical Center, a 170-bed newly constructed acute care hospital owned and operated by a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours, was completed and opened in April, 2022. In connection with this MOB, a ten-year master flex lease was executed between a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours and the Trust (scheduled to expire in March, 2033), pursuant to the terms of which our subsidiary initially agreed to master lease up to approximately 68% of the rentable square feet of the MOB. The master flex lease has been reduced since inception as certain conditions have been met. A ground lease for this facility commenced during 2023 and is scheduled to expire in 2098.\n\n\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\n\n\nThe executive officers, whose terms will expire at such time as their successors are elected, are as follows:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName and Age\n\n\n \n\n\nPresent Position with the Company\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarc D.
