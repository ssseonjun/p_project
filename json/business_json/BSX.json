    "item1": "Item 1. Business of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nMedSurg\nEndoscopy\nOur Endoscopy business develops and manufactures devices to diagnose and treat a broad range of gastrointestinal (GI) conditions with innovative, less-invasive technologies. Net sales of Endoscopy products of $2.687 billion represented 16 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2024. Endoscopy net sales increased $205 million, or 8.3 percent, in 2024 compared to 2023. This increase included operational net sales growth of 8.9 percent and the negative impact of 60 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations. Operational net sales growth included organic net sales growth of 8.0 percent in 2024, and the positive impact of 100 basis points from our acquisition of Apollo and the divestiture of our pathology business in the second quarter of 2023, and our acquisition of the endoluminal vacuum therapy portfolio of Braun in the first quarter of 2024. \nOrganic net sales growth was primarily driven by our endoluminal surgery franchise, our single-use imaging franchise led by our EXALT™ Model D Single-Use Duodenoscope and our biliary franchise led by our AXIOS™\n \nStent and Delivery System.\nUrology\nOur Urology business develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological conditions for both male and female anatomies, including kidney stones, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, erectile dysfunction and incontinence. Net sales of Urology products of $2.200 billion represented 13 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2024. Urology net sales increased $236 million, or 12.0 percent, in 2024 compared to 2023. This increase included operational net sales growth of 12.5 percent and the negative impact of 50 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations. Operational net sales growth included organic net sales growth of 9.3 percent in 2024, and the positive impact of 330 basis points from our acquisition of Axonics in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nOrganic net sales growth was primarily driven by our stone management, led by our Lumenis Pulse™ Holmium Laser Systems with MOSES™ Technology, and prosthetic urology franchises and our prostate health franchise led by our Rezūm™ Systems.\nNeuromodulation\nOur Neuromodulation business develops and manufactures devices to treat various neurological movement disorders and manage chronic pain. Net sales of Neuromodulation products of $1.106 billion represented 7 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2024. Neuromodulation net sales increased $130 million, or 13.3 percent, in 2024 compared to 2023. This increase included operational net sales growth of 13.7 percent and the negative impact of 40 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations. Operational net sales growth included organic net sales growth of 2.7 percent in 2024, and the positive impact of 1,100 basis points from our acquisition of Relievant in the fourth quarter of 2023.\nOrganic net sales growth was primarily driven by our deep brain stimulation franchise and our radiofrequency ablation portfolio.\n40\nCardiovascular\nCardiology\nOur Cardiology business develops and manufactures devices and medical technologies for diagnosing and treating a variety of diseases and abnormalities of the heart. Net sales of Cardiology products of $8.344 billion represented 50 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2024. Cardiology net sales increased $1.636 billion, or 24.4 percent in 2024 compared to 2023. This increase included operational net sales growth of 25.4 percent and the negative impact of 100 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations.\nOperational net sales growth was primarily driven by growth of our Electrophysiology business unit, led by our Farapulse™ Pulsed Field Ablation System and our access solutions portfolio, continued market penetration of Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) procedures with our WATCHMAN FLX™ LAAC Device and our WATCHMAN FLX™ Pro LAAC Device, as well as our percutaneous coronary intervention guidance franchise.\nPeripheral Interventions \nOur Peripheral Interventions business develops and manufactures products to diagnose and treat peripheral arterial and venous diseases, as well as products to diagnose, treat and ease various forms of cancer. Net sales of Peripheral Interventions products of $2.410 billion represented 14 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2024. Peripheral Interventions net sales increased $300 million, or 14.2 percent in 2024 compared to 2023. This increase included operational net sales growth of 15.5 percent and the negative impact of 120 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations. Operational net sales growth included organic net sales growth of 10.9 percent, and the positive impact of 460 basis points from our majority stake investment in Acotec which we acquired in the first quarter of 2023 and our acquisition of Silk Road Medical during the third quarter of 2024. \nOrganic net sales growth was primarily driven by our interventional oncology franchise led by our EMBOLD™ Fibered Coil and Therasphere™ Y-90 Radioactive Glass Microspheres, as well as our drug-eluting portfolio within our vascular franchise led by our Ranger™ Drug Coated Balloon.\nEmerging Markets\nAs part of our strategic imperative to drive global expansion, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets. Periodically, we assess our list of Emerging Markets countries, and effective January 1, 2023, modified our list to include all countries except the United States, Western and Central Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.\nOur Emerging Markets' net sales represented 16 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2024 and 2023. In 2024, our Emerging Markets net sales grew 16.1 percent on a reported basis including operational net sales growth of 19.6 percent and the negative impact of 360 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations, compared to 2023. Operational net sales growth was primarily driven by growth in China, fueled by the breadth of our portfolio and focus on innovation and strong commercial execution. \nEconomic Environment\nAs a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices, our business is subject to local and international macroeconomic trends as well as geopolitical factors. While global supply chain disruptions continued to improve in 2024, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increases in cost and limited availability of certain raw materials, components, and other inputs necessary to manufacture and distribute our products due to constraints and inflation within the global supply chain, as well as increases in wage costs and the cost and time to distribute our products. Uncertainty around inflationary pressures, interest rates, monetary policy, trade policies, foreign currency fluctuations and changes in tax laws, as well as actions by governments in response thereto, could create additional economic challenges which could negatively impact our business operations and results. Geopolitical developments, including related to various ongoing global conflicts and tensions, may create economic, supply chain, transportation, energy, and other challenges, including disruptions to business operations, which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. Further, sanctions, tariffs, or other measures that restrict international trade, as well as instability resulting from global conflicts, could negatively affect our business operations and results.\n41\nResults of Operations\nNet Sales\nThe following table provides our net sales by reportable segment and business, and the relative change in growth on a reported basis:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 versus 2023\n2023 versus 2022\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEndoscopy\n$\n2,687 \n$\n2,482 \n$\n2,221 \n8.3%\n11.7%\nUrology\n2,200 \n1,964 \n1,773 \n12.0%\n10.8%\nNeuromodulation\n1,106 \n976 \n917 \n13.3%\n6.4%\nMedSurg\n5,993\n \n5,422\n \n4,911\n \n10.5%\n10.4%\nCardiology\n8,344 \n6,709 \n5,932 \n24.4%\n13.1%\nPeripheral Interventions\n2,410 \n2,110 \n1,899 \n14.2%\n11.1%\nCardiovascular\n10,755\n \n8,819\n \n7,831\n \n22.0%\n12.6%\n16,747 \n14,240 \n12,742 \n17.6%\n11.8%\nOther\n(1)\n— \n— \n(60)\n0.0%\n(100.0)%\nNet Sales\n$\n16,747\n \n$\n14,240\n \n$\n12,682\n \n17.6%\n12.3%\n(1)\nIn 2022, amounts reflect sales reserves established for Italian government payback provisions, not allocated to reportable segments, which are being disputed in the Italian court system.\nRefer to \nExecutive Summary \nfor further discussion of our net sales and a comparison of our 2024 and 2023 net sales.\nIn 2023, we generated net sales of $14.240 billion compared to $12.682 billion in 2022. This increase of $1.558 billion, or 12.3 percent, included operational growth of 13.1 percent and the negative impact of 80 basis points from foreign currency fluctuations. Operational net sales growth included organic net sales growth of 12.3 percent in 2023 and the positive impact of 80 basis points driven by our majority stake investment in Acotec and the acquisitions of Apollo and Relievant during the first, second and fourth quarters of 2023, respectively, as well as the divestiture of our pathology business during the second quarter of 2023 and our acquisition of Baylis Medical Company, Inc. (Baylis Medical) during the first quarter of 2022, for which there were less than a full prior period of comparable net sales. The increase in our 2023 net sales was primarily driven by acquisitions as well as the strength and diversity of our product portfolio coupled with growth in the underlying markets in which we compete and strong commercial execution. \nGross Profit\nOur gross profit was $11.490 billion in 2024 and $9.896 billion in 2023. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period:\nGross Profit Margin\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\n68.8%\nManufacturing and supply costs\n1.7%\nSales pricing, volume and mix\n1.9%\nNet impact of foreign currency fluctuations\n(2.2)%\nAll other, including inventory charges and other period expenses\n(0.7)%\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\n69.5%\nSales pricing, volume and mix\n0.7%\nAll other, including inventory charges and other period expenses\n(1.6)%\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\n68.6%\nThe primary factors contributing to the decrease in our gross profit margin for 2024 compared to 2023 were inventory charges, including related to the POLARx™ cryoablation system given the strong commercial adoption of our Farapulse™ Pulsed Field \n42\nAblation System, strategic manufacturing capacity investments and other period expenses, partially offset by increased sales of higher margin products.\nThe primary factors contributing to the increase in our gross profit margin for 2023 compared to 2022 were increased sales of higher margin products, as well as improvements in manufacturing, raw material and component, and freight costs, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency and period expenses. \nEU MDR Implementation Costs \nThe EU MDR replaced the existing European Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMDD) regulatory frameworks, and manufacturers of medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021 for new products and by May 2024 for medical devices that have a valid CE Certificate to the Directives issued before May 2021. In 2023, updates to the legislative text of the EU MDR were adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, including an extension of the transitional period to 2027 for certain high risk class devices and 2028 for lower risk class medical devices that have a valid CE Certificate to the Directives issued before May 2021.\nWe began our EU MDR implementation efforts in late 2019 and have incurred cumulative expenses of $408 million through December 31, 2024, which are primarily being recorded within\n Cost of product sold\n. We expect to incur total expenses of approximately $450 million to $500 million over the transition period. \nOperating Expenses\nThe following table provides a summary of our key operating expenses:\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\n$\n% of Net Sales\n$\n% of Net Sales\n$\n% of Net Sales\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n$\n5,984 \n35.7 \n%\n$\n5,190 \n36.4 \n%\n$\n4,520 \n35.6 \n%\nResearch and development expenses\n1,615 \n9.6 \n%\n1,414 \n9.9 \n%\n1,323 \n10.4 \n%\nSelling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses\nIn 2024, our \nSG&A expenses\n increased $794 million, or 15 percent compared to 2023 and were 70 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The increase in \nSG&A expenses\n was due primarily to higher selling costs driven by higher global net sales and costs to support product launches, including the Farapulse™ Pulsed Field Ablation System in our Electrophysiology business unit.\nIn 2023, our \nSG&A expenses\n increased $670 million, or 15 percent compared to 2022 and were 80 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. The increase in \nSG&A expenses\n was primarily due to higher selling costs driven by higher global net sales, costs to support new and planned product launches, including the Farapulse™ Pulsed Field Ablation System in our Electrophysiology business unit and comparatively higher acquisition-related and restructuring-related expenses.\nResearch and Development (R&D) Expenses\nWe remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses. In 2024, our \nR&D expenses\n increased $201 million, or 14 percent compared to 2023, and were 30 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. In 2023, our \nR&D expenses\n increased $91 million, or 7 percent compared to 2022, and were 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. \nR&D expenses\n increased in both periods as a result of investments across our businesses in order to maintain a pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth. \nOther Operating Expenses\nThe following provides a summary of certain of our other operating expenses, which are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance; refer to \nAdditional Information\n for a further description.\n43\nAmortization Expense\nWe recorded \nAmortization expense\n of $856 million in 2024 and $828 million in 2023 related to intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition, as well as internally-developed patents. In 2024, \nAmortization expense\n increased $28 million, or 3 percent, as compared to 2023. In 2023, \nAmortization expense\n increased $25 million, or 3 percent, as compared to 2022. The increase in both periods was primarily driven by the addition of amortizable intangible assets associated with acquisitions.\nIntangible Asset Impairment Charges\nWe recorded \nIntangible asset impairment charges\n of $386 million in 2024 and $58 million in 2023. The impairment charges recorded in 2024 were primarily associated with amortizable intangible assets established in connection with our acquisitions of Cryterion Medical, Inc. (Cryterion) and Devoro Medical, Inc. (Devoro), which were integrated into our Electrophysiology and Peripheral Interventions business units, respectively. Intangible assets acquired from Cryterion were impaired due to strong commercial adoption of our Farapulse™ Pulsed Field Ablation System in our Electrophysiology business unit and the resulting lower revenue projections and cannibalization of our cryoablation business. Intangible assets acquired from Devoro were impaired following management's decision to cancel the related program in the second quarter of 2024. The impairment charges recorded in 2023 were primarily associated with the cancellation of an in-process research and development (IPR&D) program due to the incremental time and cost to complete the program and bring the technology to market. Refer to \nCritical Accounting Estimates\n for a discussion of key assumptions used in our intangible asset impairment testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our intangible assets.\nContingent Consideration Net Expense (Benefit)\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet charges (benefit)\n$\n(5)\n$\n58 \n$\n35 \nPayments for prior acquisitions following the achievement of associated milestones\n232 \n76 \n371 \nTo recognize changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability, we recorded a net benefit of $5 million in 2024 and net charges of $58 million in 2023. In addition, we made payments of $232 million and $76 million associated with prior acquisitions during 2024 and 2023, respectively, following the achievement of revenue-based earnouts. Refer to \nNote B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details related to our contingent consideration arrangements.\nRestructuring and Restructuring-related Net Charges \nOn February 22, 2023, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a new global restructuring program (the 2023 Restructuring Plan). \nFor additional information, refer to \"2023 Restructuring Plan\" under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources below.\nPursuant to the 2023 Restructuring Plan, we recorded the following restructuring and restructuring-related charges:\nYear Ended December 31, \n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRestructuring charges\n(1)\n$\n16 \n$\n69 \n$\n24 \nRestructuring-related charges\n(2)\n212 \n115 \n86 \n(1)\nThese charges are recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 420, \nExit or Disposal Cost Obligations.\n(2)\nThese charges are primarily recorded within \nCost of products sold, SG&A Expenses\n \nand\n \nR&D Expenses\n.\nThe following table presents our restructuring reserve balance:\nAs of December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nRestructuring reserve balance\n$\n26 \n$\n41 \n44\nLitigation-related Net Charges (Credits)\nWe record certain legal and product liability charges, credits and costs of defense, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant as \nLitigation-related net charges (credits)\n within our consolidated financial statements. We did not record any litigation-related net charges (credits) in 2024. We recorded litigation-related net credits of $111 million in 2023, primarily related to the settlement of offensive patent litigation. All other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within \nSG&A expenses\n.\nWe continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation, and therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with the financial covenant required by our credit arrangements. Refer to \nNote I – Commitments and Contingencies\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional discussion of our material legal proceedings.\nInterest Expense \nThe following table provides a summary of our \nInterest expense \nand average borrowing rate:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest expense \n(in millions)\n$\n(305)\n$\n(265)\n$\n(470)\nAverage borrowing rate\n2.8 \n%\n2.8 \n%\n5.0 \n%\nInterest expense\n increased in 2024, compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased debt from the registered public offering of €2.000 billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes (the 2024 Eurobonds) during the first quarter of 2024. \nInterest expense\n decreased in 2023, compared to 2022, primarily due to $194 million of charges associated with the early extinguishment of $3.275 billion of certain of our senior notes, including payment of tender premiums and the acceleration of unamortized debt issuance costs, as well as the issuance of euro-denominated senior notes during the first quarter of 2022. Our average borrowing rate remained flat in 2024 compared to 2023 and decreased in 2023 compared to 2022. Refer to \nLiquidity and Capital Resources,\n as well as\n Note E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding our debt obligations.\nOther, net\nThe following are the components of \nOther, net\n:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInterest income\n$\n107 \n$\n22 \n$\n10 \nNet foreign currency gain (loss)\n(16)\n(41)\n(31)\nNet gains (losses) on investments\n(1)\n(79)\n(59)\n(1)\nOther income (expense), net\n(29)\n(14)\n(16)\n \n$\n(16)\n$\n(93)\n$\n(38)\n(1)\nNet gains (losses) on investments include investment portfolio net losses (gains) and impairments as well as the impact of recording our share of the earnings or losses of equity method investees.\nInterest income increased during 2024, compared to prior periods, primarily due to higher average cash balances invested in each period as a result of the registered public offering of the 2024 Eurobonds during the first quarter of 2024. Net proceeds from the offering were primarily used to fund a portion of the purchase price of our Axonics acquisition which was initially expected to close in the first half of 2024 and ultimately closed in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n45\nTax Rate\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of our reported tax rate to the rate from continuing operations:\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nReported tax rate\n19.1 \n%\n19.8 \n%\n38.9 \n%\nImpact of certain receipts/charges\n(1)\n(1.1)\n%\n(0.2)\n%\n(19.1)\n%\nRate from continuing operations\n18.0 \n%\n19.6 \n%\n19.8 \n%\n(1)\n    These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our rate from continuing operations.\nOur reported tax rate is affected by recurring items such as the amount of our earnings subject to differing tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at rates that differ from our rate from continuing operations.\nIn 2024, the principal reasons for the difference between the rate from continuing operations and our reported tax rate relate to certain acquisition-related net charges and impairment charges as well as certain discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation and changes in valuation allowance.\nIn 2023, the principal reasons for the difference between the rate from continuing operations and our reported tax rate relate to receipts for litigation, certain acquisition-related net charges and restructuring-related net charges as well as certain discrete tax benefits primarily related to unrecognized tax benefits for the conclusion of the 2017-2018 IRS audit, provision-to-return adjustments, and stock-based compensation.\nIn 2022, the principal reasons for the difference between the rate from continuing operations and our reported tax rate relate to litigation-related net charges, acquisition-related net charges, impairment charges, and debt extinguishment net charges as well as certain discrete tax benefits primarily related to stock-based compensation, changes in valuation allowance as well as charges for unrecognized tax benefits.\nEffective January 1, 2024, many countries where we do business adopted a global minimum effective tax rate of 15% based on the Pillar Two framework issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Other countries where we do business are also considering adopting the framework or are in various stages of enacting the framework into their country’s laws. The impact of the Pillar Two global minimum tax on our 2024 tax rate from continuing operations was immaterial, and we expect a similar impact in 2025 based on the countries that have adopted the Pillar Two rules, and the guidance issued to date. \nThe Company continues to monitor further legislative adoption of the Pillar Two rules by country. The United States has not enacted the Pillar Two global minimum tax, and the current administration recently announced its intention to effectively withdraw from the OECD Inclusive Framework as well as its intention to enact retaliatory measures against countries who assert extraterritorial taxes against U.S. taxpayers. In addition, significant uncertainty exists regarding the interpretation of the detailed Pillar Two rules, whether such rules will be implemented consistently across taxing jurisdictions, how such rules interact with existing national tax laws and whether such rules are consistent with existing tax treaty obligations. Developments related to these uncertainties could impact our expectations regarding the impact of the Pillar Two global minimum tax on our tax rate from continuing operations in 2025.\nSee \nNote H – Income Taxes\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on our tax rate.\n46\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nBased on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of \nCash and cash equivalents\n, future cash generated from operations, access to capital markets and existing credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, pay taxes due, service and repay our existing debt and fund possible acquisitions for the next 12 months and for the foreseeable future. Please refer to \nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n below for additional details on our future payment obligations and commitments. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $414 million of unrestricted \nCash and cash equivalents\n on hand, including approximately $50 million held by Acotec, a less than wholly owned entity of which we acquired a majority stake investment during the first quarter of 2023. The balance is comprised of $50 million invested in money market funds and time deposits and $364 million in interest bearing and non-interest-bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn at market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification, as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. \nIn 2021, we entered into our $2.750 billion revolving credit facility (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks. On May 10, 2024, we entered into a third amendment to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility credit agreement, which provided for, among other things, an extension of the scheduled maturity date to May 10, 2029, an amendment of the Ratings based pricing grid of the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the credit agreement, and reset the applicable date for purposes of determining the amounts of restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses that may be excluded from consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), as defined by the credit agreement, for purposes of our maximum leverage ratio covenant, from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024, as further discussed under \nFinancial Covenant\n below. This facility provides backing for our commercial paper program, and outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. There was $191 million outstanding under our commercial paper program as of December 31, 2024. There were no amounts outstanding under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024, resulting in an additional $2.559 billion of available liquidity.\nFor additional details related to our debt obligations, including our financial covenant requirement, refer to \nNote E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows):\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities\n$\n3,435 \n$\n2,503 \n$\n1,526 \nCash provided by (used for) investing activities\n(5,687)\n(2,574)\n(2,011)\nCash provided by (used for) financing activities\n1,814 \n5 \n(548)\nOperating Activities\nIn 2024, cash provided by (used for) operating activities increased $932 million as compared to 2023, primarily due to higher net sales and operating income, slower inventory buildup due to improved macroeconomic supply chain conditions, as well as increases in employee related accruals, accrued commissions and accrued rebates, partially offset by higher prepaid expenses and income tax receivables. In 2023, cash provided by (used for) operating activities increased $977 million compared to 2022, primarily due to comparatively higher net sales and operating income, lower non-recurring tax payments compared to prior year, as well as timing of employee related accruals and prepaid expenses. This increase was partially offset by the use of cash associated with an increase in inventory purchases as a result of higher sales and ensuring continuity of supply to meet procedural volume demand.\n47\nInvesting Activities\nIn 2024, cash provided by (used for) investing activities included cash payments of $4.640 billion for the acquisitions of businesses, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the acquisitions of Axonics and Silk Road Medical, and \npurchases of property, plant and equipment and internal use software \nof $790 million. For more information on our acquisitions, refer to \nNote B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In 2023, cash provided by (used for) investing activities included cash payments of $1.811 billion, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of Apollo, Relievant and our majority stake investment in Acotec, as well as p\nurchases of property, plant and equipment and internal use software \nof $711 million.\nFinancing Activities\nIn 2024, cash provided by (used for) financing activities included proceeds from the registered public offering of the 2024 Eurobonds. The offering resulted in cash proceeds of $2.145 billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs. We primarily used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the purchase price of our acquisition of Axonics and to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. We also used the net proceeds to fund the repayment at maturity of our 3.450% Senior Notes due March 2024 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes.

    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, some of which are outside our control. These and other risks and uncertainties could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and adversely affect our liquidity plans.\nFinancial Covenant\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenant required by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. \n \nCovenant Requirement\nas of December 31, 2024\n \nActual\nas of December 31, 2024\nMaximum permitted leverage ratio\n(1)\n4.75 times\n \n2.26 times\n(1)\n Ratio of total debt to deemed consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility credit agreement.\nThe 2021 Revolving Credit Facility includes the financial covenant requirement for all of our credit arrangements that we maintain the maximum permitted leverage ratio of 3.75 times for the remaining term. The credit agreement provides for higher leverage ratios, at our election, for the period following a Qualified Acquisition, as defined by the agreement, for which consideration exceeds $1.000 billion. In the event of such an acquisition, for the four succeeding quarters immediately following, including the quarter in which the acquisition occurs, the maximum permitted leverage ratio is 4.75 times. It steps down for the fifth, sixth and seventh succeeding quarters to 4.50 times, 4.25 times and 4.00 times, respectively. Thereafter, a maximum leverage ratio of 3.75 times is required through the remaining term of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. On November 15, 2024, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Axonics, which we had previously designated as a Qualified Acquisition under the credit agreement, increasing the maximum permitted leverage ratio to 4.75 times as of December 31, 2024. We believe that we have the ability to comply with the financial covenant for the next 12 months.\nThe financial covenant requirement, as amended on May 10, 2024, provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA through maturity, of certain charges and expenses. The credit agreement amendment reset the starting date for purposes of calculating such permitted exclusions related to restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024. Permitted exclusions include up to $500 million in cash and non-cash restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses associated with our current or future restructuring plans. As of December 31, 2024, we had $322 million of the restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any cash litigation \n48\npayments (net of any cash litigation receipts), as defined by the agreement, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, provided that the sum of any excluded net cash litigation payments do not exceed $1.000 billion plus all accrued legal liabilities as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.435 billion of the litigation exclusion remaining.\nDebt\nThe following table presents the current and long-term portions of our total debt:\n \nAs of\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCurrent debt obligations\n$\n1,778 \n$\n531 \nLong-term debt\n8,968 \n$\n8,571 \nTotal debt\n$\n10,746\n \n$\n9,102\n \nThe following table presents the portions of our total debt that are comprised of fixed and variable rate debt instruments, which are presented on an amortized cost basis:\n \nAs of\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nFixed-rate debt instruments\n$\n10,507 \n$\n9,070 \nVariable rate debt instruments\n239 \n32 \nTotal debt\n$\n10,746\n \n$\n9,102\n \nFor additional details related to our debt obligations, including our financial covenant requirements, refer to \nNote E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEquity\nIn 2024, we received $230 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, compared to $182 million in 2023. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of our employees. Stock-based compensation expense related to our stock ownership plans was $266 million in 2024 and $233 million in 2023. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors, the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period, forfeiture levels related to unvested awards and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan, as well as the retirement eligibility of stock award recipients.\nOn June 1, 2023, in accordance with the terms of our MCPS, all outstanding shares of MCPS automatically converted into shares of common stock. No action by the holders of the MCPS was required in connection with the mandatory conversion. The conversion rate for each share of MCPS was 2.3834 shares of common stock. Cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with the terms of the MCPS. An aggregate of approximately 24 million shares of common stock, including shares of common stock issued to holders of MCPS that elected to convert prior to the mandatory conversion date, were issued upon conversion of the MCPS. Following the mandatory conversion of the MCPS, there were no outstanding shares of MCPS, resulting in the retirement of the annualized approximately $55 million cash dividend payment on the MCPS.\nOn December 14, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.000 billion of our common stock. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in 2024 or 2023, and had the full amount available under the authorization as of December 31, 2024. There were approximately 263 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n49\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n(in millions)\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\nThereafter\nTotal\nDebt obligations\n(1)\n$\n1,730 \n$\n255 \n$\n935 \n$\n1,123 \n$\n1,051 \n$\n5,547 \n$\n10,642 \nInterest payments\n(2)\n288 \n270 \n266 \n253 \n234 \n1,385 \n2,695 \nLease obligations\n(3)\n94 \n84 \n64 \n52 \n43 \n227 \n564 \nPurchase obligations\n(2)\n881 \n220 \n125 \n108 \n21 \n159 \n1,514 \nLegal reserves\n(4)\n177 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n177 \nOne-time transition tax\n147 \n— \n— \n— \n— \n— \n147 \n$\n3,316\n \n$\n829\n \n$\n1,390\n \n$\n1,536\n \n$\n1,349\n \n$\n7,318\n \n$\n15,739\n \n(1)\nDebt obligations are comprised of our senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2024.

The 2023 Restructuring Plan is helping to advance our Global Supply Chain Optimization strategy, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing and distribution network by transferring certain production lines among facilities and drive operational efficiencies and resiliency. Key activities under the 2023 Restructuring Plan also include optimizing certain functional capabilities to achieve cost synergies and better support business growth. These activities were initiated in the first quarter of 2023 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2025.\nWhile we expect limited role reductions as a result of these restructuring activities, we anticipate that our overall employee base will remain relatively unchanged upon completion of the 2023 Restructuring Plan as new jobs are created in areas of growth and resources are deployed to support an expanding portfolio and growing global market needs.\nThe implementation of the 2023 Restructuring Plan is estimated to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $450 million to $550 million, of which approximately $350 million to $450 million is expected to result in cash outlays, and reduce gross annual pre-tax expenses by approximately $225 million to $275 million as program benefits are realized. We expect to reinvest a substantial portion of the savings in strategic growth initiatives. The following table provides a summary of our range of estimates of total pre-tax charges associated with the 2023 Restructuring Plan by major type of cost:\nType of Cost \n(in millions)\nTotal Estimated Amount Expected to be Incurred\nRestructuring charges:\nTermination benefits\n(1)\n$\n60 \n-\n$\n80 \nOther\n(2)\n20 \n-\n40 \nRestructuring-related expenses:\nTransfer costs\n(3)\n300 \n-\n330 \nOther\n(4)\n70 \n-\n100 \n \n$\n450\n \n-\n$\n550\n \n(1)\nPlans detailing specific employee impacts will be developed for each affected region and business, working with employee representative bodies where required under local laws.\n(2)\nConsists primarily of consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations.\n(3)\nRepresents costs to transfer product and manufacturing lines between geographically dispersed facilities.\n(4)\nComprised of other costs directly related to the restructuring program, including program management, accelerated depreciation and fixed asset write-offs.\nLegal Matters\nFor a discussion of our material legal proceedings, see \nNote I – Commitments and Contingencies\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. \nTo prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, including our contingent liabilities, as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (i) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (ii) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management’s judgment: Revenue Recognition, Inventory Provisions, Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liabilities, Goodwill Valuation, Legal and Product Liability Accruals and Income Taxes.\n52\nSee \nNote A – Significant Accounting Policies\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our accounting policies and our consideration of these critical accounting areas. \nRevenue Recognition\n \nDeferred Revenue\nWe record a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when we have an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received or due in advance of our performance. When we sell a device with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the unfulfilled performance obligation and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Generally, we do not have observable evidence of the standalone selling price related to our future service obligations; therefore, we estimate the selling price using an expected cost plus a margin approach. We allocate the transaction price using the relative standalone selling price method. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.\nOur contract liabilities are primarily composed of deferred revenue related to the LATITUDE™ Patient Management System within our Cardiology business, for which revenue is recognized over the average service period based on device and patient longevity. Our contract liabilities also include deferred revenue related to the LUX-Dx™ Insertable Cardiac Monitor system, also within our Cardiology business, for which revenue is recognized over the average service period based on device longevity and usage. The use of alternative assumptions could impact the period over which revenue is recognized.\nVariable Consideration\nWe generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.\nWe also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers and record these as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected rebates, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered.\nPost-Implant Services\nWe provide non-contractual services to customers to ensure the safe and effective use of certain implanted devices. We forward accrue the costs to provide these services at the time the devices are sold by estimating the amount of time spent by our representatives performing these services and their compensation throughout the device life to determine the service cost. Changes to our business practice or the use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of accrued cost. \nInventory Provisions\nWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.\n53\nValuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration Liabilities\nWe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including IPR&D, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to pay in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount rates, periods, timing and amount of projected revenue or timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows, discount rates, useful life or probability of achieving clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations and recognized amortization expense and contingent consideration expense or benefit in current and future periods.\nWe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or adjustment to the remaining useful life. If we determine it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired based on our qualitative assessment of impairment indicators, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is determined not recoverable\n, \nwe will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period the impairment is identified. We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment.\nIn addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets, or more frequently if indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value\n. \nIf the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to fair value. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates. \nGoodwill Valuation\n \nWe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances, utilizing both the qualitative and quantitative approach described in FASB ASC Topic 350, \nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other \n(FASB ASC Topic 350), in the second quarter of each year as of April 1 for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest an impairment may exist.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. For our 2024 annual impairment assessment, we identified the following reporting units for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment test: Interventional Cardiology, Rhythm Management, Peripheral Interventions, Endoscopy, Urology and Neuromodulation. Based on the criteria prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 350, we aggregated the Interventional Cardiology Therapies and Watchman components of our Cardiology operating segment into a single Interventional Cardiology reporting unit and aggregated the Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology components into a single Rhythm Management reporting unit.\nIn performing annual impairment assessments, when a quantitative test is performed, we typically use the income approach, specifically the Discounted Cash Flow method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. We historically selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the fair value of our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. \nIn applying the income approach, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our Discounted Cash Flow analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal \n54\nvalue growth rate reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows.\nAlthough we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.\nFuture events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units include, but are not limited to, the following: \n•\ndecreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater-than-expected declines in procedural volumes, inclusive of those resulting from macroeconomic conditions, including inflationary pricing pressures and reductions in reimbursement levels, \n•\ndeclines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition, an inability to develop or launch new and next-generation products and technology features in line with our commercialization strategies and market and/or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product actions, \n•\ndecreases in our forecasted profitability due to an inability to implement successfully and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations, \n•\nnegative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products, \n•\nthe level of success of ongoing and future research and development efforts, including those related to acquisitions and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products, \n•\nthe level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies, achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations, establishing government and third-party payer reimbursement, supplying the market and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully, \n•\nchanges in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses and \n•\nincreases in our market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital and increases in our market-participant tax rate and/or changes in tax laws or macroeconomic conditions.\nNegative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in future impairment charges.\nLegal and Product Liability Accruals\nWe are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We are also the subject of certain governmental investigations, which could result in substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain, and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify. As such, significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals. Our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us, including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us, trial court or appellate proceedings, and mediation, arbitration or settlement proceedings.\n55\nIncome Taxes\nWe reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as estimates of the impact of future taxable income and available prudent and feasible tax-planning strategies. The realizability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change, particularly if earnings of a subsidiary are inconsistent with expectations, or if we take operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary. Each reporting period, we monitor the need for valuation allowances for each filing group in each jurisdiction where we are subject to tax. Based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized. \nWe establish reserves when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. The calculation of our tax liabilities involves significant judgment based on individual facts, circumstances, and information available in addition to applying complex tax regulations across our global operations. To recognize an uncertain tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements, the taxpayer must determine if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, with the measurement of the resulting benefit calculated as the largest amount more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit. We review these tax uncertainties each reporting period to consider changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. Upon final resolution with tax authorities, we may prevail in positions for which reserves have been established, or we may be required to pay amounts more than established reserves. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for liabilities resulting from tax assessments by taxing authorities, positions taken by these tax authorities could have a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to \nNote P – New Accounting Pronouncements\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on standards implemented during 2024 and standards to be implemented in future periods.\nAdditional Information\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share (EPS) that exclude certain charges (credits); operational net sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations; and organic net sales, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations as well as the impact of certain acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full period of comparable net sales. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nTo calculate adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share we exclude certain charges (credits) from GAAP net income and GAAP net income attributable to common stockholders, which include amortization expense, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition/divestiture-related net charges (credits), investment portfolio net losses (gains) and impairments, restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits), certain litigation-related net charges (credits), EU MDR implementation costs, debt extinguishment net charges, deferred tax expenses (benefits) and certain discrete tax items. Amounts are presented after-tax using our effective tax rate, unless the amount is a significant unusual or infrequently occurring item in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740-270-30, \"General Methodology and Use of Estimated Annual Effective Tax Rate.\"\nThe GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and adjusted net income (loss) per share are GAAP net income (loss), GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders and GAAP net income (loss) per common share - assuming dilution, respectively.\n56\nTo calculate operational net sales growth rates, which exclude the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior periods. To calculate organic net sales growth rates, we also remove the impact of acquisitions and divestitures with less than a full period of comparable net sales. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to operational net sales and organic net sales is net sales reported on a GAAP basis. \nReconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included under \nExecutive Summary\n above.\nManagement uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.\nWe believe that presenting adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders adjusted net income (loss) per share, operational and organic net sales growth rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.\nThe following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items. In each case, management has excluded the item for purposes of calculating the relevant non-GAAP financial measure to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance:\nAdjusted Net Income (loss), Adjusted Net Income (loss) Attributable to Common Stockholders and Adjusted Net Income (loss) per Share\n•\nAmortization expense - We record intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition, as well as internally-developed patents at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance due to its non-cash nature and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance,\n•\nGoodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges - These amounts represent write-downs of certain goodwill and/or other intangible asset balances. We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment and test our other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment. Similarly, we test our goodwill on an annual basis in the second quarter of each year and monitor for indicators of impairment during the remaining quarters. If we determine the carrying value of the amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable, goodwill of a reporting unit is impaired or it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired\n, \nwe will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. Impairment charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance,\n•\nAcquisition/divestiture-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments may consist of (a) contingent consideration fair value adjustments; (b) gains on previously held investments; (c) due diligence, deal fees and other fees and costs related to our acquisition and divestiture transactions; (d) inventory step-up amortization and accelerated compensation expense; (e) integration and exit costs; and (f) separation costs and gains or losses primarily associated with the sale of a business or portion of a business. The contingent consideration fair value adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration. Gains on previously held investments, due diligence, deal fees and other fees and costs, inventory step-up amortization, accelerated compensation expense, and other expenses and gains or losses associated with divestitures or acquisitions can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations. Integration, separation and exit costs include contract cancellations, severance and other compensation-related charges and costs, \n57\nproject management fees and costs, and other direct costs associated with the integration of our acquisitions or separation of our divested businesses. These integration, separation and exit activities take place over a defined timeframe and have distinct project timelines, are incremental to activities and costs that arise in the ordinary course of our business and are not considered part of our core, ongoing operations. These acquisition/divestiture-related net charges (credits) are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance,\n•\nRestructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments primarily represent severance and other compensation-related charges, fixed asset write-offs, contract cancellations, project management fees, facility shut down costs, costs to transfer manufacturing lines between geographically dispersed facilities and other direct costs associated with our restructuring plans. These restructuring plans each consist of distinct initiatives that are fundamentally different from our ongoing, core cost reduction initiatives in terms of, among other things, the frequency with which each action is performed and the required planning, resourcing, cost and timing. Examples of such initiatives include the movement of business activities, facility consolidations and closures and the transfer of product lines between manufacturing facilities, which, due to the highly regulated nature of our industry, requires a significant investment in time and cost to create duplicate manufacturing lines, run product validations and seek regulatory approvals. Restructuring initiatives take place over a defined timeframe and have a distinct project timeline that requires, and begins subsequent to, approval by our Board of Directors. In contrast to our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, restructuring initiatives typically result in duplicative cost and exit costs over the defined timeframe and are not considered part of our core, ongoing operations. These restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business. Restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance,\n•\nLitigation-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments include certain product liability and other litigation-related charges and credits. We record these charges and credits, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant, within the litigation-related charges (credits) line in our consolidated statements of operations; all other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. Certain litigation-related net charges (credits) are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance,\n•\nEU MDR implementation costs - These adjustments represent certain incremental costs specific to complying with new regulatory requirements in the EU. EU MDR replaced the existing MDD regulatory framework, and manufacturers of medical devices were required to comply with EU MDR beginning in May 2021 for new products and by May 2024 for medical devices which have a valid CE Certificate to the Directives issued before May 2021. In 2023, updates to the legislative text of the EU MDR were adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, including an extension of the transitional period to 2027 for certain high risk class devices and 2028 for lower risk class medical devices that have a valid CE Certificate to the Directives issued before May 2021. We expect to incur significant expenditures in connection with the adoption of the EU MDR requirements and we consider the adoption of EU MDR to be a significant change to a regulatory framework, and therefore, these expenditures are not considered to be ordinary course expenditures in connection with regulatory matters. As such, certain of these costs are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance,\n•\nDebt extinguishment net charges - These amounts relate to the early extinguishment of certain outstanding principal amounts of our senior notes. Certain debt extinguishment net charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance used for making operating decisions and assessing performance,\n•\nInvestment portfolio net losses (gains) and impairments - These amounts represent write-downs or fair value remeasurement gains and losses related to our investment portfolio. Each reporting period, we evaluate our investments without a readily determinable fair value to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. If we identify an impairment indicator, we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value and determine if the impairment is other-than-temporary, and recognize an impairment loss. In addition, for those investments accounted for under the measurement alternative method of accounting, we record gains and losses to remeasure the carrying value of the investments to their fair values based on observable market prices or implied market values. Investment impairment charges and fair value remeasurements can be highly variable dependent on external market factors and conditions \n58\nrelative to the underlying investee, which are generally outside of the control of management, as such these amounts are excluded from management's assessment of performance,\n•\nDeferred tax expenses (benefits) - This adjustment relates to a significant non-cash tax benefit arising from an intra-entity asset transfer of intellectual property completed in the fourth quarter of 2019 which resulted in our recording a $4.102 billion net deferred tax asset. The deferred tax benefit associated with the establishment of the net deferred tax asset as well as any deferred tax expense resulting from the reversal of the deferred tax asset are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance used for making operating decisions and assessing performance, and\n•\nDiscrete tax items - These items represent adjustments for certain tax charges (credits) including those which (a) are related to the indirect consequences of non-GAAP charges (credits) on limitations that impact certain tax benefits or incentives in the current period or (b) are related to the tax consequences of a non-GAAP adjustment item booked in a prior period. These discrete tax items are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance used for making operating decisions and assessing performance.\nOperational Net Sales\n•\nThe impact of foreign currency fluctuations is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, management excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations for purposes of reviewing net sales and growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.\nOrganic Net Sales\n•\nOrganic net sales growth excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and net sales attributable to acquisitions and divestitures for which there are less than a full period of comparable net sales.\n59\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nAs the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.\nIn accordance with the SEC Staff's interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses, we are permitted to omit an assessment of an acquired business's internal control over financial reporting from our assessment of internal control for up to one year from the acquisition date. As such, we have excluded our acquisitions of Silk Road Medical, Inc. and Axonics, Inc., each acquired during 2024, from our annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. These businesses represented approximately one percent of total assets as of December 31, 2024 and approximately one percent of net sales for the year then ended.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report, in which they expressed an unqualified opinion, is included below.\n \n/s/ Michael F. Mahoney\n \n/s/ Daniel J. Brennan\n \n \n \n \n \n \nMichael F. Mahoney\n \n \nDaniel J. Brennan\n \n \nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\n \n \nExecutive Vice President and Chief\nFinancial Officer\n \n60\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of\nBoston Scientific Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Boston Scientific Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Silk Road Medical, Inc. and Axonics, Inc., which are included in the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately one percent of total assets as of December 31, 2024 and approximately one percent of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Silk Road Medical, Inc. and Axonics, Inc.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n61\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 18, 2025 \n62\nITEM 7A.        QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nWe develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.\nOur currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $7.636 billion as of December 31, 2024 and $5.899 billion as of December 31, 2023. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $322 million as of December 31, 2024 compared to $236 million as of December 31, 2023. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $394 million as of December 31, 2024 compared to $288 million as of December 31, 2023. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our earnings.\nOur interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar and euro-denominated borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, $10.451 billion in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt obligations were at fixed interest rates, representing approximately 98 percent of our total debt, on an amortized cost basis. As of December 31, 2024, our outstanding debt obligations at fixed interest rates were comprised of senior notes.\nSee \nNote D – Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements\n to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments.\n63\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of\nBoston Scientific Corporation \nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss)\n,\n stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)\n \n(collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission\n \n(2013 framework),\n \nand our report dated February 18, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter \nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures\n \nto which it relates.\n64\nDescription of the Matter\nValuation of intangible assets acquired in business combinations\nAs disclosed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, during 2024, the Company completed the acquisitions of Silk Road Medical, Inc. and Axonics, Inc. for purchase prices, net of cash acquired, of $1,126 million and $3,409 million, respectively.\nAuditing the Company’s accounting for the business combinations was complex due to the significant estimation required by management to determine the fair value of identified intangible assets, which totaled $1,749 million and principally consisted of developed technology. The Company used an income approach to measure the technology-related intangible assets acquired. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets included discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results, including revenue growth rates, and EBITDA margins attributed to the assets. These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the controls over the Company’s accounting for business combination transactions. For example, we tested controls over the identification and valuation of intangible assets, including the underlying assumptions used to develop such estimates. We read the purchase agreements, evaluated the significant assumptions and methods used in developing the fair value estimates, and tested the recognition of (1) the tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value; (2) the identifiable intangible assets acquired at fair value; and (3) goodwill measured as a residual.\nTo test the estimated fair value of the intangible assets acquired, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's use of the income approach and testing the significant assumptions used in the model, as described above. We evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the analyses. For example, we compared the significant assumptions to current industry, market and economic trends, to the assumptions used to value similar assets in other acquisitions, to the historical results of the acquired businesses and to other guideline companies within the same industry. We involved our valuation professionals to assist with our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1992.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 18, 2025 \n65\nITEM 8.

Amounts may not foot due to rounding.\n71\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE A – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Boston Scientific Corporation's wholly owned subsidiaries and entities for which we have a controlling financial interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In the first quarter of 2023, we acquired a majority stake investment in Acotec Scientific Holdings Limited (Acotec) and have elected to consolidate their financial statements on a one quarter lag.\nWhen used in this report, the terms \"we,\" \"us,\" \"our\" and \"the Company\" mean Boston Scientific Corporation and its divisions and subsidiaries. We assess the terms of our investment interests to determine if any of our investees meet the definition of a variable interest entity (VIE)\n. \nFor any VIEs, we perform an analysis to determine whether our variable interests give us a controlling financial interest. The analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both 1) the power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Based on our assessments under the applicable guidance, we did not have controlling financial interests in any VIEs and, therefore, did not consolidate any VIEs during 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and with the instructions to Form 10-K and Regulation S-X.\nAmounts reported in millions within this Annual Report on Form 10-K are computed based on the amounts in thousands. As a result, the sum of the components may not equal the total amount reported in millions due to rounding. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying unrounded numbers.\nSubsequent Events\nWe evaluate events occurring after the date of our accompanying consolidated balance sheets for potential recognition or disclosure in our consolidated financial statements. Those items requiring recognition in the financial statements have been recorded and disclosed accordingly. \nThose items requiring disclosure (non-recognized subsequent events) in the financial statements have been disclosed accordingly. Refer to \nNote B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments \nand\n Note I – Commitments and Contingencies \nfor further details.\n \nAccounting Estimates\nTo prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our\nactual results may differ from these estimates.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe record \nCash and cash equivalents\n in our consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value. Our policy is to invest excess cash in short-term marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk of loss of principal amounts invested and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We consider cash equivalents to be all short-term marketable securities with remaining days to maturity of 90 days or less from the purchase date that can be readily converted to cash.\n72\nRestricted Cash \nAmounts included in restricted cash represent cash on hand required to be set aside by a contractual agreement related to receivable factoring arrangements and deferred compensation plans and are included in \nOther current assets\n within our consolidated balance sheets. Generally, the restrictions related to the factoring arrangements lapse at the time we remit the customer payments collected by us for servicing previously sold customer receivables to the purchaser. Restrictions for deferred compensation lapse when amounts are paid to the employee. \nRestricted Cash Equivalents\nRestricted cash equivalents primarily represent amounts paid into various qualified settlement funds and current amounts related to our non-qualified pension plan and are included in \nOther current assets \nwithin our consolidated balance sheets. The restrictions related to the various qualified settlement funds will lapse as we approve amounts payable to claimants, at which time we no longer have rights to a return of the amounts paid into the various qualified settlement funds. Restricted cash equivalents included in \nOther long-term assets \nwithin our consolidated balance sheets are related to deferred compensation plans.\n \nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and accounts and notes receivable. Our investment policy limits exposure to concentrations of credit risk and changes in market conditions. Counterparties to financial instruments expose us to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance. We transact our financial instruments with a diversified group of major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and actively monitor their credit ratings and our outstanding positions to limit our credit exposure. In the normal course, our payment terms with customers, including distributors, hospitals, health care agencies, clinics, doctors' offices and other private and governmental institutions, are typically 30 days in the U.S. but may be longer in international markets and generally do not require collateral.\nWe record credit loss reserves to \nAllowance for credit losses\n when we establish Trade accounts receivable\n \nif credit losses are expected over the asset's contractual life. We base our estimates of credit loss reserves on historical experience and adjust, as necessary, to reflect current conditions using reasonable and supportable forecasts not already reflected in the historical loss information. We utilize an accounts receivable aging approach to determine the reserve to record at accounts receivable commencement for certain customers, applying country or region-specific factors. In performing the assessment of outstanding accounts receivable, regardless of country or region, we may consider significant factors relevant to collectability, including those specific to a customer such as bankruptcy, lengthy average payment cycles and type of account.\nWe write-off amounts determined to be uncollectible against this reserve. We are not dependent on any single institution, and no single customer accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2024, 2023 and 2022; however, large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks, international distributors and dealers and other buying groups are important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. \nWe closely monitor outstanding receivables for potential collection risks, including those that may arise from economic conditions, in both the U.S. and international economies. Our sales to government-owned or supported customers, particularly in southern Europe, are subject to an increased number of days outstanding prior to payment relative to other countries. Further, the ongoing site-of-service trend of shifting procedure volumes in the U.S. toward non-hospital settings, particularly ambulatory surgery centers and office-based labs, continues. Many of these customers are smaller than those we have historically done business with and may have more limited liquidity. We have adjusted our estimates of credit loss reserves for these customers, regions and conditions, as appropriate. We believe our \nAllowance for credit losses\n is adequate as of December 31, 2024; however, if significant changes were to occur in the payment practices of government customers, or if there is an increase in bankruptcies among our ambulatory surgery center or office-based customers, we may not be able to collect on receivables due to us from these customers, and our write-offs of uncollectible accounts may increase.\n \n \n73\nRevenue Recognition\n \nWe sell our products primarily through a direct sales force. In certain international markets, we sell our products through independent distributors or dealers. We consider revenue to be earned when all of the following criteria are met in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n:\n•\nWe have a contract with a customer that creates enforceable rights and obligations,\n•\nPromised products or services are identified,\n•\nThe transaction price, or the amount we expect to receive, is determinable and\n•\nWe have transferred control of the promised items to the customer.\nTransfer of control is evidenced upon passage of title and risk of loss to the customer unless we are required to provide additional services. We treat shipping and handling costs performed after a customer obtains control of the good as a fulfillment cost and record these costs as a component of \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n when incurred. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant, which indicates that the sale is complete. We recognize a receivable at the point in time we have an unconditional right to payment. Payment terms are typically 30 days in the U.S. but may be longer in international markets.\nDeferred Revenue\nWe record a contract liability, or deferred revenue, when we have an obligation to provide a product or service to the customer and payment is received or due in advance of our performance. When we sell a device with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the unfulfilled performance obligation and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Many of our Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE™ Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. Generally, we do not have observable evidence of the standalone selling price related to our future service obligations; therefore, we estimate the selling price using an expected cost plus a margin approach. We allocate the transaction price using the relative standalone selling price method. The use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.\nContract liabilities are classified within \nOther current liabilities\n and \nOther long-term liabilities\n on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our contract liabilities are primarily composed of deferred revenue related to the LATITUDE™ Patient Management System. Revenue is recognized over the average service period which is based on device and patient longevity. Our contract liabilities also include deferred revenue related to the LUX-Dx™ Insertable Cardiac Monitor system, also within our CRM business, for which revenue is recognized over the average service period based on device longevity and usage. We have elected not to disclose the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations when the original expected contract duration is one year or less. In addition, we have not identified material unfulfilled performance obligations for which revenue is not currently deferred.\nVariable Consideration\nWe generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.\nWe also offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the expected rebates, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. We have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices. We recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above.\n74\nPost-Implant Services\nWe provide non-contractual services to customers, where necessary, to ensure the safe and effective use of certain implanted devices. Because the revenue related to the immaterial non-contractual services is recognized before they are delivered, we forward accrue the costs to provide these services at the time the devices are sold. We record these costs to\n Selling, general and administrative expenses\n within our consolidated statements of operations. We estimate the amount of time spent by our representatives performing these services and their compensation throughout the device life to determine the service cost. Changes to our business practice or the use of alternative estimates could result in a different amount of accrued cost.\nWarranty Obligations \nWe offer warranties on certain of our product offerings. The majority of our warranty liability relates to implantable devices offered by our CRM business, which include implantable defibrillator and pacemaker systems. These products come with a standard limited warranty covering the replacement of these devices. We offer a full warranty for a portion of the period post-implant and a partial warranty for a period of time thereafter. We estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and cost per claim and record a liability equal to these estimated costs as \nCost of products sold\n at the time the product sale occurs. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust these amounts as necessary.\nInventories\nWe state inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or net realizable value. We utilize a standard costing system, capitalizing variances between estimated and actual production costs during periods of normal production, and amortize to \nCost of products sold \nover inventory turns. We expense manufacturing variances during periods of abnormal production, or less than 75 percent of manufacturing capacity. We did not record any abnormal production variances during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nWe state property, plant, equipment and leasehold improvements at historical cost. We charge expenditures for maintenance and repairs to expense and capitalize additions and improvements that extend the life of the underlying asset. We provide for depreciation using the straight-line method at rates that approximate the estimated useful lives of the assets. We depreciate buildings over a maximum life of \n40\n years; building improvements over the remaining useful life of the building structure; equipment, furniture and fixtures over a \nthree\n to \nseven\n year life; and leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related lease.\nValuation of Business Combinations \nWe allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets and in-process research and development (IPR&D), which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including IPR&D, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate to goodwill any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired. Transaction costs associated with these acquisitions are expensed as incurred through \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n.\nIn cases where we acquire a company in which we previously held an equity stake, we attribute a portion of the purchase price to the previously-held equity interest, which is implied based on the total purchase consideration allocable to each of the shareholders, including Boston Scientific, according to priority of equity interests. We record a gain or loss in \nOther, net \nequal to the difference between the implied fair value of our prior ownership and the book value immediately prior to the acquisition.\n75\nWhere an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through \nContingent consideration net expense (benefit)\n on our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount rates, periods, timing and amount of projected revenue or timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. Payment of additional consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones after the acquisition date, including attaining specified revenue levels, achieving product development targets and/or obtaining regulatory approvals for products in development at the date of the acquisition.\nIndefinite-lived Intangibles and IPR&D \nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, include IPR&D intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Our IPR&D represents intangible assets that are used in research and development activities but have not yet reached technological feasibility, regardless of whether they have alternative future use. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We classify IPR&D as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Upon completion of the associated research and development efforts, we will determine the useful life of the technology and begin amortizing the assets to reflect their use over their remaining lives. Upon permanent abandonment, we write-off the remaining carrying amount of the associated IPR&D intangible asset. \nWe test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually during the third quarter for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. In addition, we review our indefinite-lived intangible assets for classification and impairment more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, \nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other \n(FASB ASC Topic 350)\n. \nIf the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.\nWe use the income approach to determine the fair values of our IPR&D. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of other acquired assets, the expected regulatory path and introduction dates by region and the estimated useful life of the technology. See \nNote C – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n for more information related to indefinite-lived intangibles, including IPR&D.\nFor asset purchases outside of business combinations, we expense any purchased research and development assets as of the acquisition date.\n \nAmortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets \nWe record definite-lived intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives. We use a straight-line method of amortization, unless a method that better reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up can be reliably determined. The approximate useful lives for amortization of our intangible assets are as follows: patents and licenses, \ntwo\n to \n20\n years; amortizable technology-related and customer relationships, \nfive\n to \n25\n years; other intangible assets, various. In addition, we classify internal use software as an intangible asset within our accompanying consolidated balance sheets and amortize over a \none\n to \n15\n year useful life. Due to the operational nature of these assets, we record the amortization of our internal use software within \nCost of products sold; Selling, general and administrative expenses\n and \nResearch and development expenses,\n as appropriate within our accompanying consolidated statements of operations, and include in \nAmortization expense\n only that associated with intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition, as well as internally-developed patents.\nWe review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product recall or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If we determine it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired based on our qualitative assessment of impairment indicators, we test the intangible asset for \n76\nrecoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset or asset group exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset or asset group, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period impairment is identified. \nWe calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset or asset group. See \nNote C – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n for more information related to impairments of intangible assets.\nFor patents developed internally, we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents, including attorney fees, registration fees, consulting fees and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent.\n \nGoodwill Valuation\nWe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances, utilizing both the qualitative and quantitative approach described in FASB ASC Topic 350, in the second quarter of each year as of April 1 for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest an impairment may exist.\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. For our 2024 annual impairment assessment, we identified the following reporting units for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment test: Interventional Cardiology, Rhythm Management, Peripheral Interventions, Endoscopy, Urology and Neuromodulation. Based on the criteria prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 350, we aggregated the Interventional Cardiology Therapies and Watchman components of our Cardiology operating segment into a single Interventional Cardiology reporting unit and aggregated the Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology components into a single Rhythm Management reporting unit. \nIn performing annual impairment assessments, the qualitative approach is used for testing reporting units where fair value has historically exceeded carrying value by greater than 100 percent, and all other reporting units are tested using the quantitative approach. When a quantitative test is performed, we typically use the income approach, specifically the Discounted Cash Flow method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. We historically selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures the fair value of our income producing assets. We make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our Discounted Cash Flow analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates.\nInvestments in Publicly Traded and Privately-Held Entities \nFor publicly-held equity securities for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, we account for these investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized currently in \nOther, net\n within our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For privately-held equity securities for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence, we apply the measurement alternative approach and measure these investments at cost minus impairment, if any, adjusted to fair value for any observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. We account for investments in entities for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a VIE in which we are the primary beneficiary in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 323, \nInvestments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures\n. We record these investments initially at cost and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee, including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements. Refer to \nNote B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\n for additional details on our investment balances.\nEach reporting period, we evaluate our investments to determine if there are any events or circumstances that are likely to have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Examples of such impairment indicators include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in earnings performance, recent financing rounds at reduced valuations, a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of an investee or a significant doubt about an investee’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we identify an impairment indicator, we will estimate the fair value of the investment and compare it to its carrying value. Our estimation of fair value considers financial information related to the \n77\ninvestee available to us, including valuations based on recent third-party equity investments in the investee. For our investments for which we apply the measurement alternative, if the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value, the investment is impaired and we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment’s carrying value and its fair value. For our equity method investments, if we determine an impairment is other-than-temporary, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment’s carrying value and its fair value. We deem an impairment to be other-than-temporary unless available evidence indicates that the valuation is more likely than not to recover up to the carrying value of the investment in a reasonable period of time, and we have both the ability and intent to hold the investment for at least the period of time needed to recover the value. \nNet gains and losses and impairments associated with our investment portfolio are included within \nOther, net \nin our consolidated statements of operations.\n \nIncome Taxes\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse. Future changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. \nWith respect to uncertain tax positions, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, \nIncome Taxes\n, any tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured and recognized in the consolidated financial statements at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The amount relating to uncertain tax positions is classified as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets to the extent that we anticipate making a payment within one year. \nInterest and penalties associated with income taxes are classified within \nIncome tax expense (benefit)\n in our consolidated statements of operations. \nWe have elected to treat the impact of Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) as a period cost reported as part of continuing operations. \nSee \nNote H – Income Taxes\n for further information and discussion of our income tax provision and balances.\n \nLegal and Product Liability Costs \nWe are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities and product liability litigation. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We are also the subject of certain governmental investigations, which could result in substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies. We maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. We analyze litigation settlements to identify each element of the arrangement. We allocate arrangement consideration to patent licenses received based on estimates of fair value and capitalize these amounts as assets if the license will provide an ongoing future benefit. We record certain legal and product liability charges, credits and costs of defense, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant as \nLitigation-related charges (credits)\n in our consolidated statements of operations; all other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n within our consolidated statements of operations. See \nNote I – Commitments and Contingencies\n for discussion of our individual material legal proceedings.\n78\nCosts Associated with Exit Activities \nWe record employee termination costs in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 712\n,\n \nCompensation - Nonretirement and Postemployment Benefits\n, if we pay the benefits as part of an ongoing benefit arrangement, which includes benefits provided as part of our established severance policies or that we provide in accordance with international statutory requirements. We accrue employee termination costs associated with an ongoing benefit arrangement if the obligation is attributable to prior services rendered, the rights to the benefits have vested, the payment is probable and we can reasonably estimate the liability. We account for involuntary employee termination benefits that represent a one-time benefit in accordance with \nFASB ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations\n (FASB ASC Topic 420). We record such costs into expense over the employee’s future service period, if any. \nOther costs associated with exit activities may include contract termination costs and consulting fees, which are expensed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 420 and are included within \nRestructuring net charges (credits)\n in our consolidated statements of operations. \nWe recorded \nRestructuring net charges (credits) \nof \n$\n16\n million in 2024, $\n69\n million in 2023 and $\n24\n million in 2022. The restructuring reserve balance as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $\n26\n million and $\n41\n million, respectively. Additionally, costs directly related to our active restructuring initiatives, including program management costs, accelerated depreciation, fixed asset write-offs and costs to transfer product lines among facilities are included within \nCosts of products sold, Selling, general and administrative expenses\n and \nResearch and development expenses \nwithin our consolidated statements of operations. Impairment of right of use lease assets and lease termination costs directly related to our active restructuring initiatives are expensed in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 842, \nLeases\n (FASB ASC Topic 842) and included within \nCosts of products sold\n or \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n in our consolidated statements of operations.\n \nTranslation of Foreign Currency\nWe translate all assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries from the functional currency, which is generally the local currency, into U.S. dollars using the year-end exchange rate. We show the net effect of these translation adjustments within our consolidated financial statements as a component of \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\n. We translate revenues and expenses at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. For any significant foreign subsidiaries located in highly inflationary economies, we re-measure their financial statements as if the functional currency were the U.S. dollar. \nForeign currency transaction gains and losses are included within \nOther, net \nin our consolidated statements of operations, net of gains and losses from any related derivative financial instruments.\n \nFinancial Instruments \nWe recognize all derivative financial instruments in our consolidated financial statements at fair value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815\n, Derivatives and Hedging \n(FASB ASC Topic 815), and we present assets and liabilities associated with our derivative financial instruments on a gross basis in our consolidated financial statements. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815, for those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, the hedging instrument must be designated, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for, and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship, as well as on the type of hedging relationship. Our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings to material risk, as gains and losses on these derivatives generally offset gains and losses on the item being hedged, and we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Refer to \nNote D – Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements\n for more information on our hedging instruments.\nResearch and Development\nWe expense research and development (R&D) costs, including new product development programs, regulatory compliance and clinical research as incurred. Refer to\n Indefinite-lived Intangibles and IPR&D\n above for our policy regarding R&D projects acquired in connection with our business combinations and asset purchases.\nNOTE B – ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS \nOur consolidated financial statements include the operating results for acquired entities from the respective dates of acquisition. We have not presented supplemental pro forma financial information for completed acquisitions or divestitures given their results are not material to our consolidated financial statements. Further, transaction costs were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements and were expensed as incurred.\n79\nOn January 24, 2025, we completed our acquisition of \n100\n percent of Cortex, Inc. (Cortex), a privately held medical technology company focused on the development of a diagnostic mapping solution which may identify triggers and drivers outside of the pulmonary veins that are foundational to atrial fibrillation (AF). The transaction consisted of an upfront cash payment of $\n248\n million, net of cash acquired, and up to approximately $\n50\n million in future payments upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The Cortex business will be integrated into our Cardiology division.\nOn January 8, 2025, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to acquire Bolt Medical, Inc. (Bolt Medical), the developer of an intravascular lithotripsy advanced laser-based platform for the treatment of coronary and peripheral artery disease. We have been an investor in Bolt Medical since 2019 and currently hold an equity stake of approximately \n26\n percent. The transaction price to acquire the remaining stake is expected to result in an upfront cash payment of approximately $\n443\n million upon closing and up to an additional $\n221\n million in future payments upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. The Bolt Medical business will be integrated into our Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions divisions. \nOn November 25, 2024, we announced our entry into a definitive agreement to acquire \n100\n percent of Intera Oncology\n®\n, Inc. (Intera), a privately held medical device company that provides the Intera 3000 Hepatic Artery Infusion Pump and floxuridine – a chemotherapy drug – both of which are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The Intera 3000 pump is used to administer hepatic artery infusion therapy to treat tumors in the liver primarily caused by metastatic colorectal cancer. The purchase price consists of an upfront cash payment of approximately $\n175\n million. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. The Intera business will be integrated into our Peripheral Interventions division.\n2024 Acquisitions\nOn September 17, 2024, we completed our acquisition of \n100\n percent of the outstanding equity of Silk Road Medical, Inc. (Silk Road Medical), a publicly traded medical device company that has developed an innovative platform of products to prevent stroke in patients with carotid artery disease through a minimally-invasive procedure called transcarotid artery revascularization. The transaction consisted of an upfront cash payment of $\n27.50\n per share, or approximately $\n1.126\n billion, net of cash acquired. The Silk Road Medical business is being integrated into our Peripheral Interventions division.\nOn November 15, 2024, we completed our acquisition of \n100\n percent of the outstanding equity of Axonics, Inc. (Axonics), a public medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of differentiated devices to treat urinary and bowel dysfunction. The transaction consisted of an upfront cash payment of $\n71.00\n per share, or approximately $\n3.409\n billion, net of cash acquired. The Axonics business is being integrated into our Urology division.\nPurchase Price Allocation \nWe accounted for these transactions as business combinations in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805\n, Business Combinations \n(FASB ASC Topic 805). \nThe preliminary purchase prices were comprised of the amounts presented below: \n(in millions)\nSilk Road Medical\nAxonics\nPayment for acquisition, net of cash acquired\n$\n1,126\n \n$\n3,409\n \n$\n1,126\n \n$\n3,409\n \nWe recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective fair values as of the closing date of the transaction. The preliminary purchase price allocations were comprised of the components presented below, which represent the preliminary determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net identifiable assets acquired recorded to goodwill. The final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities will be completed within the measurement period in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 805.\n80\n(in millions)\nSilk Road Medical\nAxonics\nGoodwill\n$\n569\n \n$\n2,147\n \nAmortizable intangible assets\n507\n \n1,242\n \nOther assets acquired\n117\n \n423\n \nLiabilities assumed\n(\n45\n)\n(\n167\n)\nNet deferred tax liabilities\n(\n23\n)\n(\n237\n)\n$\n1,126\n \n$\n3,409\n \nGoodwill was primarily established for Silk Road Medical and Axonics due to synergies expected to be gained from leveraging our existing operations, as well as revenue and cash flow projections associated with future technologies, none of which is deductible for tax purposes.\nWe allocated a portion of the purchase price to the specific intangible asset categories as follows:\nAmount Assigned\n(in millions)\nWeighted Average Amortization Period\n(in years)\nRisk-Adjusted Discount \nRates used in Purchase Price Allocation\nSilk Road Medical:\nAmortizable intangible assets:\nTechnology-related\n$\n447\n \n12\n13\n%\nCustomer relationships\n61\n \n12\n13\n%\n$\n507\n \nAxonics\nAmortizable intangible assets:\nTechnology-related\n$\n1,157\n \n12\n10\n%\nCustomer relationships\n85\n \n12\n10\n%\n$\n1,242\n \nOur technology-related intangible assets consist of technical processes, intellectual property and institutional understanding with respect to products and processes that we intend to leverage in future products or processes. We used the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, to derive the fair value of the technology-related intangible assets and are amortizing them on a straight-line basis over their assigned estimated useful lives.\n2023 Acquisitions\nOn February 20, 2023, we completed the acquisition of a majority stake investment in Acotec, a publicly traded Chinese manufacturer of drug-coated balloons and other products used in the treatment of vascular and other diseases. We consolidated this majority stake investment in Acotec based on the conclusion we control the entity, and recorded a noncontrolling interest for the portion we do not own. We acquired approximately \n65\n percent of the outstanding shares of Acotec, for an upfront cash payment of HK$\n20.00\n per share, or $\n519\n million at foreign currency exchange rates at closing. The Acotec portfolio complements our existing Peripheral Interventions portfolio.\nOn April 4, 2023, we completed our acquisition of \n100\n percent of the outstanding equity of Apollo Endosurgery, Inc. (Apollo), a public company which offers a portfolio of devices used during endoluminal procedures to close gastrointestinal defects, manage gastrointestinal complications and aid in weight loss for patients suffering from obesity. The transaction consisted of an upfront cash payment of $\n636\n million, net of cash acquired. The Apollo business is being integrated into our Endoscopy division.\nOn November 17, 2023, we completed our acquisition of \n100\n percent of the outstanding equity of Relievant Medsystems, Inc. (Relievant), a privately held medical technology company that developed and commercialized the Intracept® Intraosseous \n81\nNerve Ablation System to treat vertebrogenic pain, a form of chronic low back pain. The transaction consisted of an upfront cash payment of $\n794\n million, net of cash acquired, and additional sales-based milestones over the three years following the transaction close. These milestones, certain of which are uncapped, were estimated to have a fair value of $\n273\n million as of the acquisition date.

We used the multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, to derive the fair value of the technology-related intangible assets and are amortizing them on a straight-line basis over their assigned estimated useful lives.\nContingent Consideration\nChanges in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability during 2024 and 2023 associated with current and prior period acquisitions were as follows:\n(in millions)\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n149\n \nAmount recorded related to current year acquisitions\n273\n \nContingent consideration net expense (benefit)\n58\n \nContingent consideration payments\n(\n76\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n404\n \nAmount recorded related to current year acquisitions\n29\n \nContingent consideration net expense (benefit)\n(\n5\n)\nContingent consideration payments and other adjustments\n(\n257\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n171\n \nIn 2024, payments were primarily related to our acquisition of Farapulse, Inc. (Farapulse) and Relievant following the achievement of revenue-based earnouts and sales milestones, respectively. In 2023, payments were primarily related to our acquisition of Farapulse following the achievement of revenue milestones.\n83\nThe maximum amount for certain contingent consideration is not determinable as it is uncapped and based on a percent of certain sales. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of such uncapped contingent consideration is estimated at $\n147\n million. As of December 31, 2024, the maximum amount that we could be required to pay under our other capped contingent consideration arrangements (undiscounted) is approximately $\n220\n million. \nThe recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of our contingent consideration liability that we expect to be required to settle include the following significant unobservable inputs:\nContingent Consideration Liability\nFair Value as of December 31, 2024\nValuation Technique\nUnobservable Input\nRange\nWeighted Average\n(1)\nRevenue-based Payments and Commercialization Milestones\n$\n171\n million\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nDiscount Rate\n6\n \n%\n-\n15\n%\n7\n%\nProbability of Payment\n40\n%\n-\n100\n%\n96\n%\nProjected Year of Payment\n2025\n-\n2029\n2027\n(1) \nUnobservable inputs were weighted by the relative fair value of the contingent consideration liability. For projected year of payment, the amount represents the median of the inputs and is not a weighted average.\nProjected contingent payment amounts related to our revenue-based payments and commercialization milestones are discounted back to the current period, primarily using a discounted cash flow model. Significant increases or decreases in projected revenues, probabilities of payment, discount rates or the time until payment is made would have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement as of December 31, 2024.\nStrategic Investments\nThe aggregate carrying amount of our strategic investments was comprised of the following:\nAs of December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nEquity method investments\n$\n278\n \n$\n219\n \nMeasurement alternative investments\n(1, 2)\n277\n \n194\n \n$\n555\n \n$\n413\n \n(1)\n Measurement alternative investments are privately-held equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are measured at cost less impairment, if any, adjusted to fair value for any observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer, recognized in \nOther, net\n within our accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n(2)\n Includes publicly-held equity securities and convertible notes measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in \nOther, net\n within our consolidated statements of operations.\nThese investments are classified as \nOther long-term assets\n within our consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with GAAP and our accounting policies.\nIn 2024, the cost of our aggregated equity method investments exceeded our share of the underlying equity in net assets by $\n333\n million, which represents amortizable intangible assets, IPR&D, goodwill and deferred tax liabilities.\n \n84\nNOTE C – GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS \nThe gross carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets and the related accumulated amortization for intangible assets subject to amortization and accumulated goodwill impairment charges are as follows: \n \nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\n(in millions)\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated\nAmortization/\nWrite-offs\nGross Carrying Amount\nAccumulated\nAmortization/\nWrite-offs\nTechnology-related\n$\n14,327\n \n$\n(\n8,605\n)\n$\n13,207\n \n$\n(\n8,101\n)\nPatents\n481\n \n(\n381\n)\n480\n \n(\n387\n)\nOther intangible assets\n2,380\n \n(\n1,612\n)\n2,130\n \n(\n1,500\n)\nAmortizable intangible assets\n$\n17,188\n \n$\n(\n10,598\n)\n$\n15,817\n \n$\n(\n9,988\n)\nGoodwill\n$\n26,989\n \n$\n(\n9,900\n)\n$\n24,287\n \n$\n(\n9,900\n)\nIPR&D\n94\n \n54\n \nTechnology-related\n—\n \n120\n \nIndefinite-lived intangible assets\n$\n94\n \n$\n174\n \nThe increase in our balance of goodwill and amortizable intangible assets is related primarily to our acquisitions of Silk Road Medical and Axonics in the third and fourth quarters of 2024, respectively.\nIntangible asset impairment charges\n were $\n386\n million in 2024, $\n58\n million in 2023 and $\n132\n million in 2022. The impairment charges recorded in 2024 were primarily associated with amortizable intangible assets established in connection with our acquisitions of Cryterion Medical, Inc. (Cryterion) and Devoro Medical, Inc. (Devoro), which were integrated into our Electrophysiology and Peripheral Interventions business units, respectively. Intangible assets acquired from Cryterion were impaired due to strong commercial adoption of our Farapulse™ Pulsed Field Ablation System in our Electrophysiology business unit and the resulting lower revenue projections and cannibalization of our cryoablation business. Intangible assets acquired from Devoro were impaired following management's decision to cancel the related program in the second quarter of 2024. The impairment charges recorded in 2023 were primarily associated with the cancellation of an IPR&D program due to the incremental time and cost to complete the program and bring the technology to market. \nDuring the third quarter of 2024, we performed our annual IPR&D impairment test and evaluated our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment and concluded the assets were not impaired. We also reclassified our indefinite-lived technology-related intangible assets to amortizable intangible assets after determining they no longer have an indefinite useful life and verified that the classification of IPR&D projects recognized within our unaudited consolidated balance sheets continues to be appropriate.\nThe following represents a roll forward of our goodwill balance by reportable segment:\n(in millions)\nMedSurg\nCardiovascular\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n4,237\n \n$\n8,684\n \n$\n12,920\n \nGoodwill acquired\n1,110\n \n337\n \n1,447\n \nImpact of foreign currency fluctuations and other changes\n—\n \n20\n \n20\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n5,347\n \n$\n9,041\n \n$\n14,387\n \nGoodwill acquired\n2,172\n \n615\n \n2,787\n \nImpact of foreign currency fluctuations and purchase price and other adjustments\n(\n35\n)\n(\n51\n)\n(\n86\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n7,483\n \n$\n9,606\n \n$\n17,089\n \nIn the second quarter of 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test utilizing both the qualitative and quantitative approach described in FASB ASC Topic 350. The qualitative approach was used for testing reporting units where fair value has historically exceeded carrying value by greater than 100 percent, and all other reporting units were tested using the quantitative approach. For the reporting units tested using the quantitative approach, we determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value and concluded that goodwill was not impaired or at risk of impairment. \n85\nRefer to \nNote A – Significant Accounting Policies\n for further discussion of our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing.\nEstimated \nAmortization expense\n for each of the five succeeding fiscal years based upon our amortizable intangible asset portfolio, consisting of intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition, as well as internally developed patents, as of December 31, 2024 is as follows:\nFiscal Year\n(in millions)\n2025\n$\n893\n \n2026\n874\n \n2027\n835\n \n2028\n787\n \n2029\n769\n \nThese estimates do not include amortization expense associated with future acquisitions that have been announced but not yet completed as of December 31, 2024.\nNOTE D – HEDGING ACTIVITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS \nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe address market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates through risk management programs which include the use of derivative and nonderivative financial instruments. We operate these programs pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies and do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Our derivative instruments do not subject our earnings to material risk, as the gains or losses on these derivatives generally offset losses or gains recognized on the hedged item.\nWe manage concentration of counterparty credit risk by limiting acceptable counterparties to major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings, limiting the amount of credit exposure to individual counterparties and by actively monitoring counterparty credit ratings and the amount of individual credit exposure. We also employ master netting arrangements that limit the risk of counterparty non-payment on a particular settlement date to the net gain that would have otherwise been received from the counterparty. Although not completely eliminated, we do not consider the risk of counterparty default to be significant as a result of these protections. Further, none of our derivative instruments are subject to collateral or other security arrangements, nor do they contain provisions that are dependent on our credit ratings from any credit rating agency.\nCurrency Hedging Instruments\nRisk Management Strategy\nOur risk from changes in currency exchange rates consists primarily of monetary assets and liabilities; forecasted intercompany and third-party transactions; and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We manage currency exchange rate risk at a consolidated level to reduce the cost of hedging by taking advantage of offsetting transactions. We employ derivative and nonderivative instruments, primarily forward currency contracts, to reduce the risk to our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in currency exchange rates. \nThe success of our currency risk management program depends, in part, on forecast transactions denominated primarily in euro, Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, British pound sterling, Australian dollar and Swiss franc. We may experience unanticipated currency exchange gains or losses to the extent the actual activity is different than forecasted. In addition, changes in currency exchange rates related to any unhedged transactions may impact our earnings and cash flows.\nHedge Designations and Relationships\nCertain of our currency derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges under FASB ASC Topic 815, and are intended to protect the U.S. dollar value of forecasted transactions. The gain or loss on a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in the \nNet change in derivative financial instruments\n component of \nOther comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\n (OCI) within our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) until the underlying third-party transaction occurs. When the underlying third-party transaction occurs, we recognize the gain or loss in earnings within \nCost of products sold\n in our consolidated statements of operations. In the event the hedging relationship is no longer effective, or if the \n86\noccurrence of the hedged forecast transaction becomes no longer probable, we reclassify the gains or losses within \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\n (AOCI) to earnings at that time. The cash flows related to the derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported as operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nWe also designate certain forward currency contracts as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investments in certain of our entities with functional currencies denominated in the Chinese renminbi and Japanese yen. For these derivative instruments, we elected to use the spot method to assess hedge effectiveness. We also elected to exclude the spot-forward difference, referred to as the excluded component, from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are amortizing this amount separately, as calculated at the date of designation, on a straight-line basis over the term of the currency forward contracts. As such, we defer recognition of foreign currency gains and losses within the\n Foreign currency translation adjustment \n(CTA) component of OCI, and we reclassify amortization of the excluded component from AOCI to current period earnings within \nInterest expense\n within our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe designate certain euro-denominated debt as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our net investments in certain of our entities with functional currencies denominated in the euro. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we designated as a net investment hedge our €\n900\n million in aggregate principal amount of \n0.625\n% senior notes issued in November 2019 and due in 2027 (December 2027 Notes). For these nonderivative instruments, we defer recognition of the foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses within the CTA component of OCI. We reclassify these gains and losses to current period earnings within \nOther, net\n within our consolidated statements of operations only when the hedged item affects earnings, which would occur upon disposal or substantial liquidation of the underlying foreign subsidiary.\nWe also use forward currency contracts that are not part of designated hedging relationships as a part of our strategy to manage our exposure to currency exchange rate risk related to monetary assets and liabilities and related forecast transactions. These non-designated currency forward contracts have an original time to maturity consistent with the hedged currency transaction exposures, generally less than one year, and are marked-to-market with changes in fair value recorded to earnings within \nOther, net\n in our consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest Rate Hedging Instruments\nRisk Management Strategy\nOur interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar and euro-denominated borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to mitigate the risk to our earnings and cash flows associated with exposure to changes in interest rates. Under these agreements, we and the counterparty, at specified intervals, exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. We designate these derivative instruments either as fair value or cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815.\nHedge Designations and Relationships\nWe had no interest rate derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In the event that we designate outstanding interest rate derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives within OCI until the underlying hedged transaction occurs. \nWe had no interest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. In the event that we designate outstanding interest rate derivative instruments as fair value hedges, we record the changes in the fair values of interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges and of the underlying hedged debt instruments in \nInterest expense\n, which generally offset. \n87\nThe following table presents the contractual amounts of our hedging instruments outstanding:\n(in millions)\nFASB ASC Topic 815 Designation\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nForward currency contracts\nCash flow hedge\n$\n2,464\n \n$\n2,284\n \nForward currency contracts\nNet investment hedge\n741\n \n333\n \nForeign currency-denominated debt\n(1)\nNet investment hedge\n997\n \n997\n \nForward currency contracts\nNon-designated\n4,440\n \n3,282\n \nTotal Notional Outstanding\n$\n8,642\n \n$\n6,896\n \n(1)\n Foreign currency-denominated debt is the €\n900\n million debt principal associated with our December 2027 Notes designated as a net investment hedge.\nThe remaining time to maturity as of December 31, 2024 is within \n36\n months for all forward currency contracts designated as cash flow hedges and generally less than \none year\n for all non-designated forward currency contracts.

We determine the fair value of our derivative and nonderivative instruments using the framework prescribed by FASB ASC Topic 820, \nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures (\nFASB ASC Topic 820), and considering the estimated amount we would receive or pay to transfer these instruments at the reporting date with respect to current currency exchange rates, interest rates, the creditworthiness of the counterparty for unrealized gain positions and our own creditworthiness for unrealized loss positions. In certain instances, we may utilize financial models to measure fair value of our derivative and nonderivative instruments. In doing so, we use inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means.\n \nThe following are the balances of our derivative and nonderivative assets and liabilities:\n(in millions)\nLocation on Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(1)\nAs of December 31,\n2024\n2023\nDerivative and Nonderivative Assets:\n \n \n \nDesignated Hedging Instruments\n \n \nForward currency contracts\nOther current assets\n$\n149\n \n$\n140\n \nForward currency contracts\nOther long-term assets\n79\n \n107\n \n \n \n228\n \n246\n \nNon-Designated Hedging Instruments\n \n \n \nForward currency contracts\nOther current assets\n156\n \n20\n \nTotal Derivative and Nonderivative Assets\n \n$\n384\n \n$\n266\n \nDerivative and Nonderivative Liabilities:\n \n \n \nDesignated Hedging Instruments\n \n \nForward currency contracts\nOther current liabilities\n$\n1\n \n$\n15\n \nForward currency contracts\nOther long-term liabilities\n—\n \n9\n \nForeign currency-denominated debt\n(2)\nLong-term debt\n930\n \n988\n \n \n \n931\n \n1,012\n \nNon-Designated Hedging Instruments\n \n \n \nForward currency contracts\nOther current liabilities\n59\n \n38\n \nTotal Derivative and Nonderivative Liabilities\n$\n990\n \n$\n1,050\n \n(1)\n We classify derivative and nonderivative assets and liabilities as current when the settlement date of the contract is one year or less.\n(2)\n Foreign currency-denominated debt is the €\n900\n million debt principal associated with our December 2027 Notes designated as a net investment hedge. A portion of this notional is subject to de-designation and re-designation based on changes in the underlying hedged item.\nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nOn a recurring basis, we measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Where quoted market prices or other observable inputs are not available, we apply valuation techniques to estimate fair value. FASB ASC Topic 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The category of a financial asset or a financial liability within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the measurement of fair value. The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are other observable inputs, including quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities and market-corroborated inputs.\n•\nLevel 3 – Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable inputs based on management’s best estimate of inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date, including assumptions about risk.\n91\nAssets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the following:\nAs of\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMoney market funds and time deposits\n$\n120\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n120\n \n$\n454\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n454\n \nPublicly-held securities\n19\n \n—\n \n—\n \n19\n \n18\n \n—\n \n—\n \n18\n \nHedging instruments\n—\n \n384\n \n—\n \n384\n \n—\n \n266\n \n—\n \n266\n \nLicensing arrangements\n—\n \n—\n \n24\n \n24\n \n—\n \n—\n \n77\n \n77\n \n \n$\n139\n \n$\n384\n \n$\n24\n \n$\n547\n \n$\n472\n \n$\n266\n \n$\n77\n \n$\n816\n \nLiabilities\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHedging instruments\n$\n—\n \n$\n990\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n990\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,050\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,050\n \nContingent consideration liability\n—\n \n—\n \n171\n \n171\n \n—\n \n—\n \n404\n \n404\n \nLicensing arrangements\n—\n \n—\n \n33\n \n33\n \n—\n \n—\n \n90\n \n90\n \n \n$\n—\n \n$\n990\n \n$\n203\n \n$\n1,194\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,050\n \n$\n494\n \n$\n1,545\n \nOur investments in money market funds and time deposits are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices. These investments are classified as \nCash and cash equivalents\n or \nOther current assets \nwithin our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, in accordance with GAAP and our accounting policies. In addition to $\n120\n million invested in money market funds and time deposits as of December 31, 2024 and $\n454\n million as of December 31, 2023, we held $\n364\n million in interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing bank accounts as of December 31, 2024 and $\n411\n million as of December 31, 2023.\nOur recurring fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs include those related to our contingent consideration liability. Refer to \nNote B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments \nfor a discussion of the changes in the fair value of our contingent consideration liability. In addition, our recurring fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs are comprised of licensing arrangements, including the contractual right to receive future royalty payments related to the Zytiga™ Drug. We own the contractual right to receive 50 percent of the future Zytiga Drug royalty payments from the licensee and remit such payments to the inventors associated with the intellectual property. We maintain a financial asset and associated liability for our licensing arrangements measured at fair value within our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 825, \nFinancial Instruments. \nWe elected the fair value option to measure the financial asset and associated liability as it provides for consistency and comparability of these financial instruments with others. Royalty payments we receive reduce the fair value of the financial asset and are presented within \nProceeds from royalty rights,\n and payments we remit to inventors reduce the fair value of the financial liability and are presented within \nPayments for royalty rights\n within our consolidated statements of cash flows. We sold our right to receive and retain the other 50 percent of the future royalty payments in 2019 for an upfront cash payment, which we accounted for as a secured borrowing in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 860, \nTransfers and Servicing \n(FASB ASC Topic 860). Although we sold these rights, we continue to recognize at fair value the future royalty payments as an associated liability. Royalty payments associated with the rights we sold no longer impact our cash flows, and we present this activity as \nNon-cash impact of transferred royalty rights\n in the supplemental information to our consolidated statements of cash flows. We reduce the fair value of the associated liability when such non-cash activity occurs.\nWe record the fair value of the financial asset and associated liability using a discounted cash flow approach considering the probability-weighted expected future cash flows to be generated by the royalty stream. The fair value of the financial liability also considers the related contractual provisions that govern our payment obligations. Significant increases or decreases in projected cash flows of the royalty stream and the related contractual provisions that govern our payment obligations, discount rates or the time until payment is made would have resulted in a significantly lower or higher fair value measurement of the licensing arrangements' financial asset and liability as of December 31, 2024. However, increases or decreases in the financial asset would be offset by increases or decreases in the financial liability, other than for timing of receipt and remittance; as such our earnings are not subject to material gains and losses from the licensing arrangement. \n92\nThe recurring Level 3 fair value measurements of our licensing arrangements recognized within our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 include the following significant unobservable inputs:\nLicensing Arrangements\nFair Value as of December 31, 2024\nValuation Technique\nUnobservable Input\nRange\nWeighted Average\n(1)\nFinancial Asset\n$\n24\n million\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nDiscount Rate\n15\n%\n15\n%\nProjected Year of Payment\n2025\n-\n2025\n2025\nFinancial Liability\n$\n33\n million\nDiscounted Cash Flow\nDiscount Rate\n12\n%\n-\n15\n%\n13\n%\nProjected Year of Payment\n2025\n-\n2026\n2025\n(1) \nUnobservable inputs relate to a single financial asset and liability.

The fair value of a measurement alternative investment is not estimated if there are no identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Refer to \nNote B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments\n for a discussion of our strategic investments and \nNote C – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets \nfor a discussion of the fair values of our intangible assets including goodwill.\nThe fair value of our outstanding debt obligations, excluding finance leases, was $\n10.330\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and $\n8.735\n billion as of December 31, 2023. We determined fair value by using quoted market prices for our publicly registered senior notes, classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, and face value for commercial paper, term loans and credit facility borrowings outstanding. Refer to \nNote E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n for a discussion of our debt obligations.\n93\nNOTE E – CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS \nBorrowings and Credit Arrangements\nWe had total debt outstanding of $\n10.746\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and $\n9.102\n billion as of December 31, 2023, with current maturities of $\n1.778\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and $\n531\n million as of December 31, 2023. \nThe debt maturity schedule for our long-term debt obligations is presented below: \nIssuance Date\nMaturity Date\nAs of December 31, \nCoupon Rate\n(1)\n(in millions, except interest rates)\n2024\n2023\nMarch 2025 Senior Notes\n(3)\nMarch 2022\nMarch 2025\n—\n \n1,105\n \n0.750\n%\nJune 2025 Senior Notes\nMay 2020\nJune 2025\n—\n \n500\n \n1.900\n%\nMarch 2026 Senior Notes\nFebruary 2019\nMarch 2026\n255\n \n255\n \n3.750\n%\nDecember 2027 Senior Notes\n(3)\nNovember 2019\nDecember 2027\n935\n \n995\n \n0.625\n%\nMarch 2028 Senior Notes\n(3)\nMarch 2022\nMarch 2028\n779\n \n829\n \n1.375\n%\nMarch 2028 Senior Notes\nFebruary 2018\nMarch 2028\n344\n \n344\n \n4.000\n%\nMarch 2029 Senior Notes\nFebruary 2019\nMarch 2029\n272\n \n272\n \n4.000\n%\nMarch 2029 Senior Notes\n(3)\nFebruary 2024\nMarch 2029\n779\n \n—\n \n3.375\n%\nJune 2030 Senior Notes\nMay 2020\nJune 2030\n1,200\n \n1,200\n \n2.650\n%\nMarch 2031 Senior Notes\n(3)\nMarch 2022\nMarch 2031\n779\n \n829\n \n1.625\n%\nMarch 2032 Senior Notes\n(3)\nFebruary 2024\nMarch 2032\n1,299\n \n—\n \n3.500\n%\nMarch 2034 Senior Notes\n(3)\nMarch 2022\nMarch 2034\n519\n \n553\n \n1.875\n%\nNovember 2035 Senior Notes\n(2)\nNovember 2005\nNovember 2035\n350\n \n350\n \n6.500\n%\nMarch 2039 Senior Notes\nFebruary 2019\nMarch 2039\n450\n \n450\n \n4.550\n%\nJanuary 2040 Senior Notes\nDecember 2009\nJanuary 2040\n300\n \n300\n \n7.375\n%\nMarch 2049 Senior Notes\nFebruary 2019\nMarch 2049\n650\n \n650\n \n4.700\n%\nUnamortized Debt Issuance Discount and Deferred Financing Costs\n2025 - 2049\n(\n70\n)\n(\n65\n)\nFinance Lease Obligation\nVarious\n126\n \n5\n \nLong-term debt\n \n$\n8,968\n \n$\n8,571\n \n(1) \nCoupon rates are semi-annual, except for the euro-denominated notes, which bear an annual coupon.\n(2) \nCorporate credit rating improvements may result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate on our November 2035 Notes to the extent that our lowest credit rating is above BBB- or Baa3. The interest rates on our November 2035 Notes will be permanently reinstated to the issuance rate of 6.25% if the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior notes is either A- or A3 or higher. \n(3) \nThese notes are euro-denominated and presented in U.S. dollars based on the exchange rate in effect as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nContractual maturities of our Senior Notes classified as long-term debt as of December 31, 2024 are as follows (\nin millions\n):\nFiscal Year\n2026\n255\n \n2027\n935\n \n2028\n1,123\n \n2029\n1,051\n \nThereafter\n5,547\n \nRevolving Credit Facility \nOn May 10, 2021, we entered into a $\n2.750\n billion revolving credit facility (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks. On May 10, 2024, we entered into a third amendment to the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility credit agreement, which provided for, among other things, an extension of the scheduled maturity date to May 10, 2029, an amendment of the Ratings based pricing grid of the Applicable Margin, each as defined in the credit agreement, and reset the applicable date for purposes of determining the amounts of \n94\nrestructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses that may be excluded from consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA), as defined by the credit agreement, for purposes of our maximum leverage ratio covenant, from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024, as further discussed under \nFinancial Covenant\n below. This facility provides backing for our commercial paper program, and outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. We had no amounts outstanding under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility as of December 31, 2024 or December 31, 2023. \nFinancial Covenant\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the financial covenant required by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. \n \nCovenant Requirement\nas of December 31, 2024\n \nActual\nas of December 31, 2024\nMaximum permitted leverage ratio\n(1)\n4.75\n times\n \n2.26\n times\n(1)\n Ratio of total debt to deemed consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility credit agreement.\nThe 2021 Revolving Credit Facility includes the financial covenant requirement for all of our credit arrangements that we maintain the maximum permitted leverage ratio of \n3.75\n times for the remaining term. The credit agreement provides for higher leverage ratios, at our election, for the period following a Qualified Acquisition, as defined by the agreement, for which consideration exceeds $\n1.000\n billion. In the event of such an acquisition, for the four succeeding quarters immediately following, including the quarter in which the acquisition occurs, the maximum permitted leverage ratio is \n4.75\n times. It steps down for the fifth, sixth and seventh succeeding quarters to \n4.50\n times, \n4.25\n times and \n4.00\n times, respectively. Thereafter, a maximum leverage ratio of \n3.75\n times is required through the remaining term of the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. On November 15, 2024, we announced the closing of our acquisition of Axonics, which we had previously designated as a Qualified Acquisition under the credit agreement, increasing the maximum permitted leverage ratio to 4.75 times as of December 31, 2024.\nThe financial covenant requirement, as amended on May 10, 2024, provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA through maturity, of certain charges and expenses. The credit agreement amendment reset the starting date for purposes of calculating such permitted exclusions related to restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses from December 31, 2022 to March 31, 2024. Permitted exclusions include up to $\n500\n million in cash and non-cash restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses associated with our current or future restructuring plans. As of December 31, 2024, we had $\n322\n million of the restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any cash litigation payments (net of any cash litigation receipts), as defined by the agreement, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, provided that the sum of any excluded net cash litigation payments do not exceed $\n1.000\n billion plus all accrued legal liabilities as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2024, we had $\n1.435\n billion of the litigation exclusion remaining.\nAny inability to maintain compliance with this covenant could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit arrangements or seek waivers from compliance with this covenant, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers on terms acceptable to us. In this case, all 2021 Revolving Credit Facility commitments would terminate, and any amounts borrowed under the facility would become immediately due and payable. Furthermore, any termination of our 2021 Revolving Credit Facility may negatively impact the credit ratings assigned to our commercial paper program, which may impact our ability to refinance any then outstanding commercial paper as it becomes due and payable\n.\nCommercial Paper \nOur commercial paper program is backed by the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. Outstanding commercial paper directly reduces borrowing capacity under the 2021 Revolving Credit Facility. We had $\n191\n million outstanding under our commercial paper program as of December 31, 2024 and \nno\n commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2023.\n95\nAs of December 31,\n(in millions, except maturity and yield)\n2024\n2023\nCommercial paper outstanding (at par)\n$\n191\n \n$\n—\n \nMaximum borrowing capacity\n2,750\n \n2,750\n \nBorrowing capacity available\n2,559\n \n2,750\n \nWeighted average maturity\n20\n days\n0\n days\nWeighted average yield\n4.71\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nSenior Notes \nWe had senior notes outstanding of $\n10.451\n billion as of December 31, 2024 and $\n9.136\n billion as of December 31, 2023. Our senior notes were issued in public offerings, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to liabilities of our subsidiaries (see\n Other Arrangements\n below).\nIn February 2024, American Medical Systems Europe B.V. (AMS Europe), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Boston Scientific, completed a registered public offering of €\n2.000\n billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-denominated senior notes comprised of €\n750\n million of \n3.375\n% Senior Notes due 2029 and €\n1.250\n billion of \n3.500\n% Senior Notes due 2032 (collectively, the 2024 Eurobonds). Boston Scientific has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of AMS Europe's obligations under the 2024 Eurobonds, and no other subsidiary of Boston Scientific will guarantee these obligations. AMS Europe is a “finance subsidiary” as defined in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X. The financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of AMS Europe are consolidated in the financial statements of Boston Scientific. The offering resulted in cash proceeds of $\n2.145\n billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs.\nWe primarily used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2024 Eurobonds to fund a portion of the purchase price of the Axonics acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses, and for general corporate purposes. We also used the net proceeds to fund the repayment at maturity of our 3.450% Senior Notes due March 2024 and to pay accrued and unpaid interest with respect to such notes.\nIn March 2022, AMS Europe completed a registered public offering of €\n3.000\n billion in aggregate principal amount of euro-dominated senior notes comprised of €\n1.000\n billion of \n0.750\n% Senior Notes due 2025, €\n750\n million of \n1.375\n% Senior Notes due 2028, €\n750\n million of \n1.625\n% Senior Notes due 2031 and €\n500\n million of \n1.875\n% Senior Notes due 2034 (collectively, the 2022 Eurobonds). Boston Scientific has fully and unconditionally guaranteed all of AMS Europe's obligations under the 2022 Eurobonds, and no other subsidiary of Boston Scientific will guarantee these obligations. The Offering resulted in cash proceeds of $\n3.270\n billion, net of investor discounts and issuance costs.\nWe used the net proceeds from the offering of the 2022 Eurobonds to fund the tender offer and early redemption of combined aggregate principal amount of $\n3.275\n billion of certain of our outstanding senior notes, as well as to pay accrued interest, tender premiums, fees and expenses. We recorded associated debt extinguishment net charges of $\n194\n million during the first quarter of 2022 presented in \nInterest expense\n within our consolidated statements of operations.\n96\nOther Arrangements \nWe have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries and with commercial banks in China and Japan which include promissory notes discounting programs. We account for our factoring programs as sales under FASB ASC Topic 860. We have no retained interest in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administration, and once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. \nAmounts de-recognized for accounts and notes receivable, which are excluded from \nTrade accounts receivable, net \nin our accompanying consolidated balance sheets, are aggregated by contract denominated currency below (in millions): \nAs of December 31, 2024\nAs of December 31, 2023\nFactoring Arrangements\nAmount\nDe-recognized\nWeighted Average Interest Rate\nAmount\nDe-recognized\nWeighted Average Interest Rate\nEuro denominated\n$\n176\n \n5.3\n \n%\n$\n206\n \n5.1\n \n%\nYen denominated\n193\n \n0.9\n \n%\n214\n \n0.6\n \n%\nRenminbi denominated\n26\n \n2.0\n \n%\n14\n \n2.9\n \n%\nOther Contractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe had outstanding letters of credit of $\n206\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n174\n million as of December 31, 2023, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers' compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2024, future minimum purchase obligations, relating primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business, were (in millions):\nFiscal Year\nUnrecorded Purchase Obligations\n2025\n$\n881\n \n2026\n220\n \n2027\n125\n \n2028\n108\n \n2029\n21\n \nThereafter\n159\n \n \n$\n1,514\n \nWe have a supplier financing program offered primarily in the U.S. that enables our suppliers to opt to receive early payment at a nominal discount, while allowing us to lengthen our payment terms and optimize working capital. Our standard payment term in the U.S. is 90 days. All outstanding payables related to the supplier finance program are classified within \nAccounts Payable\n within our consolidated balance sheets and were $\n140\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n152\n million as of December 31, 2023.\nThe following is a roll forward of outstanding payables related to our supplier finance program:\n(in millions)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n152\n \nAdditions\n664\n \nSettlements\n(\n677\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n140\n \n97\nNOTE F – LEASES \nWe have operating and finance leases for real estate including corporate offices, land, warehouse space, and vehicles and certain equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are generally not recorded on the balance sheet, unless the arrangement includes an option to purchase the underlying asset, or an option to renew the arrangement, that we are reasonably certain to exercise (short-term leases). We recognize lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term for short-term leases that we do not record on our balance sheet. If there is a change in our assessment of the lease term and, as a result, the remaining lease term extends more than 12 months from the end of the previously determined lease term, or we subsequently become reasonably certain that we will exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset, the lease no longer meets the definition of a short-term lease and is accounted for as either an operating or finance lease and recognized on the balance sheet. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 842, we account for the lease components and the non-lease components as a single lease component, with the exception of our warehouse leases. Our leases have remaining lease terms of less than \n1\n year to approximately \n52\n years, some of which may include options to extend the leases for up to \n10\n years. If we are reasonably certain we will exercise an option to extend the lease, the time period covered by the extension option is included in the lease term.\nWe determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present at the inception of the arrangement. Operating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As such, we utilize the appropriate incremental borrowing rate, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term at an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as initial direct costs paid or incentives received. \nOur operating lease right-of-use assets are presented within \nOther long-term assets\n and corresponding liabilities are presented within \nOther current liabilities\n and \nOther long-term liabilities\n on our consolidated balance sheets. In December 2024, a previously executed lease for additional office and warehouse space with a noncancellable lease term of \n25\n years commenced, resulting in the recognition of a $\n122\n million finance lease right-of-use asset, recorded in \nProperty, plant, and equipment, net\n, in our consolidated balance sheets, as well as a corresponding current finance lease liability of less than $\n1\n million, and noncurrent finance lease liability of $\n123\n million, recorded in \nCurrent debt obligations\n and \nLong-term debt\n, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets. The discount rate used to calculate the initial right-of-use asset and corresponding liability was \n4.8\n%. Refer to \nNote E – Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n for information regarding our finance leases. \nThe following table presents supplemental balance sheet information related to our

of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had U.S. federal and state tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, the tax effect of which was $\n558\n million and $\n540\n million, respectively. In addition, we had foreign tax net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits, the tax effect of which was $\n216\n million as of December 31, 2024, and $\n203\n million as of December 31, 2023. These tax attributes expire periodically beginning in 2025.\nAfter consideration of all positive and negative evidence, we believe that it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. As a result, we recorded a valuation allowance of $\n1.268\n billion as of December 31, 2024, and $\n1.220\n billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase in the valuation allowance as of December 31, 2024, compared to \n103\nDecember 31, 2023, is primarily due to maintaining valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets which increased during the year and acquisition of deferred tax assets which required a valuation allowance, offset by release of valuation allowances on certain U.S. state net operating losses. The income tax impact of the unrealized gain or loss component of other comprehensive income and stockholders' equity was a charge of $\n30\n million in 2024, a benefit of $\n39\n million in 2023 and a charge of $\n56\n million in 2022. \nWe obtain tax incentive rates through the Free Trade Zone Regime offered in Costa Rica which allows 100 percent exemption from income tax in the first eight years of operations, which will expire in 2027, and 50 percent exemption in the following four years, which will expire in 2031. This tax incentive resulted in income tax savings of $\n316\n million, $\n212\n million and $\n162\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and impacted \nNet income (loss) per common share - diluted\n by $\n0.21\n, $\n0.15\n and $\n0.11\n for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. We also benefit from tax rate incentives in Puerto Rico through a Grant of Industrial Tax Exemption which will expire in 2034, with an option to extend for an additional 15 years. This incentive resulted in income tax savings of $\n10\n million, $\n16\n million and $\n21\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and impacted \nNet income (loss) per common share - diluted\n by $\n0.01\n, $\n0.01\n and $\n0.02\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Additionally, we benefit from tax incentive rates in Malaysia through the Principal Hub Incentive which allows a 100 percent exemption from income tax, and the Pioneer Business Exemption which allows a full tax exemption on manufacturing of specific medical device products, both of which have an option to renew for additional five-year terms and will expire in 2028 and 2029, respectively. These incentives have resulted in income tax savings of $\n27\n million, $\n20\n million and $\n17\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively and impacted \nNet income (loss) per common share - diluted\n by $\n0.02\n, $\n0.01\n and $\n0.01\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Lastly, the Company benefits from tax rate incentives on certain taxable profits in China through a High and New Technology Enterprise Regime, which will expire in 2026 with the option to renew every three years. This incentive resulted in income tax savings of less than $\n1\n million and $\n6\n million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, and was not applicable during 2022. The impact on \nNet income (loss) per common share - diluted\n was de minimis for both 2024 and 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $\n506\n million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net $\n423\n million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2023, we had $\n467\n million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net $\n395\n million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2022, we had $\n492\n million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net $\n410\n million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. \nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBeginning Balance\n$\n467\n \n$\n492\n \n$\n255\n \nAdditions based on positions related to the current year\n58\n \n65\n \n88\n \nAdditions based on positions related to prior years\n20\n \n67\n \n177\n \nReductions for tax positions of prior years\n(\n20\n)\n(\n114\n)\n(\n20\n)\nSettlements with taxing authorities\n—\n \n(\n14\n)\n(\n1\n)\nStatute of limitation expirations\n(\n18\n)\n(\n29\n)\n(\n8\n)\nEnding Balance\n$\n506\n \n$\n467\n \n$\n492\n \nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters and substantially all material state and local income tax matters through 2018. We have concluded substantially all foreign income tax matters through 2015.\nIn 2023, we received notification from the IRS that the examination of our 2017 and 2018 tax years was resolved. Due to the resolution of these tax years, we recorded a net tax benefit of $\n44\n million to release the reserves related to these years. We paid tax of $\n16\n million to the IRS reflecting the net balance of amounts due for the tax period including an increase to past transition tax installment payments for periods prior to 2023 and interest. The subsequent transition tax payment made in 2024 was increased to reflect the final audit settlement, as will the final remaining payment in 2025. \nWe recognize interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. We had $\n78\n million accrued for gross interest and penalties as of December 31, 2024, $\n70\n million as of December 31, 2023, and $\n77\n million as of December 31, 2022. Net tax expense related to interest and penalties was immaterial in 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nIt is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve multiple issues with foreign, federal and state taxing authorities, resulting in a reduction in our balance of unrecognized tax benefits of up to $\n26\n million.\n104\nThe remaining balance of the one-time transition tax on post-1986 earnings and profits that was previously deferred from U.S. income taxes is $\n147\n million as of December 31, 2024. The eighth and final payment will be paid by April 15, 2025. \nAs of December 31, 2024, we have not recorded a tax provision on approximately $\n20\n billion of unremitted earnings of our international subsidiaries as these earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested overseas. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and any future change in our plans would require us to provide for the net tax impacts of these amounts. Determining the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax related to our undistributed accumulated foreign earnings and additional outside basis differences is not practicable.\nNOTE I – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES \nThe medical device market in which we participate is largely technology driven. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. Over the years, there has been litigation initiated against us by others, including our competitors, claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. Intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These dynamics frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases, but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. Although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies. \nDuring recent years, we successfully negotiated closure of several long-standing legal matters and have received favorable rulings in several other matters; however, there continues to be outstanding litigation. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.\nIn addition, product liability, securities and commercial claims have been asserted against us and similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. We maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation and other legal proceedings in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.\nIn addition, like other companies in the medical device industry, we are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate. From time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory, marketing and other business practices. These qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.\nIn accordance with FASB ASC Topic 450, \nContingencies\n, we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range.\n \nOur accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $\n326\n million as of December 31, 2024, and $\n377\n million as of December 31, 2023, and includes certain estimated costs of settlement, damages and defense primarily related to product liability cases or claims and matters assumed from acquired companies. We record certain legal and product liability charges, credits and costs of defense, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant as \nLitigation-related net charges (credits)\n within our accompanying consolidated financial statements. We did not record any litigation-related net charges (credits) in 2024. We recorded litigation-related net credits of $\n111\n million in 2023 primarily related to the settlement of offensive patent litigation and net charges of $\n173\n million in 2022, primarily related to litigation associated with our transvaginal surgical mesh products, and other legal matters. All other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within \nSelling, general and administrative expenses \nwithin our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. \n105\nWe continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our financial covenant required by our credit arrangements. \nIn management's opinion, we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings other than those specifically identified below, which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operations and/or cash flows. Unless included in our legal accrual or otherwise indicated below, a range of loss associated with any individual material legal proceeding cannot be reasonably estimated.\nPatent Litigation\nOn November 20, 2017, The Board of Regents, University of Texas System and TissueGen. Inc. (collectively, UT), served a lawsuit against us in the Western District of Texas. The complaint against the Company alleges patent infringement of two U.S. patents owned by UT, relating to “Drug Releasing Biodegradable Fiber Implant” and “Drug Releasing Biodegradable Fiber for Delivery of Therapeutics,” and affects the manufacture, use and sale of our Synergy™ Stent System. UT primarily seeks a reasonable royalty. On March 12, 2018, the District Court for the Western District of Texas dismissed the action and transferred it to the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On September 5, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the District Court for the Western District of Texas. In April 2020, the United States Supreme Court denied the UT’s Petition for Certiorari. UT proceeded with its case against the Company in Delaware. In January 2023, a jury trial was held on the issue of whether the one UT patent still asserted in the case was valid and whether it was infringed by the Company. On January 31, 2023, a jury concluded that UT’s patent was valid and willfully infringed by the Company, and awarded UT $\n42\n million in damages. Following the trial, UT filed a motion seeking prejudgment interest and enhanced damages. The Company filed a motion seeking judgment as a matter of law in its favor or alternatively a new trial. On June 5, 2024, the Court granted the Company’s motion for judgment as a matter of law of no willful infringement, but otherwise denied the Company’s motions. The Court also denied UT’s motion for enhanced damages, awarded approximately $\n7\n million in pre-judgment interest, and awarded post-judgment interest. On July 3, 2024, UT and the Company each filed a notice of appeal.\nUpon the Company’s acquisition of Axonics on November 15, 2024, the Company assumed responsibility for all litigation pending against Axonics. Such matters included complaints filed by Medtronic, Inc., Medtronic Puerto Rico Operations Co., Medtronic Logistics LLC and Medtronic USA, Inc. (the Medtronic Parties) that asserted that aspects of Axonics’ sacral neuromodulation systems infringed patents held by the Medtronic Parties. In December 2024, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement that resolved all pending litigation between Axonics and the Medtronic Parties in the federal district courts, the federal appellate courts, the Patent, Trial, and Appeal Board, and the International Trade Commission.\nOn September 18, 2023, Axonics commenced an arbitration dispute against the Al Mann Foundation (AMF), in response to which AMF asserted multiple claims against Axonics. This arbitration will resolve, among other things, whether AMF terminated its licensing agreement with Axonics related to Axonics’ rechargeable sacral neuromodulation systems, and whether Axonics owes royalties to AMF for such products. This dispute is scheduled for an arbitration hearing in June 2025.\nProduct Liability Litigation\n \nMultiple product liability cases or claims related to transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse have been asserted against us, predominantly in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Scotland, Ireland, and Australia. Plaintiffs generally seek monetary damages based on allegations of personal injury associated with the use of our transvaginal surgical mesh products, including design and manufacturing claims, failure to warn, breach of warranty, fraud, violations of state consumer protection laws and loss of consortium claims. We have entered into individual and master settlement agreements or are in the final stages of entering agreements with certain plaintiffs' counsel, to resolve the majority of these cases and claims. All settlement agreements were entered into solely by way of compromise and without any admission or concession by us of any liability or wrongdoing. In addition, in April 2021 the Company's Board of Directors received a shareholder demand under section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, for inspection of books and records related to mesh settlements. The Company has notified our insurer and retained counsel to respond to the demand. \nWe have established a product liability accrual for remaining claims asserted against us associated with our transvaginal surgical mesh products and the costs of defense thereof. We continue to engage in discussions with plaintiffs’ counsel regarding potential resolution of pending cases and claims, which we continue to vigorously contest. The final resolution of the cases and claims is uncertain and could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity. Trials involving our transvaginal surgical mesh products have resulted in both favorable and unfavorable judgments for us. We do not \n106\nbelieve that the judgment in any one trial is representative of potential outcomes of all cases or claims related to our transvaginal surgical mesh products.\nGovernmental Investigations and Qui Tam Matters\nLike many healthcare companies, the Company receives inquiries and has ongoing discussions with governmental agencies with respect to the Company’s operations, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Department of Justice (DOJ) and foreign regulators, including its operations in Vietnam with respect to alleged Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) violations the Company received in March 2022. The Company has received related subpoenas for documents from the DOJ and the SEC with respect to the Vietnam matter, and is cooperating with the government while investigating these allegations. From time to time, the Company also self-discloses potential concerns to regulators. In the course of Vietnam-related discussions with the DOJ and SEC, the Company has disclosed that it is investigating other potential concerns in Vietnam and other countries.\nFrom time to time, the Company also receives U.S.-based subpoenas and DOJ Civil Investigative Demands (CID), including the following matters: in April 2023, the Company received a DOJ subpoena that seeks documents and information related to its ambulatory electrocardiography monitoring business; in December 2023, the Company received a DOJ CID related to the provision of peripheral intervention services through office-based labs. The Company is cooperating with the DOJ in these matters.\nOther Proceedings\n \nOn December 4, 2020, Enrique Jevons, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a class action complaint against the Company, Michael F. Mahoney and Daniel J. Brennan, stemming from the recall and retirement of the LOTUS Edge™ Aortic Valve System (LOTUS System) in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. On December 14, 2020, the parties agreed to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On December 16, 2020, Mariano Errichiello, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a second, materially similar class action complaint against the Company, Michael F. Mahoney, Joseph M. Fitzgerald, and Daniel J. Brennan in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Subsequently, on March 30, 2021, the Court consolidated the two actions, and appointed Union Asset Management Holding AG as the lead plaintiff. The plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint in June 2021 that seeks unspecified compensatory damages in favor of the alleged class as well as unspecified equitable relief. The Company filed a Motion to Dismiss in July 2021, which, in December 2022, the Court granted in part and denied in part. On October 23, 2023, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the lead plaintiff to settle the case. The Court granted the motion for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement on December 27, 2023, and approved the settlement and dismissed the case on April 23, 2024.\nOn February 8, 2021, the Company received a letter from The Vladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust, a shareholder, demanding that the Company’s Board of Directors conduct an investigation into actions by the Company’s directors and executive officers regarding statements made about the effectiveness and commercial viability of the LOTUS System. The Trust subsequently agreed to stay its demand, pending the outcome of any dispositive motion against the Amended Complaint in the class action complaint described above. The Company received letters on behalf of the Union Excavators Local 731 Pension Fund, Diane Nachbaur, and Frank Tripson, three stockholders of the Company, on July 26, 2021, July 29, 2021, and February 13, 2023, respectively, each demanding access to certain books and records of the Company, pursuant to Section 220 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, regarding the business, operations, effectiveness and commercial viability of the LOTUS system, and related items. On April 7, 2023, Diane Nachbaur filed a shareholder derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Company, Michael F. Mahoney, Nelda J. Connors, Charles J. Dockendorff, Yoshiaki Fujimori, Donna A. James, Edward J. Ludwig, David Roux, John E. Sununu, Ellen M. Zane, Joseph M. Fitzgerald, Daniel J. Brennan, Shawn McCarthy, Ian Meredith, Kevin Ballinger, and Susan Vissers Lisa. On May 8, 2023, the Court stayed the case until the conclusion of the consolidated class action case. On October 18, 2023, Frank Tripson filed a shareholder derivative complaint in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against the Company, Michael F. Mahoney, Daniel J. Brennan, Joseph M. Fitzgerald, Shawn McCarthy, Kevin Ballinger, Ian Meredith, Susan Vissers Lisa, Nelda J. Connors, Charles J. Dockendorff, Yoshiaki Fujimori, Donna A. James, Edward J. Ludwig, Stephen P. MacMillan, David Roux, John E. Sununu, and Ellen M. Zane. On December 15, 2023, the Court stayed that case until March 31, 2024. On March 26, 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with all of the plaintiffs to resolve the matters. On January 8, 2025, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued an order granting preliminary approval to the proposed settlement. A court hearing regarding final approval of the proposed settlement has been scheduled for March 25, 2025.\n107\nNOTE J – STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY \nPreferred Stock\nWe are authorized to issue \n50\n million shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the powers, designations, preferences and relative participating, option or other rights thereof, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption terms, liquidation preferences and the number of shares constituting any series, without any further vote or action by our stockholders. \nOn May 27, 2020, we completed an offering of \n10,062,500\n shares of \n5.50\n% Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A (MCPS) at a price to the public and liquidation preference of $\n100\n per share. The net proceeds from the MCPS offering were approximately $\n975\n million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.\nOn June 1, 2023 (the Mandatory Conversion Date), all outstanding shares of MCPS automatically converted into shares of common stock. The conversion rate for each share of MCPS was \n2.3834\n shares of common stock. No action by the holders of the MCPS was required in connection with the mandatory conversion. Cash was paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with the terms of the MCPS. An aggregate of approximately \n24\n million shares of common stock, including shares of common stock issued to holders of MCPS that elected to convert prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, were issued upon conversion of the MCPS. Following the mandatory conversion of the MCPS, there were no outstanding shares of MCPS.\nPrior to the Mandatory Conversion Date in 2023, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, pursuant to authority delegated to such committee by our Board of Directors, declared, and we paid, cash dividends of $\n28\n million, or $\n1.3750\n per MCPS share to holders representing dividend periods through May 2023.\nCommon Stock\nWe are authorized to issue \ntwo\n billion shares of common stock, $\n0.01\n par value per share. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share. Holders of common stock are entitled to receive dividends, if and when declared by our Board of Directors, and to share ratably in our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders in the event of liquidation. Holders of common stock have no preemptive, subscription, redemption, or conversion rights. The holders of common stock do not have cumulative voting rights. The holders of a majority of the shares of common stock can elect all of the directors and can control our management and affairs. Prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, holders of common stock were junior to holders of MCPS in terms of liquidation preference. \nOn December 14, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $\n1.000\n billion of our common stock. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during 2024 and had the full amount available under the authorization as of December 31, 2024.\nThere were approximately \n263\n million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nNOTE K – STOCK INCENTIVE AND PURCHASE PLANS \nEmployee and Director Stock Incentive Plans\nIn 2020, our Board of Directors and stockholders approved amendments to our 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan effective October 1, 2020 (Amended and Restated 2011 LTIP), authorizing for issuance up to \n171\n million shares of our common stock. The Amended and Restated 2011 LTIP covers officers, directors, employees and consultants and provides for the grant of restricted or unrestricted common stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), options to acquire our common stock, stock appreciation rights, performance awards (market-based and performance-based RSUs) and other stock and non-stock awards. Shares reserved under our current and former stock incentive plans totaled approximately \n139\n million as of December 31, 2024. The Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors, consisting of independent, non-employee directors, may authorize the issuance of common stock and cash awards under the Amended and Restated 2011 LTIP in recognition of the achievement of long-term performance objectives established by the Committee. \n108\nNon-qualified options issued to employees are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of our stock on the grant date, vest over a \nthree\n or \nfour\n-year service period and have a \nten\n-year contractual life. In the case of qualified options, if the recipient owns more than \nten\n percent of the voting power of all classes of stock, the option granted will be at an exercise price of \n110\n percent of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and will expire over a period not to exceed \nfive\n years. Non-vested stock awards, including restricted stock awards (RSAs) and RSUs issued to employees are generally granted with an exercise price of \nzero\n and typically vest in \nfour\n equal annual installments. These awards represent our commitment to issue shares to recipients after the vesting period. Upon each vesting date, such awards are no longer subject to risk of forfeiture and we issue shares of our common stock to the recipient.\nThe following presents the impact of stock-based compensation on our consolidated statements of operations:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except per share data)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCost of products sold\n$\n14\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n12\n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n206\n \n179\n \n167\n \nResearch and development expenses\n46\n \n42\n \n41\n \n \n266\n \n233\n \n220\n \nIncome tax (benefit) expense\n(\n39\n)\n(\n35\n)\n(\n32\n)\n \n$\n227\n \n$\n198\n \n$\n188\n \nNet impact per common share - basic\n$\n0.15\n \n$\n0.14\n \n$\n0.13\n \nNet impact per common share - assuming dilution\n$\n0.15\n \n$\n0.14\n \n$\n0.13\n \nStock Options\nWe use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of stock options granted to employees under our stock incentive plans.

We believe that this historical data provides the best estimate of the expected term of new option grants.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate\nWe use yield rates on U.S. Treasury securities for a period approximating the expected term of the award to estimate the risk-free interest rate in our grant-date fair value assessment.\nExpected Dividend Yield\nWe have not historically paid cash dividends on our common stock and currently we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock. Therefore, we have assumed an expected dividend yield of zero in our grant-date fair value assessment.\n109\nInformation related to stock options under stock incentive plans are as follows:\nStock Options\n(in thousands)\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise Price\nWeighted Average\nRemaining\nContractual Life\n \n(in years)\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\n(in millions)\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2021\n21,448\n \n$\n29\n \nGranted\n3,287\n \n44\n \nExercised\n(\n2,745\n)\n17\n \nCancelled/forfeited\n(\n502\n)\n34\n \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2022\n21,489\n \n$\n32\n \nGranted\n2,934\n \n47\n \nExercised\n(\n3,325\n)\n25\n \nCancelled/forfeited\n(\n249\n)\n44\n \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023\n20,850\n \n$\n36\n \nGranted\n2,443\n \n65\n \nExercised\n(\n3,866\n)\n28\n \nCancelled/forfeited\n(\n243\n)\n50\n \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2024\n19,183\n \n$\n41\n \n5.7\n$\n931\n \nExercisable as of December 31, 2024\n12,660\n \n35\n \n4.5\n688\n \nExpected to vest as of December 31, 2024\n6,313\n \n52\n \n8.1\n236\n \nTotal vested and expected to vest as of December 31, 2024\n18,972\n \n$\n41\n \n5.7\n$\n924\n \nThe total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $\n184\n million in 2024, $\n89\n million in 2023 and $\n72\n million in 2022.\nNon-Vested Stock\nWe value RSAs and RSUs based on the closing trading value of our shares on the date of grant. \nInformation related to non-vested stock awards is as follows:\nNon-Vested\nStock Award Units\n(in thousands)\nWeighted Average\nGrant-Date \nFair Value\nBalance as of December 31, 2021\n9,745\n \n$\n37\n \nGranted\n3,854\n \n45\n \nVested\n(1)\n(\n3,482\n)\n36\n \nForfeited\n(\n680\n)\n44\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n9,438\n \n$\n41\n \nGranted\n3,958\n \n49\n \nVested\n(1)\n(\n3,624\n)\n39\n \nForfeited\n(\n485\n)\n44\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n9,287\n \n$\n45\n \nGranted\n3,322\n \n66\n \nVested(1)\n(\n3,717\n)\n43\n \nForfeited\n(\n349\n)\n50\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n8,544\n \n$\n54\n \n(1) \nThe number of shares vested includes shares withheld on behalf of employees to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements.\nThe total vesting date fair value of shares that vested was approximately $\n248\n million in 2024, $\n171\n million in 2023 and $\n150\n million in 2022.\n110\nMarket-based RSU Awards\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022 we granted market-based RSU awards to certain members of our senior management team. The number of shares ultimately issued to the recipient is based on the total stockholder return (TSR) of our common stock as compared to the TSR of the common stock of the other companies in the S&P 500 Health Care Index over a three-year period. The number of RSUs ultimately granted under this program range from \n0 percent\n to \n200\n percent of the target number awarded to the participant as determined by achievement of the TSR criteria of the program. In addition, in general, award recipients must remain employed by us throughout the three-year period to attain the full amount of the market-based RSUs that satisfied the market performance criteria.\nThe aggregate fair value of these awards as determined based on Monte Carlo simulations as of the respective grant dates, and the related assumptions used in the valuations, are as follows:\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nAwards\nAwards\nAwards\nFair value \n(in millions)\n$\n16\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n12\n \nStock price on date of grant\n$\n64.99\n \n$\n47.28\n \n$\n44.19\n \nMeasurement period\n (in years)\n2.9\n2.9\n2.9\nRisk-free rate\n4.23\n \n%\n4.31\n \n%\n1.71\n \n%\nWe recognize the expense on these awards in our consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the three-year measurement period.\nOrganic Net Sales Growth and Free Cash Flow Performance-based RSU Awards\nDuring 2024 and 2023, we granted organic net sales growth (ONSG) performance-based RSU awards to certain members of our senior management team. The attainment of these performance-based RSUs is based on our organic net sales growth over a three-year performance period against a target set by the Committee. The number of RSUs ultimately granted under this program range from \n0 percent\n to \n200\n percent of the target number of performance-based RSUs awarded to the participant as determined by achievement of the performance criteria of the program.\nDuring 2022, we granted free-cash flow performance-based RSU awards to certain members of our senior management team. The attainment of these performance-based RSUs is based on our adjusted free cash flow (AFCF) measured against our goal set by the Committee, based on our internal annual financial plan performance for AFCF. AFCF was measured over a one-year performance period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2022. The number of RSUs ultimately granted under this program range from \n0 percent\n to \n150\n percent of the target number of performance-based RSUs awarded to the participant as determined by achievement of the performance criteria of the program. In addition, in general, award recipients must remain employed by us throughout a three-year service period (inclusive of the one-year performance period) to attain the full amount of the performance-based RSUs that satisfied the performance criteria.\nThe following table presents our assumptions used in determining the fair value of our ONSG and AFCF awards currently expected to vest as of December 31, 2024:\n2024 ONSG\n2023 ONSG\n2022 AFCF\nFair value, net of forfeitures to date \n(in millions)\n$\n22\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n7\n \nAchievement of target payout\n(1)\n200\n \n%\n200\n \n%\n88\n \n%\nStock price used in determining fair value\n$\n64.99\n \n$\n47.28\n \n$\n46.27\n \n(1) \nCompany's estimate of target payout as of December 31, 2024.\nWe recognize the expense on these awards in our consolidated statements of operations over the vesting period which is three years after the date of grant.\n111\nExpense Attribution\nWe recognize compensation expense for our stock incentive plan using a straight-line method over the substantive vesting period. Most of our stock awards provide for immediate vesting upon death or disability of the participant. In addition, our stock grants to employees provide for accelerated vesting of our stock-based awards, other than performance-based and market-based awards, upon retirement, if the stock award has been held for at least one year by the recipient. In accordance with the terms of our stock grants, for employees who will become retirement eligible prior to the vest date we expense stock-based awards, other than performance-based and market-based awards, over the greater of one year or the period between grant date and retirement-eligibility. The performance-based and market-based awards discussed above do not contain provisions that would accelerate the full vesting of the awards upon retirement-eligibility.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense for the value of the portion of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. FASB ASC Topic 718, \nCompensation – Stock Compensation\n allows forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The term “forfeitures” is distinct from “cancellations” or “expirations” and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered stock-based award. We have applied, based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, a weighted-average annual forfeiture rate of approximately \nfive\n percent to all unvested stock-based awards as of December 31, 2024, which represents the portion that we expect will be forfeited each year over the vesting period. We re-evaluate this analysis annually or more frequently if there are significant changes in circumstances and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary. Ultimately, we will only recognize expense for those shares that vest.\nUnrecognized Compensation Cost\nWe expect to recognize the following future expense for awards outstanding as of December 31, 2024:\n \nUnrecognized\n \nCompensation Cost\n(in millions)\n \n(1)\nWeighted Average Remaining \nVesting Period\n(in years)\nStock options\n$\n44\n \n \nNon-vested stock awards\n227\n \n \n \n$\n271\n \n1.7\n(1)\n \nAmounts presented represent compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan \nIn May 2022, our stockholders approved an additional \n10\n million shares that may be issued under our global employee stock purchase plan. Our global employee stock purchase plan provides for the granting of options to purchase up to \n60\n million shares of our common stock to all eligible employees. Under the global employee stock purchase plan, we grant each eligible employee, at the beginning of each six-month offering period, an option to purchase shares of our common stock equal to not more than \nten\n percent of the employee’s eligible compensation or the statutory limit under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Such options may be exercised only to the extent of accumulated payroll deductions at the end of the offering period, at a purchase price equal to \n85\n percent of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning or end of each offering period, whichever is less. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately \n6\n million shares available for future issuance under the employee stock purchase plan.\nInformation related to shares issued or to be issued in connection with the employee stock purchase plan based on employee contributions and the range of purchase prices is as follows:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nShares issued or to be issued \n(in thousands)\n2,409\n \n2,623\n \n2,850\n \nRange of purchase prices\n$\n49.16\n \n-\n$\n64.95\n \n$\n39.11\n \n-\n$\n45.51\n \n$\n31.68\n \n-\n$\n32.31\n \nExpense recognized \n(in millions)\n$\n34\n \n$\n29\n \n$\n28\n \nWe use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan.

Refer to \nNote J – Stockholders' Equity\n for additional information.\nWe base \nNet income (loss) per common share - diluted\n upon the weighted-average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during each year. Potential common stock equivalents are determined using the treasury stock method. We exclude stock options, stock awards and, prior to the Mandatory Conversion Date, our MCPS, from the calculation if the effect would be anti-dilutive. The dilutive effect of MCPS is calculated using the if-converted method. The if-converted method assumes that these securities were converted to shares of common stock at the beginning of the reporting period to the extent that the effect is dilutive. \nIn 2023 and 2022, the effect of assuming the conversion of our MCPS into shares of common stock was anti-dilutive, and therefore excluded from the calculation of earnings per share (EPS). Accordingly, \nNet income (loss)\n was reduced by cumulative \nPreferred stock dividends\n, as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, for purposes of calculating \nNet income (loss) attributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders\n. On June 1, 2023, all outstanding shares of MCPS automatically converted into shares of common stock.\nNOTE M – SEGMENT REPORTING \nWe aggregate our core businesses into \ntwo\n reportable segments: MedSurg and Cardiovascular, each of which generates revenues from the sale of medical devices. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 280, \nSegment Reporting, \nwe identified our reportable segments based on the nature of our products, production processes, type of customer, selling and distribution methods and regulatory environment, as well as the economic characteristics of each of our operating segments. Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our President and Chief Executive Officer.\nWe measure and evaluate our reportable segments based on their respective net sales, cost of goods sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development expenses, operating income, excluding intersegment profits, and operating income as a percentage of net sales, all based on internally-derived standard currency exchange rates to exclude the impact of foreign currency, which may be updated from year to year. We exclude from segment expenses and segment operating income certain corporate-related expenses and certain transactions or adjustments that our CODM considers to be non-operational, such as amounts related to amortization expense, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition/divestiture-related net charges (credits), restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits), certain litigation-related net charges (credits) and European Union (EU) Medical Device Regulation (MDR) implementation costs. Although we exclude these amounts from segment expenses and segment operating income, they are included in reported \nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n within our consolidated statements of operations and are included in the reconciliation below.

Our deferred revenue balance was $\n635\n million as of December 31, 2024 and $\n577\n million as of December 31, 2023. Our contract liabilities are primarily composed of deferred revenue related to the LATITUDE™ Patient Management System within our Cardiology business, for which revenue is recognized over the average service period based on device and patient longevity. Our contract liabilities also include deferred revenue related to the LUX-Dx™ Insertable Cardiac Monitor system, also within our Cardiology business, for which revenue is recognized over the average service period based on \n118\ndevice longevity and usage. We recognized revenue of $\n231\n million in 2024 that was included in the above contract liability balance as of December 31, 2023. We have elected not to disclose the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations when the original expected contract duration is one year or less. In addition, we have not identified material unfulfilled performance obligations for which revenue is not currently deferred.\nWe capitalize sales force commissions related to contracts with customers when the associated revenue is expected to be earned over a period that exceeds one year. Deferred commissions are primarily related to the sale of devices enabled with our LATITUDE™ Patient Management System. We have elected to expense commission costs when incurred for contracts with an expected duration of one year or less. Capitalized commission fees are amortized over the period the associated products or services are transferred. Similarly, we capitalize certain recoverable costs related to the delivery of the LATITUDE™ Remote Monitoring Service. These fulfillment costs are amortized over the average service period. \nRefer to \nNote A – Significant Accounting Policies\n for additional information on our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition.\nNOTE O – CHANGES IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME \nThe following table provides the reclassifications out of \nOther comprehensive income, net of tax \nattributable to Boston Scientific common stockholders:\n(in millions)\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments\nNet Change in Derivative Financial Instruments\nNet Change in Defined Benefit Pensions and Other Items\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n(\n96\n)\n$\n154\n \n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n49\n \nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n246\n \n142\n \n(\n9\n)\n379\n \n(Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income\n(\n14\n)\n(\n141\n)\n1\n \n(\n154\n)\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)\n232\n \n1\n \n(\n8\n)\n225\n \nBalance as of December 31, 2024\n$\n136\n \n$\n155\n \n$\n(\n16\n)\n$\n275\n \n(in millions)\nForeign Currency Translation Adjustments\nNet Change in Derivative Financial Instruments\nNet Change in Defined Benefit Pensions and Other Items\nTotal\nBalance as of December 31, 2022\n$\n(\n1\n)\n$\n269\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n269\n \nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications\n(\n87\n)\n63\n \n(\n10\n)\n(\n34\n)\n(Income) loss amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income\n(\n8\n)\n(\n178\n)\n1\n \n(\n185\n)\nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n95\n)\n(\n115\n)\n(\n9\n)\n(\n219\n)\nBalance as of December 31, 2023\n$\n(\n96\n)\n$\n154\n \n$\n(\n8\n)\n$\n49\n \nRefer to \nNote D – Hedging Activities and Fair Value Measurements\n for further detail on our net investment hedges recorded in \nForeign currency translation adjustment\n and our cash flow hedges recorded in \nNet change in derivative financial instruments\n.\nThe gains and losses on defined benefit and pension items before reclassifications and gains and losses on defined benefit and pension items reclassified from \nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax\n were reduced by income tax impacts of approximately $\n3\n million in 2024 and approximately $\n5\n million in 2023.\n \nNOTE P – NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS \nPeriodically, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or other standard setting bodies. Recently issued standards typically do not require adoption until a future effective date. Prior to their effective date, we evaluate the pronouncements to determine the potential effects of adoption on our consolidated financial statements. During 2024, we implemented the following standards, none of which had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements:\n119\nASC Update No. 2022-03\nASC Update No. 2022-03, \nFair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions \nclarifies the guidance in Topic 820 related to measuring the fair value of an equity security subject to contractual restrictions that prohibit the sale of an equity security, as well as introduces new disclosure requirements for these types of equity securities. We adopted Update No. 2022-03 on a prospective basis.\nASC Update No. 2023-07\nASC Update No. 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures \nrequires disclosure, on an annual and interim basis, of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss in addition to disclosure of amounts for other segment items and a description of its composition. We adopted Update No. 2023-07 on a retrospective basis.\nStandards to be Implemented\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2023-09, \nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n. Update No. 2023-09 aims to enhance the transparency and decision usefulness of income tax disclosures. Update No. 2023-09 modifies the rules on income tax disclosures to require entities to disclose (1) specific categories in the rate reconciliation, (2) the income or loss from continuing operations before income tax expense or benefit (separated between domestic and foreign) and (3) income tax expense or benefit from continuing operations (separated by federal, state, and foreign). ASU 2023-09 also requires entities to disclose their income tax payments to international, federal, state and local jurisdictions, among other changes. Update No. 2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and early adoption is allowed. Update No. 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, however retrospective application is permitted. We expect to adopt Update No. 2023-09 prospectively. As this accounting standard update impacts disclosures only, we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2024-03 \nIncome Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures\n. Update No. 2024-03 aims to improve transparency of expense disclosures to enhance investor understanding of an entity's performance and to assist in comparing an entity's performance over time and with that of other entities. Update No. 2024-03 modifies the disclosures over certain costs and expenses and requires entities to disclose (1) the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization, and depletion, included in each relevant expense caption, (2) within the same disclosure, certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed under current GAAP, (3) a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively and (4) the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. The amendments in this Update are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. Update No. 2024-03 allows for early adoption and requires either prospective adoption to financial statements issued for reporting periods after the effective date, or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. We are currently assessing the impact of Update No. 2024-03 to our consolidated financial statement disclosures. \nNo other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective in the period had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE Q – EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT PLANS\n \nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nDomestic Retirement Plans\nFollowing our 2006 acquisition of Guidant Corporation (Guidant), we assumed the Guidant Supplemental Retirement Plan, a frozen, non-qualified defined benefit plan for certain former officers and employees of Guidant. The Guidant Supplemental Retirement Plan was partially funded through a Rabbi Trust that contains segregated company assets within restricted cash used to pay the benefit obligations related to the plan. \nWe also maintain an Executive Retirement Plan, a defined benefit plan covering executive officers and other key contributors. Participants may retire with benefits once retirement conditions have been satisfied. \n120\nOther International Retirement Plans\nIn addition, we maintain retirement plans covering certain international employees. \nWe use a December 31 measurement date for these plans and record the net unfunded and underfunded portion as a liability within non-current liabilities, with the current portion within accrued expenses, on the consolidated balance sheets, recognizing changes primarily through OCI. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the funded status of our plans was unfunded or underfunded in aggregate. \nThe outstanding obligation is as follows:\n \nAs of December 31, 2024\n(\nin millions)\nAccumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO)\nProjected\nBenefit\nObligation (PBO)\nFair value of Plan Assets\nUnfunded/Underfunded\nPBO Recognized\nDomestic Retirement Plans\n$\n56\n \n$\n60\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n60\n \nOther International Retirement Plans\n150\n \n167\n \n100\n \n67\n \n \n$\n206\n \n$\n227\n \n$\n100\n \n$\n127\n \n \nAs of December 31, 2023\n(\nin millions)\nAccumulated Benefit Obligation (ABO)\nProjected\nBenefit\nObligation (PBO)\nFair value of Plan Assets\nUnfunded/Underfunded PBO Recognized\nDomestic Retirement Plans\n$\n54\n \n$\n59\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n59\n \nOther International Retirement Plans\n145\n \n159\n \n101\n \n58\n \n \n$\n199\n \n$\n218\n \n$\n101\n \n$\n117\n \nA reconciliation of the changes in the PBO for our retirement plans is as follows:\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nBeginning obligations\n$\n218\n \n$\n207\n \nService costs\n10\n \n10\n \nInterest costs\n7\n \n7\n \nActuarial (gain) loss\n10\n \n(\n4\n)\nPlan curtailments/settlements\n—\n \n(\n0\n)\nPlan amendments and assumption changes\n4\n \n6\n \nBenefits paid\n(\n10\n)\n(\n10\n)\nImpact of foreign currency fluctuations\n(\n11\n)\n3\n \nEnding obligation\n$\n227\n \n$\n218\n \nThe critical assumptions associated with our employee retirement plans for 2024 are as follows: \nWeighted Average Discount Rate\nWeighted Average Expected Return\nWeighted Average Rate of Compensation Increase\n(1)\nDomestic Retirement Plans\n5.28\n%\nn/a\n2.00\n%\nOther International Retirement Plans\n2.50\n%\n2.76\n%\n3.25\n%\n(1) \nRates of compensation increase were not weighted by relative fair value.

The rate of compensation increase is based on historical and expected rate increases. We base our rate of expected return on plan assets on historical experience, our investment guidelines and expectations for long-term rates of return. Our assets are invested in a variety of securities, primarily equity securities and government bonds.

The implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years.
