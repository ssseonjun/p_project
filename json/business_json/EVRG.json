    "item1a": "Item 1A, Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7, MD&A for further discussion of risk factors.\nThe Evergy Companies are exposed to market risks associated with commodity price and supply, interest rates and security prices.  Commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sale of electricity and energy-related products, including natural gas and coal.  Credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non-performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations.  Interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial impact related to changes in interest rates.  In addition, Evergy's investments in trusts to fund nuclear plant decommissioning and non-qualified retirement benefits give rise to security price risk.  \nManagement has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of the markets may have on Evergy's operating results.  During the ordinary course of business, the Evergy Companies' hedging strategies are reviewed to determine the hedging approach deemed appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation.  Though management believes its risk management practices are effective, it is not possible to identify and eliminate all risk.  Evergy could experience losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial position, due to many factors, including unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in the energy markets, regulatory-driven market rule changes and/or bankruptcy or non-performance of customers or counterparties, and/or failure of underlying transactions that have been hedged to materialize.\nHedging Strategies \nFrom time to time, Evergy utilizes derivative instruments to execute risk management and hedging strategies.  Derivative instruments, such as futures, forward contracts, swaps or options, derive their value from underlying assets, indices, reference rates or a combination of these factors.  These derivative instruments include negotiated contracts, which are referred to as over-the-counter derivatives, and instruments listed and traded on an exchange. \nCommodity Price Risk\nThe Evergy Companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity as part of their regulated electric operations in addition to non-regulated energy marketing activities.  These activities expose the Evergy Companies to risks associated with the price of electricity and other energy-related products.  Exposure to these risks is affected by a number of factors including the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume, as well as the wholesale market prices received by the Evergy Companies' generation resources and the wholesale market prices paid to procure power to serve customer load or satisfy regulatory or contractual obligations.  Customers' electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors.  Quantities of fossil fuel used for generation vary from year to year based on the availability, price and deliverability of a given fuel type as well as planned and unplanned outages at facilities that use fossil fuels.  Evergy's exposure to fluctuations in these factors is limited by the cost-based regulation of its regulated operations in Kansas and Missouri as these operations are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through fuel recovery mechanisms.  While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results.  The majority of derivative instruments used to manage Evergy's commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting.  Mark-to-market changes for these instruments entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on Evergy's consolidated balance sheets.  Derivative instruments entered into for non-regulated energy marketing \n64\nTable of Contents\n \nactivities are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings.  See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information.\nValue at Risk (VaR) Associated with Energy Marketing Activities\nManagement uses a risk measurement model, which calculates VaR to measure Evergy's commodity price risk associated with its trading portfolio related to non-regulated energy marketing activities.  The VaR is calculated using historical 30 day exponentially weighted volatilities and correlations and assumes a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period.  Based on this VaR analysis, as of December 31, 2024, a near term typical change in commodity prices is not expected to materially impact net income, cash flows or financial position.\nThe following table shows the end, high, average and low market risk associated with its trading portfolio related to non-regulated energy marketing activities as measured by VaR for the periods indicated. The information includes non-regulated financial and physical transactions that are not considered derivatives under U.S. GAAP but economically offset derivatives also included in the VaR model.\nVaR Model Trading Portfolio\nYear Ended\nYear Ended\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nEnd\nHigh\nAverage\nLow\nEnd\nHigh\nAverage\nLow\n(millions)\n(millions)\n$\n1.1 \n$\n3.6 \n$\n0.7 \n$\n0.1 \n$\n0.6 \n$\n2.6 \n$\n0.5 \n$\n— \nManagement back-tests VaR results against performance due to actual price movements.  Based on the assumed 95% confidence interval, the performance due to actual price movements would be expected to exceed the VaR at least once every 20 trading days.\nInterest Rate Risk \nEvergy manages interest rate risk and short- and long-term liquidity by limiting its exposure to variable interest rate debt and debt-like financial instruments to a percentage of total debt, diversifying maturity dates and, from time to time, entering into interest rate hedging transactions.  As of December 31, 2024, 9.8% of Evergy's total debt (including short-term borrowings consisting of short-term debt in excess of utility construction work in progress balances that is not eligible for capitalization as AFUDC and borrowings under Evergy's receivable sale facilities) were exposed to interest rate risk.  Evergy computes and presents information regarding the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt, short-term borrowings and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a 100-basis-point change in the current interest rates applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Evergy had $1,380.8 million of short-term borrowings, variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt exposed to variable interest rate sensitivity.  A 100-basis-point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact Evergy's income before income taxes basis by approximately $9.1 million, net of AFUDC borrowed funds which represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity and is a reduction of interest expense.\nCredit Risk\nEvergy is exposed to counterparty credit risk largely in the form of accounts receivable from its retail and wholesale electric customers and through executory contracts with market risk exposure.  The credit risk associated with accounts receivable from retail and wholesale customers is largely mitigated by Evergy's large number of individual customers spread across diverse customer classes and the ability to recover bad debt expense in customer rates.  The Evergy Companies maintain credit policies and employ credit risk control mechanisms, such as letters of credit, when necessary to minimize their overall credit risk and monitor exposure.  Credit risk of the Evergy Companies' derivative instruments relates to the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non-performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations.  See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on potential loss on counterparty exposure for derivative instruments as of December 31, 2024.\n65\nTable of Contents\n \nInvestment Risk\nEvergy maintains trust funds, as required by the NRC, to fund its 94% share of decommissioning the Wolf Creek nuclear power plant and also maintains trusts to fund pension benefits as well as certain non-qualified retirement benefits.  As of December 31, 2024, these funds were primarily invested in a diversified mix of equity and debt securities and reflected at fair value on Evergy's balance sheet.  The equity securities in the trusts are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and the value of debt securities are exposed to changes in interest rates and other market factors.  \nAs nuclear decommissioning costs are currently recovered in customer rates, Evergy defers both realized and unrealized gains and losses for these securities as an offset to its regulatory liability for decommissioning Wolf Creek and as such, fluctuations in the value of these securities do not impact earnings.  A significant decline in the value of pension or non-qualified retirement assets could require Evergy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods.  In addition, a decline in the fair value of these plan assets, in the absence of additional cash contributions to the plans by Evergy, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods by Evergy.\nIn addition to Evergy's investments in debt and equity securities in its nuclear decommissioning and pension trusts, Evergy also makes limited equity investments in early-stage energy solution companies.  These limited equity investments are often in privately-owned companies that do not have reasonably determinable fair values.  However, from time to time, these investments could have changes in fair value as a result of acquisitions, mergers, initial public offerings, or observable market transactions for similar investments.  Evergy typically seeks to liquidate its position in these companies as soon as practicable following the occurrence of an exit event such as an acquisition or initial public offering (including after the expiration of any related lock-up provisions), which serves to largely mitigate any ongoing market risk related to the investments.\n66\nTable of Contents\n \nITEM 8.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.  Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.  Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.  The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRate Matters and Regulation - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to wholesale regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and rate regulation by the Kansas Corporation Commission and by the Missouri Public Service Commission (collectively the \"Commissions\"), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of electric distribution companies in Kansas and Missouri, respectively.  Management has determined it meets the requirements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America to prepare its financial statements applying the specialized rules \n68\nTable of Contents\n \nto account for the effects of cost-based rate regulation.  Accounting for the economics of rate regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures.\nThe Company's rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes and annual earnings oversight.  Because the Commissions set the rates, the Company is allowed to charge customers based on allowable costs, including a reasonable return on equity, and the Company applies accounting standards that require the financial statements to reflect the effects of rate regulation, including the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities.  The Company assesses whether the regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery or settlement at each balance sheet date and when regulatory events occur.  This assessment includes consideration of recent rate orders, historical regulatory treatment for similar costs, and factors such as changes in applicable regulatory and political environments.  While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service or (2) full recovery of amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements.  Management judgments include assessing the likelihood of (1) recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) refunds or future rate reduction to customers.  Given that management's accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs deferred as regulatory assets and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities.\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management's controls over the initial recognition of amounts as regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company's disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe evaluated external information and compared it to management's recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.  Such external information included relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities in Kansas and Missouri, as well as other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\n•\nWe evaluated management's analysis, and letters from internal legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ \nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nKansas City, Missouri\n \nFebruary 26, 2025 \nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\n69\nTable of Contents\n \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nTo the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Evergy Kansas Central, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Evergy Kansas Central, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\").

Such external information included relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities in Kansas and Missouri, as well as other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the Commissions' treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances.\n•\nWe evaluated management's analysis, and letters from internal legal counsel, as appropriate, regarding probability of recovery for regulatory assets or refund or future reduction in rates for regulatory liabilities not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management's assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, or a future reduction in rates.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nKansas City, Missouri  \nFebruary 26, 2025  \nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\n73\nTable of Contents\n \nEVERGY, INC.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(millions, except per share amounts)\nOPERATING REVENUES\n$\n5,847.3\n \n$\n5,508.2\n \n$\n5,859.1\n \nOPERATING EXPENSES:\nFuel and purchased power\n1,479.9\n \n1,494.8\n \n1,821.2\n \nSPP network transmission costs\n370.9\n \n302.6\n \n323.0\n \nOperating and maintenance\n961.9\n \n945.3\n \n1,085.3\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n1,114.0\n \n1,076.5\n \n929.4\n \nTaxes other than income tax\n452.6\n \n406.6\n \n398.1\n \nSibley Unit 3 impairment loss and other regulatory disallowances\n—\n \n—\n \n34.9\n \nTotal Operating Expenses\n4,379.3\n \n4,225.8\n \n4,591.9\n \nINCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n1,468.0\n \n1,282.4\n \n1,267.2\n \nOTHER INCOME (EXPENSE):\nInvestment earnings\n4.6\n \n29.7\n \n9.4\n \nOther income\n38.9\n \n40.6\n \n29.9\n \nOther expense\n(\n40.4\n)\n(\n75.1\n)\n(\n97.3\n)\nTotal Other Income (Expense), Net\n3.1\n \n(\n4.8\n)\n(\n58.0\n)\nInterest expense\n563.1\n \n525.8\n \n404.0\n \nINCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n908.0\n \n751.8\n \n805.2\n \nIncome tax expense\n30.0\n \n15.6\n \n47.5\n \nEquity in earnings of equity method investees, net of income taxes\n7.8\n \n7.4\n \n7.3\n \nNET INCOME\n885.8\n \n743.6\n \n765.0\n \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n12.3\n \n12.3\n \n12.3\n \nNET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO EVERGY, INC.\n$\n873.5\n \n$\n731.3\n \n$\n752.7\n \nBASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER AVERAGE COMMON SHARE OUTSTANDING ATTRIBUTABLE TO EVERGY, INC.

Evergy operates primarily through the following wholly-owned direct subsidiaries listed below.\n•\nEvergy Kansas Central, Inc. (Evergy Kansas Central) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Kansas.  Evergy Kansas Central has \none\n active wholly-owned subsidiary with significant operations, Evergy Kansas South, Inc. (Evergy Kansas South). \n•\nEvergy Metro, Inc. (Evergy Metro) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the states of Missouri and Kansas.\n•\nEvergy Missouri West, Inc. (Evergy Missouri West) is an integrated, regulated electric utility that provides electricity to customers in the state of Missouri.\n•\nEvergy Transmission Company, LLC (Evergy Transmission Company) owns \n13.5\n% of Transource Energy, LLC (Transource) with the remaining \n86.5\n% owned by AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC, a subsidiary of American Electric Power Company, Inc. (AEP).  Transource is focused on the development of competitive electric transmission projects.  Evergy Transmission Company accounts for its investment in Transource under the equity method.\nEvergy Kansas Central also owns a \n50\n% interest in Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC (Prairie Wind), which is a joint venture between Evergy Kansas Central and subsidiaries of AEP and Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company.  Prairie Wind owns a \n108\n-mile, \n345\n kilovolt (kV) double-circuit transmission line that provides transmission service in the Southwest Power Pool, Inc. (SPP).  Evergy Kansas Central accounts for its investment in Prairie Wind under the equity method.\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Kansas South, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West conduct business in their respective service territories using the name Evergy.  Collectively, the Evergy Companies have approximately \n15,800\n megawatts (MWs) of owned generating capacity and renewable power purchase agreements and engage in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately \n1.7\n million customers in the states of Kansas and Missouri.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nEach of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated financial statements includes the accounts of their subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which they are the primary beneficiary.  Undivided interests in jointly-owned generation facilities are included on a proportionate basis.  Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.  The Evergy Companies assess financial performance and allocate resources on a consolidated basis (i.e., operate in one segment).\n89\nTable of Contents\n \nEvergy Metro elected not to apply \"push-down accounting\" related to the merger that created Evergy in 2018, whereby the adjustments of assets and liabilities to fair value and the resulting goodwill would be recorded on the financial statements of the acquired subsidiary.  These adjustments for Evergy Metro, as well as those related to the other acquired assets and liabilities from the merger are only reflected on Evergy's consolidated financial statements.\nUse of Estimates  \nThe process of preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled transactions and events as of the date of the financial statements.  Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results may differ from estimated amounts.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nCash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at acquisition.  Evergy has restricted cash included in Other Current Assets and Other Non-current Assets on Evergy's consolidated balance sheet to facilitate the servicing of Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding I, LLC's (Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding) debt and the funding requirements for a jointly-owned generation facility.  See Note 19 for additional information on the VIE.\n \nThe following table summarizes the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash included on Evergy's consolidated balance sheet. \nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nEvergy\n(millions)\nCurrent assets\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n22.0\n \n$\n27.7\n \nOther \n6.2\n \n—\n \nOther assets\nOther\n1.7\n \n—\n \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n29.9\n \n$\n27.7\n \nFuel Inventory and Supplies\nThe Evergy Companies record fuel inventory and supplies at average cost.\n \nThe following table separately states the balances for fuel inventory and supplies.\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nEvergy\n(millions)\nFuel inventory\n$\n264.2\n \n$\n257.3\n \nSupplies\n603.2\n \n518.9\n \nFuel inventory and supplies\n$\n867.4\n \n$\n776.2\n \nEvergy Kansas Central\nFuel inventory\n$\n154.2\n \n$\n138.6\n \nSupplies\n318.3\n \n273.3\n \nFuel inventory and supplies\n$\n472.5\n \n$\n411.9\n \nEvergy Metro\nFuel inventory\n$\n71.9\n \n$\n81.5\n \nSupplies\n211.9\n \n183.1\n \nFuel inventory and supplies\n$\n283.8\n \n$\n264.6\n \n90\nTable of Contents\n \nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nThe Evergy Companies record the value of property, plant and equipment, including that of VIEs, at cost.  For plant, cost includes contracted services, direct labor and materials, indirect charges for engineering and supervision and an allowance for funds used during construction (AFUDC).  AFUDC represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity.  AFUDC equity funds are included as a non-cash item in other income and AFUDC borrowed funds are a reduction of interest expense.  AFUDC is computed by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress.  The rates used to compute gross AFUDC are compounded semi-annually.\nThe amounts of the Evergy Companies' AFUDC for borrowed and equity funds are detailed in the following table.\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEvergy\n(millions)\nAFUDC borrowed funds\n$\n41.8\n \n$\n39.3\n \n$\n15.8\n \nAFUDC equity funds\n19.6\n \n10.8\n \n22.5\n \nTotal\n$\n61.4\n \n$\n50.1\n \n$\n38.3\n \nEvergy Kansas Central\nAFUDC borrowed funds\n$\n24.7\n \n$\n22.2\n \n$\n6.9\n \nAFUDC equity funds\n12.5\n \n6.4\n \n8.5\n \nTotal\n$\n37.2\n \n$\n28.6\n \n$\n15.4\n \nEvergy Metro\nAFUDC borrowed funds\n$\n11.6\n \n$\n11.8\n \n$\n6.5\n \nAFUDC equity funds\n7.1\n \n4.4\n \n14.2\n \nTotal\n$\n18.7\n \n$\n16.2\n \n$\n20.7\n \nThe average rates used in the calculation of AFUDC are detailed in the following table.\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEvergy Kansas Central\n5.2\n%\n5.7\n%\n3.1\n%\nEvergy Metro\n5.8\n%\n5.2\n%\n5.7\n%\nEvergy Missouri West\n5.1\n%\n5.6\n%\n2.3\n%\nWhen property units are retired or otherwise disposed, the original cost, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.  Repair of property and replacement of items not considered to be units of property are expensed as incurred, except for planned refueling and maintenance outages at Wolf Creek Generating Station (Wolf Creek).  As authorized by regulators, the incremental maintenance cost incurred for such outages is deferred and amortized to expense ratably over the period between planned outages.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization of utility plant other than nuclear fuel is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of depreciable property based on rates approved by state regulatory authorities.  Annual depreciation rates average approximately \n3\n%.  See Note 7 for more details.  Nuclear fuel is amortized to fuel expense based on the quantity of heat produced during the generation of electricity.\n \n91\nTable of Contents\n \nThe depreciable lives of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's property, plant and equipment are detailed in the following table.\nEvergy\nEvergy Kansas Central\nEvergy Metro\n(years)\nGenerating facilities\n5\nto\n66\n5\nto\n66\n7\nto\n58\nTransmission facilities\n27\nto\n66\n29\nto\n63\n27\nto\n64\nDistribution facilities\n10\nto\n63\n13\nto\n61\n10\nto\n54\nOther\n5\nto\n57\n5\nto\n57\n8\nto\n37\nAbandoned Plant\nWhen the Evergy Companies retire utility plant, the original cost, net of salvage, is charged to accumulated depreciation.  However, when it becomes probable an asset will be retired significantly in advance of its original expected useful life and in the near term, the cost of the asset and related accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset and a probable abandonment.  If the asset is still in service, the net amount is classified as plant to be retired, net on the consolidated balance sheets.  If the asset is no longer in service, the net amount is classified as a regulatory asset on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Evergy Companies must also assess the probability of full recovery of the remaining net book value of the abandonment.  The net book value that may be retained as an asset on the balance sheet for the abandonment is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return.  An impairment charge, if any, would equal the difference between the remaining net book value of the asset and the present value of the future revenues expected from the asset.\nEvergy Missouri West retired its Sibley Station in 2018 and the retirement of Sibley Unit 3 met the criteria to be considered an abandonment.  Evergy had classified the remaining net book value of Sibley Unit 3 as retired generation facilities within regulatory assets on its consolidated balance sheet.  In 2022, the MPSC issued an amended final rate order determining that Evergy Missouri West be allowed to collect its existing investment in Sibley Unit 3 from customers over eight years but will not be allowed to collect the return on its unrecovered investment in Sibley Unit 3.  As a result of the order, Evergy Missouri West recorded a $\n26.7\n million impairment loss on Sibley Unit 3 in 2022.\n \nNuclear Plant Decommissioning Costs \nNuclear plant decommissioning cost estimates are based on either the immediate dismantling method or the deferred dismantling method as determined by the State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas (KCC) and Public Service Commission of the State of Missouri (MPSC) and include the costs of decontamination, dismantlement and site restoration.  Based on these cost estimates, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro each contribute to a tax-qualified trust fund to be used to decommission Wolf Creek.  Related liabilities for decommissioning are included on Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated balance sheets in asset retirement obligations (AROs).  \nAs a result of the authorized regulatory treatment and related regulatory accounting, differences between the fair value of the assets held in the nuclear decommissioning trust and the amounts recorded for the accumulated accretion and depreciation expense associated with the decommissioning ARO are recorded as a regulatory liability on Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's consolidated balance sheets.  See Note 6 for discussion of AROs including those associated with nuclear plant decommissioning costs.\n \nRegulatory Accounting\nAccounting standards are applied that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation.  Accordingly, regulatory assets and liabilities have been recorded when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent.  See Note 4 for additional information concerning regulatory matters.\n92\nTable of Contents\n \nCash Surrender Value of Life Insurance\nAmounts related to corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in other long-term assets and are detailed in the following table for Evergy.  \nSubstantially all of Evergy's COLI-related balances relate to Evergy Kansas Central's COLI activity.\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nEvergy\n(millions)\nCash surrender value of policies\n$\n1,322.6\n \n$\n1,349.9\n \nBorrowings against policies\n(\n1,196.2\n)\n(\n1,221.1\n)\nCorporate-owned life insurance, net\n$\n126.4\n \n$\n128.8\n \nIncreases in cash surrender value and death benefits are recorded in other income in the Evergy Companies' consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income.  Interest expense incurred on policy loans is offset against the policy income.  Income from death benefits is highly variable from period to period.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the following financial instruments for which it was practicable to estimate that value.\nNuclear decommissioning trust\n - The Evergy Companies' nuclear decommissioning trust assets are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the fund and/or valuation models.\nDerivative instruments\n - The Evergy Companies' derivative instruments are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices for exchange-traded derivative instruments, quoted prices for similar contracts and/or valuation models.\nPension plans\n - For financial reporting purposes, the market value of plan assets is the fair value based on quoted market prices of the investments held by the fund and/or valuation models.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Evergy Companies record derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance with GAAP.  The Evergy Companies enter into derivative contracts to manage risk exposure to commodity price and interest rate fluctuations and also for trading purposes.  See Note 13 for additional information regarding derivative financial instruments and hedging activities.\nRevenue Recognition \nThe Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of electricity to customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have the right to invoice.  Revenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by the Evergy Companies.  Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month.  This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs.  The Evergy Companies' estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates.  The Evergy Companies' unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes.  See Note 3 for the balance of unbilled receivables for each of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Evergy Companies also collect sales taxes and franchise fees from customers concurrent with revenue-producing activities that are levied by state and local governments.  These items are excluded from revenue, and thus are not reflected on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.\nSee Note 2 for additional details regarding revenue recognition from sales of electricity by the Evergy Companies.\n \n93\nTable of Contents\n \nAllowance for Credit Losses \nHistorical loss information generally provides the basis for the Evergy Companies' assessment of expected credit losses.  The Evergy Companies use an aging of accounts receivable method to assess historical loss information.  When historical experience may not fully reflect the Evergy Companies' expectations about the future, the Evergy Companies will adjust historical loss information, as necessary, to reflect the current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts not already reflected in the historical loss information.\nReceivables are charged off when they are deemed uncollectible, which is based on a number of factors including specific facts surrounding an account and management's judgment.\nAsset Impairments\nLong-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset to be held and used is less than the carrying value of the asset, an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements.  The amount of impairment recognized is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value.    \nGoodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs indicating the possibility that an impairment exists.  The annual test must be performed at the same time each year.  The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment.  In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value.  See Note 5 for additional details on goodwill.\nIncome Taxes \nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset/liability approach.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nThe Evergy Companies recognize tax benefits based on a \"more-likely-than-not\" recognition threshold.  In addition, the Evergy Companies recognize interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expenses.\nEvergy files a consolidated federal income tax return as well as unitary and combined income tax returns in several state jurisdictions with Kansas and Missouri being the most significant.  Income taxes for consolidated or combined subsidiaries are allocated to the subsidiaries based on separate company computations of income or loss.  Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's income tax provisions include taxes allocated based on their separate company's income or loss. \nThe Evergy Companies have established a net regulatory liability for future refunds to be made to customers for amounts collected from customers in excess of income taxes in current rates.  Tax credits are recognized in the year generated except for certain Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West investment tax credits that have been deferred and amortized over the remaining service lives of the related properties.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nThe Evergy Companies' other income includes income from AFUDC equity funds.

Diluted EPS includes the effect of issuable common shares resulting from restricted share units (RSUs), restricted stock, convertible notes and a warrant.  Evergy computes the dilutive effects of potential issuances of common shares using the treasury stock method or the contingently issuable share method, as applicable.\n \nThe following table reconciles Evergy's basic and diluted EPS.\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nIncome\n(millions, except per share amounts)\nNet income\n$\n885.8\n \n$\n743.6\n \n$\n765.0\n \nLess: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\n12.3\n \n12.3\n \n12.3\n \nNet income attributable to Evergy, Inc.\n$\n873.5\n \n$\n731.3\n \n$\n752.7\n \nCommon Shares Outstanding\n \n \nWeighted average number of common shares outstanding - basic\n230.3\n \n230.0\n \n229.9\n \nAdd: effect of dilutive securities\n0.3\n \n0.5\n \n0.4\n \nDiluted average number of common shares outstanding\n230.6\n \n230.5\n \n230.3\n \nBasic EPS\n$\n3.79\n \n$\n3.18\n \n$\n3.27\n \nDiluted EPS\n$\n3.79\n \n$\n3.17\n \n$\n3.27\n \nThere were \nno\n anti-dilutive securities excluded from the computation of diluted EPS for 2024.

Most notably, H.B. 2527 includes a plant-in service accounting (PISA) provision that can be elected by Kansas electric public utilities to defer and recover as regulatory assets \n90\n% of depreciation expense and associated return on investment linked to qualifying electric plants in service.  Qualifying electric plant includes all rate base additions by an electric public utility, but does not include transmission facilities or new electric generating units.  The deferred depreciation and return on the associated regulatory asset are required to be included in determining the utility's rate base during subsequent general rate proceedings.  The return on the deferred regulatory asset balances will be calculated using the weighted average cost of capital.  Utilities that elect the PISA provision can make qualifying deferrals of depreciation and return from July 2024 through December 2030.  Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro elected the PISA provision in their Kansas jurisdictions effective in July 2024. \n96\nTable of Contents\n \nAdditionally, the law establishes new mechanisms for the recovery of costs associated with new gas-fired generating units.  If the KCC decides investment in a new gas-fired generating unit is reasonable, the utility would be able to recover the return on \n100\n% of the associated construction costs at its weighted average cost of capital.  The cost recovery from customers could begin a year after construction begins.  Rates could be adjusted every six months until new base rates reflecting the plant's costs are established.\nIn April 2024, Kansas S.B. 410 was signed into law by the Governor of Kansas.  Most notably, S.B. 410 includes an exemption from all property and ad valorem taxes on certain electric generation facilities for which construction or installation begins on or after January 1, 2025.\nNatural Gas Plant Investments\nIn April 2024, Evergy Missouri West purchased a \n22\n% ownership interest representing approximately \n145\n MW in Dogwood Energy Center (Dogwood), an operational combined-cycle natural gas facility located in Missouri, for approximately $\n60\n million.  The purchase was recorded as an asset acquisition to property, plant and equipment, net, on Evergy's consolidated balance sheet.  The purchase was subject to terms and conditions listed in a stipulation and agreement approved by the MPSC allowing Evergy Missouri West to recover in rates a return of and return on the original cost, net of accumulated depreciation, of Dogwood.  Evergy Missouri West shall also be allowed to recover in rates over \ntwo years\n a return of, but not a return on, the amount of the purchase price paid in excess of the original cost, net of accumulated depreciation, of Dogwood.  In addition, net revenues generated from Evergy Missouri West's ownership of Dogwood from the date of closing to the date new rates become effective in Evergy Missouri West's current rate case shall not impact rates and shall be retained by Evergy Missouri West and reduce the amount of the purchase price paid in excess of the original cost, net of accumulated depreciation, of Dogwood to be recovered from customers.\nIn October 2024, Evergy announced its plan to construct two combined-cycle natural gas plants located in Kansas.  Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Missouri West will jointly-own each plant and expect each plant to have an initial generating capacity of approximately \n705\n MW.  The first plant is expected to begin operations by summer of 2029 and the second plant is expected to begin operations by summer of 2030.\nAdditionally, Evergy Missouri West plans to construct a \n440\n MW simple-cycle natural gas plant located in Missouri.  The plant is expected to begin operations in 2030.\nSee Note 4 for information regarding Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Missouri West's applications for predetermination and the Certificate of Convenience and Necessity (CCN) for their investments in these natural gas plants.\nRenewable Plant Investments\nEvergy Kansas Central intends to construct and own an approximately \n159\n MW solar generation facility to be located in Kansas and called Kansas Sky.  The solar generation facility is expected to begin operations by summer of 2027.  The construction of Kansas Sky is subject to the granting by the KCC of predetermination with reasonably acceptable terms and other closing conditions.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Evergy Missouri West entered into agreements to own two solar generation facilities currently under development.  The first facility, to be called Sunflower Sky, is a solar generation facility to be located in Kansas with an expected generating capacity of approximately \n65\n MW.  The second facility, to be called Foxtrot, is a solar generation facility to be located in Missouri with an expected generating capacity of approximately \n100\n MW.  The solar generation facilities are expected to begin operations by summer of 2027.  The agreements are subject to regulatory approvals and closing conditions, including the granting by the MPSC of a CCN with reasonably acceptable terms.\nSee Note 4 for information regarding Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Missouri West's applications for predetermination and CCN, respectively, for their investments in these renewable generating plants.\n97\nTable of Contents\n \n2.  \nREVENUE\nEvergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's revenues disaggregated by customer class are summarized in the following tables.\nEvergy\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n(millions)\nResidential\n$\n2,186.6\n \n$\n2,036.7\n \n$\n2,168.2\n \nCommercial\n1,963.7\n \n1,832.4\n \n1,888.5\n \nIndustrial\n682.0\n \n625.9\n \n686.2\n \nOther retail\n43.3\n \n43.2\n \n(\n32.1\n)\nTotal electric retail\n$\n4,875.6\n \n$\n4,538.2\n \n$\n4,710.8\n \nWholesale\n320.5\n \n373.5\n \n509.9\n \nTransmission\n482.6\n \n403.2\n \n343.7\n \nIndustrial steam and other\n25.7\n \n30.2\n \n24.8\n \nTotal revenue from contracts with customers\n$\n5,704.4\n \n$\n5,345.1\n \n$\n5,589.2\n \nOther \n142.9\n \n163.1\n \n269.9\n \nOperating revenues\n$\n5,847.3\n \n$\n5,508.2\n \n$\n5,859.1\n \nEvergy's other retail electric revenues in 2022 include a $\n68.0\n million recognition of a regulatory liability for the refund of revenues previously collected from customers since December 2018 for the return on investment of the retired Sibley Station.  \nEvergy Kansas Central\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n(millions)\nResidential\n$\n983.5\n \n$\n821.0\n \n$\n980.1\n \nCommercial\n842.7\n \n722.9\n \n822.9\n \nIndustrial\n448.9\n \n398.5\n \n465.7\n \nOther retail\n25.2\n \n18.1\n \n17.9\n \nTotal electric retail\n$\n2,300.3\n \n$\n1,960.5\n \n$\n2,286.6\n \nWholesale\n237.2\n \n296.8\n \n389.9\n \nTransmission\n455.0\n \n385.8\n \n305.0\n \nOther\n2.7\n \n2.1\n \n2.2\n \nTotal revenue from contracts with customers\n$\n2,995.2\n \n$\n2,645.2\n \n$\n2,983.7\n \nOther\n11.9\n \n53.2\n \n72.2\n \nOperating revenues\n$\n3,007.1\n \n$\n2,698.4\n \n$\n3,055.9\n \n98\nTable of Contents\n \nEvergy Metro\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n(millions)\nResidential\n$\n738.8\n \n$\n748.4\n \n$\n746.4\n \nCommercial\n776.7\n \n778.9\n \n758.6\n \nIndustrial\n132.7\n \n130.9\n \n127.0\n \nOther retail\n10.3\n \n12.7\n \n11.5\n \nTotal electric retail\n$\n1,658.5\n \n$\n1,670.9\n \n$\n1,643.5\n \nWholesale\n82.6\n \n91.9\n \n111.9\n \nTransmission\n19.9\n \n14.3\n \n18.2\n \nOther\n3.7\n \n3.3\n \n0.9\n \nTotal revenue from contracts with customers\n$\n1,764.7\n \n$\n1,780.4\n \n$\n1,774.5\n \nOther\n129.0\n \n108.6\n \n196.1\n \nOperating revenues\n$\n1,893.7\n \n$\n1,889.0\n \n$\n1,970.6\n \nRetail Revenues\nThe Evergy Companies' retail revenues are generated by the regulated sale of electricity to their residential, commercial and industrial customers within their franchised service territories.  The Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of electricity to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice.  Retail customers are billed monthly at the tariff rates approved by the KCC and MPSC based on customer kWh usage.  \nRevenues recorded include electric services provided but not yet billed by the Evergy Companies.  Unbilled revenues are recorded for kWh usage in the period following the customers' billing cycle to the end of the month.  This estimate is based on net system kWh usage less actual billed kWhs.  The Evergy Companies' estimated unbilled kWhs are allocated and priced by regulatory jurisdiction across the rate classes based on actual billing rates.  \nThe Evergy Companies also collect sales taxes and franchise fees from customers concurrent with revenue-producing activities that are levied by state and local governments.  These items are excluded from revenue, and thus not reflected on the statements of income and comprehensive income, for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro.\nWholesale Revenues\nThe Evergy Companies' wholesale revenues are generated by the sale of wholesale power and capacity in circumstances when the power that the Evergy Companies generate is not required for customers in their service territory.  These sales primarily occur within the SPP Integrated Marketplace.  The Evergy Companies also purchase power from the SPP Integrated Marketplace and record sale and purchase activity on a net basis in wholesale revenue or fuel and purchased power expense.  In addition, the Evergy Companies sell wholesale power and capacity through bilateral contracts to other counterparties, such as electric cooperatives, municipalities and other electric utilities. \nFor both wholesale sales to the SPP Integrated Marketplace and through bilateral contracts, the Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of wholesale electricity to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice.  \nWholesale sales within the SPP Integrated Marketplace are billed weekly based on the fixed transaction price determined by the market at the time of the sale and the megawatt hour (MWh) quantity sold.  Wholesale sales from bilateral contracts are billed monthly based on the contractually determined transaction price and the kWh quantity sold.\n99\nTable of Contents\n \nTransmission Revenues\nThe Evergy Companies' transmission revenues are generated by the use of their transmission networks by the SPP. To enable optimal use of the diverse generating resources in the SPP region, the Evergy Companies, as well as other transmission owners, allow the SPP to access and operate their transmission networks.  As new transmission lines are constructed, they are included in the transmission network available to the SPP.  In exchange for providing access, the SPP pays the Evergy Companies consideration determined by formula rates approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which include the cost to construct and maintain the transmission lines and a return on investment.  The price for access to the Evergy Companies' transmission networks are updated annually based on projected costs.  Projections are updated to actual costs and the difference is included in subsequent year's prices.  \nThe Evergy Companies have different treatment for their legacy transmission facilities within the SPP, which results in different levels of transmission revenue being received from the SPP.  Evergy Kansas Central's transmission revenues from SPP include amounts that Evergy Kansas Central pays to the SPP on behalf of its retail electric customers for the use of Evergy Kansas Central's legacy transmission facilities.  These transmission revenues are mostly offset by SPP network transmission cost expense that Evergy Kansas Central pays on behalf of its retail customers.  Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West do not pay the SPP for their retail customers’ use of the Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West legacy transmission facilities and correspondingly, their transmission revenues also do not reflect the associated transmission revenue from the SPP. \nThe Evergy Companies recognize revenue on the sale of transmission service to their customers over time as the service is provided in the amount they have a right to invoice.  Transmission service to the SPP is billed monthly based on a fixed transaction price determined by FERC formula transmission rates along with other SPP-specific charges and the MW quantity sold.    \nIndustrial Steam and Other Revenues\nEvergy's industrial steam and other revenues are primarily generated by the regulated sale of industrial steam to Evergy Missouri West's steam customers.  Evergy recognizes revenue on the sale of industrial steam to its customers over time as the service is provided in the amount that it has the right to invoice.  Steam customers are billed on a monthly basis at the tariff rate approved by the MPSC based on customer MMBtu usage.\n100\nTable of Contents\n \n3.  \nRECEIVABLES\nThe Evergy Companies' receivables are detailed in the following table.\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nEvergy\n(millions)\nCustomer accounts receivable - billed\n$\n2.7\n \n$\n2.6\n \nCustomer accounts receivable - unbilled\n108.4\n \n109.1\n \nOther receivables\n150.0\n \n169.4\n \nAllowance for credit losses\n(\n15.7\n)\n(\n24.2\n)\nTotal\n$\n245.4\n \n$\n256.9\n \nEvergy Kansas Central\nCustomer accounts receivable - unbilled\n$\n36.0\n \n$\n39.9\n \nOther receivables\n104.9\n \n143.5\n \nAllowance for credit losses\n(\n7.8\n)\n(\n11.6\n)\nTotal\n$\n133.1\n \n$\n171.8\n \nEvergy Metro\n \n \nCustomer accounts receivable - unbilled\n$\n28.5\n \n$\n27.2\n \nOther receivables\n35.4\n \n35.7\n \nAllowance for credit losses\n(\n5.8\n)\n(\n7.9\n)\nTotal\n$\n58.1\n \n$\n55.0\n \nThe Evergy Companies' other receivables as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, consisted primarily of receivables from partners in jointly-owned electric utility plants, wholesale sales receivables and receivables related to alternative revenue programs.  \nThe Evergy Companies' other receivables also included receivables from contracts with customers as summarized in the following table.\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\n(millions)\nEvergy\n$\n68.9\n \n$\n61.5\n \nEvergy Kansas Central\n65.3\n \n59.9\n \nEvergy Metro\n2.6\n \n0.8\n \n101\nTable of Contents\n \nThe change in the Evergy Companies' allowance for credit losses is summarized in the following table.\n2024\n2023\nEvergy\n(millions)\nBeginning balance January 1\n$\n24.2\n \n$\n31.4\n \nCredit loss expense\n11.7\n \n15.4\n \nWrite-offs\n(\n32.5\n)\n(\n33.3\n)\nRecoveries of prior write-offs\n12.3\n \n10.7\n \nEnding balance December 31\n$\n15.7\n \n$\n24.2\n \nEvergy Kansas Central\nBeginning balance January 1\n$\n11.6\n \n$\n16.9\n \nCredit loss expense\n6.6\n \n7.7\n \nWrite-offs\n(\n15.6\n)\n(\n17.7\n)\nRecoveries of prior write-offs\n5.2\n \n4.7\n \nEnding balance December 31\n$\n7.8\n \n$\n11.6\n \nEvergy Metro\nBeginning balance January 1\n$\n7.9\n \n$\n9.3\n \nCredit loss expense\n4.5\n \n5.0\n \nWrite-offs\n(\n11.6\n)\n(\n10.5\n)\nRecoveries of prior write-offs\n5.0\n \n4.1\n \nEnding balance December 31\n$\n5.8\n \n$\n7.9\n \nSale of Accounts Receivable\nEvergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West sell an undivided percentage ownership interest in their retail electric accounts receivable to independent outside investors.

Under the amended terms, effective in the first quarter of 2024, Evergy Kansas Central's facility allows up to $\n185.0\n million in aggregate outstanding principal amount to be borrowed at any time.  To the extent Evergy Kansas Central has qualifying accounts receivable and subject to the lender's discretion, Evergy Kansas Central's facility allows for an additional $\n65.0\n million in aggregate outstanding principal amount to be borrowed at any time.  Evergy Metro's facility allows up to $\n130.0\n million in aggregate outstanding principal amount to be borrowed at any time.  To the extent Evergy Metro has qualifying accounts receivable and subject to the lender's discretion, Evergy Metro's facility allows for an additional $\n70.0\n million in aggregate outstanding principal amount to be borrowed at any time.  Evergy Missouri West's facility allows up to $\n50.0\n million in aggregate outstanding principal amount to be borrowed at any time.  To the extent Evergy Missouri West has qualifying accounts receivable and subject to the lender's discretion, Evergy Missouri West's facility allows for an additional $\n65.0\n million in aggregate outstanding principal amount to be borrowed at any time.\n \n102\nTable of Contents\n \n4.  \nRATE MATTERS AND REGULATION\nKCC Proceedings\nEvergy Kansas Central's 2025 Rate Case Proceeding\nIn January 2025, Evergy Kansas Central filed an application with the KCC to request an increase to its retail revenues of approximately $\n196\n million.  Evergy Kansas Central's request reflected a return on equity of \n10.5\n% (with a capital structure composed of \n52\n% equity) and increases related to the recovery of infrastructure investments made to improve reliability and enhance customer service and the update of expenses to current levels of spend.  New rates are expected to be effective in September 2025.  \nApplications for Predetermination\nThe KCC uses a process referred to as ‘predetermination’ to establish ratemaking principles and treatments for certain utility investments before they are included in a utility’s rate base.  The process helps balance the interest of utilities and customers by ensuring broad agreement to the reasonableness of the investment and regulatory certainty regarding the recovery of costs associated with the investment.\n \nInvestment in utility projects may be dependent on acceptable regulatory treatment determined in the predetermination process.\n \nIn November 2024, Evergy Kansas Central requested predetermination from the KCC for its planned natural gas plant investments and Kansas Sky solar investment.\n \nEvergy Kansas Central is expecting an order from the KCC in July 2025.\nEvergy Kansas Central 2024 Transmission Delivery Charge (TDC)\nIn April 2024, the KCC issued an order adjusting Evergy Kansas Central's retail prices to include updated transmission costs as reflected in the FERC transmission formula rate (TFR).  The new prices were effective in May 2024 and are expected to increase Evergy Kansas Central's annual retail revenues by $\n80.1\n million when compared to 2023.\nEvergy Metro 2024 TDC\nIn April 2024, the KCC issued an order adjusting Evergy Metro's retail prices to include updated transmission costs as reflected in the FERC TFR.  The new prices were effective in May 2024 and are expected to increase Evergy Metro's annual retail revenues by $\n7.1\n million when compared to 2023. \nMPSC Proceedings\nEvergy Missouri West's 2024 Rate Case Proceeding\nIn February 2024, Evergy Missouri West filed an application with the MPSC to request an increase to its retail revenues of approximately $\n104\n million.  Evergy Missouri West's request reflected a return on equity of \n10.5\n% (with a capital structure composed of \n52\n% equity) and increases related to the recovery of infrastructure investments made to improve reliability and enhance customer service and the inclusion of certain costs related to Dogwood and Crossroads Energy Center (Crossroads), two natural gas plants.\nIn October 2024, Evergy Missouri West, MPSC staff and other intervenors in the case reached a unanimous partial stipulation and agreement to settle certain issues in the case.  The partial stipulation and agreement provided for an increase to Evergy Missouri West's retail revenues of approximately $\n55\n million after lowering base rates for fuel and purchased power expense of approximately $\n49\n million and rebasing property tax expense.  \nIn December 2024, the MPSC issued a final rate order approving the unanimous partial stipulation and agreement.  The new rates established by this order took effect in January 2025.\nRequests for Certificate of Convenience and Necessity\nMissouri utilities must request a CCN from the MPSC to authorize them to build certain utility projects. \n \nThe CCN process authorizes utilities to build projects and can provide assurance that the project is prudent and necessary. \n \nInvestment in projects is dependent upon the granting by the MPSC of a CCN with reasonably acceptable terms.\n \nIn October 2024, Evergy Missouri West filed an application for a CCN for its planned renewable plant investments.\n \nIn its application, Evergy Missouri West requested an order from the MPSC by May 2025.\n \nIn November 2024, \n103\nTable of Contents\n \nEvergy Missouri West filed an application for a CCN for its planned natural gas plant investments. \n \nEvergy Missouri West is expecting an order from the MPSC by August 2025.\nEvergy Missouri West February 2021 Winter Weather Event Securitization\nIn February 2021, much of the central and southern United States, including the service territories of the Evergy Companies, experienced a significant winter weather event that resulted in extremely cold temperatures over a multi-day period (February 2021 winter weather event).   \nIn November 2022, the MPSC issued a revised financing order authorizing Evergy Missouri West to issue securitized bonds to recover its extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs incurred as part of the February 2021 winter weather event.  As part of the order, the MPSC found that Evergy Missouri West's costs were prudently incurred, that it should only be allowed to recover \n95\n% of its extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs consistent with the \n5\n% sharing provision of its fuel recovery mechanism, that it should be allowed to recover carrying costs incurred since February 2021 at Evergy Missouri West's long-term debt rate of \n5.06\n% and approved a \n15\n year repayment period for the bonds with a \n17\n year legal maturity.  Evergy Missouri West continued to record carrying charges on its February 2021 winter weather event regulatory asset until it issued the securitized bonds in February 2024.  See Note 12 for additional information regarding the issuance of the securitized bonds.  \nFERC Proceedings\nIn October of each year, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro post an updated TFR that includes projected transmission capital expenditures and operating costs for the following year.  This rate is the most significant component in the retail rate calculation for Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's annual request with the KCC to adjust retail prices to include updated transmission costs through the TDC.\nEvergy Kansas Central TFR Annual Update\nMost recently, the updated TFR was expected to adjust Evergy Kansas Central's annual transmission revenues by approximately:\n•\n$\n19.1\n million increase effective in January 2025;\n•\n$\n115.8\n million increase effective in January 2024; and\n•\n$\n21.7\n million decrease effective in March 2023. \nSee \"Evergy Kansas Central TFR Formal Challenge\" within this Note 4 for additional information regarding the March 2023 adjustment.\nEvergy Kansas Central TFR Formal Challenge\nIn March 2022, certain Evergy Kansas Central TFR customers submitted a formal challenge regarding the implementation of Evergy Kansas Central's TFR, specifically how Evergy Kansas Central's capital structure was calculated as part of determining the Annual Transmission Revenue Requirement.  As part of this challenge, the customers requested that Evergy Kansas Central make refunds for over-collections in rate years 2018 through 2022 as a result of the calculation of its capital structure included in the TFR.  Evergy Kansas Central disputed that any refunds for 2018 through 2022 were required because Evergy Kansas Central was following its approved TFR formula.  \nIn December 2022, FERC issued an order addressing the challenge to the 2020 through 2022 over-collections which were refunded to customers as part of Evergy Kansas Central's 2023 TFR effective in March 2023.  In February 2023, certain Evergy Kansas Central TFR customers submitted a formal complaint with FERC requesting the refund of over-collections related to the 2018 and 2019 rate years.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central had recorded a $\n7.1\n million regulatory liability related to the 2018 and 2019 rate year refund request.  Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central are awaiting a response from FERC.     \n104\nTable of Contents\n \nEvergy Metro TFR Annual Update\nMost recently, the updated TFR was expected to adjust Evergy Metro's annual transmission revenues by approximately:\n•\n$\n1.0\n million increase effective in January 2025;\n•\n$\n23.7\n million increase effective in January 2024; and\n•\n$\n8.6\n million increase effective in January 2023.\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe Evergy Companies have recorded assets and liabilities on their consolidated balance sheets resulting from the effects of the ratemaking process, which would not otherwise be recorded if they were not regulated.  Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that are probable of recovery from future revenues.  Regulatory liabilities represent future reductions in revenues or refunds to customers.  \nManagement regularly assesses whether regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or refund by considering factors such as decisions by the MPSC, KCC or FERC in Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's and Evergy Missouri West's rate case filings; decisions in other regulatory proceedings, including decisions related to other companies that establish precedent on matters applicable to the Evergy Companies; and changes in laws and regulations.  If recovery or refund of regulatory assets or liabilities is not approved by regulators or is no longer deemed probable, these regulatory assets or liabilities are recognized in the current period results of operations.  The Evergy Companies continued ability to meet the criteria for recording regulatory assets and liabilities may be affected in the future by restructuring and deregulation in the electric industry or changes in accounting rules.  In the event that the criteria no longer applied to any or all of the Evergy Companies' operations, the related regulatory assets and liabilities would be written off unless an appropriate regulatory recovery mechanism were provided.  Additionally, these factors could result in an impairment on utility plant assets.  \n105\nTable of Contents\n \nThe Evergy Companies' regulatory assets and liabilities are detailed in the following tables. \nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nEvergy\nEvergy Kansas Central\nEvergy Metro\nEvergy\nEvergy Kansas Central\nEvergy Metro\nRegulatory Assets\n(millions)\nPension and post-retirement costs\n$\n47.3\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n91.6\n \n$\n29.7\n \n$\n—\n \nDebt reacquisition costs\n74.8\n \n69.8\n \n4.7\n \n81.2\n \n75.3\n \n5.3\n \nDebt fair value adjustment\n81.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n87.0\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAsset retirement obligations fair value \n   adjustment\n121.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \n120.7\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDepreciation\n238.3\n \n55.6\n \n94.7\n \n168.7\n \n44.6\n \n66.0\n \nCost of removal\n332.1\n \n133.5\n \n167.8\n \n372.3\n \n165.6\n \n168.2\n \nAsset retirement obligations\n189.0\n \n81.5\n \n82.2\n \n152.9\n \n65.9\n \n64.0\n \nAnalog meter unrecovered investment\n6.2\n \n6.2\n \n—\n \n8.3\n \n8.3\n \n—\n \nTreasury yield hedges\n17.0\n \n17.0\n \n—\n \n18.1\n \n18.1\n \n—\n \nIatan No. 1 and common facilities\n5.6\n \n—\n \n2.5\n \n5.9\n \n—\n \n2.5\n \nIatan No. 2 construction accounting costs\n22.7\n \n—\n \n11.4\n \n23.4\n \n—\n \n11.7\n \nProperty taxes\n26.6\n \n—\n \n23.7\n \n56.0\n \n28.3\n \n25.3\n \nDisallowed plant costs\n13.2\n \n13.2\n \n—\n \n13.5\n \n13.5\n \n—\n \nLa Cygne environmental costs\n7.7\n \n5.8\n \n1.9\n \n8.8\n \n6.8\n \n2.0\n \nDeferred customer programs\n38.5\n \n15.9\n \n17.2\n \n20.3\n \n6.7\n \n11.2\n \nFuel recovery mechanisms\n25.7\n \n16.3\n \n9.4\n \n101.3\n \n—\n \n14.1\n \nFebruary 2021 winter weather event\n8.3\n \n8.3\n \n—\n \n403.5\n \n79.7\n \n—\n \nFebruary 2021 winter weather event securitized costs\n310.4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nSolar rebates\n3.4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n9.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTransmission delivery charge\n22.0\n \n20.0\n \n2.0\n \n2.0\n \n0.9\n \n1.1\n \nWolf Creek outage\n14.6\n \n7.3\n \n7.3\n \n8.4\n \n4.2\n \n4.2\n \nPension and other post-retirement benefit \n   non-service costs\n82.4\n \n31.0\n \n31.9\n \n85.8\n \n32.0\n \n34.2\n \nRetired generation facilities\n120.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n138.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \nMerger transition costs\n18.4\n \n8.7\n \n6.9\n \n23.1\n \n11.0\n \n8.6\n \nOther regulatory assets\n71.7\n \n36.2\n \n8.5\n \n86.5\n \n42.3\n \n15.6\n \nTotal\n1,900.2\n \n526.3\n \n472.1\n \n2,087.4\n \n632.9\n \n434.0\n \nLess: current portion\n(\n180.9\n)\n(\n79.7\n)\n(\n42.7\n)\n(\n292.1\n)\n(\n127.7\n)\n(\n53.2\n)\nTotal noncurrent regulatory assets\n$\n1,719.3\n \n$\n446.6\n \n$\n429.4\n \n$\n1,795.3\n \n$\n505.2\n \n$\n380.8\n \n106\nTable of Contents\n \nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nEvergy\nEvergy Kansas Central\nEvergy Metro\nEvergy\nEvergy Kansas Central\nEvergy Metro\nRegulatory Liabilities\n(millions)\nTaxes refundable through future rates\n$\n1,631.4\n \n$\n1,008.5\n \n$\n477.7\n \n$\n1,737.8\n \n$\n1,047.2\n \n$\n519.2\n \nNuclear production tax credits\n168.6\n \n82.4\n \n86.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDeferred regulatory gain from sale \n   leaseback\n26.1\n \n26.1\n \n—\n \n31.6\n \n31.6\n \n—\n \nEmission allowances\n30.2\n \n—\n \n30.2\n \n34.2\n \n—\n \n34.2\n \nNuclear decommissioning\n387.2\n \n142.1\n \n245.1\n \n318.7\n \n125.5\n \n193.2\n \nPension and post-retirement costs\n206.6\n \n39.0\n \n165.4\n \n124.8\n \n21.9\n \n100.5\n \nJurisdictional allowance for funds used \n   during construction\n23.8\n \n22.1\n \n1.7\n \n24.4\n \n22.7\n \n1.7\n \nLa Cygne leasehold dismantling costs\n29.6\n \n29.6\n \n—\n \n29.6\n \n29.6\n \n—\n \nKansas tax credits\n8.4\n \n8.4\n \n—\n \n16.8\n \n16.8\n \n—\n \nPurchase power agreement\n3.0\n \n3.0\n \n—\n \n3.7\n \n3.7\n \n—\n \nFuel recovery mechanisms\n21.5\n \n—\n \n0.2\n \n34.7\n \n34.7\n \n—\n \nFebruary 2021 winter weather event\n3.0\n \n—\n \n3.0\n \n13.0\n \n—\n \n13.0\n \nSibley AAO\n52.8\n \n—\n \n—\n \n79.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTFR refunds\n7.1\n \n7.1\n \n—\n \n11.2\n \n11.2\n \n—\n \nCOLI rate credits refund\n64.4\n \n64.4\n \n—\n \n96.5\n \n96.5\n \n—\n \nLevelized rate recovery\n65.0\n \n65.0\n \n—\n \n38.1\n \n38.1\n \n—\n \nOther regulatory liabilities\n117.1\n \n54.7\n \n37.4\n \n131.2\n \n57.0\n \n41.4\n \nTotal\n2,845.8\n \n1,552.4\n \n1,046.9\n \n2,725.5\n \n1,536.5\n \n903.2\n \nLess: current portion\n(\n173.8\n)\n(\n76.6\n)\n(\n38.5\n)\n(\n183.0\n)\n(\n104.1\n)\n(\n43.0\n)\nTotal noncurrent regulatory liabilities\n$\n2,672.0\n \n$\n1,475.8\n \n$\n1,008.4\n \n$\n2,542.5\n \n$\n1,432.4\n \n$\n860.2\n \nThe following summarizes the nature and period of recovery for each of the regulatory assets listed in the table above.\nPension and post-retirement costs: \nRepresents unrecognized gains and losses and prior service costs that will be recognized in future net periodic pension and post-retirement costs, pension settlements amortized over various periods and financial and regulatory accounting method differences that will be eliminated over the life of the pension plans.

Evergy's impairment test for the $\n2,336.6\n million of goodwill that was recorded as a result of the merger that created Evergy was conducted as of May 1, 2024.  The goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill, to identify potential impairment.  In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount of the reporting unit and its fair value.  Evergy's consolidated operations are considered \none\n reporting unit for assessment of impairment, as management assesses financial performance and allocates resources on a consolidated basis.  The determination of fair value of the reporting unit consisted of two valuation techniques: an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow analysis and a market approach consisting of a determination of reporting unit invested capital using a market multiple derived from the historical earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and market prices of the stock of peer companies.  The results of the two techniques were evaluated and weighted to determine a point within the range that management considered representative of fair value for the reporting unit.  The fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, including goodwill.  As a result, there was no impairment of goodwill in 2024 or 2023.\n6.  \nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS \nAROs associated with tangible long-lived assets are legal obligations that exist under enacted laws, statutes and written or oral contracts, including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel.  These liabilities are recognized at estimated fair value as incurred with a corresponding amount capitalized as part of the cost of the related long-lived assets and depreciated over their useful lives.

Evergy is also responsible for its indirect \n94\n% ownership share of Wolf Creek's defined benefit plans, consisting of Evergy Kansas South's and Evergy Metro's respective \n47\n% ownership shares.\nFor the majority of employees, pension benefits under these plans reflect the employees' compensation, years of service and age at retirement.  However, for the plan covering Evergy Kansas Central's employees, the benefits for non-union employees hired between 2002 and the second quarter of 2018 and union employees hired beginning in 2012 are derived from a cash balance account formula.  The plan was closed to future non-union employees in 2018.  For the plans covering Evergy Metro's employees, the benefits for union employees hired beginning in 2014 are derived from a cash balance account formula and the plans were closed to future non-union employees in 2014.\nEvergy and its subsidiaries also provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees of Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro and their respective shares of Wolf Creek's post-retirement benefit plans. \nThe Evergy Companies record pension and post-retirement expense in accordance with rate orders from the KCC and MPSC that allow the difference between pension and post-retirement costs under GAAP and costs for ratemaking to be recognized as a regulatory asset or liability.  This difference between financial and regulatory accounting methods is due to timing and will be eliminated over the life of the plans.\nFor 2024, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central recorded pension special termination benefit expense of $\n0.2\n million.  For 2023, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro recorded pension settlement (gains) losses of ($\n21.1\n) million, $\n1.1\n million and ($\n22.2\n) million, respectively.  For 2022, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro recorded pension and post-retirement special termination benefit expense of $\n59.5\n million, $\n17.0\n million and $\n42.5\n million, respectively.  These settlement (gains) losses and special termination benefits were the result of accelerated distributions and enhanced pension distributions as a result of employee retirements for certain plan participants.  Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro deferred substantially all of the (gains), losses and expense to regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities and expect to recover these amounts over future periods pursuant to regulatory agreements.\n114\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following pension benefits tables provide information relating to the funded status of all defined benefit pension plans on an aggregate basis as well as the components of net periodic benefit costs.  For financial reporting purposes, the market value of plan assets is the fair value.  Net periodic benefit costs reflect total plan benefit costs prior to the effects of capitalization and sharing with joint owners of power plants.\nPension Benefits\nPost-Retirement

The Long-Term Incentive Plan permits the grant of restricted stock, restricted stock units, bonus shares, stock options, stock appreciation rights, limited stock appreciation rights, director shares, director deferred share units and performance shares to directors, officers and other employees of Evergy.  Common stock shares delivered by Evergy under the Long-Term Incentive Plan may be authorized but unissued, held in the treasury or purchased on the open market (including private purchases) in accordance with applicable securities laws.  Evergy has a policy of delivering newly issued shares and does not expect to repurchase common shares during 2025 to satisfy equity compensation payments and director deferred share unit conversion.  Evergy recognizes forfeitures as they occur.\nThe following table summarizes the Evergy Companies' equity compensation expense and the associated income tax benefit.\n2024\n2023\n2022\nEvergy\n(millions)\nEquity compensation expense\n$\n15.2\n \n$\n17.7\n \n$\n18.8\n \nIncome tax benefit\n1.9\n \n1.6\n \n2.6\n \nEvergy Kansas Central\nEquity compensation expense\n6.7\n \n6.5\n \n8.4\n \nIncome tax benefit\n1.5\n \n1.4\n \n1.7\n \nEvergy Metro\nEquity compensation expense\n4.5\n \n5.7\n \n6.0\n \nIncome tax (expense) benefit\n—\n \n(\n0.6\n)\n0.2\n \nRestricted Share Units\nEvergy utilizes RSUs for new grants of stock-based compensation awards.  RSU awards are grants that entitle the holder to receive shares of common stock as the awards vest.  These RSU awards are defined as nonvested shares and do not include restrictions once the awards have vested.  These RSUs either take the form of RSUs with performance measures that vest upon the achievement of specific performance goals or RSUs with only service requirements that vest solely upon the passage of time.  \nRSUs with Performance Measures\nThe payment of RSUs with performance measures is contingent upon achievement of specific performance goals over a stated period of time as approved by the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board.  The numbers of RSUs with performances measures ultimately paid can vary from the numbers of RSUs with performance measures initially granted depending on Evergy's performance over the stated performance periods.  Compensation expense for RSUs with performance measures is calculated by recognizing the portion of the fair value for each reporting period for which the requisite service has been rendered.  Dividends are accrued over the vesting period and paid in cash based on the number of RSUs with performance measures ultimately paid.\nThe fair value of RSUs with performance measures is estimated using the market value of Evergy's stock at the valuation date and a Monte Carlo simulation technique that incorporates assumptions for inputs of expected volatilities, dividend yield and risk-free rates.  Expected volatility is based on daily stock price change during a historical period commensurate with the remaining term of the performance period of the grant.  The risk-free rate is based upon the rate at the time of the evaluation for zero-coupon government bonds with a maturity consistent with the remaining performance period of the grant.  The dividend yield is based on the most recent dividends paid and the actual closing stock price on the valuation date.  For shares granted in 2024, inputs for expected volatility, dividend yield and the risk-free rate were \n21\n%, \n4.15\n% - \n5.21\n% and \n3.53\n% - \n4.28\n%, respectively.\n126\nTable of Contents\n \nRSU activity for awards with performance measures for 2024 is summarized in the following table. \nNonvested\nRestricted Share Units\nGrant Date\nFair Value*\nBeginning balance as of January 1, 2024\n663,727\n \n$\n58.32\n \nGranted\n295,803\n \n49.94\n \nVested\n(\n165,464\n)\n61.41\n \nAdjusted\n(\n61,194\n)\n61.41\n \nForfeited\n(\n102,185\n)\n54.28\n \nEnding balance as of December 31, 2024\n630,687\n \n55.45\n \n* weighted-average\nAs of December 31, 2024, the remaining weighted-average contractual term related to RSU awards with performance measures was \n1.3\n years.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted with performance measures was $\n49.94\n, $\n59.77\n and $\n57.95\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024, there was $\n12.2\n million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs with performance measures.  The total fair value of RSUs with performance measures that vested was $\n10.2\n million, $\n7.9\n million and $\n5.5\n million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nRSUs with Only Service Requirements\nEvergy measures the fair value of RSUs with only service requirements based on the fair market value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date.  RSU awards with only service conditions recognize compensation expense by multiplying shares by the grant-date fair value related to the RSU and recognizing it on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. Dividends are accrued over the vesting period and are invested in additional RSU's subject to the same service conditions. \nRSU activity for awards with only service requirements for 2024 is summarized in the following table.\nNonvested\nRestricted Share Units\nGrant Date\nFair Value*\nBeginning balance as of January 1, 2024\n264,214\n \n$\n57.76\n \nGranted\n199,816\n \n51.22\n \nVested\n(\n120,813\n)\n55.99\n \nForfeited\n(\n36,562\n)\n53.96\n \nEnding balance as of December 31, 2024\n306,655\n \n54.65\n \n* weighted-average\nAs of December 31, 2024, the remaining weighted-average contractual term related to RSU awards with only service requirements was \n1.4\n years.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted with only service requirements was $\n51.22\n, $\n57.47\n and $\n60.93\n in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  As of December 31, 2024, there was $\n8.4\n million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs.  The total fair value of RSUs with only service requirements that vested was $\n6.8\n million, $\n3.3\n million and $\n4.7\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n11.  \nSHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND SHORT-TERM BANK LINES OF CREDIT\nIn August 2024, the Evergy Companies extended the expiration date of their $\n2.5\n billion master credit facility from 2027 to 2028.  Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West have borrowing capacity under the master credit facility with specific sublimits for each borrower.  These sublimits can be unilaterally adjusted by Evergy for each borrower provided the sublimits remain within minimum and maximum sublimits as specified in the facility.

Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Kansas South must be in compliance with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness.  The amount of Evergy Kansas Central FMBs authorized by its Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated July 1, 1939, as supplemented, is subject to certain limitations as described below.  The amount of Evergy Kansas South FMBs authorized by the Evergy Kansas South Mortgage and Deed of Trust, dated April 1, 1940, as supplemented and amended, is limited to a maximum of $\n3.5\n billion, unless amended further.  FMBs are secured by utility assets.  Amounts of additional FMBs that may be issued are subject to property, earnings and certain restrictive provisions, except in connection with certain refundings, of each mortgage.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately $\n420.5\n million and $\n2,878.6\n million principal amounts of additional Evergy Kansas Central FMBs or Evergy Kansas South FMBs, respectively, could be issued under the most restrictive provisions of their mortgages.\nEvergy Metro has issued mortgage bonds under the Evergy Metro Mortgage Indenture, which creates a mortgage lien on substantially all Evergy Metro's utility plant.  Additional Evergy Metro bonds may be issued on the basis of \n75\n% of property additions or retired bonds.  As of December 31, 2024, approximately $\n5,552.7\n million principal amount of additional Evergy Metro mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage.\nEvergy Missouri West has issued mortgage bonds under the Evergy Missouri West Mortgage Indenture, establishing a first mortgage lien on substantially all of its present properties and certain after-acquired properties, subject to certain exceptions.

As of December 31, 2024, approximately $\n2,137.2\n million principal amount of additional Evergy Missouri West mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage.\nIn April 2024, Evergy Metro issued, at a discount, $\n300.0\n million of \n5.40\n% Mortgage Bonds, maturing in 2034.  Proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper and for general corporate purposes. \nIn May 2024, Evergy Missouri West issued, at a discount, $\n300.0\n million of \n5.65\n% FMBs, maturing in 2034.  Proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper and for general corporate purposes.  \nSenior Notes\nUnder the terms of the note purchase agreements for certain Evergy Missouri West senior notes, Evergy Missouri West is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio, as defined in the agreements, not greater than \n0.65\n to 1.00.  In addition, Evergy Missouri West's priority debt, as defined in the agreements, cannot exceed \n15\n% of consolidated tangible net worth, as defined in the agreements.  As of December 31, 2024, Evergy Missouri West was in compliance with these covenants.\nIn September 2024, Evergy, Inc. repaid its $\n800.0\n million of \n2.45\n% Senior Notes at maturity.\nConvertible Notes\nInterest on Evergy, Inc.'s $\n1.4\n billion of \n4.50\n% Convertible Notes (Convertible Notes) is payable semiannually, beginning June 2024.  The Convertible Notes will mature in December 2027, unless earlier converted or repurchased, but are not redeemable at the option of Evergy, Inc.  No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes.  The Convertible Notes are direct, senior unsecured obligations of Evergy, Inc. and rank equal in right of payment to any of Evergy, Inc.'s unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated, including Evergy, Inc.'s master revolving credit agreement that governs its senior unsecured revolving credit facility, its commercial paper \n131\nTable of Contents\n \nobligations and its \n2.9\n% Senior Notes due 2029.  The Convertible Notes are not guaranteed by any of Evergy, Inc.'s subsidiaries. \nHolders may convert their Convertible Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2027 only under the following circumstances:\na.\nDuring any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2024 (and only such calendar quarter), if the last reported sales price of Evergy, Inc. common stock for at least \n20\n trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of \n30\n consecutive trading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to \n130\n% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day;\nb.\nDuring the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (Measurement Period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than \n98\n% of the product of the last reported sale price of Evergy, Inc. common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or\nc.\nUpon the occurrence of specific corporate events specified in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes. \nOn or after September 15, 2027 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, a holder may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.  \nUpon conversion, Evergy, Inc. will pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be converted and pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of Evergy, Inc. common stock or a combination of cash and shares of Evergy, Inc. common stock, at Evergy, Inc.’s election, in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Convertible Notes being converted, as described in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes.  The Convertible Notes are initially convertible at a rate of \n16.1809\n shares of Evergy, Inc. common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $\n61.80\n per share of Evergy, Inc. common stock.  The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.  In addition, following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date, Evergy, Inc. will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their Convertible Notes in connection with such a corporate event.  If Evergy, Inc. undergoes a fundamental change, a holder may require Evergy, Inc. to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their Convertible Notes at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nSecuritized Bonds\nIn 2022, Evergy Missouri West created a special purpose subsidiary, Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding, a wholly-owned, bankruptcy remote entity solely for the purpose of recovering extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs incurred as part of the February 2021 winter weather event.  In February 2024, Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding issued, at a discount, $\n331.1\n million of \n5.10\n% Securitized Utility Tariff Bonds (Securitized Bonds) with a final payment scheduled for 2038, maturing in 2040.  The obligations of Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding's Securitized Bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in Evergy Missouri West's service territory.  Creditors of Evergy Missouri West have no recourse to any assets or revenues of Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding, and the bondholders have no recourse to the general credit of Evergy Missouri West.  See Note 4 for additional information regarding the February 2021 winter weather event securitization.  \nJunior Subordinated Notes\nIn December 2024, Evergy, Inc. issued $\n500.0\n million in aggregate principal amount of \n6.65\n% Fixed-to-Fixed Reset Rate Junior Subordinated Notes (Junior Subordinated Notes), maturing in 2055.  The Junior Subordinated Notes will bear interest (i) from and including December 5, 2024 to, but excluding, June 1, 2030 at the rate of \n6.65\n% per annum and (ii) from and including June 1, 2030, during each reset period at a rate per annum equal to the five-year U.S. Treasury rate (determined as described in the offering documents) as of the most recent reset interest \n132\nTable of Contents\n \ndetermination date plus a spread of \n2.558\n%, to be reset every five years until maturity.  At Evergy, Inc.'s option, it may redeem some or all of the Junior Subordinated Notes during specified periods, and upon the occurrence of certain ratings or tax events, all as described in the offering documents.  In accordance with terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes, Evergy, Inc. has the right, from time to time, to defer the payment of interest on the outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes on one or more occasions for up to 20 consecutive semi-annual interest payment periods.  As more fully described in the offering documents, deferring the payment of interest on outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes will restrict Evergy, Inc.'s ability to execute certain actions, such as declaring or paying dividends, purchasing Evergy, Inc. stock or repaying principal on any indebtedness of Evergy that ranks equally with or junior to the Junior Subordinated Notes.  \nScheduled Maturities\nEvergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's long-term debt maturities for the next five years are detailed in the following table.\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n(millions)\nEvergy\n$\n652.2\n \n$\n367.0\n \n$\n2,039.8\n \n$\n18.8\n \n$\n819.8\n \nEvergy Kansas Central\n250.0\n \n350.0\n \n321.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEvergy Metro\n350.0\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n13.  \nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nThe Evergy Companies engage in the wholesale and retail sale of electricity as part of their regulated electric operations, in addition to limited non-regulated energy marketing activities.  These activities expose the Evergy Companies to market risks associated with the price of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products.  Management has established risk management policies and strategies to reduce the potentially adverse effects that the volatility of the markets may have on the Evergy Companies' operating results. The Evergy Companies' commodity risk management activities, which are subject to the management, direction and control of an internal risk management committee, utilize derivative instruments to reduce the effects of fluctuations in wholesale sales and fuel and purchased power expense caused by commodity price volatility. \nThe Evergy Companies are also exposed to market risks arising from changes in interest rates and may use derivative instruments to manage these risks.  The Evergy Companies' interest rate risk management activities have included using derivative instruments to hedge against future interest rate fluctuations on anticipated debt issuances.  \nThe Evergy Companies also engage in non-regulated energy marketing activity for trading purposes, primarily at Evergy Kansas Central, which focuses on seizing market opportunities to create value driven by expected changes in the market prices of commodities, primarily electricity and natural gas.\nThe Evergy Companies consider various qualitative factors, such as contract and marketplace attributes, in designating derivative instruments at inception.  The Evergy Companies may elect the normal purchases and normal sales (NPNS) exception, which requires the effects of the derivative to be recorded when the underlying contract settles under accrual accounting.  The Evergy Companies account for derivative instruments that are not designated as NPNS primarily as either economic hedges or trading contracts (non-hedging derivatives) which are recorded as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value.  See Note 14 for additional information on the Evergy Companies' methods for assessing the fair value of derivative instruments.  Changes in the fair value of non-hedging derivatives that are related to the Evergy Companies' regulated operations are deferred to a regulatory asset or regulatory liability when determined to be probable of future recovery or refund from/to customers.  Recovery of the actual costs incurred by regulated activities will not impact earnings but will impact cash flows due to the timing of the recovery mechanism.  Cash flows for all derivative instruments are classified as operating activities on the Evergy Companies' statements of cash flows, with the exception of cash flows for interest rate swap agreements accounted for as cash flows hedges of forecasted debt transactions, which are recorded as financing activities.  Changes in the fair value of non-hedging derivatives that are not related to the Evergy Companies' regulated \n133\nTable of Contents\n \noperations are recorded in operating revenues on the Evergy Companies' statements of income and comprehensive income.  \nThe Evergy Companies offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments under master netting arrangements, which include rights to reclaim cash collateral (a receivable), or the obligation to return cash collateral (a payable).\nThe gross notional contract amount by commodity type for derivative instruments is summarized in the following table.\nDecember 31\nNon-hedging derivatives\nNotional volume unit of measure\n2024\n2023\nEvergy\n(millions)\nCommodity contracts\nPower\nMWhs\n51.3\n \n52.9\n \nNatural gas\nMMBtu\n598.7\n \n559.9\n \nEvergy Kansas Central\nCommodity contracts\nPower\nMWhs\n31.3\n \n32.1\n \nNatural gas\nMMBtu\n598.7\n \n558.7\n \nEvergy Metro\nCommodity contracts\nPower\nMWhs\n15.3\n \n15.1\n \nThe fair values of Evergy's open derivative positions and balance sheet classifications are summarized in the following tables.

The Evergy Companies maintain credit policies and employ credit risk mitigation, such as collateral requirements or letters of credit, when necessary to minimize their overall credit risk and monitor exposure.  Substantially all of the Evergy Companies' counterparty credit risk associated with derivative instruments relates to Evergy Kansas Central's non-regulated energy marketing activities.  As of December 31, 2024, if counterparty groups completely failed to perform on contracts, Evergy's and Evergy Kansas Central's maximum exposure related to derivative assets was $\n40.5\n million.  As of December 31, 2024, the potential loss after the consideration of applicable master netting arrangements and collateral received for Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central was $\n27.6\n million.\nCertain of the Evergy Companies' derivative instruments contain collateral provisions that are tied to the Evergy Companies' credit ratings and may require the posting of collateral for various reasons, including if the Evergy Companies' credit ratings were to fall below investment grade.  Substantially all of these derivative instruments relate to Evergy Kansas Central's non-regulated energy marketing activities.  The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position as of December 31, 2024, was $\n44.2\n million for which Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central have posted $\n2.5\n million collateral in the normal course of business.  If the credit-risk-related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered as of December 31, 2024, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central could be required to post an additional $\n41.7\n million of collateral to their counterparties.\n136\nTable of Contents\n \n14.  \nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nValues of Financial Instruments\nGAAP establishes a hierarchical framework for disclosing the transparency of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value.  Management's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.  In addition, the Evergy Companies measure certain investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value at NAV, which are not included in the fair value hierarchy.  Further explanation of these levels and NAV is summarized below.\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed on public exchanges or exchange-traded derivative instruments.\nLevel 2 –  Pricing inputs are not quoted prices in active markets but are either directly or indirectly observable.  The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 2 are certain marketable debt securities, financial instruments traded in less than active markets, non-exchange traded derivative instruments with observable forward curves and options contracts. \nLevel 3 – Significant inputs to pricing have little or no transparency.  The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring significant management judgment or estimation.  The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are non-exchange traded derivative instruments for which observable market data is not available to corroborate the valuation inputs and transmission congestion rights (TCRs) in the SPP Integrated Marketplace.\nNAV - Investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at NAV.  These investments do not consider the observability of inputs and, therefore, they are not included within the fair value hierarchy.  The Evergy Companies include in this category investments in private equity, real estate and alternative investment funds that do not have a readily determinable fair value.  The underlying alternative investments include collateralized debt obligations, mezzanine debt and a variety of other investments.\nThe Evergy Companies record cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and short-term borrowings on their consolidated balance sheets at cost, which approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. \nFair Value of Long-Term Debt\nThe Evergy Companies measure the fair value of long-term debt using Level 2 measurements available as of the measurement date.  \nThe book value and fair value of the Evergy Companies' long-term debt are summarized in the following table.\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nBook Value\nFair Value\nBook Value\nFair Value\nLong-term debt\n(a)\n(millions)\nEvergy\n(b)\n$\n12,460.9\n \n$\n11,535.0\n \n$\n11,853.3\n \n$\n11,044.9\n \nEvergy Kansas Central\n4,583.5\n \n4,031.7\n \n4,580.4\n \n4,176.6\n \nEvergy Metro\n3,223.4\n \n2,966.3\n \n2,924.4\n \n2,738.8\n \n(a) \nIncludes current maturities.\n(b) \nBook value as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, includes $\n81.7\n million and $\n87.0\n million, respectively, of fair value adjustments recorded in connection with purchase accounting for the merger that created Evergy, which are not part of future principal payments and will amortize over the remaining life of the associated debt instrument.\n137\nTable of Contents\n \nRecurring Fair Value Measurements\nThe following tables include balances of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nDescription\nDecember 31, 2024\nNetting\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nNAV\nEvergy Kansas Central\n(millions)\nAssets\nNuclear decommissioning trust\n(a)\nDomestic equity funds\n$\n142.9\n \n$\n— \n$\n134.0\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n8.9\n \nInternational equity funds\n81.6\n \n— \n81.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCore bond fund\n66.7\n \n— \n66.7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nHigh-yield bond fund\n33.7\n \n— \n33.7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEmerging markets bond fund\n20.6\n \n— \n20.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAlternative investments fund\n45.6\n \n— \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n45.6\n \nReal estate securities fund\n16.3\n \n— \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n16.3\n \nCash equivalents\n0.5\n \n— \n0.5\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal nuclear decommissioning trust\n407.9\n \n— \n337.1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n70.8\n \nRabbi trust\nFixed income funds\n14.6\n \n— \n14.6\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEquity funds\n6.9\n \n— \n6.9\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCombination debt/equity/other fund\n1.7\n \n— \n1.7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCash equivalents\n0.2\n \n— \n0.2\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal rabbi trust\n23.4\n \n— \n23.4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nDerivative instruments -

Management's assessment of these contingencies, which are based on federal and state statutes and regulations, and regulatory agency and judicial interpretations and actions, has evolved over time.  These laws, regulations, interpretations and actions can also change, restrict or otherwise impact the Evergy Companies' operations or financial results.  The failure to comply with these laws, regulations, interpretations and actions could result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the \n142\nTable of Contents\n \nimposition of remedial requirements.  The Evergy Companies believe that all their operations are in substantial compliance with current federal, state and local environmental standards.\nThere are a variety of final and proposed laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Evergy Companies' operations and consolidated financial results.  Due in part to the complex nature of environmental laws and regulations, the Evergy Companies are unable to assess the impact of potential changes that may develop with respect to the environmental contingencies described below.\nMercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS)\nIn April 2024, the EPA finalized a rule to tighten certain aspects of the MATS rule.  The EPA is lowering the emission limit for particulate matter (PM), requiring the use of PM continuous emissions monitors (CEMS) and lowering the mercury emission limit for lignite coal-fired electric generating units (EGUs).  The Evergy Companies' cost to comply is not expected to be material.\nOzone Interstate Transport State Implementation Plans (ITSIP)\nIn 2015, the EPA lowered the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) from 75 ppb to 70 ppb.  States were required to submit ITSIPs in 2018 to comply with the \"Good Neighbor Provision\" of the Clean Air Act (CAA) as it applies to the revised NAAQS.  The EPA did not act on these ITSIP submissions by the deadline established in the CAA and entered consent decrees establishing deadlines to take final action on various ITSIPs.  In February 2022, the EPA published a proposed rule to disapprove the ITSIPs submitted by nineteen states including Missouri and Oklahoma.  In April 2022, the EPA published an approval of the Kansas ITSIP in the Federal Register.  The Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) submitted a supplemental ITSIP to the EPA in November 2022.  In February 2023, the EPA published a final rule disapproving the ITSIPs submitted by nineteen states, including the final disapproval of the Missouri and Oklahoma ITSIPs.  In April 2023, the Attorneys General of Missouri and Oklahoma filed Petitions for Review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (Eighth Circuit) and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (Tenth Circuit), respectively, challenging the EPA's disapproval.  In May 2023, the Eighth Circuit granted a stay of the EPA's disapproval of the Missouri ITSIP.  Similarly, in July 2023, the Tenth Circuit granted a stay of the EPA's disapproval of the Oklahoma ITSIP.  In August 2024, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposed rule to disapprove the supplemental ITSIP that Missouri submitted in November 2022.  Due to uncertainty regarding the stays of the EPA's disapprovals of the Missouri and Oklahoma ITSIPs, the Evergy Companies are unable to accurately assess the impact on their operations or consolidated financial results, but the cost to comply could be material.  In January 2024, the EPA proposed to disapprove the ITSIP for Kansas and four other states.  The Kansas ITSIP was previously approved in April 2022.  The impact of the EPA's disapproval of the Kansas ITSIP could have a material impact on the Evergy Companies' operations.  \nOzone Interstate Transport Federal Implementation Plans (ITFIP)\nIn April 2022, the EPA published in the Federal Register the proposed ITFIP to resolve outstanding \"Good Neighbor\" obligations with respect to the 2015 Ozone NAAQS for twenty-six states including Missouri and Oklahoma.  This ITFIP would establish a revised Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) ozone season nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions trading program for EGUs beginning in 2023 and would limit ozone season NOx emissions from certain industrial stationary sources beginning in 2026.  The proposed rule would also establish a new daily backstop NOx emissions rate limit for applicable coal-fired units larger than 100 MW, as well as unit-specific NOx emission rate limits for certain industrial emission units and would feature \"dynamic\" adjustments of emission budgets for EGUs beginning with ozone season 2025.  The proposed ITFIP included reductions to the state ozone season NOx budgets for Missouri and Oklahoma beginning in 2023 with additional reductions in future years.  The Evergy Companies provided formal comments as part of the rulemaking process.  In March 2023, the EPA issued the final ITFIPs for twenty-three states, including Missouri and Oklahoma, which included reduced ozone season NOx budgets for EGUs in Missouri, Oklahoma and other states, and included other features and requirements that were in the proposed version of the rule.  Because the EPA's authority to impose an ITFIP for a state is triggered by the state's failure to submit an ITSIP addressing NAAQS by the statutory deadline or disapproval of an ITSIP, the EPA lacks authority under the Clean Air Act to impose an ITFIP on a state for which state implementation plan (SIP) disapprovals have been stayed by the courts.  Accordingly, the EPA issued interim final rules staying the effectiveness of the ITFIP in both Missouri and Oklahoma while the stays issued by the Eighth and Tenth Circuits \n143\nTable of Contents\n \nin the ITSIP disapproval cases remain in place.  During this time, both states will continue to operate under the existing CSAPR program.  While Kansas was not originally included in the ITFIP, in January 2024, the EPA issued a proposal to include Kansas in the ITFIP.  If finalized, the ITFIP for Kansas would become effective for the 2025 ozone season beginning in May 2025.  In June 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court issued an order granting emergency motions for stay filed by state and industry petitioners of the final ITFIP pending further review of the ITFIP by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (D.C. Circuit).  If the ITFIP ultimately takes effect for Missouri, Kansas and Oklahoma following the pending litigation, the impact on the Evergy Companies' operations and the cost to comply could be material.  \nParticulate Matter National Ambient Air Quality Standards\nIn March 2024, the EPA published in the Federal Register the final rule which strengthens the primary annual PM\n2.5 \n(particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in diameter) NAAQS.  The EPA is lowering the primary annual PM\n2.5\n NAAQS from 12.0 µg/m3 (micrograms per cubic meter) to 9.0 µg/m3.  The final rule took effect in May 2024.  In August 2024, the EPA released the PM\n2.5 \nambient monitor design values for calendar years 2021 through 2023.  These design values will be used by each state governor for recommending to the EPA attainment designations for their states.  In January 2025, Kansas proposed to designate the entire state of Kansas as either attainment or attainment/unclassifiable for the 2024 annual PM\n2.5\n NAAQS.  The EPA will issue final designations for all states, including Kansas, by February 2026.  Due to the uncertainty of the attainment status of portions of the service territory, the Evergy Companies are unable to accurately assess the impacts on their operations or consolidated financial results, but the cost to comply with lower PM\n2.5\n NAAQS could be material. \nRegional Haze Rule\nIn 1999, the EPA finalized the Regional Haze Rule which aims to restore national parks and wilderness areas to pristine conditions.  The rule requires states in coordination with the EPA, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and other interested parties to develop and implement air quality protection plans to reduce the pollution that causes visibility impairment.  There are 156 \"Class I\" areas across the U.S. that must be restored to pristine conditions by the year 2064.  There are no Class I areas in Kansas, whereas Missouri has two: the Hercules-Glades Wilderness Area and the Mingo Wilderness Area.  States must submit revisions to their Regional Haze Rule SIPs every ten years and the first round was due in 2007.  For the second ten-year implementation period, the EPA issued a final rule revision in 2017 that allowed states to submit their SIP revisions by July 2021.  \nThe Missouri SIP revision does not require any additional reductions from the Evergy Companies' generating units in the state.  MDNR submitted the Missouri SIP revision to the EPA in August 2022, however, they failed to do so by the EPA's revised submittal deadline in August 2022.  As a result, in August 2022, the EPA published \"finding of failure\" with respect to Missouri and fourteen other states for failing to submit their Regional Haze SIP revisions by the applicable deadline.  This finding of failure established a two-year deadline for the EPA to issue a Regional Haze federal implementation plan (FIP) for each state unless the state submits and the EPA approves a revised SIP that meets all applicable requirements before the EPA issues the FIP.  In July 2024, the EPA published in the Federal Register a proposal to partially approve and partially disapprove Missouri's Regional Haze SIP revision.  \nThe Kansas SIP revision did not include any additional emission reductions by electric utilities based on the significant reductions that were achieved during the first implementation period.  The Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) submitted the Kansas SIP revision in July 2021.  In August 2024, the EPA issued the final disapproval of the Kansas SIP revision for failing to conduct a four-factor analysis for at least two emission sources in Kansas.  If a Kansas generating unit of the Evergy Companies is selected for analysis, the possibility exists that the state or the EPA, through a revised SIP or a FIP, could determine that additional operational or physical modifications are required on the generating unit to further reduce emissions.  \nIf a Kansas or Missouri revised SIP or FIP is finalized, the overall costs of implementing the proposed rules could be material to the Evergy Companies.  \n144\nTable of Contents\n \nGreenhouse Gases\nBurning coal and other fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) and other gases referred to as greenhouse gases (GHG).  Various regulations under the CAA limit CO\n2\n and other GHG emissions, and in addition, other measures are being imposed or offered by individual states, municipalities and regional agreements with the goal of reducing GHG emissions.  In April 2024, the EPA finalized the GHG regulations and GHG guidelines that apply to new and existing fossil fuel fired EGUs.  The final GHG regulation establishes CO\n2\n limitations on emissions from new and reconstructed stationary combustion turbines.  The GHG guidelines set CO\n2\n emission limitations for existing coal, oil and gas-fired steam generating units.  For new and reconstructed stationary combustion turbines, the emission limitations were developed by applying the Best System of Emission Reduction (BSER) to three distinct subcategories (low load, intermediate load and base load) taking into consideration the annual capacity factor of the stationary combustion turbine.  For intermediate and base load stationary combustion turbines, BSER is assumed to be the utilization of highly efficient combustion turbine technology.  Base load stationary combustion turbines are also required to consider the emissions reduction associated with the application of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) beginning in 2032.  For existing coal-fired EGUs, the emission limitations were established by applying the BSER to two subcategories (medium and long-term).  For medium-term existing coal-fired units, which are units retiring between 2032 and 2038, the BSER established emission limitation is based on co-firing natural gas beginning in 2030.  For units operating in 2039 and after, BSER is the application of CCS starting in 2032.  In July 2024, the D.C. Circuit denied motions of stay filed by various states, industry and trade organizations; however, the D.C. Circuit has ordered expedited review of the challenges to the final regulations and guidelines.  In December 2024, a three judge panel of the D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments on challenges to the merits of the rule.  \nDue to uncertainty regarding the implementation of these final rules and ongoing judicial review, the Evergy Companies are unable to accurately assess the impacts on their operations or consolidated financial results, but the cost to comply could be material. \nWater\nThe Evergy Companies discharge some of the water used in generation and other operations containing substances deemed to be pollutants.  In April 2024, the EPA finalized an update to the Effluent Limitation Guidelines (ELG) for steam electric power generating facilities to address the vacated limitations and prior reviews of the existing rule.  Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) wastewater, bottom ash transport wastewater (BATW), coal residual leachate (CRL), and legacy wastewater are addressed in the rulemaking.  FGD wastewater, BATW and CRL at operating facilities are required to achieve zero liquid discharge as soon as feasible and no later than December 2029.  The Evergy Companies have reviewed the modifications to limitations on FGD wastewater and BATW and the Evergy Companies do not believe the impact to be material.  The Evergy Companies are reviewing the limitations on CRL, its impact on their operations and financial results and believe the cost to comply will not be material.  In June 2024, multiple legal challenges to the ELG were consolidated in the Eighth Circuit.  In October 2024, the Eighth Circuit denied a motion to stay the ELG.  Additional litigation is ongoing that could impact the timing or cost to comply.  \nRegulation of CCRs\nIn the course of operating their coal generation plants, the Evergy Companies produce CCRs, including fly ash, gypsum and bottom ash.  The EPA published a rule to regulate CCRs in April 2015 that requires additional CCR handling, processing and storage equipment and closure of certain ash disposal units.  In January 2022, the EPA published proposed determinations for facilities that filed closure extensions for unlined or clay-lined CCR units.  These proposed determinations include various interpretations of the CCR regulations and compliance expectations that may impact all owners of CCR units.  These interpretations could require modified compliance plans such as different methods of CCR unit closure.  Additionally, more stringent remediation requirements for units that are in corrective action or forced to go into corrective action are possible.  Legal challenges on issues associated with the January 2022 determinations are expected.  The cost to comply with these proposed determinations by the EPA could be material.\nIn April 2024, the EPA finalized an expansion to the CCR regulations focused on legacy surface impoundments and historic placements of CCR.  This regulation expands applicability of the 2015 CCR regulation to inactive landfills and beneficial use sites not previously regulated.  Litigation could impact the timing or cost to comply.  \n145\nTable of Contents\n \nThe Evergy Companies have recorded AROs for their current estimates for the closure of ash disposal ponds and landfills and recorded additional ARO liabilities in the second quarter of 2024 related to the April 2024 CCR regulation.  See Note 6 for additional information on AROs.  The revision of these AROs may be required in the future due to information collected in the April 2024 CCR regulation's Facility Evaluation Reports (FERs), changes in existing CCR regulations, the results of groundwater monitoring of CCR units or changes in interpretation of existing CCR regulations or changes in the timing or cost to close ash disposal ponds and landfills.  The revision of AROs for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through a regulatory asset.  If revisions to these AROs are necessary, the impact on the Evergy Companies' operations or consolidated financial results could be material.  \nMontrose Station CCRs\nIn January 2025, two lawsuits, including one seeking class certification, were filed in the Circuit Court of Henry County, Missouri against Evergy Metro and two other defendants alleging unspecified damages resulting from the defendants' alleged unlawful and negligent spreading of coal combustion residuals associated with the Montrose Station coal ash landfill.  Montrose Station was a coal-fired generating facility which was operated by Evergy Metro until its closure in 2018.  The cases are at preliminary stages and Evergy and Evergy Metro are unable to assess the outcome or reasonably estimate any possible damages with respect to the claims.  However, Evergy and Evergy Metro believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend themselves.  \nNuclear Insurance\nNuclear liability, property and accidental outage insurance is maintained for Wolf Creek.  These policies contain certain industry standard terms, conditions and exclusions, including, but not limited to, ordinary wear and tear and war.  An industry aggregate limit of $\n3.2\n billion for nuclear events ($\n1.8\n billion of non-nuclear events) plus any reinsurance, indemnity or any other source recoverable by Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), provider of property and accidental outage insurance, exists for acts of terrorism affecting Wolf Creek or any other NEIL insured plant within 12 months from the date of the first act.  In addition, participation is required in industry-wide retrospect assessment programs as discussed below.\nNuclear Liability Insurance\nPursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, liability insurance includes coverage against public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the required limit of public liability, which is approximately $\n16.3\n billion.  This limit of liability consists of the maximum available commercial insurance of $\n0.5\n billion and the remaining $\n15.8\n billion is provided through mandatory participation in an industry-wide retrospective assessment program.  Under this retrospective assessment program, the owners of Wolf Creek are jointly and severally subject to an assessment of up to $\n165.9\n million (Evergy's share is $\n156.0\n million and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $\n78.0\n million), payable at no more than $\n24.7\n million (Evergy's share is $\n23.2\n million and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $\n11.6\n million) per incident per year per reactor for any commercial U.S. nuclear reactor qualifying incident.  Both the total and yearly assessment is subject to an inflationary adjustment based on the Consumer Price Index and applicable premium taxes.  In addition, the U.S. Congress could impose additional revenue-raising measures to pay claims.\nNuclear Property and Accidental Outage Insurance\nThe owners of Wolf Creek carry decontamination liability, nuclear property damage and premature nuclear decommissioning liability insurance for Wolf Creek totaling approximately $\n2.8\n billion.  Insurance coverage for non-nuclear property damage accidents total approximately $\n1.0\n billion.  In the event of an extraordinary nuclear accident, insurance proceeds must first be used for reactor stabilization and site decontamination in accordance with a plan mandated by the NRC.  The Evergy Companies' share of any remaining proceeds can be used to pay for property damage or, if certain requirements are met, including decommissioning the plant, toward a shortfall in the nuclear decommissioning trust.  The owners also carry additional insurance with NEIL to help cover costs of replacement power and other extra expenses incurred during a prolonged outage resulting from accidental property damage at Wolf Creek.  If significant losses were incurred at any of the nuclear plants insured under the current NEIL policies, the owners of Wolf Creek may be subject to retrospective assessments under the current policies of approximately $\n26.1\n million (Evergy's share is $\n24.6\n million and each of Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's is $\n12.3\n million).\n146\nTable of Contents\n \nNuclear Insurance Considerations\nAlthough the Evergy Companies maintain various insurance policies to provide coverage for potential losses and liabilities resulting from an accident or an extended outage, the insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the costs that could result from a catastrophic accident or extended outage at Wolf Creek.  Any substantial losses not covered by insurance, to the extent not recoverable in prices, would have a material effect on the Evergy Companies' consolidated financial results.\nContractual Commitments - \nFuel and Power\nThe Evergy Companies' contractual commitments for fuel and power as of December 31, 2024 are detailed in the following tables.

Such agreements include, for example, guarantees and letters of credit.  These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiary's intended business purposes.  The majority of these agreements guarantee Evergy's own future performance, so a liability for the fair value of the obligation is not recorded.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Evergy has provided $\n794.0\n million of credit support for certain of its subsidiaries as follows:\n•\nEvergy direct guarantees to Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro counterparties for certain fuel supply contracts totaling $\n48.0\n million, which expire in 2027; and\n•\nEvergy's guarantee of Evergy Missouri West long-term debt totaling $\n746.0\n million, which includes debt with maturity dates ranging from 2025 to 2043.\n147\nTable of Contents\n \nNone of the guaranteed obligations are subject to default or prepayment if Evergy Missouri West's credit ratings were downgraded.\n17.  \nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS\nIn the normal course of business, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West engage in related party transactions with one another.  In addition, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West plan to engage in the construction of jointly-owned generation facilities.  See Note 1 for a discussion of future planned investments.  A summary of these related party transactions and the amounts associated with them is provided below.\nJointly-Owned Plants and Shared Services\nEmployees of Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro manage Evergy Missouri West's business and operate its facilities at cost, including Evergy Missouri West's \n18\n% ownership interest in Evergy Metro's Iatan Nos. 1 and 2.  Employees of Evergy Kansas Central manage Jeffrey Energy Center (JEC) and operate its facilities at cost, including Evergy Missouri West's \n8\n% ownership interest in JEC.

Income taxes for consolidated or combined subsidiaries are allocated to the subsidiaries based on separate company computations of income or loss.  \nThe following table summarizes Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's income taxes receivable from (payable to) Evergy.\nDecember 31\n2024\n2023\nEvergy Kansas Central\n(millions)\nIncome taxes receivable from Evergy\n$\n11.4\n \n$\n11.5\n \nEvergy Metro\nIncome taxes payable to Evergy\n$\n(\n10.0\n)\n$\n(\n6.8\n)\n18.  \nSHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\n \nEvergy's authorized capital stock consists of \n600\n million shares of common stock, without par value, and \n12\n million shares of Preference Stock, without par value.  \nEvergy Registration Statements\nIn August 2024, Evergy filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC.  Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, Evergy may issue debt and other securities, including common stock, in the future with the amounts, prices and terms to be determined at the time of future offerings.  The automatic registration statement was filed to replace a similar Form S-3 upon expiration of its three-year term.  The shelf registration statement expires in August 2027.  \nIn March 2024, Evergy registered shares of its common stock with the SEC for its Dividend Reinvestment and Direct Stock Purchase Plan.  Shares issued under the plan may be either newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market. \nEvergy has registered shares of its common stock with the SEC for the Evergy, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan.  Shares issued under the plan may be either newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market.  \nDividend Restrictions \nEvergy depends on its subsidiaries to pay dividends on its common stock.  The Evergy Companies have certain restrictions stemming from statutory requirements, corporate organizational documents, covenants and other conditions that could affect dividend levels or the ability to pay dividends.\nThe KCC order authorizing the merger transaction requires Evergy to maintain consolidated common equity of at least \n35\n% of total consolidated capitalization.\nUnder the Federal Power Act, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West generally can pay dividends only out of retained earnings.  Certain conditions in the MPSC and KCC orders authorizing the merger transaction also require Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro to maintain consolidated common equity of at least \n40\n% of total capitalization.  Other conditions in the MPSC and KCC merger orders require Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West to maintain credit ratings of at least investment grade.  If Evergy Kansas Central's, Evergy Metro's or Evergy Missouri West's credit ratings are downgraded below the investment grade level as a result of their affiliation with Evergy or any of Evergy's affiliates, the impacted utility shall not pay \n149\nTable of Contents\n \na dividend to Evergy without KCC or MPSC approval or until the impacted utility's investment grade credit rating has been restored. \nThe master credit facility of Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central, Evergy Metro and Evergy Missouri West and the note purchase agreements for certain Evergy Missouri West senior notes contain covenants requiring the respective company to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization ratio of not more than \n0.65\n to 1.00.  \nThe Evergy, Inc. Junior Subordinated Notes issued in December 2024 permit Evergy to defer the payment of interest under certain circumstances.  Making such an election would restrict Evergy's ability to declare or pay dividends, among other restrictions.  As of December 31, 2024, Evergy has not elected to defer the payment of interest under the terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes.  See Note 12 for additional information regarding the Junior Subordinated Notes.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, Evergy's retained earnings and net income were free of restrictions, Evergy Kansas Central had a retained earnings restriction of $\n290.5\n million and Evergy Metro had a retained earnings restriction of $\n464.9\n million.  As of December 31, 2024, Evergy's subsidiaries had restricted net assets of approximately $\n6.3\n billion.  These restrictions are not expected to affect the Evergy Companies' ability to pay dividends at the current level for the foreseeable future.\n19. \nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nIn determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Evergy Companies assess the entity's purpose and design, including the nature of the entity's activities and the risks that the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders.  A reporting enterprise is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE.  \nAll involvement with entities by the Evergy Companies is assessed to determine whether such entities are VIEs and, if so, whether or not the Evergy Companies are the primary beneficiaries of the entities.  The Evergy Companies also continuously assess whether they are the primary beneficiary of the VIE with which they are involved.  Prospective changes in facts and circumstances may cause identification of the primary beneficiary to be reconsidered.\nEvergy Missouri West Storm Funding\nIn 2022, Evergy Missouri West created Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding solely for the purpose of recovering extraordinary fuel and purchased power costs incurred as part of the February 2021 winter weather event.  In February 2024, Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding issued, at a discount, $\n331.1\n million of \n5.10\n% Securitized Bonds with a final payment scheduled for 2038, maturing in 2040.  The obligations of Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding's Securitized Bonds are repaid through charges imposed on customers in Evergy Missouri West's service territory and collected by Evergy Missouri West on behalf of Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding.  Creditors of Evergy Missouri West have no recourse to any assets or revenues of Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding, and the bondholders have no recourse to the general credit of Evergy Missouri West.  See Note 4 for additional information regarding the February 2021 winter weather event securitization.  \nEvergy Missouri West Storm Funding is considered a VIE.  Evergy Missouri West is the primary beneficiary of the VIE primarily because, as described above, Evergy Missouri West has the power to direct the activities of Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding that most significantly impact economic performance and Evergy Missouri West has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding that could potentially be significant.  Therefore, Evergy Missouri West consolidates Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding.  \n150\nTable of Contents\n \nThe following table summarizes the impact of Evergy Missouri West Storm Funding on Evergy's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024.  There was no impact on Evergy's consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023.\nDecember 31\n2024\nEvergy\n(millions)\nCurrent assets\nRegulatory assets\n$\n15.9\n \nOther \n5.4\n \nOther assets\nRegulatory assets\n294.5\n \nOther\n1.7\n \nCurrent liabilities\nCurrent maturities of long-term debt\n16.2\n \nAccrued interest\n1.3\n \nLong-term liabilities\nLong-term debt, net\n295.7\n \n50\n% Interest in La Cygne Unit 2\nUnder an agreement that expires in September 2029, Evergy Kansas Central entered into a sale-leaseback transaction with a trust under which the trust purchased Evergy Kansas Central's \n50\n% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and subsequently leased it back to Evergy Kansas Central.  The trust was financed with an equity contribution from an owner participant and debt issued by the trust.  The trust was created specifically to purchase the \n50\n% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and lease it back to Evergy Kansas Central and does not hold any other assets.  Evergy Kansas Central meets the requirements to be considered the primary beneficiary of the trust.  In determining the primary beneficiary of the trust, Evergy Kansas Central concluded that the activities of the trust that most significantly impact its economic performance and that Evergy Kansas Central has the power to direct include (1) the operation and maintenance of the \n50\n% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 and (2) Evergy Kansas Central's ability to exercise a purchase option at the end of the agreement at the lesser of fair value or a fixed amount.  Evergy Kansas Central has the potential to receive benefits from the trust that could potentially be significant if the fair value of the \n50\n% interest in La Cygne Unit 2 at the end of the agreement is greater than the fixed amount.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central recorded $\n126.5\n million and $\n133.6\n million, respectively, to property, plant and equipment, net, on their consolidated balance sheets related to the VIE described above.\nThe assets of the VIE can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and the VIE's debt holders have no recourse to the general credit of Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central.  Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central have not provided financial or other support to the VIE and are not required to provide such support.  Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central did not record any gain or loss upon the initial consolidation of the VIE.\n151\nTable of Contents\n \n20.  \nTAXES\nComponents of income tax expense are detailed in

million and $\n284.1\n million, respectively, of federal general business income tax credit carryforwards.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Evergy Kansas Central had $\n291.6\n million and $\n237.9\n million, respectively, of federal general business income tax credit carryforwards.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Evergy Metro had $\n95.3\n million and $\n43.6\n million, respectively, of federal general business income tax credit carryforwards.  The carryforwards for Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro relate primarily to PTCs and research and development tax credits and expire in the years 2025 to 2044.  Approximately $\n0.1\n million of Evergy's credits are related to Low Income Housing credits that were acquired in the acquisition of Evergy Missouri West.\nThe Evergy Companies' federal general business income tax credit carryforwards include PTCs related to the generation of electricity from nuclear energy.  As of December 31, 2024, Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro had $\n132.3\n million, $\n65.1\n million and $\n67.2\n million, respectively, of nuclear energy PTCs.  Beginning in 2024, nuclear units, including Wolf Creek, are eligible for a production tax credit through 2032.  The credit is for $\n15.00\n per MWh and is subject to a phase-out when gross receipts from the facility are between $\n25.00\n per MWh and $\n43.75\n per MWh.  The credit may be used to offset Evergy's income tax liability or be transferred to an unrelated third party.  The Evergy Companies have estimated the credit based on the existing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) regulations.  The IRS is expected to provide guidance regarding the type of revenue to be included in the computation of gross receipts in 2025 and any changes would be reflected subsequently in the estimate.  The \n154\nTable of Contents\n \nEvergy Companies have recorded a regulatory liability for these tax credits as the benefits are expected to be returned to customers as a reduction to revenue in future regulatory proceedings.  \nThe year of origin of Evergy's, Evergy Kansas Central's and Evergy Metro's related tax benefit amounts for federal tax credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2024 are detailed in the following table.\nAmount of Benefit\nYear of Origin\nEvergy\nEvergy Kansas Central\nEvergy Metro\n(millions)\n2007\n$\n0.1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n2018\n2.1\n \n2.0\n \n0.1\n \n2019\n37.7\n \n30.8\n \n6.7\n \n2020\n35.9\n \n28.5\n \n7.2\n \n2021\n31.7\n \n28.1\n \n3.5\n \n2022\n34.7\n \n31.7\n \n2.6\n \n2023\n49.8\n \n45.3\n \n4.3\n \n2024\n196.3\n \n125.2\n \n70.9\n \n$\n388.3\n \n$\n291.6\n \n$\n95.3\n \nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Evergy had $\n4.9\n million and $\n4.8\n million of tax benefits, respectively, related to state income tax credit carryforwards.  As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Evergy Kansas Central had $\n4.9\n million and $\n4.8\n million of tax benefits, respectively, related to state income tax credit carryforwards.  The state income tax credits relate primarily to the Kansas high performance incentive program tax credits and expire in the years 2038 to 2039.  Due to the elimination of the Kansas corporate income tax for utilities, Evergy and Evergy Kansas Central expect a portion of these state NOL carryforwards to expire unutilized and have provided a valuation allowance against $\n2.7\n million of the state tax benefits.  \nNet Operating Loss Carryforwards\nAs of December 31, 2023, Evergy had $\n17.2\n million of tax benefits related to federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards.  Any unutilized federal NOL carryforwards expired in 2024.  \nIn addition, Evergy also had deferred tax benefits of $\n4.4\n million\n \nand $\n5.3\n million related to state NOLs as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.  The state NOL carryforwards expire in years 2025 to 2042.  Evergy does not expect to utilize $\n4.2\n million of NOLs before the expiration date of the carryforwards of NOLs in certain states.  Therefore, a valuation allowance has been provided against $\n4.2\n million of state tax benefits.\nValuation Allowances\nEvergy is required to assess the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets using a \"more likely than not\" assessment threshold.  This assessment takes into consideration tax planning strategies within Evergy's control.  As a result of this assessment, Evergy has established a partial valuation allowance for state tax NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.  During 2024, $\n7.9\n million of tax benefits was recorded in continuing operations primarily related to federal and state NOLs that expired.  The tax benefits were offset by the reduction in related deferred tax assets.    \nUncertain Tax Positions\nEvergy is considered open to U.S. federal examination for years after 2009 due to the carryforward of net operating losses and general business income tax credits.  With few exceptions, Evergy is no longer subject to state and local tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2021.  As of December 31, 2024, Evergy does not have any significant income tax issues under examination and does not have any uncertain tax positions recorded.\n \n155\nTable of Contents\n \n21. \nLEASES\nThe Evergy Companies lease office buildings, computer equipment, vehicles, rail cars, generating plant and other property and equipment, including rail cars to serve jointly-owned generating units where Evergy Kansas Central or Evergy Metro is the managing partner and is reimbursed by other joint-owners for the other owners' proportionate share of the costs. \n \nUnder GAAP, a contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration.  The Evergy Companies assess a contract as being or containing a lease if the contract identifies property, plant and equipment, provides the lessee the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the property, plant and equipment and provides the lessee the right to direct the use of the property, plant and equipment. \nThe Evergy Companies have entered into several agreements to purchase energy through renewable purchase power agreements that are accounted for as leases that commenced prior to the application of \nTopic 842-Leases\n.\n \n Due to the intermittent nature of renewable generation, these leases have significant variable lease payments not included in the initial and subsequent measurement of the lease liability.  Variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.  In addition, certain other contracts contain payment for activity that transfers a separate good or service such as utilities or common area maintenance.  The Evergy Companies have elected a practical expedient permitted by GAAP to not separate such components of the lease from other lease components for all leases.\nThe Evergy, Evergy Kansas Central and Evergy Metro leases have remaining terms ranging from \n1\n to \n14\n years, \n1\n to \n14\n years and \n1\n to \n9\n years, respectively.  Leases that have original lease terms of twelve months or less are not recognized on the Evergy Companies’ balance sheets. \n \nSome leases have options to renew the lease or terminate early at the election of the Evergy Companies.  Judgment is applied at lease commencement to determine the reasonably certain lease term based on then-current assumptions about use of the leased asset, market conditions and terms in the contract. \n \nThe judgment applied to determine the lease term can significantly impact the measurement of the lease liability and right-of-use asset and lease classification.\nThe Evergy Companies typically discount lease payments over the term of the lease using their incremental borrowing rates at lease commencement to measure its initial and subsequent lease liability.  For leases that existed at the initial application of Topic 842, the Evergy Companies used the incremental borrowing rates that corresponded to the remaining lease term as of January 1, 2019.\nLeases may be classified as either operating leases or finance leases.  The lease classification is based on assumptions of the lease term and discount rate, as discussed above, and the fair market value and economic life of the leased asset.  Operating leases recognize a consistent expense each period over the lease term, while finance leases will result in the separate presentation of interest expense on the lease liability and amortization of the right-of-use asset.  Finance leases are treated as operating leases for rate-making purposes and as such, the Evergy Companies defer to a regulatory asset or liability any material differences between expense recognition and the timing of payments in order to match what is being recovered in customer rates.\nThe Evergy Companies' lease expense is detailed in the following tables.\nEvergy\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFinance

In addition, the disclosure controls and procedures provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated to management, including to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, allowing timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Evergy carried out an evaluation of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act).  This evaluation was conducted under the supervision, and with the \n160\nTable of Contents\n \nparticipation, of Evergy's management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, and Evergy's disclosure committee.  Based upon this evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Evergy have concluded as of the end of the period covered by this report that the disclosure controls and procedures of Evergy were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in Evergy's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarterly period ended December 31, 2024, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) for Evergy.  Under the supervision and with the participation of Evergy’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, management evaluated the effectiveness of Evergy’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.  Management used for this evaluation the framework in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission.\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.  Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, Evergy’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria set forth in the COSO framework.  Deloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K, has issued its attestation report on Evergy’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included below.\n161\nTable of Contents\n \nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM \nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Evergy, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Evergy, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedules as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, of the Company and our report dated February 26, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.  We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nKansas City, Missouri  \nFebruary 26, 2025 \n162\nTable of Contents\n \nEVERGY KANSAS CENTRAL\nDisclosure Controls and Procedures\nEvergy Kansas Central maintains a set of disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.
