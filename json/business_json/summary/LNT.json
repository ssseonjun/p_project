The EPA enacted the final Section 111(d) rule under the CAA for certain fossil-fueled EGUs in May 2024 .\n In 2015, the EPA published final standards under Section 111(b) of the CAA, which establish CO2 emissions limits for certain new fossil-fueled EGUs . The final rule does not apply to EGUs that are retired by January 2032 . If WPL’s coal-fired Columbia Energy Center is retired by the end of 2029, the final rule would not be applicable; however, if WPL converts Columbia Unit 1 and/or Unit 2 to natural gas, then the rule would be applicable .\n Cross-State Air Pollution Rule is a regional sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides cap-and-trade program . Compliance with emission limits may be achieved by purchasing emission allowances and/or reducing emissions through changes in operations or the additions of environmental controls . In 2023, the EPA finalized revisions to the CSAPR state-specific ozone season nitrogen Oxides emission caps and utility-specific emission allowances for certain states, including Wisconsin, beginning in 2023; however, these revisions were stayed by the Supreme Court in June 2024 .\n In December 2024, the EPA proposed updates to the NSPS for combustion turbines built, reconstructed, or modified after December 13, 2024 .
