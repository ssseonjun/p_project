  "item1_summary": " The quick service restaurant (“QSR”) pizza category and the food service and food delivery markets in general are highly competitive . Domino’s may continue to experience increased competition from existing or new companies in the delivery and carryout pizza categories, in addition to competition from order and delivery aggregators .\n The overall food service market, food delivery market and the QSR market are intensely competitive with respect to food quality, price, service, image, convenience and concept . The Company saw an increase in sales in certain markets, including within the U.S., at times in recent years . Future sales are not possible to estimate, and it is unclear what future sales will be .\n Our supply chain segment is also subject to competition from outside suppliers . U.S. franchisees are not required to purchase food and other products from us . If other suppliers offer lower prices or better service to our franchisees, our financial condition, business and results of operations would be adversely affected . We may not be able to execute our strategy to achieve our planned growth targe, which includes opening new stores and generating more sales .\n We and our franchisees face many challenges in opening new stores, including construction, permitting or development delays . Failure to add new stores or closures of existing stores would impact global retail sales and adversely affect our ability to increase revenues and operating income . The success of new stores depend in large part on the availability of suitable store sites and leases .\n As we continue to expand, we or our franchisees may not experience the gross margins we expect, our results of operations may be negatively impacted, and our stock price may decline . We expect to continue our strategy of building additional stores in markets and regions where we have existing stores . This strategy could also result in store closures if executed too rapidly, as seen in certain international markets in recent years .\n There have been and may continue to be significant increases in food costs and labor costs, which have impacted and could further impact our profitability and that of our franchisees . Economic conditions, including the inflationary pressures seen in recent years, may also impact the discretionary purchasing power of our customers, especially customers with less disposable income .\n Pizza Pizza Pizza Co. may not be able to pass on increased costs to customers or franchisees . Cheese, particularly cheese, is a significant cost to us, representing approximately 25% of the food basket purchased by our Company-owned stores . The company has experienced increased volatility in prices for some ingredients in recent years .\n Labor costs are largely a function of the minimum wage for a majority of our and our franchisees’ store personnel and certain supply chain center personnel . As more jurisdictions implement minimum wage increases, we expect that labor costs will continue to increase . Federal, state and local proposals that increase minimum wage requirements or mandate other employee matters could, to the extent implemented, materially increase labor and other costs .\n Labor costs and food costs, including cheese, generally represent approximately 55% to 65% of the sales at a typical Company-owned store . If a significant portion of our or our franchisees’ employees were to become unionized, labor costs could increase . Shortages, interruptions or disruptions in the supply of fresh food products and store equipment could adversely affect our operating results .\n The food service market is affected by consumer preferences and perceptions, which may reduce sales and harm our business . Climate change could increase the frequency and duration of weather impacts on our operations . The preferences of customers also may change as a result of advances in technology or alternative delivery methods or channels . If we are not able to respond to these changes, or our competitors respond to them more effectively than us, our operating results could be adversely affected .\n Reports of product contamination, illnesses and injuries caused by food tampering have in the past severely injured the reputations and operating results of participants in the QSR market . Social media has dramatically increased the rate at which negative publicity, including as it relates to food-borne illness, can be disseminated before there is any meaningful opportunity to respond to an issue .\n A decrease in sales due to these health concerns, any negative publicity or as a result of the closure of any Domino’s stores could adversely affect our results of operations . The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the ability of our supply chain centers to deliver necessary products to our stores and those of our franchisees .\n Our financial condition and results of operations have at times been and may in the future be adversely affected if global markets in which our franchised stores compete are affected by changes in political, economic or other factors . These factors, many over which neither we nor our master franchisees have control, may include both internal and external factors .\n A significant portion of our earnings comes from royalties and fees generated by our franchise stores . An increase in tariffs, such as the tariffs announced on February 1, 2025 on imports to the United States from Canada and Mexico, could disrupt and increase the costs of our supply chains and those of our master franchisees in relation to certain products that we and they source internationally .\n Domino’s success depends in part on continuing positive relationships with its franchisees . If those relationships were to deteriorate, our revenues and stock price could decline . Our international master franchisees are generally responsible for the development of significantly more stores than our U.S. franchisees. Our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our US operations .\n The use of social media platforms and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination . Failure to use or respond to social media campaigns effectively could lead to a decline in brand value and revenue . Negative publicity related to our brand, products, operations, or stores could harm our business, brand, reputation, marketing partners, financial condition and results of operations .\n From March 27, 2023 through March 24, 2024, the Company effectuated a temporary reduction of 0.25% to its standard 6.0% advertising contribution . The lack of continued financial support for advertising activities or a limitation on our ability to advertise certain offers could significantly curtail our marketing efforts, which may in turn affect our business and our operating results .\n The loss of these employees or our inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel, including general managers or other store-level team members, could adversely affect our operating results . We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, domain names, patents, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products . The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks to capitalize on our name recognition .\n Some countries’ laws do not protect unregistered trademarks at all, or make them more difficult to enforce . Third parties may have filed for “Domino’s” or similar marks in countries where Domino's has not registered its brand for reasons including lack of presence by the brand where actual use is required to obtain trademark registration .\n Many retailers and other companies have recently experienced serious cyber incidents and breaches of their information technology systems . As our reliance on technology has increased, so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those we have outsourced . The primary risks that could directly result from the occurrence of a cyber incident include operational interruption, damage to our relationships with customers, franchisees and employees .\n The failure of our suppliers, aggregators and other third parties to maintain adequate controls or comply with our expectations and standards could have a material adverse effect on our business . Artificial intelligence (“AI”) technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks . The rapid evolution and increased adoption of AI technologies amplifies these concerns .\n The failure of these systems to operate effectively, stemming from maintenance problems, upgrading or transitioning to new platforms, a compromise in our security or other unanticipated problems has at times in the past and in the future could result in interruptions to or delays in our and our franchisees’ operations, and some of our systems are not fully redundant .\n Cyber-attacks and data breaches at a payment processing contractor could compromise confidential information or adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers . More than 85% of our U.S. retail sales in 2024 were derived from digital channels, primarily through our online ordering website and mobile applications, where customers enter personally identifiable information that we retain .\n As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure that we are in compliance with those laws . Our security and information systems are compromised or if we, our employees or franchisees fail to comply with these laws, regulations or contract terms, it could require us to notify customers, employees or other groups . This could result in adverse publicity, loss of sales and cash flows, increased fees payable to third parties .\n We may pursue certain technologies and consumer offerings if we believe they offer a sustainable customer proposition and can be successfully integrated into our business model . We cannot predict consumer acceptance of these delivery channels or their impact on our business . Alternative methods of delivery may also impact the potential labor pool from which we recruit our delivery drivers and could reduce the available supply of labor .\n We are subject to a variety of additional risks associated with our franchise system and franchisees . These risks include the application of local, state, federal and foreign bankruptcy laws and the impact such laws could have on our ability to collect payments and fees under applicable franchise agreements . Such risks may also apply to us as owners of stores .\n Those parties are either not covered by the franchisee’s insurance or exceed the policy limits . Those parties include parties not covered or exceed policy limits of the insurance . Those relating to product liability exposure, noncompliance with labor and safety regulations and the impact such events could have on a franchisee's ability to make payments under applicable franchise agreements .\n We maintain insurance coverage for workers’ compensation, general liability and owned and non-owned automobile liabilities . Insurance premiums for such coverage may increase and we may not be able to obtain insurance at acceptable rates, or at all . Total insurance limits under these retention programs vary depending upon the period covered and range up to $112.5 million per occurrence for general liability .\n We have established significant commitments on greenhouse gas emissions and in October 2024 our near-term and net zero targets were approved by the Science Based Targets initiative . Execution of these strategies and achievement of these goals are subject to risks and uncertainties . Failure to achieve our goals could damage our reputation and customer, investor and other stakeholder relationships and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as on our stock price .\n As of December 29, 2024, our consolidated total indebtedness was approximately $4.98 billion . We may also incur additional debt, which would not be prohibited under the terms of our current securitized debt agreements . Failure or perceived failure by us to manage ESG issues could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and on our business, results of operations, financial condition or stock price .\n Our 2021 and 2022 Variable Funding Notes bear interest at fluctuating interest rates that in certain circumstances is based on a forward-looking term rate based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“Term SOFR”) There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (the New York Fed) will continue the publication of Term SOFR .\n There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding indebtedness will remain in effect for any given period of time . A downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things, increase our cost of borrowing, limit our ability to access capital or result in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur .\n The terms of our securitized debt financing of certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries have restrictive terms . Failure to comply with any of these terms could put us in default, which would have an adverse effect on our business and prospects . If we are unable to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, our business may be harmed .\n A breach of these covenants could result in a rapid amortization event or default under the securitized debt . No assurance can be given that any refinancing or additional financing will be possible when needed . The payment of principal on the outstanding senior notes may be suspended if the Holdco Leverage Ratio for the Company is less than or equal to 5.0x total debt to Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA .\n There can be no assurance that market conditions will be favorable at the times that we require new or additional financing . The indenture governing the securitized debt will restrict the cash flow from the entities subject to the . securitization to any of our other entities and upon the occurrence of certain events, cash flow would be further restricted . The funds available to us would be reduced or eliminated, which would in turn reduce our ability to operate or grow our business .\n State attorney general offices or other regulators have initiated and may in the future initiate investigations or enforcement actions against us . We and our international master franchisees have been and continue to be subject to these types of claims . If one or more of these claims were to be successful, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed . Failure to comply with existing or increased laws and regulations could adversely affect our business .\n It is uncertain how the policy priorities and initiatives of the new administration may impact the federal laws and regulations to which we are subject . We are subject to an FTC rule and to various state and foreign laws that govern the offer and sale of franchises . Failure to comply with these laws could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales, fines or other penalties .\n Franchisors may be subject to claims that their franchisees should be treated as employees . The California legislature has enacted a statute known as Assembly Bill 5 (AB-5), which went into effect on January 1, 2020 . AB-5 requires “gig economy” workers to be reclassified as employees instead of independent contractors . If a broader rule is ultimately enacted or adopted by the NLRB or other government agencies, it could cause us to be liable .\n California voters approved proposition 22 to exempt app-based transportation (ride shares) and delivery drivers from the application of AB-5 . The ballot measure does not affect how AB- 5 applies to other businesses and workers . AB--5 could be liable to franchisees based on the rights and remedies available to employees under such laws .\n Federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations on immigration and labor organizations may adversely impact the availability and costs of labor for Domino’s and franchisees’ stores in a particular area or across the United States . Domino's: Higher minimum wage standards may increase the price of goods and services they supply to us .\n On July 29, 2021, the Department of Labor issued a final rule rescinding the 2020 rule . The rules are separate from the joint employer standard under the NLRA or potential liability as a joint employer . The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the “Affordable Care Act”) requires employers such as us to provide health insurance .\n The majority of the increases in these costs began in 2015, and while the incremental costs of this program have not been material to us to date, we cannot predict what effect these costs will have on our results of operations and financial position . Changes in tax laws or tax policy more broadly, increases in enacted tax rates, adverse outcomes in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could also impact our financial condition .\n A hypothetical 10% adverse change in the foreign currency rates in our international markets would have resulted in a negative impact on international royalty revenues of approximately $28.2 million in 2024 . Unfavorable currency fluctuations could lead to increased prices to customers outside the U.S. or lower profitability to our franchisees . We operate dough manufacturing and distribution facilities in Canada, which generate revenues denominated in Canadian dollars .\n The Company’s entire Board of Directors is engaged in risk management oversight, including the oversight of risks from cybersecurity threats . We anticipate that fluctuations in operating results will continue in the future, and such fluctuations may result in significant fluctuations or a significant decline in our stock price . Cybersecurity and related matters are a recurring topic at meetings of the Audit Committee and the  Audit Committee .\n Company’s Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer (“CTO) and Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) provide updates to the Enterprise Risk Committee at multiple Audit Committee meetings each year . These updates include both qualitative and quantitative information on the effectiveness of the Company's cybersecurity controls . The CISO has multiple decades of experience in the cybersecurity and information security fields .\n Domino’s maintains a comprehensive information security program with a dedicated team that is responsible for directing, coordinating, planning and organizing information security activities throughout the Company . The Company leverages a combination of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework and the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls .\n Domino’s has been certified as compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (“PCI DSS”) standards . The company also has a dedicated Security Operations Center (SOC) team that is responsible for quickly identifying and treating events that could pose risk to its technology environments .\n Cyber incident techniques change frequently, may not immediately be recognized and can originate from a wide variety of sources . The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by others, including by the Company’s service providers . There has been an increase in the sophistication and sophistication of the data security threats the Company and these vendors and service providers face, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generally .\n Cyber incidents could negatively impact our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of confidential information, or damage to our employee and business relationships . isk Factors – The occurrence of cyber incidents, or a deficiency in cybersecurity, could negatively affect our business . for further information. isk factors ."
