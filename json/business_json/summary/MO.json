  "item1_summary": " This Form 10-K contains statements concerning our expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance and other statements that are not historical facts . We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement will be realized . Achievement of future results is subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate . If risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, actual results could differ from those anticipated .\n The willingness of adult tobacco consumers to purchase premium brands is affected by macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and overall economic stability . We may be unsuccessful in anticipating and responding to changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences and purchase behavior . We elaborate on these important factors and risks we face throughout this Form 10-K, particularly in the “Executive Summary” and “Business Environment” sections preceding our discussion of the operating results of our segments .\n The primary impacts of these conditions include  higher than expected domestic cigarette industry volume declines and declines in pod-based product volume within the e-vapor category . The inability of our operating companies to sufficiently increase the prices of their premium products to offset volume declines from consumers down-trading to lower-priced competitive brands could have a material adverse effect on our business .\n Significant competition exists with respect to product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging, distribution and promotional activities . Failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position and our ability to achieve our Vision. The growth of innovative tobacco products, including legal and illicit e-vapor products, has contributed to reductions in the consumption levels and industry sales volumes of cigarettes and other tobacco products .\n PM USA faces competition from lower-priced brands sold by certain U.S. and foreign manufacturers that have cost advantages because they are not parties to settlements of certain healthcare cost recovery litigation in the United States . As such, they're not required to make annual settlement payments as required by the parties to the settlements . These settlement payments, which are inflation-adjusted, are significant for PM USA and have contributed to substantial cigarette price increases .\n In January 2025, in a patent lawsuit, the ITC imposed bans on the importation of NJOY ACE products into the United States . The ITC’s decision to impose these restrictions is currently under a 60-day review by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which could approve or reject the decision . We have plans to commercialize next generation NJOY products once regulatory authorizations are received .\n The success of Horizon, our joint venture with JTIUH for the marketing and commercialization of HTS products in the United States, is dependent upon a number of factors . s will take effect on March 31, 2025 or earlier if the Trade Representative notifies the ITC of approval before the 60 days elapse .\n If we do not succeed in commercializing innovative tobacco products that appeal to adult tobacco consumers, we could be at a competitive disadvantage . Illicit trade can take many forms, including the sale of tobacco products intended for sale outside the U.S. and the diversion into one taxing jurisdiction for sale in another country . Counterfeit versions of our products can negatively affect consumer experiences .\n In the e-vapor category, illicit flavored disposable product usage has significantly increased . The impacts of this dynamic include declines in pod-based e-Vapor product volume and increased cross-category movement among adult cigarette smokers . Recent enforcement actions by regulatory agencies have not had a material impact in curbing the proliferation and sale of illicit .\n FDA’s failure to take meaningful enforcement actions against manufacturers and products that violate the law could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position . Failure to complete or manage strategic transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments in third parties, or realize the anticipated benefits of such transactions .\n We may not be able to realize the expected benefits of the NJOY Transaction in the expected manner or timeframe, if at all, including due to failure to receive or maintain regulatory authorizations, changes in adult tobacco consumer preferences, failure to comply with regulatory requirements, prevailing economic, market, regulatory or business conditions, or changes in such conditions negatively affecting our business .\n As consumer demand increases for innovative smoke-free products and decreases for combustible and MST products, the volume of tobacco leaf required for production of these products has decreased . Reduced demand for tobacco leaf may result in the reduced supply and availability of domestic tobacco and increased costs, as growers divert resources to other crops or cease farming .\n The nicotine used in our innovative tobacco products is extracted from tobacco produced in one country . As consumer demand increases for innovative products, the volume of raw materials, ingredients and component parts required for the production of these products has decreased . Reduced demand for raw materials may reduce supply and availability and increase the cost of materials .\n Government taxes, restrictions and prohibitions on the sale and use of certain products may limit access to, and increase the costs of, raw materials and component parts . If we are unable to identify alternate sources of raw materials, ingredients and . component parts for our operating companies’ products, we could be exposed to supply risk .\n Our operating companies face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant manufacturing facilities and a small number of key suppliers, distributors and distribution chain service providers . A natural or man-made disaster, cybersecurity incident, global pandemic, labor disruption or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of our operating companies . Operations could be suspended temporarily once or multiple times, or halted permanently, depending on various factors .\n This calculation may be affected by several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, the proliferation of illicit products, government actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction, changes in category growth (decline) rates . Certain events also can trigger an immediate review of intangible assets . The impairment was the result of the decrease in the fair value of the .-Skoal-centric trademark caused by decreases in the size of the MST products category .\n In January 2025, in a patent lawsuit, the ITC imposed bans on the importation of                 NJOY ACE vapor products into the United States and the sale and marketing of products previously imported into the U.S. vapor products . In October 2024, we announced the multi-phase Initiative, through which we plan to increase our organization’s speed, efficiency and effectiveness by centralizing work .\n The expected savings associated with the Initiative may be offset to some extent by business disruption during the implementation phase . Many of the tasks that will be outsourced will be performed in developing countries that may be at a heightened risk for geopolitical uncertainty . The Initiative may lead to a loss of control and oversight of outsourced functions, which could weaken our existing internal control over financial reporting .\n An epidemic, pandemic or other significant public health emergency, and the measures taken by governmental authorities to address it, could significantly disrupt our ability to operate our businesses in the ordinary course . A product recall or a product liability or other claim (even if unsuccessful or without merit) could have negative economic consequences and also generate negative publicity about us and our products .\n Legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions against us and our subsidiaries, including PM USA, as well as our and their respective indemnitees and indemnitors . Unfavorable outcomes with respect to litigation proceedings or any governmental investigations could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows or financial position .\n In a patent lawsuit, the ITC banned the importation of                 IQOS devices, .-Marlboro HeatSticks and component parts into the United States . The ITC imposed similar restrictions on  NJOY ACE. in a separate patent lawsuit brought by JUUL . The risk is especially pertinent to smoke-free products where technology continues advancing rapidly, resulting in a high volume of patents .\n Litigation is subject to significant uncertainty, and there could be adverse developments in pending or future cases . Damages claimed in some tobacco-related or other litigation are significant and, in certain cases, have ranged in the billions of dollars . An unfavorable outcome or settlement of pending litigation could encourage the commencement of additional litigation . d have a material adverse effect on our businesses .\n There remains a risk that such relief may not be obtainable in all cases . 47 states and Puerto Rico now limit the dollar amount of bonds or require no bond at all . Tobacco litigation plaintiffs have challenged the constitutionality of Florida’s bond cap statute in several cases . Altria may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in our best interests .\n We face significant governmental and private sector actions, including efforts aimed at reducing the incidence of tobacco use and seeking to hold us responsible for the adverse health effects associated with both smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke . These actions, combined with the diminishing social acceptance of smoking, have resulted in reduced cigarette industry volume, and we expect that these factors will continue to reduce cigarette consumption levels .\n The actions and inaction of regulators, including the FDA, can result in competitive challenges . A protracted FDA review of one of our operating companies’ PMTAs would allow competitive products already on the market to establish market share, brand recognition and adult tobacco consumer loyalty in the absence of competition from our product . The FDA could review a PMTA for a competitor’s product before it reviews a competing product .\n Any federal, state or local governmental action, including regulatory actions and inaction by the FDA, may have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position . Such action and inaction also could negatively impact adult smokers’ transition to these products, which could materially adversely affect our ability to achieve our Vision .\n Tobacco-related taxes or fees could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position . International business operations subject us to various U.S. and foreign laws and regulations . Violations of these laws could result in reputational harm, legal challenges and significant penalties and other costs .\n The increased concern over climate change and other sustainability matters is likely to result in new or additional legal and regulatory requirements intended to reduce or mitigate environmental issues . A successful challenge to one or more of our tax positions (which could give rise to additional liabilities, including interest and potential penalties), an increase in the corporate income tax rate could materially adversely affect our earnings or cash flows .\n Access to the credit and capital markets important for us to satisfy our liquidity and financing needs . Disruption and uncertainty in the credit or capital markets or high interest rates could negatively impact the availability or cost of capital and adversely affect our liquidity, cash flow, earnings and dividend rate . A downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely impact our borrowing costs .\n Our performance relating to corporate responsibility matters and investor and stakeholder responses may impact our reputation, ability to attract investors and the market value of our stock . Any such outcome could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition . Estment grade could increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access the credit and capital markets, including the commercial paper market, on terms commercially acceptable to us .\n Failure to achieve corporate responsibility goals could result in adverse publicity . Failure of information systems to function as intended could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations, cash flows or financial position . Cyber-attacks, cyber-attacks or security breaches could have an impact on our reputation and ability to attract and retain investors .\n From time-to-time, we and our service providers, suppliers and trade customers experience attempts to infiltrate and interrupt information systems . Bad actors around the world use increasingly sophisticated methods, including the use of artificial intelligence, to engage in illegal activities involving the theft and misuse of personal information, confidential information and intellectual property . Our safeguards include employee training, testing and auditing .\n Implementation of new technology and systems deployment may increase our risk of data security incidents, internal control failures and regulatory noncompliance . Failure of our, or our service providers’, key suppliers’ or trade customers’ . information systems to function as intended, or cyber-attacks or security breaches, could result in loss of revenue, assets, personal data, intellectual property, trade secrets or other sensitive and confidential data .\n These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements . As our business expands internationally, we may incur additional costs associated with compliance with foreign data protection laws . Failure to comply with these laws could result in litigation, claims, regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations .\n The expected benefits of our investment in ABI may not materialize in the expected manner or timeframe or at all, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position or earnings . Foreign currency exchange rates, ABI’s business results and the value of its investment are also subject to risks encountered by ABI in its business, its business outlook, cash flow requirements and financial performance .\n The company did not pay its interim 2020 dividend that would have been paid in the fourth quarter of 2020, which resulted in a reduction of cash dividends we received from ABI . It is possible that we may be required to record significant impairment charges in the future and, if we do so, our net earnings and carrying value of our investment in ABI could be materially adversely affected .\n Cronos’s operations are subject to laws, regulations and guidelines promulgated by various governmental authorities . A failure by Cronos or Altria to comply with applicable laws, including cannabis laws, could result in criminal, civil or tax liability, negative impacts on the availability and cost of capital and credit . The company has implemented an extensive cybersecurity risk management framework designed to identify, assess, mitigate and prevent potentia .\n We leverage the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity Framework and industry best practices to identify and prioritize cybersecurity risks . We also use the NIST framework to drive enhancements to our program that are designed to protect our assets and third-party partners . We align our security standards for infrastructure configuration with the Center for Internet Security's Benchmarks .\n We employ a layered approach to cybersecurity, implementing a range of technical and procedural controls designed to protect critical systems and data . We also conduct regular security patching to manage emerging cyber threats . We have established an incident response plan and playbook . We engage third-party consulting services to conduct audits and assessments of the effectiveness of our cybersecurity controls .\n The IT Risk Management function reviews procedures designed to respond to and recover from cybersecurity incidents . The procedures provide detailed descriptions of the roles and responsibilities of key stakeholders and procedures for communication and coordination during an incident . These procedures also provide guidelines for escalating information to senior management, our Disclosure Controls Committee, our Audit Committee, and our full Board and for providing timely public disclosure, when necessary .\n We use security risk assessment questionnaire tools to identify high-risk third-party third-parties, which we believe allows us to effectively assess and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities . We conduct cybersecurity training programs emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity awareness at least annually and more frequently as necessary or advisable . Employees are held accountable for completing all assigned cybersecurity programs and meeting certain performance thresholds .\n Our Board devotes significant time and attention to our cybersecurity and information technology risks . While our Board and Audit Committee oversee cybersecurity risk oversight, our CISO and Chief Information Officer present to our Board annually and to our Audit Committee at least twice each year on a broad range of topics, such as recent and potential cybersecurity threats and incidents .\n Senior management is responsible for actively managing cybersecurity risk, including by overseeing and executing the risk management strategies discussed above . Senior management reports annually to the Board with respect to our overall enterprise risk management processes . CISO has over 25 years of experience, including five years as our CISO, managing technology risks across multiple industries, including financial services, technology and manufacturing .\n As of the date of this filing, we are not aware of any current cybersecurity threats or cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our business, results of operations or financial condition . From time-to-time, we and our third-party service providers, suppliers and trade customers experience attempts to infiltrate and interrupt information systems ."
