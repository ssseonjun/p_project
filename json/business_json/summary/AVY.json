Success of any acquisition depends on ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated benefits from combining our businesses . Successful integration of systems, controls, employees, product lines, market segments, customers, suppliers and cost savings can be difficult to achieve .\n Future acquisitions could result in increased debt, dilution, liabilities, interest expense, restructuring charges and amortization expenses related to intangible assets .
