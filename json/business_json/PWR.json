    "item1": "Item 1. \nBusiness \nof this Annual Report. \nSignificant Factors Impacting Results\nOur revenues, profit, margins and other results of operations can be influenced by a variety of factors in any given period, including those described in Item 1. \nBusiness \nand",
    "item1a": "Item 1A. \nRisk Factors \nof Part I of this Annual Report, and those factors have caused fluctuations in our results in the past and are expected to cause fluctuations in our results in the future. Additional information with respect to certain of those factors is provided below.\nSeasonality. \nTypically, our revenues are lowest in the first quarter of the year because cold, snowy or wet conditions can create challenging working environments that are more costly for our customers or cause delays on projects. In addition, infrastructure projects often do not begin in a meaningful way until our customers finalize their capital budgets, which typically occurs during the first quarter. Second quarter revenues are typically higher than those in the first quarter, as some projects begin, but continued cold and wet weather can often impact productivity. Third quarter and fourth quarter revenues are typically the highest of the year, as a greater number of projects are underway and operating conditions, including weather, are normally more accommodating. During the fourth quarter, projects are often completed and customers often seek to spend their capital budgets before year end. However, the holiday season and inclement weather can sometimes cause delays during the fourth quarter, reducing revenues and increasing costs. These seasonal impacts are typical for our U.S. operations, but seasonality for our international operations may differ. For example, revenues for certain projects in Canada are typically higher in the first quarter because projects are often accelerated in order to complete work while the ground is frozen and prior to the break up, or seasonal thaw, as productivity is adversely affected by wet ground conditions during warmer months. \nWeather, natural disasters and emergencies.\n The results of our business in a given period can be impacted by adverse weather conditions, severe weather events, natural disasters or other emergencies, which include, among other things, heavy or prolonged snowfall or rainfall, hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, floods, blizzards, extreme temperatures, wildfires, post-wildfire floods and debris flows, pandemics and earthquakes. Climate change has the potential to increase the frequency and extremity of severe weather events. These conditions and events can negatively impact our financial results due to, among other things, the termination, deferral or delay of projects, reduced productivity and exposure to significant liabilities due to failure of electrical power or other infrastructure on which we have performed services. However, severe weather events can also increase our emergency restoration services, which typically yield higher margins due in part to higher equipment utilization and absorption of fixed costs. \nDemand for services\n. We perform the majority of our services under existing contracts, including MSAs and similar agreements pursuant to which our customers are not committed to specific volumes of our services. Therefore our volume of business can be positively or negatively affected by fluctuations in the amount of work our customers assign us in a given period, which may vary by geographic region. Examples of items that may cause demand for our services to fluctuate materially from quarter to quarter include: the financial condition of our customers, their capital spending and their access to and cost of capital; acceleration of any projects or programs by customers (e.g., modernization or hardening programs); economic and political conditions on a regional, national or global scale, including availability of renewable energy tax credits; interest rates; governmental regulations affecting the sourcing and costs of materials and equipment; other changes in U.S. and global trade relationships (e.g., tariffs, taxes); and project deferrals and cancellations. \nRevenue mix and impact on margins.\n The mix of revenues based on the types of services we provide in a given period will impact margins, as certain industries and services provide higher-margin opportunities. Our larger or more complex projects typically include, among others, transmission projects with higher voltage capacities; pipeline projects with larger-diameter throughput capacities; large-scale renewable generation projects; complex data center projects; and projects with increased engineering, design or construction complexities, more difficult terrain or geographical requirements, or longer distance requirements. These projects typically yield opportunities for higher margins than our recurring services under MSAs described above, as we assume a greater degree of performance risk and there is greater utilization of our resources for longer construction timeframes. However, larger projects are subject to additional risk of regulatory delay and cyclicality. Project schedules also fluctuate, particularly in connection with larger, more complex or longer-term projects, which can affect the amount of work performed in a given period. Furthermore, smaller or less complex projects typically have a greater number of companies competing for them, and competitors at times may more aggressively pursue available work. A greater percentage of smaller scale or less complex work also could negatively impact margins due to the inefficiency of transitioning between a \n44\ngreater number of smaller projects versus continuous production on fewer larger projects. As a result, at times we may choose to maintain a portion of our workforce and equipment in an underutilized capacity to ensure we are strategically positioned to deliver on larger projects when they move forward.\nProject variability and performance.\n Margins for a single project may fluctuate period to period due to changes in the volume or type of work performed, the pricing structure under the project contract or job productivity. Additionally, our productivity and performance on a project can vary period to period based on a number of factors, including unexpected project difficulties or site conditions (including in connection with difficult geographic characteristics); project location, including locations with challenging operating conditions; whether the work is on an open or encumbered right of way; inclement weather or severe weather events; environmental restrictions or regulatory delays; protests, public activism, other political activity or legal challenges related to a project; and the performance of third parties. Moreover, we currently generate a significant portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts, and fixed price contracts are more common in connection with our larger and more complex projects that typically involve greater performance risk. Under these contracts, we assume risks related to project estimates and execution, and project revenues can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including the additional complexity, timing uncertainty or extended bidding, regulatory and permitting processes associated with these projects. These variations can result in a reduction in expected profit, the incurrence of losses on a project or the issuance of change orders and/or assertion of contract claims against customers. See \nContract Estimates and Changes in Estimates \nin Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report.\nSubcontract work and provision of materials.\n Work that is subcontracted to other service providers generally yields lower margins, and therefore an increase in subcontract work in a given period can decrease operating margins. In recent years, we have subcontracted approximately 20% of our work to other service providers. Additionally, under certain contracts, including contracts for engineering, procurement and construction services, we agree to procure all or part of the required materials. While we attempt to structure our agreements with customers and suppliers to account for the impact of increased materials procurement requirements or fluctuations in the cost of materials we procure, our margins may be lower on projects where we furnish a significant amount of materials, as our markup on materials is generally lower than our markup on labor costs, and in a given period an increase in the percentage of work with greater materials procurement requirements may decrease our overall margins, including in some cases our assuming price risk. Furthermore, fluctuations in the price or availability of materials, equipment and consumables that we or our customers utilize could impact costs to complete projects. \n45\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results\nThe following table sets forth selected statements of operations data, such data as a percentage of revenues for the years indicated, as well as the dollar and percentage change from the prior year (dollars in thousands). \n \nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n \n2024\n2023\n$\n%\nRevenues\n$\n23,672,795 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n20,882,206 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n2,790,589 \n13.4 \n%\nCost of services\n20,162,034 \n85.2 \n17,945,120 \n85.9 \n2,216,914 \n12.4 \n%\nGross profit\n3,510,761 \n14.8 \n2,937,086 \n14.1 \n573,675 \n19.5 \n%\nEquity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates\n50,484 \n0.2 \n41,609 \n0.2 \n8,875 \n21.3 \n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n(1,824,754)\n(7.7)\n(1,555,137)\n(7.4)\n(269,617)\n17.3 \n%\nAmortization of intangible assets\n(382,959)\n(1.6)\n(289,014)\n(1.5)\n(93,945)\n32.5 \n%\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities\n(7,064)\n— \n(6,568)\n— \n(496)\n7.6 \n%\nOperating income\n1,346,468 \n5.7 \n1,127,976 \n5.4 \n218,492 \n19.4 \n%\nInterest and other financing expenses\n(202,687)\n(0.9)\n(186,913)\n(1.0)\n(15,774)\n8.4 \n%\nInterest income\n32,404 \n0.1 \n10,830 \n0.1 \n21,574 \n199.2 \n%\nOther income, net\n35,845 \n0.2 \n18,063 \n0.1 \n17,782 \n98.4 \n%\nIncome before income taxes\n1,212,030 \n5.1 \n969,956 \n4.6 \n242,074 \n25.0 \n%\nProvision for income taxes\n284,747 \n1.2 \n219,267 \n1.0 \n65,480 \n29.9 \n%\nNet income\n927,283 \n3.9 \n750,689 \n3.6 \n176,594 \n23.5 \n%\nLess: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n22,459 \n0.1 \n6,000 \n— \n16,459 \n274.3 \n%\nNet income attributable to common stock\n$\n904,824 \n3.8 \n%\n$\n744,689 \n3.6 \n%\n$\n160,135 \n21.5 \n%\nRevenues.\n Revenues increased due to a $1.68 billion increase in revenues from our Renewable Energy segment and a $1.47 billion increase in revenues from our Electric Power segment, partially offset by a $354.6 million decrease in revenues from our Underground and Infrastructure segment. See \nSegment Results \nbelow for additional information and discussion related to segment revenues.\nCost of services.\n Costs of services primarily includes wages, benefits, subcontractor costs, materials, equipment, and other direct and indirect costs, including related depreciation. The increase in cost of services generally correlates to the increase in revenues.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses.\n The increase was primarily attributable to a $165.6 million increase related to recently acquired businesses; a $46.0 million increase in compensation expense, largely associated with increased salaries and non-cash stock compensation expense due primarily to an increase in the number of employees to support business growth; a $21.1 million increase in travel and related expenses to support business growth; and $18.5 million of foreign currency translation losses in connection with our substantial liquidation from Latin American operations.\nAmortization of intangible assets.\n The increase was related to incremental amortization expense associated with recent acquisitions, including CEI.\nOperating income.\n Operating income was positively impacted by a $278.2 million increase in operating income for our Electric Power segment and a $189.9 million increase in operating income for our Renewable Energy segment, partially offset by a $112.9 million decrease in operating income for our Underground and Infrastructure segment and a $136.7 million increase in corporate and non-allocated costs, which includes amortization expense. Results for each of our business segments and corporate and non-allocated costs are discussed in \nSegment Results\n below.\nInterest and other financing expenses.\n Approximately half of the increase resulted from higher principal balances and lease financing transactions as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\nInterest income\n. Approximately half of the increase resulted from higher interest-bearing cash and cash equivalent balances as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023.\n46\nOther income, net\n. The increase was primarily attributable to a gain of $12.6 million resulting from the sale of an investment in a non-integral unconsolidated affiliate, $5.0 million of which was attributable to a non-controlling interest, as further described in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report. \nProvision for income taxes\n. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were 23.5% and 22.6%, respectively. The tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2024 benefited from a $55.1 million benefit due to equity incentive awards vesting at a higher fair market value than their grant date fair market value, compared to a $35.0 million benefit in the year ended December 31, 2023. Additionally, the 2024 tax rate was positively impacted by ongoing entity rationalization and restructuring efforts. These efforts resulted in a $10.2 million deferred tax benefit and the release of a $4.6 million valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2024. The tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2023 was favorably impacted by the realization of the loss on our investment in Starry Group Holdings, Inc. for tax purposes, and the corresponding release of the valuation allowance initially recorded during the year ended December 31, 2022. The components of our provision for income taxes including changes in our valuation allowance are quantified and described in more detail in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report.\nNet income attributable to non-controlling interests. \nThe increase in net income attributable to non-controlling interests is primarily related to increased activity on certain joint ventures and the $5.0 million gain on the sale of the investment in a non-integral equity unconsolidated affiliate recorded during the year ended December 31, 2024 as described above.\nComprehensive income.\n See Statements of Comprehensive Income in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \nin Part II of this Annual Report. Comprehensive income increased by $42.6 million in 2024 as compared to 2023, primarily due to a $176.6 million increase in net income and $18.5 million of foreign currency translation losses recognized to net income in connection with our substantial liquidation from Latin American operations. These increases in comprehensive income were partially offset by a $134.7 million foreign currency translation adjustment loss and the $16.5 million increase in comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests described above. The predominant functional currencies for our operations outside the U.S. are Canadian and Australian dollars. Foreign currency translation adjustment loss in the year ended December 31, 2024 primarily resulted from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against both the Canadian and Australian dollars as of December 31, 2024 when compared to December 31, 2023.\nSegment Results\nThrough December 31, 2024, we reported our results under three reportable segments: Electric Power, Renewable Energy and Underground and Infrastructure. Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating income by type of work, is gathered from each of our operating companies. Classification of our operating company revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can at times require judgment on the part of management. Integrated operations and common administrative support for operating companies require that certain allocations be made to determine segment profitability, including allocations of corporate shared and indirect operating costs, as well as general and administrative costs. Certain corporate costs are not allocated, including corporate facility costs; non-allocated corporate salaries, benefits and incentive compensation; acquisition and integration costs; non-cash stock-based compensation; amortization related to intangible assets; asset impairments related to goodwill and intangible assets; and change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.\n47\nThe following table sets forth segment revenues, segment operating income (loss) and operating margins for the periods indicated, as well as the dollar and percentage change from the prior period (dollars in thousands):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nChange\n \n2024\n2023\n$\n%\nRevenues\n:\n \n \n \n \n \nElectric Power\n$\n11,166,495 \n47.2 \n%\n$\n9,696,897 \n46.5 \n%\n$\n1,469,598 \n15.2 \n%\nRenewable Energy\n7,845,884 \n33.1 \n6,170,301 \n29.5 \n1,675,583 \n27.2 \n%\nUnderground and Infrastructure\n4,660,416 \n19.7 \n5,015,008 \n24.0 \n(354,592)\n(7.1)\n%\nConsolidated revenues\n$\n23,672,795 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n20,882,206 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n2,790,589 \n13.4 \n%\nOperating income (loss):\n \n \n \n \nElectric Power\n$\n1,291,580 \n11.6 \n%\n$\n1,013,350 \n10.5 \n%\n$\n278,230 \n27.5 \n%\nRenewable Energy\n667,112 \n8.5 \n%\n477,208 \n7.7 \n%\n189,904 \n39.8 \n%\nUnderground and Infrastructure\n265,030 \n5.7 \n%\n377,977 \n7.5 \n%\n(112,947)\n(29.9)\n%\nCorporate and Non-Allocated Costs\n(877,254)\n(3.7)\n%\n(740,559)\n(3.5)\n%\n(136,695)\n18.5 \n%\nConsolidated operating income\n$\n1,346,468 \n5.7 \n%\n$\n1,127,976 \n5.4 \n%\n$\n218,492 \n19.4 \n%\nElectric Power Segment Results\nRevenues. \nThe increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to approximately $1.22 billion in revenues attributable to acquired businesses in 2024 and the rising demand for our services. \nOperating Income. \nThe increase in operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the increase in revenues and change in the overall mix of work, including an increase in higher margin emergency restoration services. \nRenewable Energy Segment Results\nRevenues. \nThe increase in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to increased demand for generation and transmission services for renewable generation projects, as well as approximately $320 million in revenues attributable to acquired businesses. \nOperating Income. \nThe increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in revenues during the year ended December 31, 2024. The increase in operating margin was primarily attributable to improved performance on transmission and generation projects, partially offset by increased costs on two solar projects in the United States. \nUnderground and Infrastructure Segment Results\nRevenues. \nThe decrease in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to lower revenues from large pipeline projects. This decrease was partially offset by approximately $215 million in revenues attributable to an acquired business. \nOperating Income. \nThe decrease in operating income and operating margin for the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to decreased revenues and overall mix of work performed during the period, which contributed to lower levels of fixed cost absorption, and an $11.9 million loss recorded during the year ended related to the disposition of a non-core business.\nCorporate and Non-Allocated Costs\nThe increase in corporate and non-allocated costs during the year ended December 31, 2024 was primarily due to a $93.9 million increase in intangible asset amortization expense associated with recent acquisitions, including CEI, and a $36.0 million increase in compensation expense, which was primarily attributable to increased non-cash stock compensation and salary expense in support of business growth and associated with acquisitions.\nChange in Reportable Segments\nBeginning in the three months ending March 31, 2025, our Chief Executive Officer reevaluated how he assesses performance and allocates resources, which resulted in a change in the reporting of management’s internal financial information. As a result, we will begin reporting the results of our two operating segments, which will also be our two reportable segments: (1) Electric Infrastructure Solutions and (2) Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions. The Electric Infrastructure Solutions segment will consist of the historical Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments.\n48\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, financial measures not recognized under GAAP, when used in connection with net income attributable to common stock, are intended to provide useful information to investors and analysts as they evaluate our performance. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest and other financing expenses, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA adjusted for certain other items as described below. These measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stock or other financial measures of performance that are derived in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that the exclusion of these items from net income attributable to common stock enables us and our investors to more effectively evaluate our operations period over period and to identify operating trends that might not be apparent due to, among other reasons, the variable nature of these items period over period. In addition, management believes these measures may be useful for investors in comparing our operating results with other companies that may be viewed as our peers. \nAs to certain of the items below, (i) non-cash stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period due to acquisition activity, changes in the estimated fair value of performance-based awards, forfeiture rates, accelerated vesting and amounts granted; (ii) acquisition and integration costs vary from period to period depending on the level and complexity of our acquisition activity; (iii) equity in (earnings) losses of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates varies from period to period depending on the activity and financial performance of such affiliates, the operations of which are not operationally integral to us; (iv) gains and losses on the sale of investments and businesses, and foreign currency translation losses recognized from substantial liquidation of certain foreign operations vary from period to period depending on activity; and (v) change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities varies from period to period depending on the performance in post-acquisition periods of certain acquired businesses and the effect of present value accretion on fair value calculations. Because EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, as defined, exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income attributable to common stock, such measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. The most comparable GAAP financial measure, net income attributable to common stock, and information reconciling the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures, are included below. The following table shows dollars in thousands.\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nNet income attributable to common stock (GAAP as reported) \n$\n904,824 \n$\n744,689 \nInterest and other financing expenses\n202,687 \n186,913 \nInterest income\n(32,404)\n(10,830)\nProvision for income taxes\n284,747 \n219,267 \nDepreciation expense\n359,363 \n324,786 \nAmortization of intangible assets\n382,959 \n289,014 \nInterest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization included in equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates\n21,114 \n19,936 \nEBITDA \n2,123,290 \n1,773,775 \nNon-cash stock-based compensation\n150,526 \n126,762 \nAcquisition and integration costs \n29,994 \n42,837 \nEquity in earnings of non-integral unconsolidated affiliates\n(2,649)\n(1,263)\nLoss on disposition of business (gain on sale of investment), net \n(1)\n4,370 \n(1,496)\nForeign currency translation losses \n(2)\n18,531 \n— \nChange in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities\n7,064 \n6,568 \nAdjusted EBITDA\n$\n2,331,126 \n$\n1,947,183 \n(1)\n    \nThe amount for the year ended December 31, 2024 is a loss of $11.9 million on the disposition of a non-core business, partially offset by a gain of $7.5 million as a result of the sale of a non-integral equity method investment. \n(2)\n    \nThe amount for the year ended December 31, 2024 is foreign currency translation losses in connection with our substantial liquidation from Latin American operations. \nRemaining Performance Obligations and Backlog\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service. Our remaining performance obligations represent management’s estimate of consolidated revenues that are expected to be realized from the \n49\nremaining portion of firm orders under fixed price contracts not yet completed or for which work has not yet begun, which includes estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities, revenues from funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent they are reasonably expected to be realized, and revenues from change orders and claims to the extent management believes they will be earned and are probable of collection.\nWe have also historically disclosed our backlog, a measure commonly used in our industry but not recognized under GAAP. We believe this measure enables management to more effectively forecast our future capital needs and results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. We believe this measure is also useful for investors in forecasting our future results and comparing us to our competitors. Our remaining performance obligations are a component of backlog, which also includes estimated orders under MSAs, including estimated renewals, and certain non-fixed price contracts. Our methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, MSAs accounted for 38% and 45% of our estimated 12-month backlog and 48% and 55% of our total backlog. Generally, our customers are not contractually committed to specific volumes of services under our MSAs, and most of our contracts can be terminated on short notice even if we are not in default. We determine the estimated backlog for these MSAs using recurring historical trends, factoring in seasonal demand and projected customer needs based upon ongoing communications. In addition, many of our MSAs are subject to renewal, and these potential renewals are considered in determining estimated backlog. As a result, estimates for remaining performance obligations and backlog are subject to change based on, among other things, project accelerations; project cancellations or delays, including but not limited to those caused by commercial issues, regulatory requirements, natural disasters, emergencies and adverse weather conditions; and final acceptance of change orders by customers. These factors can cause revenues to be realized in periods and at levels that are different than originally projected.\nThe following table reconciles total remaining performance obligations to our backlog (a non-GAAP financial measure) by reportable segment, along with estimates of amounts expected to be realized within 12 months (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n12 Month\nTotal\n12 Month\nTotal\nElectric Power\nRemaining performance obligations\n$\n4,250,978 \n$\n7,320,481 \n$\n2,762,608 \n$\n4,505,830 \nEstimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts\n5,907,359 \n12,583,574 \n5,597,732 \n10,995,198 \nBacklog\n$\n10,158,337 \n$\n19,904,055 \n$\n8,360,340 \n$\n15,501,028 \nRenewable Energy\nRemaining performance obligations\n$\n6,046,432 \n$\n8,333,547 \n$\n5,512,159 \n$\n8,005,368 \nEstimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts\n291,244 \n390,205 \n118,770 \n119,634 \nBacklog\n$\n6,337,676 \n$\n8,723,752 \n$\n5,630,929 \n$\n8,125,002 \nUnderground and Infrastructure \nRemaining performance obligations\n$\n953,983 \n$\n1,104,609 \n$\n1,017,227 \n$\n1,383,057 \nEstimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts\n2,321,941 \n4,806,408 \n2,222,451 \n5,099,332 \nBacklog\n$\n3,275,924 \n$\n5,911,017 \n$\n3,239,678 \n$\n6,482,389 \nTotal\nRemaining performance obligations\n$\n11,251,393 \n$\n16,758,637 \n$\n9,291,994 \n$\n13,894,255 \nEstimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts\n8,520,544 \n17,780,187 \n7,938,953 \n16,214,164 \nBacklog\n$\n19,771,937 \n$\n34,538,824 \n$\n17,230,947 \n$\n30,108,419 \nThe increases in both remaining performance obligations and backlog from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 were partially due to the impact of acquisitions that occurred in the year ended December 31, 2024, as well as increased new project awards with existing customers.\n50\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe plan to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, dividends and other cash requirements with our current available liquidity and cash from operations, which could be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Management monitors financial markets and national and global economic conditions for factors that may affect our liquidity and capital resources. \nAs set forth below, we have various short-term and long-term cash requirements and capital allocation priorities, and we intend to fund these requirements primarily with cash flow from operating activities, as well as debt financing as needed.\nCash Requirements and Capital Allocation\nCash Requirements. \nThe following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2024, our cash requirements from contractual obligations that are due within the twelve months subsequent to December 31, 2024 and thereafter, excluding certain amounts discussed below (in thousands):\nDue in 2025\nDue Thereafter\nTotal\nLong-term debt, including current portion - principal \n$\n51,039 \n$\n3,984,274 \n$\n4,035,313 \nLong-term debt - cash interest \n(1)\n137,538 \n886,285 \n1,023,823 \nOperating lease obligations \n(2)\n107,468 \n247,365 \n354,833 \nFinance lease obligations \n(2)\n13,225 \n41,826 \n55,051 \nShort-term lease obligations\n27,345 \n— \n27,345 \nEquipment purchase commitments \n(3)\n68,797 \n25,036 \n93,833 \nOther purchase commitments \n(4)\n117,730 \n36,267 \n153,997 \nCapital commitment related to investments in unconsolidated affiliates\n (5)\n19,667 \n48,936 \n68,603 \nTotal cash requirements from contractual obligations\n$\n542,809 \n$\n5,269,989 \n$\n5,812,798 \n(1)\n    \nAmounts represent cash interest and other financing expenses associated primarily with our senior notes. Interest payments related to our senior credit facility and commercial paper program are not included due to their variable interest rates. With respect to this variable rate debt, assuming the principal amount outstanding and interest rate in effect as of December 31, 2024 remained the same, the annual cash interest expense would be approximately \n$42.1 million\n related to the term loan payable until October 8, 2026, the maturity date of the term loan, and \n$1.1 million\n related to the revolving loans payable until July 31, 2029, the maturity date of our senior credit facility. \n(2)    \nAmounts represent undiscounted operating and finance lease obligations as of December 31, 2024. The corresponding amounts recorded on our December 31, 2024 consolidated balance sheet represent the present value of these amounts.\n(3)    \nAmounts represent capital committed for the purchase of equipment. We expect that some of these orders will be assigned to third-party leasing companies and made available to us under certain of our master equipment lease agreements.\n(4)    \nAmounts represent other purchase commitments not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, primarily for inventory and general and administrative services, including information technology services.\n(5)    \nAmounts represen\nt estimates of capital commitments for investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including $45.0 million\n related to a limited partnership interest in a \nfund that targets investments in certain portfolio companies that operate businesses related to the transition to a reduced-carbon economy.\nExcluded from the table above are firm purchase commitments for materials and certain subcontractor costs in the normal course of business that primarily support direct project costs on existing contractual arrangements with our customers. These firm purchase commitments are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet and are not expected to impact future liquidity as amounts are anticipated to be included in customer billings. As of December 31, 2024, these commitments are estimated to represent approximately 10% of our annual cost of services, with the substantial majority of the commitments payable in the year ending December 31, 2025. Also excluded from the table above and not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet are our commitments to purchase certain production tax credits as described in more detail in Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report. \nContingent Obligations\n. We have various contingent obligations that could require the use of cash or impact the collection of cash in future periods; however, we are unable to accurately predict the timing and estimate the amount of such contingent obligations as of December 31, 2024. These contingent obligations generally include, among other things: \n•\ncontingent consideration liabilities, which are described further in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report;\n \n51\n•\nundistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and unrecognized tax benefits, which are described further in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report;\n•\ncollective bargaining agreements and multiemployer pension plan liabilities, as well as liabilities related to our deferred compensation and other employee benefit plans, which are described further in Notes 15 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report; and\n•\nobligations relating to our joint ventures, lawsuits and other legal proceedings, uncollectible accounts receivable, insurance liabilities, obligations relating to letters of credit, bonds and parent guarantees, obligations relating to employment agreements, indemnities and assumed liabilities, and residual value guarantees, which are described further in Notes 4, 10, 11 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report\n.\nCapital Allocation\n. Our capital deployment priorities that require the use of cash include: (i) working capital to fund ongoing operating needs, (ii) capital expenditures to meet anticipated demand for our services, (iii) acquisitions and investments to facilitate the long-term growth and sustainability of our business, and (iv) return of capital to stockholders, including through the payment of dividends and repurchases of our outstanding common stock. Our industry is capital intensive, and we expect substantial capital expenditures and commitments for equipment purchases and equipment lease and rental arrangements to be needed into the foreseeable future in order to meet anticipated demand for our services. We expect capital expenditures for property and equipment purchases for the year ended December 31, 2025 to be approximately $500 million to $550 million. We also expect to continue to allocate significant capital to strategic acquisitions and investments, as well as to pay dividends and to repurchase our outstanding common stock and/or debt securities. \nDuring 2024, we completed the acquisition of eight businesses in which a portion of the consideration, net of cash acquired, consisted of $1.75 billion in cash funded partially with a combination of cash and cash equivalents, borrowings from our commercial paper program and certain other financing transactions as described in \nFinancing Activities\n below. \nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, we completed the acquisitions of two businesses in which a portion of the consideration consisted of $374.9 million in cash paid on each respective acquisition date funded with a combination of cash and cash equivalents and borrowings from our commercial paper program. For additional information regarding our recent acquisitions, refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report.\nWe anticipate that our future cash flows from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand, existing borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility and commercial paper program and ability to access capital markets for additional capital will provide sufficient funds to enable us to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months and over the longer term. \nSignificant Sources of Cash\nCash flow from operating activities is primarily influenced by demand for our services and operating margins but is also influenced by the timing of working capital needs associated with the various types of services that we provide. Our working capital needs may increase when we commence large volumes of work under circumstances where project costs are required to be paid before the associated receivables are billed and collected. Working capital needs are generally higher during the summer and fall due to increased demand for our services when favorable weather conditions exist in many of our operating regions. Conversely, working capital assets are typically converted to cash during the winter. These seasonal trends can be offset by changes in project timing due to delays or accelerations and other economic factors that may affect customer spending, including market conditions or the impact of certain unforeseen events (e.g., regulatory and other actions that impact the supply chain for certain materials). Additionally, operating cash flows may be negatively impacted as a result of unpaid and delayed change orders and claims. Changes in project timing due to delays or accelerations and other economic, regulatory, market and political factors that may affect customer spending could also impact cash flow from operating activities. Further information with respect to our cash flow from operating activities is set forth below and in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report\n.\n52\nOur available commitments under our senior credit facility and cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2024 were as follows (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2024\nTotal capacity available for revolving loans, credit support for commercial paper program and letters of credit\n$\n2,800,000 \nLess:\nBorrowings of revolving loans \n22,945 \nLetters of credit outstanding\n167,401 \nAvailable commitments for revolving loans, credit support for commercial paper program and letters of credit\n2,609,654 \nPlus:\nCash and cash equivalents \n(1)\n741,960 \nTotal available commitments under senior credit facility and cash and cash equivalents\n$\n3,351,614 \n(1)    \nFurther information with respect to our cash and cash equivalents is set forth below and in Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in Part II of this Annual Report. This amount includes $259.8 million in jurisdictions outside of the U.S., principally in Australia. There are currently no legal or economic restrictions that would materially impede our ability to repatriate such cash. \nOn July 31, 2024, we amended our senior credit facility to, among other things, (i) increase the aggregate commitments for revolving loans from $2.64 billion to $2.80 billion and (ii) extend the maturity date for revolving loans under the senior credit facility from October 8, 2026 to July 31, 2029. In August 2024, we issued $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes and received net proceeds of $1.24 billion and used the proceeds to repay certain borrowings that were utilized to acquire CEI. For additional information regarding the amendment to our senior credit facility and the issuance of the senior notes, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report. \nWe consider our investment policies related to cash and cash equivalents to be conservative, as we maintain a diverse portfolio of what we believe to be high-quality cash and cash equivalent investments with short-term maturities. Additionally, subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement for our senior credit facility, we have the option to increase the capacity of our senior credit facility, in the form of an increase in the revolving commitments, term loans or a combination thereof, from time to time, upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders by up to an additional (i) $400.0 million plus (ii) additional amounts so long as the Incremental Leverage Ratio Requirement (as defined in the credit agreement) is satisfied at the time of such increase. The Incremental Leverage Ratio Requirement requires, among other things, after giving pro forma effect to such increase and the use of proceeds therefrom, compliance with the credit agreement’s financial covenants as of the most recent fiscal quarter end for which financial statements were required to be delivered. Further information with respect to our debt obligations is set forth in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report\n. \nWe may seek to access the capital markets from time to time to raise additional capital, increase liquidity as we deem necessary, refinance or extend the term of our existing indebtedness, fund acquisitions or otherwise fund our capital needs. While our financial strategy and consistent performance have allowed us to maintain investment grade ratings, our ability to access capital markets in the future depends on a number of factors, including our financial performance and financial position, our credit ratings, industry conditions, general economic conditions, our backlog, capital expenditure commitments, market conditions and market perceptions of us and our industry. \nSources and Uses of Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash During the Years Ended December 31, 2024 and 2023\nIn summary, our cash flows for each period were as follows (in thousands):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n2,081,196 \n$\n1,575,952 \nNet cash used in investing activities\n$\n(2,294,319)\n$\n(989,650)\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n$\n(305,636)\n$\n268,500 \n53\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $2.08 billion and $1.58 billion in 2024 and 2023 primarily reflected earnings adjusted for non-cash items and cash provided and used by the main components of working capital: “Accounts and notes receivable,” “Contract assets,” “Accounts payable and accrued expenses,” and “Contract liabilities.” Net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2023 was negatively impacted by incremental working capital requirements and the timing of the associated billings related to the large renewable transmission project in Canada as discussed further in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report. \nDays sales outstanding (DSO) represents the average number of days it takes revenues to be converted into cash, which management believes is an important metric for assessing liquidity. A decrease in DSO has a favorable impact on cash flow from operating activities, while an increase in DSO has a negative impact on cash flow from operating activities. DSO is calculated by using the sum of current accounts receivable, net of allowance (which includes retainage and unbilled balances), plus contract assets less contract liabilities, and divided by average revenues per day during the quarter. DSO at December 31, 2024 was 59 days, which was lower than DSO of 68 days at December 31, 2023 and lower than our five-year historical average DSO of 79 days. This decrease in DSO as compared to December 31, 2023 was partially due to increased revenues, an increase in contract liabilities and a decrease in contract assets related to favorable billing terms on certain large projects. Negatively impacting DSO and cash flow from operating activities for both the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were unapproved change orders and claims included in contract assets from the aforementioned large renewable transmission project in Canada. Also negatively impacting cash flow from operating activities for 2023 was our prepayment of amounts to suppliers for certain project materials that require a long lead time. \nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities in the year ended 2024 included $1.75 billion related to acquisitions, $604.1 million of capital expenditures and $81.9 million cash paid primarily for non-integral equity method investments. Partially offsetting these items were $77.6 million of proceeds from the sale of, and insurance settlements related to, property and equipment; $31.4 million of proceeds from the disposition of a non-core business; and $29.2 million of proceeds from the sale of a non-integral equity investment. \nNet cash used in investing activities in 2023 included $651.6 million related to acquisitions and $434.8 million of capital expenditures. Partially offsetting these items were $69.3 million of proceeds from the sale of, and insurance settlements related to, property and equipment and $42.3 million of proceeds from the sale of certain non-integral equity investments.\nOur industry is capital intensive, and we expect substantial capital expenditures and commitments for equipment purchases and equipment lease and rental arrangements to be needed for the foreseeable future in order to meet anticipated demand for our services. In addition, we expect to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions and investments, although we cannot predict the timing or amount of the cash needed for these initiatives. We also have various other capital commitments that are detailed in \nCash Requirements and Capital Allocation\n above. \nFinancing Activities\nIn July 2024, we entered into, and borrowed the full amount available under, a $400.0 million 90-day term loan facility outside of our senior credit facility and utilized these borrowings, together with $1.20 billion of borrowings under our commercial paper program and cash on hand, to finance the acquisition of CEI, as well as pay certain related costs and expenses and fund certain working capital requirements. On August 9, 2024, we received net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes of $1.24 billion, net of the original issue discount and underwriting discounts, and used the proceeds to repay certain borrowings utilized to acquire CEI, including the full amount of the short-term term loan. Net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2024 included $830.8 million of net repayments under our senior credit facility and commercial paper program. Additionally, on October 1, 2024, we repaid the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 0.95% senior notes due October 2024. Financing costs paid directly by us during the year ended December 31, 2024 were $7.6 million, which related to the August 2024 issuance of senior notes, the short-term term loan and the amendment of our senior credit facility. Net cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2024 also included $155.6 million of payments to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with stock-based compensation and the payment of $54.2 million of dividends. \nNet cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2023 included $408.7 million of net borrowings under our senior credit facility and commercial paper program, partially offset by $119.8 million of payments to satisfy tax withholding obligations associated with stock-based compensation and $47.8 million of dividends.\nWe expect to continue to utilize cash for similar financing activities in the future, including repayments of our outstanding debt, payment of cash dividends and repurchases of our common stock and/or debt securities. \n54\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the consolidated financial statements are published and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. We review all significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and record the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on our beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates. Management has reviewed its development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Our accounting policies are primarily described in Notes 2 and 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report and should be read in conjunction with the accounting policies identified below that we believe affect our more significant estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. \nRevenue Recognition \n-\n Contract Estimates and Changes in Estimates\nRefer to \nContract Estimates and Changes in Estimates\n in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report for a description of a variety of factors that can cause changes in estimates and how changes in estimates on certain contracts may result in the issuance of change orders or claims under contracts for our projects. The quantitative impacts of changes in change orders and claims are also included therein.\nDue to the significant judgments utilized in the revenue and cost estimation process, if subsequent actual results and/or updated assumptions or estimates were to change from those utilized as of December 31, 2024, it could result in a material impact to our results of operations. As described in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report, under fixed price contracts, as well as unit-price contracts with more than an insignificant amount of partially completed units, revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over time, with the percentage of completion generally measured as the percentage of costs incurred to total estimated costs for such performance obligation. Approximately 60.0% of our revenues recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 were associated with this revenue recognition method. Refer to \nContract Estimates and Changes in Estimates\n in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report for a description of the impacts in changes in estimates on revenue and gross profit during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nCollectability of Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets\nRefer to \nAccounts Receivable, Allowance for Credit Losses and Concentrations of Credit Risk \nin Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report for a description of how we determine our allowance for credit losses, which is based on an estimate of expected credit losses for financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable (including unbilled receivables) and contract assets, as well as activity in the allowance for credit losses.\nShould anticipated collections fail to materialize, or if future economic conditions deteriorate, we could experience an increase in our allowance for credit losses. If our historical loss ratio had been 5 basis points higher or lower as of December 31, 2024, our provision for credit loss would have increased or decreased $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. \nAcquisitions\nContingent Consideration. \nRefer to \nContingent Consideration\n in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report for a description of how contingent consideration liabilities are determined and the related assumptions and uncertainties utilized for our estimates, as well as the balances and account activity. The maximum amount payable related to these liabilities is also included therein.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets.\n Refer to Notes 2 and 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report for a description of valuation of long-lived assets related to acquisitions (other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment), including assumptions and uncertainties related to our estimates, as well as amounts related to recent acquisitions. If we determine there is a change in the \n55\nvaluation of long-lived assets during the measurement period, the change in estimate would result in a change in the amount of goodwill. \nGoodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Property, Plant and Equipment\nIn connection with our annual goodwill assessments in 2024 and 2023, management performed a qualitative impairment assessment of our reporting units, which indicated that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their carrying value including goodwill. Accordingly, a quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required, and no goodwill impairment was recognized in 2024 or 2023. Additionally, there were no material impairments related to other intangible assets or property, plant equipment in 2024 or 2023. Changes in facts and circumstances, judgments and assumptions used to determine these fair values, including with respect to market conditions and the economy, could result in impairment charges in the future that could be material to our financial statements. \nInsurance \nRefer to Notes 2 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report for a description of our insurance coverage, accounting policies related to insurance, accruals and related recoveries, as well as uncertainties of the related estimates. Our estimates of insurance liabilities related to employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability require us to make assumptions related to potential losses regarding our determination of amounts considered probable and estimable. We, along with our third-party actuary and third-party administrator, consider a number of factors when estimating our retained liability, including claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. We periodically review our estimates and assumptions with our third-party actuary to assist us in determining the adequacy of our retained liability. As of December 31, 2024, the amount accrued for employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability and general liability totaled $373.6 million.\nAlthough we believe that we have reasonably estimated our insurance liability, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded retained liabilities. Our insurance liability is based on a reasonable estimate provided by our third-party actuaries based on a statistical model that considers the cumulative probability distribution of all possible loss estimates.\nIncome Taxes \nRefer to Notes 2 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report for a description of our accounting policies related to income taxes, the identification and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the measurement of valuation allowances on deferred tax assets, benefits from uncertain tax positions and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that are reasonably possible of being adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities. \nThe evaluation of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income and whether we will be able to utilize state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, to determine whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Revisions to our forecasts, declining macroeconomic conditions or other factors could result in changes to our assessment of the realization of these deferred income tax assets.\nThe evaluation of uncertain tax positions involves significant estimates and judgments. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments are reasonable, we are occasionally challenged by various taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, are required to pay amounts in excess of the established liability or experience a change in judgment, the change in the liability could increase or decrease income tax expense in the period of such determination. \nITEM 7A.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nOur primary exposure to market risk relates to unfavorable changes with respect to interest rates and currency exchange rates. \nInterest Rate Risk\n.\n \nWe are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. Fluctuations in interest rates impact the fair value of fixed-rate debt and expose us to the risk that we may need to refinance debt at higher rates at each instrument\n’s\n respective maturity date. Fluctuations in interest rates impact interest expense from our variable-rate debt. At December 31, 2024, 82% of our debt portfolio, on a gross basis, incurred interest at a fixed-rate and the remaining 18% of the portfolio incurred interest at a variable-rate. \n56\nAs of December 31, 2024, our fixed-rate debt primarily consisted of\n \nour s\nenior notes outstanding. The fair value of our senior notes was $2.90 billion as of December 31, 2024, compared to a carrying value of $3.22 billion net of unamortized bond discount, underwriting discounts and deferred financing costs of $30.6 million. A\n 10% change in the market price would cause a change in fair value of $289.6 million.\n \nAs\n of December 31, 2024, our variable-rate debt consisted of \n$735.4 million\n outstanding under our senior credit facility. \nThe weighted average interest rate on our borrowings under our senior credit facility for the year ended December 31, 2024 was 6.6%. Based on these borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2024, we estimate that a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would impact annual interest expense by approximately $3.7 million. \nAs of \nDecember 31, 2024, we had \nno\n outstanding unsecured notes under our commercial paper program. The average daily amount outstanding and weighted average interest rate on our borrowings under our commercial paper program for the year ended December 31, 2024 were $362.2 million and \n5.37%. Based on the weighted average interest rate and average borrowings outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2024, we estimate that a 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would impact annual interest expense by approximately \n$1.8 million\n. \nFor additional information about our debt obligations, refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report.\nForeign Currency Risk.\n We perform our services in some foreign countries, primarily Canada and Australia, and as a result, are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Our reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. Our foreign entities typically use the local currency as their functional currency. Translation adjustments are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income. In the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n we recognized $18.5 million of foreign currency translation losses to net income in connection with our substantial liquidation from Latin American operations.\nSome of our consolidated entities enter into transactions that are not denominated in their functional currency. This results in exposure to foreign currency risk for financial instruments, including, but not limited to, third-party and intercompany receivables and payables and intercompany loans.\nOur policy is to maintain a balanced position in foreign currencies to minimize exchange gains and losses arising from changes in exchange rates. We maintain risk management control practices to monitor the foreign currency risk attributable to our intercompany and third-party outstanding foreign currency balances. These practices involve the centralization of our exposure to underlying currencies that are not subject to central bank and/or country specific restrictions. By centralizing most of our foreign currency exposure into one subsidiary, we are able to take advantage of natural offsets thereby reducing the overall impact of changes in foreign currency rates on our earnings.\nHistorically, we have not had significant exposure to foreign currency risk. Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of income in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report\n \nreflects net foreign currency gains of $5.6 million in the year ended \nDecember 31, 2024\n and net foreign currency losses of $2.6 million in the year ended\n \nDecember 31, 2023. \nOther Risks. \nFor a discussion about our concentration of credit risk; cash and cash equivalents; and investments in COLI assets, refer to Notes 4, 15, 16 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report\n \nfor additional information.\n57\nITEM 8.\nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\nINDEX TO QUANTA SERVICES, INC.’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \nPage\nReport of Management\n59\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n (PCAOB ID \n238\n)\n60\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n63\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n64\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n65\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n66\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\n67\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n68\n58\nREPORT OF MANAGEMENT\nManagement’s Report on Financial Information and Procedures\nThe accompanying financial statements of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries were prepared by management. These financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, applying certain estimates and judgments as required.\nOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon the criteria established in \nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurances and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nThe effectiveness of Quanta Services, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which appears herein.\nManagement’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 excluded the eight businesses we acquired in 2024. Such exclusion was in accordance with guidance from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of recently acquired businesses may be omitted in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, provided the acquisition took place within twelve months of management’s evaluation. These acquisitions comprised approximately 5.5% and 6.7% of our consolidated assets and revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and included the acquisition of Cupertino Electric, Inc., which comprised approximately 3.7% and 5.3% of our consolidated assets and revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n59\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Quanta Services, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Quanta Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income (loss), of equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"consolidated financial statements\"). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management has excluded eight businesses from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 because they were acquired by the Company in purchase business combinations during 2024. We have also excluded these eight acquired businesses from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. These acquired businesses, each of which is wholly-owned, comprised, in the aggregate, total assets and total revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting of appropriately 5.5% and 6.7%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. The most significant of these acquired businesses, representing 3.7% of consolidated total assets and 5.3% of consolidated total revenues was Cupertino Electric, Inc.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n60\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRevenue Recognition - Determination of Total Estimated Contract Costs and Revenue Related to Estimated Change Orders and Claims for Contracts Recognized Over Time\nAs described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes certain revenue over time as it performs its obligations because there is a continuous transfer of control of the deliverable to the customer. Under unit-price contracts with more than an insignificant amount of partially completed units and fixed price contracts, the Company recognizes revenue as performance obligations are satisfied over time, with the percentage of completion generally measured as the percentage of costs incurred to total estimated costs for such performance obligation. During the year ended December 31, 2024, approximately 60.0%\n \nof the Company’s revenues recognized were associated with this revenue recognition method. Contract costs include all direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. Actual revenues and project costs can vary, sometimes substantially, from previous estimates due to changes in a variety of factors, including unforeseen or changed circumstances not included in management’s cost estimates or covered by the contracts. Changes in cost estimates on certain contracts may result in the issuance of change orders, which can be approved or unapproved by the customer, or the assertion of contract claims. Management determines the probability that costs associated with change orders and claims will be recovered based on, among other things, contractual entitlement, past practices with the customer, specific discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer and verbal approvals by the customer. The Company recognizes amounts associated with change orders and claims as revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and the amount of any such adjustment can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had recognized revenues of $733.6 million related to unapproved change orders and claims included as contract price adjustments that were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition for contracts recognized over time is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when determining the total estimated contract costs and revenue related to estimated change orders and claims and (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s estimate of the total estimated contract costs and revenue related to estimated change orders and claims. \nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls related to the determination of total estimated contract costs and revenue related to estimated change orders and claims. These procedures also included, among others, for a sample of contracts (i) testing management’s process for determining the total estimated contract costs, which included evaluating contracts and other documents, and testing the underlying contract costs; (ii) evaluating management’s ability to reasonably estimate total contract costs by performing a comparison of the total estimated contract costs as compared with prior period estimates, including evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to the total estimated contract costs; (iii) testing management’s process for determining the revenue related to estimated change orders and claims, which included evaluating management’s assessment of whether it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted, and testing the amount of any such adjustment for the change order or claim; and (iv) evaluating management’s methodologies and the consistency of management’s methodologies over the lives of contracts.\nAcquisition of Cupertino Electric, Inc. – Valuation of Customer Relationships and Trade Name Intangible Assets\nAs described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Cupertino Electric, Inc. on July 17, 2024. The acquisition resulted in $669 million of identifiable intangible assets being recorded, of which $404 million and $175 million related to the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets, respectively. The fair value of customer relationships is estimated as of the date a business is acquired based on the value-in-use concept utilizing the income approach, specifically the multi-period excess earnings method. This method discounts to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the customer relationships, with consideration given to customer contract renewals and estimated customer attrition rates. The fair value of trade names is estimated using the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method, which is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty for use of the trade name. The significant assumptions used by management in determining the fair values of customer relationships intangible assets include future revenues, margins, discount rates and customer attrition rates. The significant assumptions used \n61\nby management in determining the fair value of trade name intangible assets include future revenues, royalty rates, and discount rates. \nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Cupertino Electric, Inc. is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to future revenues, margins, and the customer attrition rate for the customer relationships intangible asset and future revenues and the royalty rate for the trade name intangible asset; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets acquired and the development of significant assumptions related to future revenues, margins, and the customer attrition rate for the customer relationships intangible asset, and the significant assumptions related to future revenues and the royalty rate for the trade name intangible asset. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement; (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets acquired; (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings method and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions related to future revenues, margins, and the customer attrition rate for the customer relationships intangible asset; (iv) evaluating the appropriateness of the relief-from-royalty method and the reasonableness of the significant assumptions related to future revenues and the royalty rate for the trade name intangible asset; and (v) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the multi-period excess earnings and relief-from-royalty methods. Evaluating the reasonableness of future revenues for the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets and margins for the customer relationships intangible asset involved considering (i) the current and past performance of the acquired business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the multi-period excess earnings and relief-from-royalty methods and the reasonableness of the customer attrition rate assumption for the customer relationships intangible asset and the royalty rate assumption for the trade name intangible asset. \n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n \nHouston, Texas\nFebruary 20, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\n62\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\n1.\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS:\nQuanta Services, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, Quanta) is a leading provider of comprehensive infrastructure solutions for the electric and gas utility, renewable energy, technology, communications, pipeline and energy industries in the United States, Canada, Australia and select other international markets. We provide engineering, procurement, construction, upgrade and repair and maintenance services for infrastructure within each of these industries, including electric power transmission and distribution networks; substation facilities; wind and solar generation and transmission and battery storage facilities; electrical systems for data center, commercial and industrial facilities; communications and cable multi-system operator networks; gas utility systems; pipeline transmission systems and facilities; and downstream industrial facilities.\n2.\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES:\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Quanta include the accounts of Quanta Services, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, which are also referred to as its operating companies. The consolidated financial statements also include the accounts of certain of Quanta’s investments in joint ventures, which are either consolidated or proportionately consolidated, as discussed in the following summary of accounting policies. Unless the context requires otherwise, references to Quanta include Quanta Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. \nQuanta holds interests in various joint ventures and other partially owned entities entered into in the normal course of business. Certain of these interests are investments in variable interest entities (VIE). If an entity is identified as a VIE, management determines whether Quanta is the entity’s primary beneficiary and must consolidate the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity with both (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. When Quanta is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, the VIE is consolidated and equity interests held by third parties are accounted for as non-controlling interests. See \nInvestments in Affiliates and Other\n below and Note 16 for additional information on joint venture liabilities.\n \nUse of Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date the financial statements are published, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented. Quanta reviews all significant estimates affecting its consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any necessary adjustments prior to their publication. Judgments and estimates are based on Quanta’s beliefs and assumptions derived from information available at the time such judgments and estimates are made. Uncertainties with respect to such estimates and assumptions are inherent in the preparation of financial statements. Estimates are primarily used in Quanta’s assessment of revenue recognition for construction contracts, including contractual change orders and claims; allowance for credit losses; valuation of inventory; useful lives of assets; fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill, other intangibles and long-lived asset impairments; fair value assumptions in analyzing equity and other investment impairments; purchase price consideration and allocations; acquisition-related contingent consideration liabilities; contingent liabilities associated with, among other things, legal proceedings and claims, parent guarantees and indemnity obligations; estimated insurance claims and recoveries; stock-based compensation; classification of operating company revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes; provision for income taxes; and uncertain tax positions.\nRevenue Recognition \nSee Note 4 for Quanta’s accounting policy related to revenue recognition and related balance sheet accounts.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nQuanta considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents, which are carried at fair value. Quanta’s cash equivalents are categorized as Level 1 assets, as all values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets in an active market. \nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, and consist primarily of solar tracker installation materials, safety equipment, transmission and distribution parts and equipment, transformer parts, and other construction supplies and parts held for use in the ordinary course of business. Cost is determined by using either the first-in, first-out (FIFO) \n69\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nmethod or the average costing method. Inventories also include certain job specific materials not yet installed, which are valued using the specific identification method.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is computed using the straight-line method, net of estimated salvage values, over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements are capitalized and amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset. \nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense when incurred. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments, which extend the useful lives of existing equipment, are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the assets. Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable. When an evaluation is required, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset group are compared to the asset group’s carrying amount to determine if an impairment is necessary. The effect of any impairment involves expensing the difference between the fair value of the asset group and its carrying amount in the period incurred.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair market value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses and is stated at cost. Quanta has recorded goodwill in connection with its historical acquisitions of businesses. Goodwill is required to be assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level, which represents the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level for which discrete financial information is available. \nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year, or more frequently if events or circumstances arise which indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit with goodwill is below its carrying amount. Quanta assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed for each reporting unit include, among other things, deterioration in macroeconomic conditions; declining financial performance; deterioration in the operational environment; an expectation of selling or disposing of a portion of a reporting unit; a significant change in market, management, business strategy or business climate; a loss of a significant customer; increased competition; a sustained decrease in share price; or a decrease in Quanta’s market capitalization below book value.\nIf Quanta believes that, as a result of its qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded to “Asset impairment charges” in the consolidated statements of operations. \nQuanta generally determines the fair value of its reporting units using a weighted combination of the income approach (discounted cash flow method) and market multiple valuation techniques (market guideline transaction method and market guideline public company method). \nUnder the discounted cash flow method, Quanta determines fair value based on the estimated future cash flows for each reporting unit, discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted industry weighted average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk for each reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. \nUnder the market guideline transaction and market guideline public company methods, Quanta determines the estimated fair value for each of its reporting units by applying transaction multiples and public company multiples, respectively, to each reporting unit’s historical and projected results. The transaction multiples are based on observed purchase transactions for similar businesses adjusted for size, volatility and risk. The public company multiples are based on peer group multiples adjusted for size, volatility and risk. For the market guideline public company method, Quanta adds a reasonable control premium, which is estimated as the premium that would be appropriate to convert the reporting unit value to a controlling interest basis.\nOther Intangible Assets\nQuanta’s identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships; backlog; trade names; non-compete agreements; curriculum; patented rights, developed technology, process certifications and other, all of which are subject to amortization. \nDefinite-lived intangible assets are amortized based upon the estimated consumption of their economic benefits, or on a \n70\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nstraight-line basis if the pattern of economic benefit cannot otherwise be reliably estimated. Quanta evaluates identifiable intangible assets with the associated long-lived asset group for impairment whenever impairment indicators are present. If the carrying amount of an identifiable intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded to “Asset impairment charges” in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \nLeases\nLeases with terms longer than 12 months are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as lease assets and lease liabilities. If at inception of a contract a lease is identified, Quanta recognizes a lease asset and corresponding liability based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term as of the commencement date. Lease assets also include any initial direct costs incurred less any lease incentives received. \nFinance leases are leases that meet any of the following criteria: the lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset at the end of the lease term; the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to purchase the underlying asset; the lease term is for the major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset; the present value of the sum of the lease payments and any additional residual value guarantee by the lessee equals or exceeds substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset; or the underlying asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. A lease that does not meet any of these criteria is considered an operating lease. After the commencement date, lease cost for an operating lease is recognized over the remaining lease term on a straight-line basis, while lease cost for a finance lease is based on the depreciation of the lease asset and interest on the lease liability. Lease expense for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe terms of Quanta’s lease arrangements vary, and certain leases include one or more of the following: a renewal option, a cancellation option, a residual value guarantee, a purchase option or an escalation clause. An option to extend or terminate a lease is accounted for when assessing a lease term when it is reasonably certain that Quanta will exercise such option. Additionally, certain of Quanta’s real estate and equipment arrangements contain both lease and non-lease components (e.g., maintenance services). Quanta made a policy election that allows an entity to not separate lease components from their associated non-lease components under arrangements with both components. Accordingly, Quanta accounts for both lease and non-lease components of such arrangements under the lease accounting guidance. \nDeterminations with respect to lease term, discount rate, variable lease cost and future minimum lease payments require the use of judgment based on the facts and circumstances related to each lease. Quanta considers various factors, including economic incentives, penalties, and business need, to determine the likelihood that a renewal option will be exercised. Unless a renewal option is reasonably certain to be exercised, which is typically at Quanta’s sole discretion, the initial non-cancelable lease term is used. Quanta generally uses its incremental borrowing rates to determine the present value of future minimum lease payments.\nInvestments in Affiliates and Other \nIn the normal course of business, Quanta enters into various types of investment arrangements, each having unique terms and conditions. These investments may include equity interests held by Quanta in business entities, including general or limited partnerships, contractual joint ventures, or other forms of equity or profit participation. Quanta also enters into strategic partnerships with customers and infrastructure investors to provide fully integrated infrastructure solutions on certain projects, including planning and feasibility analyses, engineering, design, procurement, construction and project operation and maintenance. These projects include public-private partnerships and concessions, along with private infrastructure projects such as build, own, operate (and in some cases transfer) and build-to-suit arrangements. In cases where Quanta determines that it is not the primary beneficiary but has an undivided interest in the assets, liabilities, revenues and profits of an unincorporated VIE (e.g., a general partnership interest), such amounts are consolidated on a basis proportional to Quanta’s ownership interest in the unincorporated entity. See Note 8 for additional information on Quanta’s investments and Note 16 for additional information on joint venture liabilities.\nEquity Method Investments\n Investments in affiliated entities in which Quanta does not have a controlling financial interest, but over which Quanta has the ability to exercise significant influence, usually because Quanta holds a voting interest of between 20% and 50% in the affiliated entity, are accounted for using the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting, investments are stated initially at cost and are adjusted for subsequent additional investments and Quanta’s proportionate share of profit or loss and distributions. Certain of Quanta’s equity method investments are equity interests in private equity funds. These underlying private equity funds are carried at fair value. Quanta’s profit or loss is determined by its share of the change in fair value.\nQuanta’s equity method investments are reported in “Other assets, net” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Quanta’s share of net income or losses of these investments is reported as “Equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates” within operating income when the investee is integral to the operations of Quanta, and is reported as “Other income \n71\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\n(expense), net” when the investee is not considered integral to the business. Additionally, Quanta utilizes the cumulative earnings approach to determine whether distributions received from equity method investees are returns on investment and classified as operating cash inflows or returns of investment and reported as investing cash flows.\nQuanta recognizes impairments on equity method investments if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value and considered other-than-temporary. Any impairment losses related to integral unconsolidated affiliates are included in “Equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates,” while any impairments related to non-integral unconsolidated affiliates are included in “Other income (expense), net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nMarketable and Non-Marketable Equity Securities\nInvestments in entities over which Quanta does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are either considered marketable securities or non-marketable equity securities. The carrying value of any marketable and non-marketable equity securities is reported in “Other assets, net” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. \nNon-marketable equity securities are equity securities without a readily determinable fair value that are measured and recorded using a measurement alternative that measures the securities at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment in the same company. Non-marketable equity securities are measured on a nonrecurring basis and recorded at fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the reporting period. Quanta recognizes impairments on non-marketable equity securities if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less than its carrying value. Any changes in fair value and any impairments of non-marketable equity securities are reported in “Other income (expense), net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nQuanta follows the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the underlying assets or liabilities are recovered or settled.\nQuanta regularly evaluates valuation allowances established for deferred tax assets (DTAs) for which future realization is uncertain, including in connection with changes in tax laws. The estimation of required valuation allowances includes estimates of future taxable income. The ultimate realization of DTAs is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the jurisdiction of the DTA during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Quanta considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. If actual future taxable income differs from these estimates, Quanta may not realize DTAs to the extent estimated.\nQuanta records reserves for income taxes related to certain tax positions when management considers it more likely than not that additional taxes may be due in excess of amounts reflected on income tax returns filed. When recording these reserves, Quanta assumes that taxing authorities have full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts. Quanta continually reviews exposure to additional tax obligations, and as further information is known or events occur, changes in tax reserves may be recorded. Quanta adjusts its tax contingencies accrual and income tax provision in the period in which matters are effectively settled with tax authorities at amounts different from Quanta’s established accrual, when the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available. To the extent interest and penalties may be assessed by taxing authorities on any underpayment of income tax, such amounts have been accrued and included in the provision for income taxes.\nU.S. federal and state and foreign income tax laws and regulations are voluminous and often ambiguous. As such, Quanta is required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding its tax positions that could materially affect amounts recognized in future consolidated balance sheets, statements of operations and statements of comprehensive income.\n \nDeferred Financing Costs\nCapitalized deferred financing costs related to Quanta’s senior credit facility (other than deferred financing costs related to the term loan, which are recorded along with deferred financing costs related to the senior notes in a contra account to long-term debt) are included in “Other assets, net” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are amortized to “Interest and other financing expenses” on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective agreements giving rise to the costs, which Quanta believes approximates the effective interest rate method.\n \n72\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock are computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share attributable to common stock is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period adjusted for all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, except in cases where the effect of the common stock equivalents would be antidilutive.\n \nInsurance\nSee Note 16 for Quanta’s accounting policy related to insurance and related balance sheet accounts. \nStock-Based Compensation\nRestricted Stock Units to be Settled in Stock \nQuanta recognizes compensation expense for restricted stock units (RSUs) to be settled in common stock based on the grant date fair value of the awards, which is the number of RSUs granted multiplied by the closing price of Quanta’s common stock on the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. The resulting compensation expense for time-based RSU awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. The non-cash stock compensation expense related to RSUs to be settled in common stock is included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses.” \nRSU awards to be settled in common stock are subject to forfeiture, restrictions on transfer and certain other conditions until vesting, which generally occurs in \nthree\n equal annual installments following the date of grant or over a period of \nfive\n to \nten years\n following the date of grant. Holders of RSUs to be settled in common stock awarded under the Quanta Services, Inc. 2019 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (the Omnibus Plan) are entitled to cash dividend equivalent payments in an amount equal to any cash dividend payable on account of the underlying Quanta common stock; however, payment of such amounts is not made until the RSUs vest, such that the dividend equivalent payments are subject to forfeiture until vesting of the applicable RSUs.\nPayments made by Quanta to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations associated with stock-based compensation are classified as financing cash flows.\nPerformance Stock Units to be Settled in Stock \nQuanta recognizes compensation expense for performance stock units (PSUs) to be settled in common stock based on the fair value of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures. The resulting compensation expense for PSU awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. Non-cash stock compensation expense related to PSUs to be settled in common stock is included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses.”\nPSUs provide for the issuance of shares of common stock upon vesting, which generally occurs following a \nthree-year\n performance period based on achievement of performance metrics established by the Compensation Committee of Quanta’s Board of Directors, including financial and operational goals and Quanta’s total shareholder return as compared to a broad equity market index. The final number of shares of common stock issuable upon vesting of PSUs can range from \n0\n% to \n200\n% of the number of PSUs initially granted, depending on the level of achievement. Holders of PSUs are entitled to cash dividend equivalent payments in an amount equal to any cash dividend payable on account of the underlying Quanta common stock that ultimately vests; however, payment of such amounts is not made until the PSUs vest, such that the dividend equivalent payments are subject to forfeiture until vesting of the applicable PSUs. \nThe grant date fair value of the PSUs is determined as follows: (i) for the portion of the awards based on company financial and operational performance metrics, by multiplying the number of units granted by the closing price of Quanta’s common stock on the date of grant and (ii) for the portion of the awards based on relative total shareholder return, by multiplying the number of units granted by a stock price estimated by utilizing a Monte Carlo simulation valuation methodology. Quanta recognizes compensation expense for PSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, based on the forecasted achievement of the company financial and operational performance metrics and forecasted performance with respect to relative total shareholder return, multiplied by the grant date fair value of the total number of shares of common stock that Quanta anticipates will be issued based on such achievement for the completed portion of the performance period. The compensation expense related to outstanding PSUs can vary from period to period based on changes in forecasted achievement of established performance metrics, the total number of shares of common stock that Quanta anticipates will be issued upon vesting of such PSUs and changes in forfeiture estimates. \nPayments made by Quanta to satisfy employee tax withholding obligations associated with stock-based compensation are classified as financing cash flows.\n73\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nFunctional Currency and Translation of Financial Statements\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for the majority of Quanta’s operations, which are primarily located within the United States. The functional currency for Quanta’s foreign operations, which are primarily located in Canada and Australia, is typically the currency of the country where the foreign operating company is located and transacts the majority of its activities, including billings, financing, payroll and other expenditures. When preparing its consolidated financial statements, Quanta translates the financial statements of its foreign operating companies from their functional currency into U.S. dollars. Statements of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows are translated at average monthly rates, while balance sheets are translated at month-end exchange rates. The translation of the balance sheet results in translation gains or losses that are included as a separate component of equity under “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Gains and losses arising from transactions not denominated in functional currencies are included within “Other income (expense), net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nQuanta categorizes assets and liabilities, measured at fair value, into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. Level 2 inputs are quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs or significant value-drivers are observable. Level 3 inputs are model-derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or significant value-drivers are unobservable. Fair value measurements are classified according to the lowest level input or value-driver that is significant to the valuation. \nInputs, valuation techniques to estimate the fair value and levels are disclosed within the notes to these consolidated financial statements\n.\n3.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:\nRecently Adopted Guidance\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued an update that, among other things, requires public entities to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, provide an amount for other segment items by reportable segment and provide all segment disclosures required on an annual basis in interim periods. Additionally, the update requires entities to disclose the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Retrospective application is required. Quanta adopted this update effective December 31, 2024.\nIn June 2022, the FASB issued an update that clarifies the guidance in FASB ASC 820 (Fair Value Measurement) for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The update prohibits entities from taking into account contractual restrictions on the sale of equity securities when estimating fair value and introduces required disclosures for such transactions. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023. This guidance will increase the fair market value of the consideration paid in equity securities in a business combination, and therefore it may increase the amount allocated to goodwill. Quanta adopted this update effective January 1, 2024, and it did not have a material impact on Quanta’s consolidated financial statements.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued an update that requires incremental disclosures about specific expense categories. Entities are required to disclose in the notes to financial statements the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, intangible asset amortization and selling expense included in each relevant expense caption of the statements of operations. The standard also requires disclosure of the amount, and a qualitative description of, other items remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption and both prospective and retrospective application are permitted. Quanta is currently assessing the effect of this update.\nIn March 2024, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued its final climate disclosure rule (the Final Rule) that requires public entities to disclose certain material climate-related information in annual reports and registration statements, including disclosure of material impacts as a result of severe weather events and other natural conditions and material Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. The Final Rule requires disclosures to be made prospectively, with \n74\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\ninformation for prior periods required only to the extent the information was disclosed in a prior SEC filing. Certain requirements of the Final Rule were originally effective for fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2025, with phase-in periods for additional requirements. However, on April 4, 2024, the SEC issued a stay pending judicial review of the Final Rule in U.S. federal court. Quanta is currently assessing the effect of the Final Rule as the judicial review continues.\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued an update that expands disclosures for tax rate reconciliation tables, primarily by requiring disaggregation of income taxes paid by jurisdiction, as well as greater disaggregation within the rate reconciliation. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2025. Early adoption and retrospective application are permitted. Quanta is currently assessing the effect of this update.\n4.     \nREVENUE RECOGNITION AND RELATED BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS:\nContracts\nQuanta’s services include the design, new construction, upgrade and repair and maintenance of infrastructure primarily in the utility, renewable energy, communications and pipeline and energy industries. These services are generally provided pursuant to master service agreements (MSAs), repair and maintenance contracts, and fixed price and non-fixed price construction contracts. These contracts are classified into three categories based on the methods by which transaction prices are determined and revenue is recognized: unit-price contracts, cost-plus contracts and fixed price contracts. Transaction prices for unit-price contracts are determined on a per unit basis, transaction prices for cost-plus contracts are determined by applying a profit margin to costs incurred on the contracts and transaction prices for fixed price contracts are determined on a lump-sum basis. All of Quanta’s revenues are recognized from contracts with its customers. In addition to the considerations described below, revenue is not recognized unless collectability under the contract is considered probable, the contract has commercial substance and the contract has been approved. Additionally, the contract must contain payment terms, as well as the rights and commitments of both parties.\nPerformance Obligations \nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a distinct good or service. Most of Quanta’s contracts are considered to have a single performance obligation whereby Quanta is required to integrate complex activities and equipment into a deliverable for a customer. For contracts with multiple performance obligations, Quanta allocates a portion of the total transaction price to each performance obligation using its best estimate of the standalone selling price of the distinct good or service associated with each performance obligation. Standalone selling price is estimated using the expected costs plus a margin.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations was approximately $\n16.76\n billion and $\n13.89\n billion, with \n67.1\n% and \n66.9\n% expected to be recognized in the subsequent \ntwelve months\n. These amounts represent management’s estimates of the consolidated revenues that are expected to be realized from the remaining portion of firm orders under fixed price contracts not yet completed or for which work had not yet begun as of such dates. For purposes of calculating remaining performance obligations, Quanta includes all estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and VIEs, revenues from funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent they are reasonably expected to be realized and revenues from change orders and claims to the extent management believes additional contract revenues will be earned and are deemed probable of collection. Excluded from remaining performance obligations are potential orders under MSAs and expected revenues under certain non-fixed price contracts.\nRecognition of Revenue Upon Satisfaction of Performance Obligations\nA transaction price is determined for each contract, and that amount is allocated to each performance obligation within the contract and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. Quanta recognizes certain revenue over time as it performs its obligations because there is a continuous transfer of control of the deliverable to the customer. Under unit-price contracts with an insignificant amount of partially completed units, Quanta recognizes revenue as units are completed based on contractual pricing amounts. Under unit-price contracts with more than an insignificant amount of partially completed units and fixed price contracts, Quanta recognizes revenues as performance obligations are satisfied over time, with the percentage of completion generally measured as the percentage of costs incurred to total estimated costs for such performance obligation. Under cost-plus contracts, Quanta recognizes revenue on an input basis, as labor hours are incurred, materials are utilized and services are performed.\nUnder contracts where Quanta has a right to consideration in an amount that directly corresponds to the value of completed performance, Quanta recognizes revenue in such amount and does not include such performance as a remaining \n75\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nperformance obligation. Also, contract consideration is not adjusted for a significant financing component if payment is expected to be collected less than one year from when the services are performed.\nContract costs include all direct materials, labor and subcontract costs and indirect costs related to contract performance, such as indirect labor, supplies, tools, repairs and depreciation costs. The majority of the materials associated with Quanta’s work are owner-furnished, and therefore not included in contract revenues and costs. Additionally, Quanta may incur incremental costs to obtain certain contracts, such as selling and marketing costs, bid and proposal costs, sales commissions, and legal fees or initial set-up or mobilization costs, certain of which can be capitalized. There were no significant capitalized costs during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nQuanta provides limited warranties to customers for work performed under its contracts that typically extend for a limited duration following substantial completion of its work on a project. Such warranties are not sold separately and do not provide customers with a service other than the assurance of compliance with agreed-upon specifications. Accordingly, these types of warranties are not considered to be separate performance obligations, but any costs incurred or expected to be incurred, by Quanta in connection with these warranties are included in contract costs. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Quanta has not been subject to a significant number of material warranty claims in connection with its services.\nContract Estimates and Changes in Estimates\nActual revenues and project costs can vary, sometimes substantially, from previous estimates due to changes in a variety of factors, including unforeseen or changed circumstances not included in Quanta’s cost estimates or covered by its contracts. Some of the factors that can result in positive changes in estimates on projects include successful execution through project risks, reduction of estimated project costs or increases of estimated revenues. Some of the factors that can result in negative changes in estimates include concealed or unknown site conditions; changes to or disputes with customers regarding the scope of services; changes in estimates related to the length of time to complete a performance obligation; changes or delays with respect to permitting and regulatory requirements and materials; changes in the cost of equipment, commodities, materials or skilled labor; unanticipated costs or claims due to delays or failure to perform by customers or third parties; customer failure to provide, or supply chain and logistical challenges related to, required materials or equipment; errors in engineering, specifications or designs; project modifications; adverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and other emergencies; and performance and quality issues causing delay (including payment of liquidated damages) or requiring rework or replacement. Any changes in estimates could result in changes to profitability or losses associated with the related performance obligations. For example, estimated costs for a performance obligation may increase from an original estimate, and contractual provisions may not allow for adequate compensation or reimbursement for such additional costs. Changes in estimated revenues, costs and profit are recorded in the period they are determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated. Contract losses are recognized in full when they are determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nAdditionally, changes in cost estimates on certain contracts may result in the issuance of change orders, which can be approved or unapproved by the customer, or the assertion of contract claims. Quanta determines the probability that costs associated with change orders and claims will be recovered based on, among other things, contractual entitlement, past practices with the customer, specific discussions or preliminary negotiations with the customer and verbal approvals by the customer. Quanta recognizes amounts associated with change orders and claims as revenue if it is probable that the contract price will be adjusted and the amount of any such adjustment can be reasonably estimated. Most of Quanta’s change orders are for services that are not distinct from an existing contract and are accounted for as part of an existing contract on a cumulative catch-up basis. Quanta accounts for a change order as a separate contract if the additional goods or services are distinct from and increase the scope of the contract, and the price of the contract increases by an amount commensurate to Quanta’s standalone selling price for the additional goods or services.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, Quanta had recognized revenues of $\n733.6\n million and $\n778.9\n million related to unapproved change orders and claims included as contract price adjustments primarily in “Contract assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These change orders and claims were in the process of being negotiated in the normal course of business and represent management’s estimates of additional contract revenues that have been earned and are probable of collection. The largest component of the revenues recognized related to unapproved change orders and claims as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is associated with a large renewable transmission project in Canada. During 2021 and 2022, decreased productivity and additional costs arose from delays, administrative requirements and labor issues due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including incremental governmental requirements and worksite restrictions. During 2023, additional costs arose from residual impacts associated with the aforementioned items, as well as work resequencing and acceleration, access delays, and logistical challenges and other issues outside of Quanta’s control. As of March 31, 2024, the project was substantially completed.\nVariable consideration amounts, including performance incentives, early pay discounts and penalties, may also cause changes in contract estimates. The amount of variable consideration is estimated based on the most likely amount that is deemed probable of realization. Contract consideration is adjusted for variable consideration when it is probable that a \n76\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nsignificant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur once the uncertainty related to the variable consideration is resolved.\nChanges in estimates can result in the recognition of revenue in a current period for performance obligations that were satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods or the reversal of previously recognized revenue if the currently estimated revenue is less than the previous estimate. The impact of a change in contract estimate is measured as the difference between the revenue or gross profit recognized in the prior period as compared to the revenue or gross profit which would have been recognized had the revised estimate been used as the basis of recognition in the prior period. Changes in estimates can also result in contract losses, which are recognized in full when they are determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nRevenues were positively impacted by \n0.2\n%, \n0.4\n% and \n0.7\n% during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 as a result of changes in estimates associated with performance obligations on fixed price contracts partially satisfied prior to December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021. \nOperating results for the year ended December 31, 2024 were impacted by less than \n5\n% of gross profit as a result of aggregate changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress as of the year ended December 31, 2023. However, gross profit was negatively impacted by $\n22.6\n million as a result of decreased productivity associated with a large solar facility project in the United States (primarily incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2024) and by $\n37.0\n million as a result of increased costs related to a large solar facility project in the United States. These two projects were substantially complete as of December 31, 2024.\nAlso impacting the year ended December 31, 2024 was the recognition of gross profit of approximately $\n39.2\n million awarded from a large telecommunications project in Peru, that was terminated during 2019, in connection with payments received pursuant to an arbitration award as described in \nPeru Project Dispute\n in Note 16.\nOperating results for the year ended December 31, 2023 were impacted by less than \n5\n% of gross profit as a result of aggregate changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress as of December 31, 2022. However, gross profit was negatively impacted by $\n20.9\n million as a result of access delays, logistical challenges and other issues outside of Quanta’s control that increased costs associated with the large renewable transmission project in Canada referenced above.\nOperating results for the year ended December 31, 2022 were impacted by less than \n5\n% of gross profit as a result of aggregate changes in contract estimates related to projects that were in progress as of the corresponding prior year end. There were \nno\n material changes in estimates on any individual project.\nRevenues by Category\nThe following tables present Quanta’s revenue disaggregated by contract type and by geographic location, as determined by the job location (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBy contract type:\nFixed price contracts\n$\n13,307,321\n \n56.2\n \n%\n$\n10,251,037\n \n49.1\n \n%\n$\n7,282,537\n \n42.7\n \n%\nUnit-price contracts\n6,475,714\n \n27.4\n \n6,586,982\n \n31.5\n \n5,927,335\n \n34.7\n \nCost-plus contracts\n3,889,760\n \n16.4\n \n4,044,187\n \n19.4\n \n3,864,031\n \n22.6\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n23,672,795\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n20,882,206\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n17,073,903\n \n100.0\n \n%\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBy primary geographic location:\nUnited States\n$\n21,606,807\n \n91.3\n \n%\n$\n17,910,892\n \n85.8\n \n%\n$\n14,390,237\n \n84.3\n \n%\nCanada\n1,025,074\n \n4.3\n \n2,045,999\n \n9.8\n \n2,020,853\n \n11.8\n \nAustralia\n666,870\n \n2.8\n \n612,497\n \n2.9\n \n428,321\n \n2.5\n \nOthers\n374,044\n \n1.6\n \n312,818\n \n1.5\n \n234,492\n \n1.4\n \nTotal revenues\n$\n23,672,795\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n20,882,206\n \n100.0\n \n%\n$\n17,073,903\n \n100.0\n \n%\nAs described above, under fixed price contracts, as well as unit-price contracts with more than an insignificant amount of partially completed units, revenue is recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over time, with the percentage of completion generally measured as the percentage of costs incurred to total estimated costs for such performance obligation. \n77\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nApproximately \n60.0\n%, \n56.5\n% and \n51.6\n% of Quanta’s revenues recognized during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were associated with this revenue recognition method.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nWith respect to Quanta’s contracts, interim payments are typically received as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. As a result, under fixed price contracts and unit-price contracts with more than an insignificant amount of partially completed units, the timing of revenue recognition and contract billings results in contract assets and contract liabilities. Contract assets represent revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed and are current assets that are transferred to accounts receivable when billed or the billing rights become unconditional. Contract assets are not considered a significant financing component as they are intended to protect the customer in the event Quanta does not perform on its obligations under the contract. \nConversely, contract liabilities represent billings in excess of revenues. These arise under certain contracts that allow for upfront payments from the customer or contain contractual billing milestones, which result in billings that exceed the amount of revenues recognized for certain periods. Contract liabilities are current liabilities and are not considered to have a significant financing component, as they are used to meet working capital requirements that are generally higher in the early stages of a contract and are intended to protect Quanta from the other party failing to meet its obligations under the contract. Contract assets and liabilities are recorded on a performance obligation basis at the end of each reporting period.\nContract assets and liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands):\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nDecember 31, 2022\nContract assets\n$\n1,208,619\n \n$\n1,413,057\n \n$\n1,080,206\n \nContract liabilities\n$\n2,149,328\n \n$\n1,538,677\n \n$\n1,141,518\n \nContract assets and liabilities fluctuate period to period based on various factors, including, among others, changes in the number and size of projects in progress at period end; variability in billing and payment terms, such as up-front or advance billings, interim or milestone billings, or deferred billings; and recognized unapproved change orders and contract claims. The decrease in contract assets from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 was primarily due to the completion of certain large projects and the corresponding billing of amounts previously recorded as contract assets. The increase in contract assets from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to additional unapproved change orders and claims related to the large renewable transmission project in Canada referenced above, as well as on other projects on which the timing of billings lagged behind the completion of work. The increase in contract liabilities from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 was primarily due to recent acquisitions and an increase in contract liabilities related to favorable billing terms on certain large projects. The increase in contract liabilities from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the timing of billing in relation to costs incurred on renewable projects and contract liabilities acquired as part of a 2023 acquisition.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, Quanta recognized revenue of approximately $\n1.42\n billion, $\n1.04\n billion and $\n695.1\n million related to contract liabilities outstanding as of the end each respective prior year.\nAccounts Receivable, Allowance for Credit Losses and Concentrations of Credit Risk \nQuanta determines its allowance for credit losses based on an estimate of expected credit losses for financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable and contract assets. The assessment of the allowance for credit losses involves certain judgments and estimates. Management estimates the allowance balance using relevant available information from internal and external sources relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Expected credit losses are estimated by evaluating trends with respect to Quanta’s historical write-off experience and applying historical loss ratios to pools of financial assets with similar risk characteristics. Quanta has determined that it has \ntwo\n risk pools for the purpose of calculating its historical credit loss experience.\nQuanta’s historical loss ratio and its determination of risk pools, which are used to calculate expected credit losses, may be adjusted for changes in customer credit concentrations within its portfolio of financial assets, changes in customers’ ability to pay, and other considerations, such as economic and market changes, changes to regulatory or technological environments affecting customers and the consistency between current and forecasted economic conditions and the historical economic conditions used to derive historical loss ratios. At the end of each quarter, management reassesses these and other relevant factors, including the impact of uncertainty and challenges in the overall economy and in Quanta’s industries and markets, (e.g., inflationary pressure, supply chain and other logistical challenges and increased interest rates).\nAdditional allowance for credit losses is established for financial asset balances with specific customers where collectability has been determined to be improbable based on customer specific facts and circumstances. Quanta considers accounts receivable delinquent after 30 days but, absent certain specific considerations, generally does not consider such \n78\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\namounts delinquent in its credit loss analysis unless the accounts receivable are at least 120 days outstanding. In addition, management monitors the credit quality of its receivables by, among other things, obtaining credit ratings for significant customers, assessing economic and market conditions and evaluating material changes to a customer’s business, cash flows and financial condition. Should anticipated recoveries relating to receivables fail to materialize, including anticipated recoveries relating to bankruptcies or other workout situations, Quanta could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided.\nAccounts receivable are written-off against the allowance for credit losses if they are deemed uncollectible. \nActivity in Quanta’s allowance for credit losses consisted of the following (in thousands):     \nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance at beginning of year\n$\n13,962\n \n$\n15,644\n \n$\n49,749\n \nIncrease in provision for credit losses\n4,279\n \n5,927\n \n350\n \nWrite-offs charged against the allowance net of recoveries of amounts previously written off\n(\n3,056\n)\n(\n7,609\n)\n(\n34,455\n)\nBalance at end of year\n$\n15,185\n \n$\n13,962\n \n$\n15,644\n \nThe above activity relates to the largest risk pool Quanta utilizes for assessing credit loss. The second risk pool represents approximately \n13\n% of Quanta’s consolidated financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 and did not have any allowance for credit loss or experience any credit loss during the periods presented. Quanta’s customers generally have high credit ratings. In addition, the customers in the second risk pool typically pre-approve invoices and often receive project financing.\nProvision for credit losses is included in “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the consolidated statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Quanta determined that $\n31.7\n million of receivables that were fully reserved in previous periods were uncollectible, and as such wrote off the receivables against their related allowances. The receivables were from Limetree Bay Refining, LLC, which filed for bankruptcy in July 2021, and an affiliate, customers within Quanta’s Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions (Underground and Infrastructure) segment. Provisions for such receivables were recognized during 2021.\nQuanta is subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to its receivable position for services Quanta has performed for customers. Quanta grants credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral. As of December 31, 2023, one customer within the Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions (Renewable Energy) segment associated with the large renewable transmission project in Canada described above represented \n10\n% of Quanta’s consolidated receivable position, which includes amounts related to contract assets. No customer represented 10% or more of Quanta’s consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022, and no customer represented 10% or more of Quanta’s consolidated receivable position as of December 31, 2024. \nCertain contracts allow customers to withhold a small percentage of billings pursuant to retainage provisions, and such amounts are generally due upon completion of the contract and acceptance of the project by the customer. Based on Quanta’s experience in recent years, the majority of these retainage balances are expected to be collected within one year. Retainage balances with expected settlement dates within one year of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $\n666.5\n million and $\n610.0\n million, which are included in “Accounts receivable.” Retainage balances with expected settlement dates beyond one year were $\n143.6\n million and $\n78.7\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and are included in “Other assets, net.” \nQuanta recognizes unbilled receivables for non-fixed price contracts within “Accounts receivable” in certain circumstances, such as when revenues have been earned and recorded but the amount cannot be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date or when amounts arise from routine lags in billing. These balances do not include revenues recognized for work performed under fixed-price contracts and unit-price contracts with more than an insignificant amount of partially completed units, as these amounts are recorded as “Contract assets.” As of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, unbilled receivables included in “Accounts receivable” were $\n859.9\n million, $\n743.6\n million and $\n823.9\n million. Quanta also recognizes unearned revenues for non-fixed price contracts when cash is received prior to recognizing revenues for the related performance obligation. Unearned revenues, which are included in “Accounts payable and accrued expenses,” were $\n97.9\n million, $\n58.6\n million and $\n59.6\n million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n5.    \nSEGMENT INFORMATION: \nQuanta’s operations are managed by senior executives who report to its Chief Executive Officer, the chief operating decision maker. The Chief Executive Officer uses operating income for each of Quanta’s reportable segments and considers \n79\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nforecast to actual variances to assess performance and when making decisions about allocating capital, craft skill labor and other resources. Quanta’s reportable segments are: Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions (Electric Power), Renewable Energy and Underground and Infrastructure. The Electric Power segment reflects the aggregation of the Electric Power and Telecommunication operating segments.\nElectric Power\n. Quanta’s Electric Power segment provides comprehensive services for the electric power, technology and communications markets. Services include, but are not limited to, the design, procurement, new construction, upgrade and repair and maintenance services for electric power transmission and distribution infrastructure, both overhead and underground, and substation facilities, along with other engineering and technical services, including services that support the implementation of upgrades by utilities to modernize and harden the electric power grid in order to ensure its safety and enhance reliability and to accommodate increased residential and commercial use of electric vehicles. In addition, this segment provides emergency restoration services, including the repair of infrastructure damaged by fire and inclement weather and the installation of “smart grid” technologies on electric power networks. This segment also provides comprehensive design and construction solutions to wireline and wireless communications companies; electrical systems for data center, commercial and industrial facilities; and cable multi-system operators and other customers within the communications industry, as well as other related services. Additionally, this segment manufactures power transformers and components for the electric utility, municipal power and industrial markets.\nRenewable Energy. \nQuanta’s Renewable Energy segment provides comprehensive infrastructure solutions to customers that are involved in the renewable energy industry. Services include, but are not limited to, engineering, procurement, new construction, repowering and repair and maintenance services for renewable generation facilities, such as utility-scale wind, solar and hydropower generation facilities and battery storage facilities, and engineering and construction services for transmission and other electrical infrastructure needed to interconnect and transmit electricity from renewable energy generation and battery storage facilities.\nUnderground and Infrastructure. \nQuanta’s Underground and Infrastructure segment provides comprehensive infrastructure solutions to customers involved in the transportation, distribution, storage, development and processing of natural gas, oil and other products. Services include, but are not limited to design, engineering, procurement, new construction, upgrade and repair and maintenance services for natural gas systems for gas utility customers; and pipeline protection, integrity testing, rehabilitation and replacement services. Additionally, Quanta serves the midstream and downstream industrial energy markets through catalyst replacement services, high-pressure and critical-path turnaround services, instrumentation and electrical services, piping, fabrication and storage tank services.\nQuanta’s segment results are derived from the types of services provided across its operating companies in each of its end user markets. Quanta’s entrepreneurial business model allows multiple operating companies to serve the same or similar customers and to provide a range of services across end user markets. Reportable segment information, including revenues and operating income by type of work, is gathered from each operating company. Classification of operating company revenues by type of work for segment reporting purposes can require judgment on the part of management. \nSegment operating expenses (excluding depreciation expense) primarily includes cost of services, such as wages and benefits; subcontractor costs; materials; certain equipment rental and maintenance costs, and other direct and indirect project costs, as well as allocated segment selling, general and administrative expenses. Integrated operations and common administrative support for Quanta’s operating companies require that allocations be made to determine segment profitability, including allocations of certain corporate shared and indirect operating costs as well as general and administrative costs. \nSeparate measures of Quanta’s assets and cash flows by reportable segment, including capital expenditures, are not produced or utilized by the Chief Executive Officer to evaluate segment performance since certain of Quanta’s fixed assets are used on an interchangeable basis across its reportable segments. As such, for reporting purposes, total depreciation expense is determined quarterly by allocating depreciation expense at each legal entity to Quanta’s reportable segments based on the ratio of each legal entity’s revenue contribution to each of Quanta’s segments. \nCorporate and non-allocated costs include corporate facility costs; non-allocated corporate salaries, benefits and incentive compensation; acquisition and integration costs; non-cash stock-based compensation; amortization related to intangible assets; asset impairment related to goodwill and intangible assets; and change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.\n80\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC.

The fair value of this software was \nzero\n at December 31, 2022.\nBeginning in the three months ending March 31, 2025, Quanta’s Chief Executive Officer reevaluated how he assesses performance and allocates resources, which resulted in a change in the reporting of management’s internal financial information. As a result, Quanta will begin reporting the results of its \ntwo\n operating segments, which will also be its \ntwo\n reportable segments: (1) Electric Infrastructure Solutions and (2) Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions. The Electric Infrastructure Solutions segment will consist of the historical Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments.\n \n6.     \nACQUISITIONS:\nSubsequent to December 31, 2024, Quanta acquired a business located in the United States that specializes in civil solutions, including site clearing, earthwork, soil stabilization and infrastructure development (which will be primarily included in the Underground and Infrastructure segment) and a business located in Australia that specializes in electrical engineering and the design and manufacturing of industrial technology solutions including control systems (which will primarily be included in the Electric Power and Underground and Infrastructure segments). The consideration for these transactions consisted of approximately $\n400.5\n million paid or payable in cash on the dates of the acquisitions and \n515,822\n shares of Quanta common stock, which had a fair value of $\n161.6\n million as of the respective acquisition dates. The final amount of consideration for these acquisitions remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including with respect to net working capital, tax estimates and other contractually agreed-upon adjustments to consideration. Additionally, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, the former owners of these businesses are eligible to receive potential payments of contingent consideration of up to approximately $\n109.5\n million to the extent the acquired businesses achieve certain financial and operating performance targets over a \nthree-year\n period. Quanta is in the process of performing procedures to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed related to these acquisitions, including the fair value assessment of contingent consideration, and will include the preliminary purchase price allocations in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025.\nOn July 17, 2024, Quanta completed the acquisition of Cupertino Electric, Inc. (CEI), which provides electrical infrastructure solutions, including engineering, procurement, project management, construction and modularization services, to the technology, renewable energy and infrastructure and commercial industries. CEI is located in the United States, and its results have been included in the Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments since the acquisition date. The aggregate consideration for the acquisition was approximately $\n2.04\n billion, which included approximately $\n1.65\n billion paid in cash, including payment for cash held by CEI as of the acquisition date, and \n882,926\n shares of Quanta common stock, which had a fair value of $\n216.3\n million as of the acquisition date. The cash consideration paid by Quanta, net of cash received from CEI, was $\n1.24\n billion. Additionally, the former equity holders and award holders of CEI are eligible for a potential contingent consideration payment of up to $\n200.0\n million based on achievement of certain financial performance targets during the \nthree-year\n post-acquisition period beginning in January 2025. To the extent payable, Quanta, at its sole discretion, can pay up to \n10\n% of any such contingent consideration amount in Quanta common stock. As of July 17, 2024, the fair value of the contingent consideration liability was $\n164.0\n million. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Quanta also acquired \nseven\n additional businesses located in the United States, including: a business that provides specialty environmental solutions to utility, industrial and petrochemical companies (primarily included in the Underground and Infrastructure segment); a business that specializes in testing, manufacturing and distributing safety equipment and supplies (primarily included in the Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments); a business that specializes in electrical infrastructure services for substations, data centers and governmental entities (primarily included in the Electric Power segment); a business that manufactures transmission and distribution equipment for the electric utility industry (primarily included in the Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments); a business that provides services and equipment related to aerial telecommunications infrastructure and networks (primarily included in the Electric Power segment); a business that provides services related to fiber optic networks (primarily included in the Electric Power segment); and a business that specializes in designing, manufacturing, and distributing liquid-filled power transformers primarily for electrical companies and utilities (primarily included in the Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments). The consideration for these businesses consisted of approximately $\n540.1\n million paid or payable in cash on the acquisition dates and \n334,472\n shares of Quanta common stock, which had a fair value of $\n74.8\n million as of the acquisition dates. The final amount of consideration for certain of these acquisitions remains subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including with respect to net \n82\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nworking capital. As of the dates of the respective acquisitions, the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities related to certain of these acquisitions was $\n24.3\n million. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, Quanta acquired \nfive\n businesses located in the United States including: a business that provides services related to high-voltage transmission lines, overhead and underground distribution, emergency restoration and industrial and commercial wiring and lighting (primarily included in the Electric Power segment); a business that procures parts, assembles kits for sale, manages logistics and installs solar tracking equipment for utility and development customers (primarily included in the Renewable Energy segment); a business that provides concrete construction services (primarily included in the Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments); a business specializing in power studies, maintenance testing and commissioning primarily for utility and commercial customers (included in the Electric Power segment); and a business that manufactures power transformers for the electric utility, renewable energy, municipal power and industrial markets (included in the Electric Power and Renewable Energy segments). The consideration for these transactions consisted of approximately $\n780.8\n million paid or payable in cash and \n1,238,576\n shares of Quanta common stock, which had a fair value of $\n158.9\n million as of the dates of the acquisitions. \nIn July 2022, Quanta acquired a business located in the United States that provides construction contracting services to utilities, specializing in trenching and underground pipeline and electrical conduit installation (primarily included in the Electric Power segment). Consideration for this acquisition included $\n22.3\n million paid in cash.\nThe results of operations of acquired businesses have been included in Quanta’s consolidated financial statements since their respective acquisition dates. Additionally, the former owners of certain acquired businesses are eligible to receive potential payments of contingent consideration to the extent the acquired businesses achieve certain financial performance targets over specified post-acquisition periods.\nPurchase Price Allocation\nPurchase price allocations require significant use of estimates and are based on information that was available to management at the time these consolidated financial statements were prepared. Quanta uses a variety of information to estimate fair values, including quoted market prices, carrying amounts and valuation techniques such as discounted cash flows.

The significant assumptions used by management in determining the fair values of customer relationships intangible assets include future revenues, margins, discount rates and customer attrition rates.\n \nThe following table includes the discount rates and customer attrition rates used to determine the fair value of customer relationships intangible assets for businesses acquired during the year ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 as of the respective acquisition dates:\nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nRange\nWeighted Average\nRange\nWeighted Average\nDiscount rates\n15\n% to \n24\n%\n15\n%\n14\n% to \n19\n%\n17\n%\nCustomer attrition rates\n10\n% to \n25\n%\n11\n%\n10\n% to \n30\n%\n19\n%\nThe fair value of backlog is estimated as of the acquisition date based upon the contractual nature of the backlog using the multi-period excess earnings method, which discounts to present value the projected cash flows attributable to the backlog. The fair value of trade names is estimated using the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method, which is based on the assumption that in lieu of ownership, a company would be willing to pay a royalty for use of the trade name. The significant assumptions used by management in determining the fair values of trade name intangible assets include future revenues, royalty rates, and discount rates. The value of a non-compete agreement is estimated based on the difference between the present value of the prospective cash flows with the agreement in place and the present value of the prospective cash flows without the agreement in place. The level of inputs used for these identifiable intangible asset fair value measurements is Level 3. \nContingent Consideration\nAs described above, certain business acquisitions have contingent consideration liabilities associated with the transactions. \nThe aggregate fair value of outstanding contingent consideration liabilities for acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2024 and their classification in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is as follows (in thousands):\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nAccounts payable and accrued expenses\n$\n152,030\n \n$\n—\n \nInsurance and other non-current liabilities\n192,954\n \n157,073\n \nTotal contingent consideration liabilities\n$\n344,984\n \n$\n157,073\n \nThe estimated fair values of these contingent consideration liabilities are measured on a recurring basis using a probability-weighted discounted cash flow method, which considers significant inputs not observable in the market and are Level 3 inputs. The significant estimates used by management in determining fair value consist of projections of future financial results in relation to specific performance criteria specified in the contingent consideration agreements. These forecast \n85\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nprojections include inputs such as revenues, operating margins and management’s probability assessment with respect to the likelihood of acquired businesses achieving those performance criteria during designated post-acquisition periods. Appropriate discount rates are also applied to determine the present value of the future expected payments.\nQuanta’s aggregate contingent consideration liabilities can change due to additional business acquisitions, settlement of outstanding liabilities, accretion in present value, changes in estimated fair value, the performance of acquired businesses in post-acquisition periods, the incremental impact on Quanta’s performance attributable to an acquired business and in certain cases, management discretion. These changes are reflected in “Change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. \nAll of Quanta’s outstanding contingent consideration liabilities are subject to a maximum payment amount, and the aggregate maximum payment amount of these liabilities for acquisitions completed prior to December 31, 2024 totaled $\n580.2\n million as of December 31, 2024. During the year ended December 31, 2024, Quanta made \nno\n cash payments to settle contingent consideration liabilities. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, Quanta settled certain contingent consideration liabilities with cash payments of $\n5.0\n million and $\n1.6\n million. \nPro Forma Results of Operations\nThe following unaudited supplemental pro forma results of operations for Quanta, which incorporate the acquisitions completed in 2024, 2023 and 2022, have been provided for illustrative purposes only and may not be indicative of the actual results that would have been achieved by the combined companies for the periods presented or that may be achieved by the combined companies in the future (in thousands).\n \nYear Ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nRevenues\n$\n24,867,769\n \n$\n23,403,024\n \n$\n17,702,495\n \nNet income attributable to common stock \n(1)\n$\n527,522\n \n$\n638,973\n \n$\n486,342\n \n(1)    \nThe pro forma combined results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 include one-time acquisition-related expenses of $\n453.8\n million ($\n335.8\n million net of tax) for pre-acquisition transaction costs incurred by CEI, primarily related to the vesting and increase in value of stock appreciation rights as a result of the acquisition.\n \nThe pro forma combined results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were prepared by adjusting the historical results of Quanta to include the historical results of the businesses acquired in 2024 as if such acquisitions had occurred January 1, 2023. The pro forma combined results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 were prepared by further adjusting the historical results of Quanta to include the historical results of the business acquired in 2023 as if such acquisition had occurred January 1, 2022. The pro forma combined results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 were prepared by further adjusting the historical results of Quanta to include the historical results of the businesses acquired in 2022 as if such acquisitions occurred January 1, 2021. These pro forma combined historical results were adjusted for the following: a reduction of interest and other financing expenses as a result of the repayment of outstanding indebtedness of the acquired businesses; an increase in interest and other financing expenses as a result of the debt incurred by Quanta for the purpose of financing the acquisition of CEI and cash consideration paid for all acquired businesses; an increase in amortization expense due to the intangible assets recorded; elimination of inter-company sales; and changes in depreciation expense to adjust acquired property and equipment to the acquisition date fair value and to conform with Quanta’s accounting policies. The pro forma combined results of operations do not include any adjustments to eliminate the impact of acquisition-related costs incurred by Quanta or acquired businesses or any cost savings or other synergies that resulted or may result from the acquisitions. \nImpact on Consolidated Results of Operations Related to Acquisitions\nIncluded in Quanta’s consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 were revenues of $\n1.60\n billion and income before income taxes of $\n17.7\n million, which included $\n98.9\n million of amortization expense related to the acquisitions completed in 2024. Included in Quanta’s consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 were revenues of $\n475.2\n million and income before income taxes of $\n15.9\n million, which included $\n34.7\n million of amortization expense related to the acquisitions completed in 2023. Included in Quanta’s consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 were revenues of $\n15.5\n million and income before income taxes of $\n2.5\n million, which included $\n1.4\n million of amortization expense related to the acquisition completed in 2022.\n \n86\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC.

The cumulative proceeds from the public offering of the 2027 notes and 2034 notes were $\n1.24\n billion, net of the original issue discount, underwriting discounts and deferred financing costs, which were used to repay certain short-term and commercial paper borrowings that were utilized to acquire CEI. On September 23, 2021, Quanta issued $\n1.50\n billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes consisting of: $\n500.0\n million aggregate principal amount of \n0.95\n% senior notes due October 2024 (the 2024 notes); $\n500.0\n million aggregate principal amount of \n2.35\n% senior notes due January 2032 (the 2032 notes); and $\n500.0\n million aggregate principal amount of \n3.05\n% senior notes due October 2041 (the 2041 notes). The cumulative proceeds received from the public offering of the 2024 notes, the 2032 notes and the 2041 notes were $\n1.48\n billion, net of the original issue discount, underwriting discounts and deferred financing costs, which were used, along with drawings under Quanta’s senior credit facility, as amended, to acquire Blattner Holding Company. The 2024 notes were repaid on October 1, 2024. On September 22, 2020, Quanta issued $\n1.00\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n2.90\n% senior notes due October 2030 (the 2030 notes, and together with the 2024 notes, the 2027 notes, the 2032 notes, the 2034 notes and the 2041 notes, collectively, the Senior Notes) and received proceeds of $\n986.7\n million from the offering, net of the original issue discount, underwriting discounts and deferred financing costs, and used such proceeds, together with cash on hand, to voluntarily prepay the $\n1.21\n billion of term loans then-outstanding under Quanta’s credit agreement for its senior credit facility. \nIn each case as further specified by the terms of the Senior Notes and the indenture and supplemental indentures governing the Senior Notes (collectively, the indenture), Quanta may redeem all or a portion of (i) the 2027 notes at any time prior to July 9, 2027 at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, and at any time on or after July 9, 2027 at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest; (ii) the 2030 notes at any time prior to July 1, 2030 at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, and at any time on or after July 1, 2030 at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest; (iii) the 2032 notes at any time prior to October 15, 2031 at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, and at any time on or after October 15, 2031 at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest; (iv) the 2034 notes at any time prior to May 9, 2034 at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, and at any time on or after May 9, 2034 at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and (v) the 2041 notes at any time prior to April 1, 2041 at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount plus a make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest, and at any time on or after April 1, 2041 at a price equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. \nUpon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as defined in the indenture), unless Quanta has exercised its right to redeem the applicable series of Senior Notes in full by giving irrevocable notice to the trustee, each holder of such Senior Notes will have the right to require Quanta to purchase all or a portion of such holder’s Senior Notes of such series at a purchase price equal to \n101\n% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nThe indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit Quanta’s ability to incur liens securing certain indebtedness, to engage in certain sale and leaseback transactions with respect to certain properties and to sell all or substantially all of Quanta’s assets or merge or consolidate with or into other companies.

The fair value of the Senior Notes is based on the quoted market prices for the same issue, and the senior notes are categorized as Level 1 liabilities.\n90\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nSenior Credit Facility \nAs of December 31, 2024, the credit agreement for Quanta’s senior credit facility provided for a $\n750.0\n million term loan facility, with a maturity date of October 8, 2026, and aggregate revolving commitments of $\n2.80\n billion, with a maturity date of July 31, 2029. Subject to the conditions specified in the credit agreement, Quanta has the option to increase the capacity of the credit facility, in the form of an increase in the revolving commitments, term loans or a combination thereof, from time to time, upon receipt of additional commitments from new or existing lenders by up to an additional (i) $\n400.0\n million plus (ii) additional amounts so long as the Incremental Leverage Ratio Requirement (as defined in the credit agreement) is satisfied at the time of such increase. The Incremental Leverage Ratio Requirement requires, among other things, after giving pro forma effect to such increase and the use of proceeds therefrom, compliance with the credit agreement’s financial covenants as of the most recent fiscal quarter end for which financial statements were required to be delivered. \nBorrowings under the senior credit facility and the applicable interest rates were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\nMaximum amount outstanding\n$\n1,262,736\n \n$\n1,004,677\n \n$\n1,684,783\n \nAverage daily amount outstanding\n$\n855,033\n \n$\n929,201\n \n$\n1,250,493\n \nWeighted-average interest rate\n6.62\n \n%\n6.62\n \n%\n3.03\n \n%\nThe credit agreement contains certain covenants, including, as of the end of any fiscal quarter of Quanta, (i) a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of \n3.5\n to 1.0 (except that in connection with certain permitted acquisitions in excess of $\n200.0\n million, such ratio is \n4.0\n to 1.0 for the fiscal quarter in which the acquisition is completed and the \nfour\n subsequent fiscal quarters) and (ii) a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the credit agreement) of \n3.0\n to 1.0.\n As of December 31, 2024, Quanta was in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the credit agreement. \nThe Consolidated Leverage Ratio is the ratio of Quanta’s total funded debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement). For purposes of calculating the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, total funded debt is reduced by available cash and Cash Equivalents (as defined in the credit agreement) in excess of $\n25.0\n million. Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio is the ratio of (i) Consolidated EBIT (as defined in the credit agreement) for the \nfour\n fiscal quarters most recently ended to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined in the credit agreement) for such period (excluding all interest expense attributable to capitalized loan costs and the amount of fees paid in connection with the issuance of letters of credit on behalf of Quanta during such period). \nThe credit agreement also limits certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations, indebtedness, asset sales and prepayments of indebtedness and, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits liens on Quanta’s assets. These limits include a limit on surety-backed letters of credit issued separate from the senior credit facility, which are not to exceed $\n500.0\n million at any one time outstanding. The credit agreement allows cash payments for dividends and stock repurchases subject to compliance with the following requirements (including after giving effect to the dividend or stock repurchase): (i) no default or event of default under the credit agreement; (ii) continued compliance with the financial covenants in the credit agreement; and (iii) at least $\n100.0\n million of availability under the senior credit facility and/or cash and cash equivalents on hand. \nThe credit agreement provides for customary events of default and contains cross-default provisions with other debt instruments exceeding $\n400.0\n million in borrowings or availability. If an Event of Default (as defined in the credit agreement) occurs and is continuing, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the credit agreement, the lenders may declare all amounts outstanding and accrued and unpaid interest immediately due and payable, require that Quanta provide cash collateral for all outstanding letter of credit obligations and terminate the commitments under the credit agreement.\nTerm Loan. \nAs of\n \nDecember 31, 2024, Quanta had $\n712.5\n million outstanding under its term loan facility. The carrying amount of the term loan under Quanta’s senior credit facility approximates fair value due to its variable interest rate. \nThe term loan required quarterly principal payments in the amount of $\n4.7\n million per quarter through October 2024 and requires quarterly principal payments in the amounts of $\n9.4\n million per quarter in 2025 and $\n18.8\n million per quarter in 2026, with the remaining principal amount outstanding paid at maturity in October 2026. Quanta may voluntarily prepay the term loan borrowings from time to time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. \nBeginning August 23, 2022, amounts borrowed under the term loan facility bear interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Term SOFR plus \n1.000\n% to \n1.625\n%, or (b) the Base Rate (as defined below) plus \n0.000\n% to \n0.625\n%, each as determined based on either Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as described above) or Quanta’s Debt Rating (as defined in the credit agreement), whichever is more favorable to Quanta. The Base Rate equals the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus \n0.5\n%, (ii) Bank of America N.A.’s prime rate, (iii) the Term SOFR plus \n91\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\n1.00\n%, and (iv) \n1.00\n% subject to applicable interest rate floors. \nPrior to August 23, 2022, amounts borrowed under the term loan facility bore interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal to either (a) the LIBOR Rate plus \n1.000\n% to \n1.625\n%, or (b) the Base Rate (as defined below) plus \n0.000\n% to \n0.625\n%, each as determined based on either Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as described above) or Quanta’s Debt Rating (as described above), whichever was more favorable to Quanta. The Base Rate equaled the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as described above) plus \n0.5\n%, (ii) Bank of America N.A.’s prime rate and (iii) the LIBOR Rate plus \n1.00\n%. \nRevolving Loans. \nAs of December 31, 2024, Quanta had $\n22.9\n million of outstanding revolving loans under the senior credit facility, all of which were denominated in Canadian dollars. The carrying amounts of the revolving borrowings under Quanta’s senior credit facility approximate fair value, as all revolving borrowings have a variable interest rate. \nAs of December 31, 2024, Quanta also had $\n167.4\n million of letters of credit issued under the senior credit facility, of which $\n79.8\n million were denominated in U.S. dollars and $\n87.6\n million were denominated in Canadian dollars. Additionally, available commitments for revolving loans under the senior credit facility must be maintained in order to provide credit support for notes issued under Quanta’s commercial paper program, and therefore such notes effectively reduce the available borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility. \nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n2.61\n billion remained available under the senior credit facility for new revolving loans, letters of credit and support of the commercial paper program. \nBeginning August 23, 2022, amounts borrowed in U.S. dollars under the revolving credit facility bear interest, at Quanta’s option, at a rate equal to either (a) the Term SOFR plus \n1.125\n% to \n1.750\n%, or (b) the Base Rate plus \n0.125\n% to \n0.750\n%, each as determined based on either Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio or its Debt Rating, whichever is more favorable to Quanta. Revolving loans borrowed in any currency other than U.S. dollars bear interest at a rate equal to the Alternative Currency Daily Rate or the Alternative Currency Term Rate (each as defined in the credit agreement), as applicable, plus \n1.125\n% to \n1.750\n%, as determined based on either Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio or Quanta’s Debt Rating, whichever is more favorable to Quanta. \nOn June 10, 2024, the senior credit facility was amended to establish Term CORRA (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) as the benchmark rate for borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars, in replacement of the CDOR Rate (as defined therein prior to giving effect to the amendment). \nAdditionally, standby or commercial letters of credit issued under the credit agreement are subject to a letter of credit fee of \n1.125\n% to \n1.750\n%; Performance Letters of Credit (as defined in the credit agreement) issued under the credit agreement in support of certain contractual obligations are subject to a letter of credit fee of \n0.675\n% to \n1.125\n%; and Quanta is subject to a commitment fee of \n0.100\n% to \n0.275\n% on any unused availability under the revolving credit facility, in each case as determined based on either the Quanta’s Consolidated Leverage Ratio or its Debt Rating, whichever is more favorable to Quanta. \nBetween October 8, 2021 and August 23, 2022, the interest rates for amounts borrowed in U.S. dollars were the same as above except that the benchmark rate utilized was the LIBOR Rate rather than the Term SOFR.\nCommercial Paper Program\n As of December 31, 2024, Quanta’s commercial paper program allows it to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount of $\n1.50\n billion of notes outstanding at any time. The notes are sold under customary market terms in the U.S. commercial paper market at a discount from par or at par and bear interest at rates determined at the time of issuance. The maturities of the notes may vary, but may not exceed \n397\n days from the date of issuance. Quanta began issuing notes under this program on September 2, 2022 and had \nno\n outstanding notes as of December 31, 2024. \nBorrowings under the commercial paper program and the applicable interest rates were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n (1)\nMaximum amount outstanding\n$\n1,415,000\n$\n938,400\n$\n707,300\nAverage daily amount outstanding\n$\n362,220\n$\n644,942\n$\n462,359\nWeighted-average interest rate\n5.37\n \n%\n5.82\n \n%\n4.47\n \n%\n(1)    \nThe amounts in this column represent activity beginning on the date Quanta first issued its commercial paper notes, which was September 2, 2022, through December 31, 2022.\nOn July 17, 2024, Quanta utilized approximately $\n1.20\n billion of borrowings under its commercial paper program, $\n400.0\n million of borrowings under an additional term loan described below, and cash on hand, primarily to finance the cash portion of the acquisition of CEI and pay certain related costs and expenses and working capital requirements. As described above, the proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 notes and the 2034 notes were utilized to repay the $\n400.0\n million additional term loan and certain commercial paper borrowings.\n92\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nAdditional Term Loan \nIn July 2024, Quanta entered into, and borrowed the full amount available under, a $\n400.0\n million \n90-day\n term loan facility outside of the senior credit facility for the purpose of financing a portion of the acquisition of CEI. Quanta voluntarily prepaid the term loan borrowings, in whole without premium or penalty, in August 2024 with proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 notes and 2034 notes. The term loan facility bore interest at a rate equal to the Term SOFR (as defined in the credit agreement) plus \n1.375\n%.\nAdditional Letters of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2024, Quanta had $\n538.5\n million of letters of credit issued outside of its senior credit facility, which were denominated in U.S. dollars.\n11.    \nLEASES:\nQuanta primarily leases land, buildings, vehicles, construction equipment and office equipment. As of December 31, 2024, the majority of Quanta’s leases had remaining lease terms of less than \n13\n years. Certain leases include options to extend their terms in increments of up to \nfive years\n and/or options to terminate. \nThe components of lease costs in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations are as follows (in thousands):\n \nYear Ended December 31,\nLease and lease financing cost\nClassification\n2024\n2023\n2022\nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of lease assets\nDepreciation \n(1)\n$\n11,462\n \n$\n4,944\n \n$\n1,540\n \nInterest on lease liabilities\nInterest and other financing expenses\n2,798\n \n1,463\n \n108\n \nLease financing transactions:\n(2)\nDepreciation\nDepreciation \n(1)\n10,396\n \n7,698\n \n5,303\n \nInterest\nInterest and other financing expenses\n17,600\n \n12,992\n \n8,405\n \nOperating lease cost\nCost of services and Selling, general and administrative expenses\n108,879\n \n93,133\n \n93,539\n \nShort-term and variable lease cost \n(3)\nCost of services and Selling, general and administrative expenses\n1,245,011\n \n1,106,454\n \n953,721\n \nTotal lease and lease financing cost\n \n$\n1,396,146\n \n$\n1,226,684\n \n$\n1,062,616\n \n(1)    \nDepreciation is included within “Cost of services” and “Selling, general and administrative expenses” in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations.\n(2)    \nCertain of Quanta’s equipment rental agreements contain purchase options pursuant to which the purchase price is offset by a portion of the rental payments. When these purchase options are exercised by a third-party lessor on behalf of Quanta, the transaction is deemed to be a financing transaction for accounting purposes, which results in the recognition of an asset equal to the purchase price and a corresponding liability.\n(3)    \nShort-term lease cost includes both leases and rentals with initial terms of one year or less. Variable lease cost is insignificant.\nQuanta has entered into arrangements with certain related parties to lease real and personal property and facilities. Typically, the parties are employees of Quanta who are also the former owners of businesses acquired by Quanta, and the real property and facilities continue to be utilized by Quanta subsequent to the acquisitions. Quanta utilizes third-party market valuations to evaluate rental rates for these properties and facilities, and the lease agreements generally have remaining lease terms of up to \nten years\n, subject to renewal options. Related party lease expense was $\n18.7\n million, $\n16.5\n million and $\n14.7\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n93\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC.

These valuation allowances relate to state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credits. The valuation allowances were established primarily as a result of uncertainty in Quanta’s outlook as to the amount and character of future taxable income in particular tax jurisdictions. Quanta believes it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances. \nThe net changes in the total valuation allowance for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were an increase of $\n2.6\n million, a decrease of $\n18.5\n million and an increase of $\n17.2\n million. The change in valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2024 resulted in a net $\n4.9\n million increase in tax expense due primarily to $\n9.5\n million in valuation allowances placed primarily on foreign net operating losses during the year that were partially offset by valuation allowance releases of $\n4.6\n million as a result of ongoing entity rationalization and restructuring efforts. The total valuation allowance also decreased by $\n2.3\n million in foreign currency translation adjustments on previously provided valuation allowances. \nThe change in valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2023 resulted in a $\n20.2\n million decrease in tax expense, primarily due to the release of the $\n22.7\n million valuation allowance on Quanta’s investment in Starry, and a $\n2.9\n million reduction due to utilization of certain foreign net operating losses. These decreases were partially offset by $\n5.6\n million of new valuation allowances primarily placed on foreign net operating losses during the year. The total valuation allowance also increased by $\n1.7\n million in currency translation adjustments on previously provided valuation allowances. During the year ended December 31, 2022, Quanta recognized $\n91.5\n million of unrealized losses on its investment in Starry and recorded a valuation allowance against such unrealized losses. On August 31, 2023, the equity securities of Starry held by Quanta were cancelled pursuant to an approved plan of reorganization pursuant to a bankruptcy proceeding. As a result, Quanta’s $\n91.5\n million loss was realized, and the related $\n22.7\n million valuation allowance was released during the year ended December 31, 2023. This realized loss can be utilized to offset gains from tax years 2020 through 2023, and can be carried forward to offset future capital gains realized in tax years 2024 through 2028. Quanta identified sufficient sources of capital loss carry backs and forecasted capital gain income in these periods such that the full $\n22.7\n million valuation allowance on the Starry capital loss was released during the year ended December 31, 2023\n. \nThe change in valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted in a $\n23.3\n million increase in tax expense due primarily to $\n22.7\n million in new valuation allowances recorded on unrealized losses on Quanta’s investment in Starry. The total valuation allowance increased by $\n17.2\n million from December 31, 2021 to December 31, 2022 primarily as a result of the $\n22.7\n million valuation allowance related to Starry mentioned above, partially offset by a reduction of $\n4.8\n million due to the removal of deferred tax assets that were no longer available to be carried forward to future years for which a valuation allowance had been provided in prior years, as well as currency translation adjustments on previously provided valuation allowances. \nAt December 31, 2024, Quanta had federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, the tax effect of which was $\n185.2\n million. These carryforwards will expire as follows: 2025, $\n5.3\n million; 2026, $\n0.9\n million; 2027, $\n1.1\n million; 2028, $\n1.0\n million; 2029, $\n0.9\n million and $\n176.0\n million after 2029. A valuation allowance of $\n36.1\n million has been recorded against certain foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards.\nQuanta generally does not provide for taxes related to undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries because such earnings either would not be taxable when remitted or they are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. Quanta could also be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes if it were to repatriate cash that is indefinitely reinvested outside the United States, but it does not expect such amount to be material.\n97\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC.

Additionally, various state and foreign tax returns filed by Quanta and certain subsidiaries for multiple periods remain under examination by various U.S. state and foreign tax authorities. Quanta does not consider any U.S. state in which it does business to be a major tax jurisdiction.\n \n13.    \nEQUITY:\nTreasury Stock\nGeneral\nTreasury stock is recorded at cost. Under Delaware law, treasury stock is not counted for quorum purposes or entitled to vote.\nShares withheld for tax withholding obligations\nThe tax withholding obligations of employees with respect to RSUs and PSUs that are settled in common stock are typically satisfied by Quanta making tax payments and withholding the number of shares of common stock having a value equal to the tax withholding obligation that is due on the date of vesting or settlement (as applicable). With respect to these liabilities, Quanta withheld \n0.6\n million shares of Quanta common stock during the year ended December 31, 2024, which had a market value of $\n155.5\n million, \n0.7\n million shares of Quanta common stock during the year ended December 31, 2023, which had a market value of $\n119.1\n million, and \n0.7\n million shares of Quanta common stock during the year ended December 31, 2022, which had a market value of $\n82.9\n million. These shares and the related costs to acquire them were accounted for as adjustments to the balance of treasury stock. \nStock repurchases\nOn May 23, 2023, Quanta’s Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program that authorizes Quanta to purchase, from time to time through June 30, 2026, up to $\n500\n million of its outstanding common stock.

This amount is based on forecasted attainment of performance metrics and estimated forfeitures of unearned and unvested PSUs. The compensation expense related to outstanding PSUs can vary from period to period based on changes in forecasted achievement of established performance goals and the total number of shares of common stock that Quanta anticipates will be issued upon vesting of such PSUs. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of \n1.67\n years. \nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, \n0.3\n million, \n0.7\n million and \n0.7\n million shares of common stock were issued in connection with earned and vested PSUs. The approximate fair values of PSUs earned and vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $\n75.4\n million, $\n115.5\n million and $\n72.4\n million, respectively.\n \n 15.    \nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:\nUnions’ Multiemployer Pension Plans\nQuanta contributes to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements with various unions that represent certain of Quanta’s employees. Approximately \n32\n% of Quanta’s employees as of December 31, 2024 were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Quanta’s multiemployer pension plan contribution rates generally are specified in the collective bargaining agreements (usually on a monthly or annual basis), and contributions are made to the plans on a “pay-as-you-go” basis based on its union employee payrolls. Quanta may also have additional liabilities imposed by law as a result of its participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, imposes certain liabilities upon an employer who is a contributor to a multiemployer pension plan if the employer withdraws or is deemed to have withdrawn from the plan or the plan is terminated or experiences a mass withdrawal. \nThe Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) also added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multiemployer plans in the United States that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status based on multiple factors (including, for example, the plan’s funded percentage, cash flow position and whether a projected minimum funding deficiency exists). Plans in these classifications must adopt remedial measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. Certain plans to which Quanta contributes or may contribute in the future are in “endangered,” “seriously endangered” or “critical” status. The amount of additional funds, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainty regarding the amount of future work involving covered union employees, future contribution levels and possible surcharges on plan contributions.\nThe following table summarizes plan information relating to Quanta’s participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans, including company contributions for the last three years, the status of the plans under the PPA and whether the plans are subject to a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan or contribution surcharges. The most recent PPA zone status available in 2024 and 2023 generally relates to the plans’ fiscal year-ends in 2023 and 2022. Forms 5500 were not yet available for the plan years ending in 2024. The PPA zone status is based on information that Quanta received from the respective plans’ administrators, as well as publicly available information on the U.S. Department of Labor website, and is certified by each plan’s actuary. Although multiple factors or tests may result in red zone or yellow zone status, plans in the red zone generally are less than 65 percent funded, plans in the yellow zone generally are less than 80 percent funded, and plans in the green zone generally are at least 80 percent funded. Under the PPA, red zone plans are classified as “critical” status, yellow zone plans are classified as “endangered” status and green zone plans are classified as neither “endangered” nor “critical” status. The “Subject to Financial Improvement/ Rehabilitation Plan” column indicates plans for which a financial improvement plan or a rehabilitation plan is either pending or has been implemented. The last column lists the expiration dates of Quanta’s collective-bargaining agreements to which the plans are subject. Total contributions to these plans correspond to the number of union employees employed at any given time and the plans in which they participate and vary depending upon the location and number of ongoing projects at a given time and the need for union resources in connection with such projects. Information has been presented separately for individually significant plans, based on PPA funding status classification, and in the aggregate for all other plans.\n101\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC.

Contributions to union multiemployer defined contribution or other postretirement benefit plans by Quanta were $\n282.5\n million, $\n254.7\n million and $\n234.3\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Total contributions made to all of these multiemployer plans correspond to the number of union employees employed at any given time and the plans in which they participate and participation in project labor agreements and vary depending upon the location and number of ongoing projects at a given time and the need for union resources or project labor agreements in connection with such projects. Contributions to such plans are also impacted by business combinations and changes in employer contribution rates.\nQuanta 401(k) Plan\nQuanta maintains a 401(k) plan pursuant to which employees who are not provided retirement benefits through a collective bargaining agreement may make contributions through payroll deductions. Quanta makes matching cash contributions of \n100\n% of each employee’s contribution up to \n3\n% of that employee’s salary and \n50\n% of each employee’s contribution between \n3\n% and \n6\n% of such employee’s salary, up to the maximum amount permitted by law. Contributions to the 401(k) plan by Quanta were $\n93.9\n million, $\n75.9\n million and $\n61.7\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nDeferred Compensation Plans \nQuanta maintains non-qualified deferred compensation plans under which eligible directors and key employees may defer their receipt of certain cash compensation and/or the settlement of certain stock-based awards. These plans are unfunded and unsecured compensation arrangements. Individuals participating in these plans may allocate deferred cash amounts among a group of notional accounts that mirror the gains and losses of various investment alternatives. Generally, participants receive distributions of deferred balances based on predetermined payout schedules or other events.\nThe plan covering key employees provides for employer matching contributions for certain officers and employees whose benefits under the 401(k) plan are limited by federal tax law. Quanta may also make discretionary employer contributions to such plan. Matching contributions vest immediately, and discretionary employer contributions may be subject to a vesting schedule determined at the time of the contribution, provided that vesting accelerates upon a change in control or the participant’s death or retirement. All matching and discretionary employer contributions, whether vested or not, are forfeited upon a participant’s termination of employment for cause or upon the participant engaging in competition with Quanta or any of its affiliates. \nQuanta made matching contributions to the eligible participants’ accounts under the deferred compensation plans of $\n2.3\n million, $\n1.8\n million and $\n1.5\n million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and did \nnot\n make discretionary contributions during those years. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the liability related to deferred cash compensation under these plans, including amounts contributed by Quanta, was $\n110.2\n million and $\n88.9\n million, the majority of which was included in “Insurance and other non-current liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the settlement and issuance of \n154,991\n and \n174,079\n shares of common stock \n103\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nunderlying certain stock-based awards had been deferred under these plans, and such issuances are scheduled to occur in future periods.\nTo provide for future obligations related to deferred cash compensation under these plans, Quanta has invested in corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies covering certain participants in the deferred compensation plans, the underlying investments of which are intended to be aligned with the investment alternatives elected by plan participants. The COLI assets are recorded at their cash surrender value, which is considered their fair market value, and as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair market values were $\n102.7\n million and $\n83.4\n million and were included in “Other assets, net” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The level of inputs for these fair value measurements is Level 2.\nChanges in the fair market value of Quanta’s COLI assets and deferred compensation liabilities largely offset and are recorded in the accompanying statements of operations as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, \nClassification\nChange in fair market value of\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(Loss) gain included in Selling, general and administrative expenses\nDeferred compensation liabilities\n$\n(\n14,108\n)\n$\n(\n13,325\n)\n$\n13,192\n \nOther income (expense), net\nCOLI assets\n$\n12,446\n \n$\n11,587\n \n$\n(\n13,757\n)\n16.    \nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:\nLegal Proceedings\nQuanta is from time to time party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. These actions typically seek, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, property damage, breach of contract, negligence or gross negligence, environmental liabilities, wage and hour and other employment-related damages, punitive damages, consequential damages, civil penalties or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. \nWith respect to all such lawsuits, claims and proceedings, Quanta records a reserve when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In addition, Quanta discloses matters for which management believes a material loss is at least reasonably possible. \nThe assessment of whether a loss is probable or reasonably possible, and whether the loss or a range of loss is estimable, often involves a series of complex judgments about future events. In all instances, management has assessed the matter based on current information and made a judgment concerning its potential outcome, giving due consideration to the nature of the claim, the amount and nature of damages sought and the probability of success and taking into account, among other things, negotiations with claimants, discovery, settlements and payments, judicial rulings, arbitration and mediation decisions, advice of internal and external legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter. Costs incurred for litigation are expensed as incurred. Except as otherwise stated below, none of these proceedings are expected to have a material adverse effect on Quanta’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. However, management’s judgment may prove materially inaccurate, and such judgment is made subject to the known uncertainties of litigation.\nPeru Project Dispute\nIn 2015, Redes Andinas de Comunicaciones S.R.L. (Redes), a majority-owned subsidiary of Quanta, entered into \ntwo\n separate contracts with an agency of the Peruvian Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MTC), currently Programa Nacional de Telecomunicaciones (PRONATEL), as successor to Fondo de Inversion en Telecomunicaciones (FITEL), pursuant to which Redes would design, construct and operate certain telecommunication networks in rural regions of Peru. The aggregate consideration provided for in the contracts was approximately $\n248\n million, consisting of approximately $\n151\n million to be paid during the construction period and approximately $\n97\n million to be paid during a \n10\n-year post-construction operation and maintenance period. At the beginning of the project, FITEL made advance payments totaling approximately $\n87\n million to Redes, which were secured by \ntwo\n on-demand advance payment bonds posted by Redes to guarantee proper use of the payments in the execution of the project. Redes also provided \ntwo\n on-demand performance bonds in the aggregate amount of $\n25\n million to secure performance of its obligations under the contracts.\nDuring the construction phase, the project experienced numerous challenges and delays, primarily related to issues which Quanta believes were outside of the control of and not attributable to Redes, including, among others, weather-related issues, local opposition to the project, permitting delays, the inability to acquire clear title to certain required parcels of land and other delays which Quanta believes were attributable to FITEL/PRONATEL. In response to various of these challenges and delays, Redes requested and received multiple extensions to certain contractual deadlines and relief from related liquidated damages. However, in April 2019, PRONATEL provided notice to Redes claiming that Redes was in default under the contracts due to \n104\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nthe delays and that PRONATEL would terminate the contracts if the alleged defaults were not cured. Redes responded by claiming that it was not in default, as the delays were due to events not attributable to Redes, and therefore PRONATEL was not entitled to terminate the contracts. PRONATEL subsequently terminated the contracts for alleged cause prior to completion of Redes’ scope of work, exercised the on-demand performance bonds and advance payment bonds against Redes, and indicated its intention to claim damages, including liquidated damages under the contracts.\nAs of the date of the contract terminations, Redes had incurred costs of approximately $\n157\n million related to the design and construction of the project and had received approximately $\n100\n million of payments (inclusive of the approximately $\n87\n million advance payments). \nICC Arbitration Proceeding\n. In May 2019, Redes filed for arbitration before the Court of International Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) against PRONATEL and the MTC. In the arbitration, Redes claimed that PRONATEL: breached and wrongfully terminated the contracts; wrongfully executed the advance payment bonds and the performance bonds; and was not entitled to the alleged amount of liquidated damages. In August 2022, Redes received the decision of the arbitration tribunal, which unanimously found in favor of Redes in connection with its claims and ordered, among other things, (i) repayment of the amounts collected by PRONATEL under the advance payment bonds and the performance bonds; (ii) payment of amounts owed for work completed by Redes under the contracts; (iii) payment of lost income in connection with Redes’ future operation and maintenance of the networks; and (iv) payment of other related costs and damages to Redes as a result of the breach and improper termination of the contracts (including costs related to the execution of the bonds, costs related to the transfer of the networks and legal and expert fees). Accordingly, the arbitration tribunal awarded Redes approximately $\n177\n million. In addition, per the terms of the arbitration decision, interest will accrue on any amount owed pursuant to this award up to the date of payment. \nThe decision of the arbitration tribunal is final, with limited grounds on which PRONATEL and the MTC may seek to annul the decision in Peruvian courts. In December 2022, Redes filed an enforcement proceeding with respect to each project contract to secure recovery of the arbitration award, and PRONATEL and the MTC filed an annulment proceeding with respect to each project contract. The enforcement and annulment proceedings were filed with different commercial courts in Lima, Peru. During 2023 and 2024, Redes received favorable rulings in each of the enforcement proceedings and each of the annulment proceedings, and the grounds for annulment were rejected; however, PRONATEL and the MTC are pursuing, and are expected to continue to pursue, certain remaining legal challenges to such rulings. Quanta expects these remaining legal challenges will be resolved in 2025 or 2026.\nWhile PRONATEL and the MTC are continuing to pursue their remaining legal challenges, in October 2024 and January 2025, Quanta received approximately $\n168\n million from PRONATEL, comprised of $\n112\n million in repayment of amounts collected under the advance payment and performance bonds and $\n56\n million in payment of other amounts outstanding under the ICC arbitration award. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2024, Quanta recognized approximately $\n39.2\n million of operating income for the work completed under the contracts as described above, $\n5.2\n million for reimbursement of legal fees and $\n3.7\n million of award interest. Quanta is continuing to pursue collection of the remaining amount owed under the ICC arbitration award. Additionally, Quanta remitted $\n100\n million of the amounts received from PRONATEL to its insurers in repayment of amounts previously received from the insurers pursuant to coverage under applicable insurance policies.\nQuanta believes Redes is entitled to all amounts awarded by the ICC arbitration tribunal, and intends to vigorously pursue recovery of the remaining amounts awarded and take additional legal actions deemed necessary to enforce the ICC arbitration decision. However, due to the inherent uncertainty involved with the ultimate timing and conclusion with respect to collection of the remaining amounts of the ICC arbitration award, primarily associated with interest, \nQuanta has not recognized income as of December 31, 2024 for such amounts. To the extent any such amounts are determined to be realizable in the future, income would be recorded in the period such determination is made.\nICSID Arbitration Proceeding\n. In May 2020, in connection with Quanta’s additional rights to seek full compensation for the loss of its investment under applicable investment treaties and customary international law, Quanta’s Dutch subsidiary delivered to the Peruvian government an official notice of dispute arising from the termination of the contracts and related acts by PRONATEL (which are attributable to Peru) under the Agreement on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Peru (Investment Treaty). The Investment Treaty protects Quanta’s subsidiary’s indirect ownership stake in Redes and the project, and provides for rights and remedies distinct from the ICC arbitration. In December 2020, Quanta’s Dutch subsidiary filed a request for the institution of an arbitration proceeding against Peru with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) related to Peru’s breach of the Investment Treaty, which was registered by ICSID in January 2021. In the ICSID arbitration, Quanta’s Dutch subsidiary claims, without limitation, that Peru: (i) treated the subsidiary’s investment in Redes and the project unfairly and inequitably; and (ii) effectively expropriated the subsidiary’s investment in Redes and the project. In addition, Quanta’s Dutch subsidiary is seeking full compensation for all damages arising from Peru’s actions, including but not limited to (i) the fair market value of the investment and/or lost profits; (ii) attorneys’ fees and arbitration costs; (iii) other related costs and damages and (iv) pre- \n105\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nand post-award interest. The ICSID arbitration hearing on the merits occurred in the second quarter of 2023 and a decision is currently expected in the first half of 2025.\nSilverado Wildfire Matter \nDuring 2022 and 2023, \ntwo\n of Quanta’s subsidiaries received tenders of defense and demands for preservation of evidence from Southern California Edison Company (SCE) related to lawsuits filed from April 2021 through December 2024 against SCE and T-Mobile USA, Inc. (T-Mobile) in the Superior Court of California, County of Orange. The lawsuits generally assert property damage and related claims on behalf of certain individuals and subrogation claims on behalf of insurers relating to damages caused by a wildfire that began in October 2020 in Orange County, California (the Silverado Fire) and that is purported to have damaged approximately \n13,000\n acres. The lawsuits allege the Silverado Fire originated from utility poles in the area, generally claiming that each defendant failed to adequately maintain, inspect, repair or replace its overhead facilities, equipment and utility poles and remove vegetation in the vicinity; that the utility poles were overloaded with equipment from shared usage; and that SCE failed to de-energize its facilities during red flag warnings for a Santa Ana wind event. The lawsuits allege the Silverado Fire started when SCE and T-Mobile equipment contacted each other and note the Orange County Fire Department is investigating whether a T-Mobile lashing wire contacted an SCE overhead primary conductor in high winds. T-Mobile has filed cross-complaints against SCE alleging, among other things, that the ignition site of the Silverado Fire encompassed two utility poles replaced by SCE or a third party engaged by SCE, and that certain equipment, including T-Mobile’s lashing wire, was not sufficiently re-secured after the utility pole replacements. One of Quanta’s subsidiaries performed planning and other services related to the two utility poles, and another Quanta subsidiary replaced the utility poles and reattached the electrical and telecommunication equipment to the new utility poles in March 2019, approximately \n19\n months before the Silverado Fire. Pursuant to the general terms of a master services agreement and a master consulting services agreement between the Quanta subsidiaries and SCE, the subsidiaries agreed to defend and indemnify SCE against certain claims arising with respect to performance or nonperformance under the agreements. The SCE tender letters seek contractual indemnification and defense from Quanta’s subsidiaries for the claims asserted against SCE in the lawsuits and the T-Mobile cross-complaints. \nQuanta’s subsidiaries intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuits, the T-Mobile cross-complaints and any other claims asserted in connection with the Silverado Fire. Quanta will continue to review additional information in connection with this matter as litigation and resolution efforts progress, and any such information may potentially allow Quanta to determine an estimate of potential loss, if any. As of December 31, 2024, Quanta had not recorded an accrual with respect to this matter, and Quanta is currently unable to reasonably estimate a range of reasonably possible loss, if any, because there are a number of unknown facts and legal considerations that may impact the amount of any potential liability. Quanta also believes that to the extent its subsidiaries are determined to be liable for any damages resulting from this matter, its insurance would be applied to any such liabilities over its deductible amount and its insurance coverage would be adequate to cover such potential liabilities. However, the ultimate amount of any potential liability and insurance coverage in connection with this matter remains subject to uncertainties associated with pending and potential future litigation.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nQuanta is subject to concentrations of credit risk related primarily to its cash and cash equivalents and its net receivable position with customers, which includes amounts related to billed and unbilled accounts receivable and contract assets for services Quanta has performed for customers. Substantially all of Quanta’s cash and cash equivalents are managed by what it believes to be high credit quality financial institutions. In accordance with Quanta’s investment policies, these institutions are authorized to invest cash and cash equivalents in a diversified portfolio of what Quanta believes to be high quality cash and cash equivalent investments, which consist primarily of interest-bearing demand deposits, money market investments and money market mutual funds. Although Quanta does not currently believe the principal amount of these cash and cash equivalents is subject to any material risk of loss, changes in economic conditions could impact the interest income Quanta receives from these investments. \nQuanta grants credit under normal payment terms, generally without collateral, to its customers, which primarily include utilities, renewable energy developers, communications providers, industrial companies and energy delivery companies located primarily in the United States, Canada and Australia. While Quanta generally has certain statutory lien rights with respect to services provided, Quanta is subject to potential credit risk related to business, economic and financial market conditions that affect these customers and locations, which has been heightened as a result of recent economic and financial market conditions, including in connection with the uncertainties and challenges in the overall economy, including, among other things, inflationary pressure and increased interest rates. Some of Quanta’s customers have experienced significant financial difficulties (including bankruptcy), and customers may experience financial difficulties in the future. These difficulties expose Quanta to increased risk related to collectability of billed and unbilled receivables and contract assets for services Quanta has performed. See Note 4 for additional discussion on concentrations on credit risk.\n106\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nInsurance\nQuanta is insured for, among other things, employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability, aviation and general liability claims. Quanta manages and maintains a portion of its risk through retentions and/or high deductibles and indirectly through its wholly-owned captive insurance company. The captive insurance company reimburses all claims up to the amount of the applicable deductible of its third-party insurance programs, as well as certain additional exposure related to the general and auto liability programs, which together, in certain circumstances, can be up to \n$\n50.0\n million\n per occurrence. As a supplement to its high-deductible primary insurance and captive programs, Quanta maintains insurance with excess insurance carriers for potential losses that exceed the amount of Quanta’s deductible and captive insurance obligations. Quanta renews its insurance policies on an annual basis, and therefore deductibles, captive reinsurance amounts, and levels of insurance coverage may change in future periods. In addition, insurers may cancel Quanta’s coverage or determine to exclude certain items from coverage, or Quanta may elect not to obtain certain types or levels of insurance based on the potential benefits considered relative to the cost of such insurance or increase the amounts subject to self-insurance or retention.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the gross amount accrued for employer’s liability, workers’ compensation, auto liability, general liability and group health claims totaled $\n400.2\n million and $\n351.7\n million, of which $\n263.3\n million and $\n229.2\n million are included in “Insurance and other non-current liabilities,” and the remainder is included in “Accounts payables and accrued expenses.” Related insurance recoveries/receivables as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $\n4.9\n million and $\n4.9\n million, of which $\n0.8\n million and $\n0.3\n million are included in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and $\n4.1\n million and $\n4.6\n million are included in “Other assets, net.” Losses under these insurance programs are accrued based upon Quanta’s estimate of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported, with assistance from third-party actuaries. These insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors, including the severity of an injury, the extent of damage, the determination of Quanta’s liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents not reported and the overall claims environment. The accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends, and management believes such accruals are adequate.\nLetters of Credit\nCertain of Quanta’s vendors require letters of credit to ensure reimbursement for amounts they are disbursing on Quanta’s behalf, such as to beneficiaries under its insurance programs. In addition, from time to time, certain customers require Quanta to post letters of credit to ensure payment of subcontractors and vendors and guarantee performance under contracts. Such letters of credit are generally issued by a bank or similar financial institution, including pursuant to Quanta’s senior credit facility and certain uncommitted bilateral arrangements. Each letter of credit commits the issuer to pay specified amounts to the holder of the letter of credit if the holder claims that Quanta has failed to perform specified actions. If this were to occur, Quanta would be required to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit. Depending on the circumstances of such a reimbursement, Quanta may also be required to record a charge to earnings for the reimbursement. See Note 10 for additional information regarding Quanta’s letters of credit outstanding. Quanta is not aware of any claims currently asserted or threatened under any of these letters of credit that are material, individually or in the aggregate. However, to the extent payment is required for any such claims, the amount paid could be material and could adversely affect Quanta’s consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \nBonds and Parent Guarantees\nMany customers, particularly in connection with new construction, require Quanta to post performance and payment bonds. These bonds provide a guarantee that Quanta will perform under the terms of a contract and pay its subcontractors and vendors. In certain circumstances, the customer may demand that the surety make payments or provide services under the bond, and Quanta must reimburse the surety for any expenses or outlays it incurs. Quanta may also be required to post letters of credit in favor of the sureties, which would reduce the borrowing availability under its senior credit facility. Quanta has not been required to make any material reimbursements to its sureties for bond-related costs except as described in \nLegal Proceedings - Peru Project Dispute\n above. However, to the extent further reimbursements are required, the amounts could be material and could adversely affect Quanta’s consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As of December 31, 2024, Quanta is not aware of any outstanding material obligations for payments related to bond obligations.\nPerformance bonds expire at various times ranging from mechanical completion of a project to a period extending beyond contract completion in certain circumstances, and therefore a determination of maximum potential amounts outstanding requires certain estimates and assumptions. Such amounts can also fluctuate from period to period based upon the mix and level of Quanta’s bonded operating activity. As of December 31, 2024, the total amount of the outstanding performance bonds was estimated to be approximately $\n9.5\n billion. Quanta’s estimated maximum exposure related to the value of the performance bonds outstanding is lowered on each bonded project as the cost to complete is reduced, and each commitment under a performance bond generally extinguishes concurrently with the expiration of its related contractual obligation. \n107\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nAdditionally, from time to time, Quanta guarantees certain obligations and liabilities of its subsidiaries that may arise in connection with, among other things, contracts with customers, equipment lease obligations, joint venture arrangements and contractor licenses. These guarantees may cover all of the subsidiary’s unperformed, undischarged and unreleased obligations and liabilities under or in connection with the relevant agreement. For example, with respect to customer contracts, a guarantee may cover a variety of obligations and liabilities arising during the ordinary course of the subsidiary’s business or operations, including, among other things, warranty and breach of contract claims, third party and environmental liabilities arising from the subsidiary’s work and for which it is responsible, liquidated damages, or indemnity claims. Quanta is not aware of any claims under any guarantees that are material. To the extent a subsidiary incurs a material obligation or liability and Quanta has guaranteed the performance or payment of such obligation or liability, the recovery by a customer or other counterparty or a third party will not be limited to the assets of the subsidiary. As a result, responsibility under the guarantee could exceed the amount recoverable from the subsidiary alone and could materially and adversely affect Quanta’s consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \nCollective Bargaining Agreements and Multiemployer Pension Plans\nCertain of Quanta’s operating companies are parties to collective bargaining agreements with unions that represent certain of their employees. The collective bargaining agreements expire at various times and have typically been renegotiated and renewed on terms similar to those in the expiring agreements. From time to time, Quanta is a party to grievance and arbitration actions based on claims arising out of the collective bargaining agreements. The agreements require the operating companies to pay specified wages, provide certain benefits to union employees and contribute certain amounts to multiemployer pension plans and employee benefit trusts. Quanta’s multiemployer pension plan contribution rates generally are made to the plans on a “pay-as-you-go” basis based on its union employee payrolls. The location and number of union employees that Quanta employs at any given time and the plans in which they may participate vary depending on Quanta’s need for union resources in connection with its ongoing projects. Therefore, Quanta is unable to accurately predict its union employee payroll and the resulting multiemployer pension plan contribution obligations for future periods.\nIn addition, Quanta may also be subject to liabilities as a result of its participation in, or withdrawal from, multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. Quanta may be required to make additional contributions to its multiemployer pension plans if they become underfunded, and these additional contributions will be determined based on Quanta’s union employee payrolls. Certain plans to which Quanta contributes or may contribute in the future may adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, which may require additional contributions from employers (e.g., a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. The amount, if any, that Quanta may be obligated to contribute to these plans cannot be reasonably estimated due to uncertainty regarding the amount of future work involving covered union employees, future contribution levels and possible surcharges on plan contributions. Quanta may also be subject to additional liabilities imposed by law if it or another participating employer withdraws from a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan, a plan is terminated or a plan experiences a mass withdrawal. These liabilities may include an allocable share of the unfunded vested benefits in the plan for all plan participants, not only the benefits payable to a contributing employer’s own retirees. As a result, participating employers may bear a higher proportion of liability for unfunded vested benefits if other participating employers cease to contribute or withdraw, with the reallocation of liability being more acute in cases when a withdrawn employer is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay its withdrawal liability. Quanta is not aware of any material withdrawal liabilities that have been incurred or asserted and that remain outstanding as a result of a withdrawal by Quanta from a multiemployer defined benefit pension plan. However, Quanta’s future contribution obligations and potential withdrawal liability exposure could vary based on the investment and actuarial performance of the multiemployer pension plans to which it contributes and other factors, which could be negatively impacted as a result of recent unfavorable and uncertain economic and financial market conditions. Quanta has been subject to significant withdrawal liabilities in the past, and to the extent Quanta is subject to material withdrawal liabilities in the future, such liability could adversely affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIndemnities and Warranties\nQuanta generally indemnifies its customers for the services it provides under its contracts and other specified liabilities, which may subject Quanta to indemnity claims and liabilities and related litigation. Additionally, Quanta manufactures products sold to customers and other third parties, which may subject Quanta to warranty claims and liabilities and related litigation. Quanta is not aware of any indemnity or warranty claims in connection with these obligations that are material, except as described in \nLegal Proceedings - Silverado Wildfire Matter \nabove.\nAdditionally, in the normal course of Quanta’s acquisition transactions, Quanta has granted indemnification rights to various parties against certain potential liabilities related to the transaction or the acquired business and obtained rights to indemnification from the sellers or former owners of acquired businesses for certain risks, liabilities and obligations arising from business operations prior to the date of acquisition, such as financial, performance, operational, safety, workforce, environmental, litigation, compliance or tax issues, some of which Quanta may not have discovered during due diligence. \n108\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nHowever, the indemnities may not cover all of Quanta’s exposure for such pre-acquisition matters, or the indemnitors may be unwilling or unable to pay amounts owed to Quanta. Accordingly, Quanta may incur expenses for which it is not reimbursed, and such amounts could be material and could have a material adverse effect on Quanta’s business or consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nJoint Venture Liabilities\nAs described in Note 2, Quanta is a participant in certain joint ventures, including joint venture entities that provide infrastructure-related services under specific customer contracts and partially owned entities that own, operate and/or maintain certain infrastructure assets. If losses are incurred by joint venture entities in which Quanta holds an interest, they are generally shared ratably based on the percentage ownership of the participants in the structures. However, in Quanta’s joint venture structures that provide infrastructure-related services, each participant is typically jointly and severally liable for all of the obligations of the joint venture entity pursuant to the contract with the customer, and therefore Quanta can be liable for full performance of the contract with the customer. Additionally, in circumstances where Quanta’s participation in a joint venture qualifies as a general partnership, Quanta can be liable for all obligations of the joint venture, including obligations owed to the customer or any other person or entity. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future claims against it for material amounts in connection with these liabilities. Additionally, typically each joint venture participant agrees to indemnify the other participant for any liabilities incurred in excess of what the other participant is obligated to bear under the respective joint venture agreement or in accordance with the scope of work subcontracted to each participant. It is possible, however, that Quanta could be required to pay or perform obligations in excess of its share if another participant is unable or refuses to pay or perform its share of the obligations. Quanta is not aware of circumstances that would lead to future claims against it for material amounts that would not be indemnified. However, to the extent any such claims arise, they could be material and could adversely affect Quanta’s consolidated business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCapital Commitments and Other Committed Expenditures\nAs of December 31, 2024, Quanta had $\n68.8\n million of production orders with expected delivery dates in 2025 and $\n25.0\n million with expected delivery dates thereafter for capital commitments primarily related to the expansion of its equipment. Although Quanta has committed to purchase this equipment at the time of their delivery, Quanta anticipates that some of these orders will be assigned to third-party leasing companies and made available under certain master equipment lease agreements, thereby releasing Quanta from its capital commitments.\nAs of December 31, 2024, Quanta had $\n68.6\n million of outstanding capital commitments associated with investments in unconsolidated affiliates, the majority of which relates to a limited partnership interest in a fund that targets investments in certain portfolio companies that operate businesses related to the transition to a reduced-carbon economy. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, Quanta entered into an agreement to purchase production tax credits from a third party related to a solar facility. These commitments are contingent upon the third party reaching certain energy production targets. As of December 31, 2024, Quanta had up to $\n218.0\n million of outstanding commitments associated with these production tax credits, with up to $\n29.0\n million payable in the year ended December 31, 2025 and the remainder due by 2035.\nEmployment Agreements\nQuanta has various employment agreements with certain executives and other employees, which provide for compensation, other benefits and, under certain circumstances, severance payments and post-termination stock-based compensation benefits. Certain employment agreements also contain clauses that require the potential payment of specified amounts to such employees upon the occurrence of a defined change in control event.\nAvailability of Project Materials, Equipment and Labor\nQuanta’s customers depend on the availability of certain materials for construction, upgrade and repair and maintenance of their infrastructure and are typically responsible for supplying most or all of the materials required for the services Quanta performs on their projects, including, among other things, steel, copper, aluminum and components for renewable energy projects (e.g., solar panels, wind turbine blades). Additionally, Quanta is required to procure all or part of the materials needed for certain projects. Although there have been recent delays related to disruption in the supply chain for certain project materials, including delays with respect to solar panels during the year ended December 31, 2022 and into 2023, Quanta and its customers have generally been able to procure necessary materials. \nQuanta also depends on the availability of certain equipment, including specialty vehicles, to perform services. As a result, to the extent vehicle manufacturers experience production delays with respect to new vehicles for Quanta’s fleet (both on-road and specialty vehicles) or vehicle parts (e.g., tires), Quanta could encounter significant disruptions with respect to its fleet.\n109\nQUANTA SERVICES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (\nContinued\n)\nQuanta’s success depends on its ability to attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees, including craft skilled labor, engineers, project management, architects, designers, management and professional and administrative employees, and the industries in which Quanta operates have experienced shortages of qualified skilled labor personnel in recent years, which is expected to continue and potentially worsen in the future. In order to help meet near-term and longer-term labor needs, Quanta supports and utilizes its own training and educational programs and has developed additional company-wide and project-specific employee training and educational programs and strategic relationships with universities, the military and unions to recruit qualified personnel.\n17.    \nDETAIL OF CERTAIN ACCOUNTS:\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, cash equivalents were $\n347.5\n million and $\n610.8\n million and consisted primarily of money market investments, money market mutual funds and short-term deposits. \nCash and cash equivalents held by joint ventures, which are either consolidated or proportionately consolidated, are available to support joint venture operations, but Quanta cannot utilize those assets to support its other operations. Quanta generally has no right to cash and cash equivalents held by a joint venture other than participating in distributions, to the extent made, and in the event of dissolution. Cash and cash equivalents held by Quanta’s wholly-owned captive insurance company are generally not available for use in support of its other operations.\n \nAmounts related to cash and cash equivalents held by consolidated or proportionately consolidated joint ventures and the captive insurance company, which are included in Quanta’s total cash and cash equivalents balances, were as follows (in thousands):\n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nCash and cash equivalents held by domestic joint ventures\n$\n71,646\n \n$\n41,427\n \nCash and cash equivalents held by foreign joint ventures\n10,088\n \n10,968\n \nTotal cash and cash equivalents held by joint ventures\n81,734\n \n52,395\n \nCash and cash equivalents held by captive insurance company\n19,445\n \n19,088\n \nCash and cash equivalents not held by joint ventures or captive insurance company\n640,781\n \n1,218,765\n \nTotal cash and cash equivalents\n$\n741,960\n \n$\n1,290,248\n \nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following (in thousands):\n \nEstimated Useful\nDecember 31,\n \nLives in Years\n2024\n2023\nLand\nN/A\n$\n134,590\n \n$\n102,839\n \nBuildings and leasehold improvements\n5\n-\n30\n514,888\n \n456,004\n \nOperating machinery, equipment and vehicles\n1\n-\n25\n3,347,871\n \n3,069,882\n \nOffice equipment, furniture and fixtures and information technology systems\n3\n-\n10\n298,878\n \n290,687\n \nConstruction work in progress\nN/A\n125,676\n \n73,018\n \nFinance lease assets and lease financing transactions\n5\n-\n20\n239,806\n \n165,923\n \nProperty and equipment, gross\n4,661,709\n \n4,158,353\n \nLess — Accumulated depreciation and amortization\n \n(\n1,961,432\n)\n(\n1,821,410\n)\nProperty and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation\n \n$\n2,700,277\n \n$\n2,336,943\n \nDepreciation expense related to property and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets and was $\n359.4\n million, $\n324.8\n million and $\n290.6\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

The disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAs of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b), as such disclosure controls and procedures are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on this evaluation, these officers have concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives.\nEvaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting can be found in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data i\nn Part II of this Annual Report under the heading \nReport of Management\n and is incorporated herein by reference. The report of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, on the financial statements, and its opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, can also be found in Item 8. \nFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\n in Part II of this Annual Report under the heading \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n and is incorporated herein by reference.\nAs described in the Report of Management, management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 excluded the eight businesses we acquired in 2024. Such exclusion was in accordance with SEC guidance that an assessment of recently acquired businesses may be omitted in management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, provided the acquisitions took place within twelve months of management’s evaluation. These acquisitions comprised approximately 5.5% and 6.7% of our consolidated assets and revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024 and included the acquisition of Cupertino Electric, Inc., which comprised approximately 3.7% and 5.3% of our consolidated assets and revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. We are in the process of integrating each acquired business into our overall internal control over financial reporting process.\nExcept as noted above, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nDesign and Operation of Control Systems\nOur management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes. Controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management \n112\noverride of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nITEM 9B.\nOther Information\nInsider Trading \nArrangements\nOn \nNovember 25, 2024\n, \nDonald C.
