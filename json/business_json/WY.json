We also maintain and regularly update other company policies that guide our business, inform our employees and help manage our identified risks, including the following: Anti-Bribery Policy; Anti-Discrimination, Anti-Harassment and Equal Employment Opportunity Policy; Insider Trading Policy; Related Party Transactions Review and Approval Policy; Anti-Hedging and Anti-Pledging Policy; Chemical Management Policy; Code of Ethics; Environmental Policy; Health and Safety Policy; Human Rights Policy; Product Stewardship Policy; Supplier Code of Ethics; Sustainable Forestry Policy; Threatened and Endangered Species Policy; and Wood Procurement Policy.\n\n\nPARTICIPATING IN PUBLIC POLICY\n\n\nOur ethical and transparent involvement in public policy includes coalition and relationship building, advocacy, political contributions and grassroots activities. As active members of our communities, we participate in the political process to help shape policy and legislation affecting our company and industry and do so without regard to the private political preferences of executives. All political contributions are managed by our government affairs team. Public policy and legislative priorities are reviewed annually with senior business leaders, our board of directors and our Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee. We follow both the letter and the spirit of the laws governing lobbying. Our managers receive regular training on current laws and practices, and we work fairly and honestly with public officials at all levels. Some states allow companies to contribute directly to campaigns for state and local offices and for ballot measures. We file these contributions as required at state and local levels. We also sponsor a U.S. Weyerhaeuser Political Action Committee (WPAC), which solicits voluntary contributions from eligible shareholders, employees and our board of directors. WPAC contribution reports are filed with the Federal Election Commission, and we provide a summary of our annual WPAC political donations in the sustainability section of our website.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWHAT \nWE DO\n\n\n \n\n\nThis section provides information about how we:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrow and harvest trees,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaximize the value of every acre we own and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmanufacture and sell wood products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nFor each of our business segments, we provide details about what we do, where we do it, how much we sell and where we are headed.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n8\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nTIMBERLANDS\n\n\nOur Timberlands segment manages 10.4 million acres of private commercial timberlands in the U.S. We own 9.8 million of those acres and control the remaining acres through long-term contracts. In addition, we have renewable, long-term licenses on 14.1 million acres of Canadian timberlands.\n\n\nWHAT WE DO\n\n\nForestry Management\n\n\nOur Timberlands segment:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngrows and plants seedlings to reforest harvested areas using the most effective regeneration method for the site and species (natural regeneration is employed and managed in parts of Canada and the northern U.S.);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmanages our timberlands as the trees grow to maturity;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nharvests trees to be converted into wood products, such as lumber, oriented strand board, engineered wood products, pellets, pulp and paper;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmanages the health of our forests to sustainably maximize harvest volumes, minimize risks, and protect unique environmental, cultural, historical and recreational value and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noffers recreational access.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe seek to maximize the returns from our timberlands by selling delivered logs and through stumpage sales to both internal and external customers. We leverage our expertise in forestry using research and planning systems to optimize log production and innovative planting and harvesting techniques across varying terrain. We use intensive, customized silviculture to increase forest productivity and returns while managing our forests on a sustainable basis. We use our scale, infrastructure and supply chain expertise to deliver reliable and consistent supply to our customers.\n\n\nCompetitive factors within each of our market areas generally include price, species, grade, quality, proximity to wood-consuming facilities and the ability to consistently meet customer requirements. We compete in the marketplace through our ability to provide customers with a consistent and reliable supply of high-quality logs at scale volumes and competitive prices. Our customers also value our status as a SFI certified supplier.\n\n\nSustainable Forestry Practices\n\n\nWe manage our forests intensively to maximize the value of every acre and produce a sustainable supply of wood fiber for our customers. At the same time, we are careful to protect biological diversity, water quality and other ecosystem values. Our working forests also provide unique environmental, cultural, historical and recreational value. We work hard to protect these and other qualities, while still managing our forests to produce financially mature timber. We follow regulatory requirements, voluntary standards and certify 100 percent of our North American timberlands under the SFI Forest Management Standard.\n\n\nCanadian Forestry Operations\n\n\nIn Canada, we manage timberlands under long-term licenses that serve as the primary source of raw material for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces. When we harvest trees, we pay the provinces at stumpage rates set by the government. We transfer logs to our manufacturing facilities at cost and do not generate any significant profit from the harvest of timber from our licensed acres in Canada.\n\n\nTimberlands Products\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRODUCTS\n\n\nHOW THEY’RE USED\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelivered logs:\n• Grade logs\n• Fiber logs\n\n\nGrade logs are made into lumber, plywood, veneer and other products used in residential homes, commercial structures, furniture, industrial and decorative applications. Fiber logs are sold to pulp, paper, oriented strand board and pellet mills to make products used for printing, writing, packaging, homebuilding, consumer products and renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimber\n\n\nStanding timber is sold to third parties through stumpage sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreational leases\n\n\nTimberlands are leased or permitted for recreational purposes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther products\n\n\nSeeds and seedlings grown in the U.S. and wood chips.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nHOW WE MEASURE OUR PRODUCTS\n\n\nWe use multiple units of measure when transacting business including:\n\n\n \n\n\n•\nThousand board feet (MBF) — used in the West to measure the expected lumber recovery from a tree or log and\n\n\n•\nGreen tons (GT) — used in the South to measure weight; factors used for conversion to product volume can vary by species, size, location and season.\n\n\n \n\n\nWe report Timberlands volumes in ton equivalents.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n9\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nWHERE WE DO IT\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we sustainably managed timberlands in 17 states. This included owned or contracted acres in the following locations:\n\n\n \n\n\n•\n2.5 million acres in the western U.S. (Oregon and Washington);\n\n\n•\n6.7 million acres in the southern U.S. (Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia) and\n\n\n•\n1.2 million acres in the northern U.S. (Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and West Virginia).\n\n\nIn Canada, we manage timberlands under long-term licenses that provide raw material for our manufacturing facilities. These licenses are in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Saskatchewan.\n\n\nOur total timber inventory — comprised of timber on owned and contracted land in the U.S. — is approximately 594 million tons. This timber inventory does not translate into a specific amount of lumber or panel products because the quantity of end products varies according to the age, species, size and quality of the timber and will change over time as these variables adjust.\n\n\nWe maintain our timber inventory in an integrated resource inventory system and geographic information system (GIS). The resource inventory component of the system is proprietary and is largely based on internally developed methods, including growth and yield models developed by our research and development organization. The GIS component is based on GIS software that is viewed as the standard in our industry.\n\n\nTimber inventory data collection and verification techniques include the use of industry standard field sampling procedures as well as proprietary remote sensing technologies in some geographies. The data is collected and maintained at the timber stand level.\n\n\nWe also own and operate nurseries and seed orchards in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina and Washington.\n\n\nSummary of 2024 Standing Timber Inventory\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMILLIONS OF TONS AS OF\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGEOGRAPHIC AREA\n\n\n \n\n\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTOTAL INVENTORY\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S.:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDouglas-fir/Cedar\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n156\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitewood\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n22\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardwood\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal West\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n191\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthern yellow pine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n280\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardwood\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n80\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal South\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n360\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConifer\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHardwood\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal North\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n43\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Company\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n594\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nInventory includes all conservation and non-harvestable areas.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n10\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nSummary of 2024 Timberland Locations\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTHOUSANDS OF ACRES AS OF\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGEOGRAPHIC AREA\n\n\n \n\n\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFEE \nOWNERSHIP\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLONG-TERM\nCONTRACTS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTOTAL\nACRES\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S.:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOregon\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,415\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,415\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWashington\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,095\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,095\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal West\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,510\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,510\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlabama\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n525\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n163\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n688\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nArkansas\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,184\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,200\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFlorida\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n210\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n271\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeorgia\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n571\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n595\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLouisiana\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,005\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n350\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,355\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMississippi\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,113\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n35\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,148\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n660\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n660\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n486\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n486\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n201\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n201\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirginia\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n117\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n117\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal South\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,084\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n651\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n6,735\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaine\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n833\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n833\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVermont\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n86\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n86\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest Virginia\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n251\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n251\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal North\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,194\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,194\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Company\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9,788\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n651\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,439\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nAcres include all conservation and non-harvestable areas.\n\n\nWe provide a year-round flow of logs to internal and external customers. We sell grade and fiber logs to manufacturers that produce a diverse range of products. We also sell standing timber to third parties and lease land for recreational purposes. Most of our timberlands are strategically located to take advantage of road, logging and transportation systems for efficient delivery of logs to customers.\n\n\nWestern United States\n\n\nOur Western timberlands are well situated to serve the wood products and pulp markets in Oregon and Washington. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold 36 percent of our total Western log sales volume internally. Additionally, our location on the West Coast provides access to higher-value export markets for Douglas-fir and whitewood logs to Japan, China and Korea. Our largest export market is Japan, where Douglas-fir is a preferred species for higher-valued post and beam homebuilding. The size and quality of our Western timberlands, coupled with their proximity to several deep-water port facilities, competitively positions us to meet the needs of Pacific Rim log markets.\n \n\n\nOur holdings are composed primarily of Douglas-fir, a species highly valued for its structural strength, stiffness and appearance. All of our lands are located on the west side of the Cascade Mountain Range with soil and rainfall conditions considered favorable for growing this species. Our standing timber inventory is comprised of 81 percent Douglas-fir, 12 percent whitewood and 7 percent hardwood.\n\n\nOur management systems and supply chain expertise provide us with a competitive operating advantage in a number of areas including forestry and research, harvesting, marketing and logistics. Additionally, our scale, diversity of timberlands ownership and infrastructure on the West Coast allow us to consistently and reliably supply logs to our internal and external customers year-round.\n\n\nWe sell recreational use permits covering approximately 2 million acres of our owned Western timberlands.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n11\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n2024 Western U.S. Inventory by Species\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2024 Western U.S. Inventory by Age / Species\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe average age of timber harvested from our Western timberlands in 2024 was 47 years.

For the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold 23 percent of our total Southern log sales volume internally. Additionally, our Atlantic and Gulf coastal locations position us to serve an emerging Asian log export market. Our standing timber inventory is comprised of 78 percent Southern yellow pine and 22 percent hardwood.\n\n\nOperationally, we focus on efficiently harvesting and hauling logs from our ownership and capitalizing on our scale and supply chain expertise to consistently and reliably supply logs to our internal and external customers year-round.\n\n\nWe lease approximately 96 percent of our owned Southern acreage for recreational purposes.\n\n\n2024 Southern U.S. Inventory by Species\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n12\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n2024 Southern U.S. Inventory by Age / Species\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe average age of timber harvested from our Southern timberlands in 2024 was 29 years. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest and replant an average of 2 percent of our acreage each year in the South.\n\n\nNorthern United States\n\n\nOur Northern timberlands acres contain a diverse mix of temperate broadleaf hardwoods and mixed conifer species across timberlands located in four states. We grow over 35 species and market over 300 product grades to a diverse mix of customers.\n\n\nOur large-diameter cherry, red oak and hard maple sawlogs and veneer logs serve domestic and export furniture markets. Our maple and other appearance woods are used in furniture and high-value decorative applications. In addition to high-value hardwood sawlogs, our log mix includes hardwood fiber logs for pulp and oriented strand board applications. Hardwood pulpwood is a significant market in the Northern region and we have long-term supply agreements, primarily at market rates, for nearly 90 percent of our hardwood pulp production. Our competitive advantages include a merchandising program to capture the value of premium hardwood logs.\n\n\n2024 Northern U.S. Inventory by Species\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n2024 Northern U.S. Inventory by Age / Species\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n13\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nThe average age of timber harvested from our Northern timberlands in 2024 was 61 years. Timber harvested in the North is sold predominantly as delivered logs to domestic mills, including our manufacturing facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we sold 9 percent of our total Northern log sales volume internally. In accordance with our sustainable forestry practices, we harvest an average of 1 percent of our acreage each year in the North. Regeneration is predominantly natural, augmented by planting where appropriate.\n\n\nCanada — Licensed Forestlands\n\n\nWe manage forestlands in Canada under long-term licenses from the provincial governments to secure volume for our manufacturing facilities in various provinces. The provincial governments regulate the volume of timber that may be harvested each year through Annual Allowable Cuts (AAC), which are updated every 10 years.

The harvested logs are transferred to our manufacturing facilities at cost (stumpage plus harvest, haul and overhead costs less any margin on selling logs to third parties). Any profit from harvesting the log through converting to finished products is recognized at the respective mill in our Wood Products segment.\n\n\nSummary of License Arrangements\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTHOUSANDS OF\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nACRES AS OF\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGEOGRAPHIC AREA\n\n\n \n\n\nDECEMBER 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTOTAL ACRES\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProvince:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlberta\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,399\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nBritish Columbia\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,147\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOntario\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,574\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaskatchewan\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,987\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal Canada\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,107\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n(1)\nLicense is managed by partnership.\n\n\nHOW MUCH WE HARVEST\n\n\nOur fee harvest volumes are managed sustainably across all regions to ensure the preservation of long-term economic value of the timber and to capture maximum value from the markets.

In 2021, we launched our natural climate solutions business through which we leverage our resources and expertise to help others meet their goals to reduce carbon emissions or mitigate environmental impacts. This involves an expansion of our established business activities in the areas of conservation, mitigation banking and leasing land for renewable energy projects. Additionally, it involves advancing our participation in two emerging markets focused on the mitigation of carbon emissions: forest carbon, by which we generate carbon credits through incremental carbon sequestration over a baseline and sell them on voluntary carbon markets, and carbon capture and storage, which involves leasing of surface and subsurface ownership to safely and permanently sequester transported carbon emissions from their source. As the largest private owner of timberlands in North America, the scale and geographic diversity of our assets create a unique opportunity for participation in each of these activities, all of which offer natural solutions for reducing carbon emissions and support climate change mitigation efforts.\n\n\nWHAT WE DO\n\n\nReal Estate\n\n\nProperties that exhibit higher use value than commercial timberlands are monetized by our Real Estate business over time. We analyze our existing U.S. timberland holdings using a process we call AVO. We start with understanding the value of a parcel operating as commercial timberlands and then assess the specific real estate attributes of the parcel and its corresponding market. The assessment includes demographics, infrastructure and proximity to amenities and recreation to determine the potential to realize a premium value to commercial timberland. Attributes can evolve over time, and accordingly, the assignment of value and opportunity can change. We continually revisit our AVO assessment across our timberland portfolio. Additionally, we leverage new technology to improve and enhance our ability to identify and capture value from various timber and non-timber attributes, including carbon, renewable energy and other natural climate solutions opportunities. This technology-enabled approach, referred to as \"AVO 2.0\", leverages remote sensing, satellite imagery, machine learning and other advanced data analytics, and continues to drive significant improvements in our ability to identify strategic growth opportunities and manage every acre in our portfolio to maximize value across the full suite of attributes and opportunities.\n\n\nWe expect to sell certain properties for recreational, conservation, commercial or residential purposes over time. We will also entitle a small amount of acres for real estate development. Development, outside of entitlement activities, is typically performed by third parties. Mitigation banking consists of setting aside certain areas of our timberlands to preserve, enhance or restore a wetland, stream or habitat area to make up for development by another entity in a similar nearby ecosystem. Activities within the Real Estate business that contribute to natural climate solutions include conservation sales or easements and mitigation banking. Some of our real estate activities are conducted through our TRSs.\n \n\n\nOccasionally, we sell a small amount of timberland acreage in areas where we choose to reduce our market presence and capture a price that exceeds the value derivable from holding and operating as commercial timberlands. These transactions will vary based on factors including the location and physical and operating characteristics of the timberlands.\n\n\nThe volume of real estate sales is a function of many factors, including the general state of the economy, demand in local real estate markets, the ability of buyers to obtain financing, the number of competing properties listed for sale, the seasonal nature of sales, the plans of adjacent landowners, our expectation of future price appreciation, the timing of harvesting activities and the availability of government and not-for-profit funding. In any period, the average price per acre sold will vary based on the location and physical characteristics of parcels sold.\n\n\nEnergy and Natural Resources\n\n\nWe focus on maximizing potential opportunities for construction materials, industrial minerals, renewable energy (including wind and solar energy), natural gas, rights of way easements on our timberland portfolio and retained mineral interests. Activities within the ENR business that contribute to natural climate solutions include utilizing land for the production of renewable energy like wind and solar, forest carbon and carbon capture and storage.\n\n\nAs the owner of mineral rights and interests, we typically do not invest in development or operations but, instead, enter into contracts with operators granting them the rights to explore, develop and sell energy and natural resources produced from our property in exchange for rents and royalties. We generally reserve mineral rights when selling timberlands acreage. Some Energy and Natural Resources activities are conducted through our TRSs.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n18\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nReal Estate, Energy and Natural Resources Sources of Revenue\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUSINESS\n\n\nSOURCES OF REVENUE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Estate\n\n\n• Select timberland tracts are sold for recreational, conservation, commercial or residential purposes.\n• Mitigation banking credits are generated and sold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy and Natural Resources\n\n\n• Rights are granted to explore for, extract and sell construction aggregates (rock, sand and gravel), industrial\nmaterials and natural gas.\n \n• Ground leases and easements are granted to wind and solar developers to generate renewable electricity.\n• Rights are granted to access and utilize timberland acreage for communications, pipeline, powerline and transportation rights of way.\n• Forest carbon credits are generated and sold.\n• Subsurface ownership is leased for carbon sequestration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHERE WE DO IT\n\n\nOur Real Estate business identifies opportunities to realize premium value for our owned timberland acreage.\n\n\nThe majority of our Energy and Natural Resources revenue sources are located in Oregon, Washington, South Carolina and Georgia (construction material royalties);

Residential and multi-family construction is influenced by factors such as population growth and other demographics, availability of labor and lots, the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, availability of financing and interest rate levels, and the supply and pricing of existing homes on the market. Repair and remodel activity is primarily affected by the size and age of existing housing inventory and access to home equity financing and other credit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe supply of commodity building products such as structural lumber, oriented strand board and softwood plywood affects prices. A number of factors can influence supply, including changes in production capacity and utilization rates, weather, imported supply, raw material supply and availability of labor and transportation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe following graphs reflect product price trends for the past five years.\n\n\n \n\n\nFive-Year Summary of Published Lumber Prices — $/MBF\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n22\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nFive-Year Summary of Published Oriented Strand Board Prices — $/MSF\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWHERE WE’RE HEADED\n\n\nOur competitive strategies include:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndelivering industry-leading controllable manufacturing costs and optimizing capacity through operational excellence and disciplined capital execution;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\naligning closely with fiber supply;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexpanding our lumber and engineered wood products capacity;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeveloping new and innovative products;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nleveraging our brand and reputation as the preferred provider of quality building products and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npursuing disciplined, profitable sales growth in target markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n23\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n \n\n\n \n\n\nBrian K.

We also participate in voluntary certification of our timberlands to ensure that we sustain their overall quality, including the protection of wildlife and water quality. Changes in these laws or certification standards can significantly affect our business.\n\n\nREGULATIONS AFFECTIN\nG FORESTRY PRACTICES\n\n\nIn the United States, laws established by federal, state and local government agencies to protect, among other things, water quality, wetlands and other wildlife habitat could affect future harvests and forest management practices on our timberlands. Forest practice laws that affect present or future harvest and forest management activities in certain states include:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimits on the size of clearcuts,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrequirements that some timber be left unharvested to protect water quality and fish and wildlife habitat,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregulations regarding construction and maintenance of forest roads,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrules requiring reforestation following timber harvest,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregulations on the use of pesticides and herbicides and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvarious related permit programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nEach state in which we own timberlands has developed laws and/or best management practices to reduce the effects of forest practices on water quality and aquatic habitats. Additional and more stringent laws may be adopted by various state and local governments to achieve water quality standards, protect fish and wildlife habitats and human health, or achieve other public policy objectives.\n\n\nIn Canada, our forest operations are carried out on public timberlands under forest licenses with the provinces. All forest operations in Canada are subject to:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nforest practices and environmental laws and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlicense requirements established by contract between us and the relevant province designed to protect environmental values and encourage other stewardship values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn Canada, 21 member companies of the Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC), including Weyerhaeuser\n’\ns Canadian subsidiary, announced in May 2010 the signing of a Canadian Boreal Forest Agreement (CBFA) with nine environmental organizations. The CBFA applies to approximately 72 million hectares of public forests licensed to FPAC members and, when fully implemented, was expected to lead to the conservation of significant areas of Canada\n’\ns boreal forest and protection of boreal species at risk, in particular, woodland caribou. While the CBFA mandate came to an end in 2017, CBFA signatories continue to work on management plans with provincial governments and seek the participation of indigenous and local communities.\n\n\nENDANGERED SPECIES PROTECTIONS\n\n\nIn the United States, a number of fish and wildlife species that inhabit geographic areas near or within our timberlands have been listed as threatened or endangered under the federal Endangered Species Act (ESA) or similar state laws, including but not limited to:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe northern spotted owl, the marbled murrelet, a number of salmon species, bull trout and steelhead trout in the Pacific Northwest;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseveral freshwater mussel and sturgeon species and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe red-cockaded woodpecker, gopher tortoise, dusky gopher frog, American burying beetle and Northern long-eared bat in the South or Southeast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAdditional species or populations may be listed as threatened or endangered as a result of pending or future citizen petitions or petitions initiated by federal or state agencies. In addition, significant citizen litigation seeks to compel the federal agencies to designate \"critical habitat\" for ESA-listed species, and many cases have resulted in settlements under which designations will be implemented over time. Such designations may adversely affect some management activities and options. Restrictions on timber harvests can result from:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfederal and state requirements to protect habitat for threatened and endangered species;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregulatory actions by federal or state agencies to protect these species and their habitat and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncitizen suits under the ESA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSuch actions could increase our operating costs and affect timber supply and prices in general. To date, we do not believe that these measures have had, and we do not believe that in 2025 they will have, a significant effect on our harvesting operations. We anticipate that likely future actions will not disproportionately affect Weyerhaeuser as compared with comparable operations of U.S. competitors.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n25\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nIn Canada:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe federal Species at Risk Act (SARA) requires protective measures for species identified as being at risk and for their critical habitat. Pursuant to SARA, Environment Canada continues to identify and assess species deemed to be at risk and their critical habitat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn October 2012, the Canadian Minister of the Environment released a strategy for the recovery of the boreal population of woodland caribou under the SARA. The population and distribution objectives for boreal caribou across Canada are to (1) maintain the current status of existing, self-sustaining local caribou populations and (2) stabilize and achieve self-sustaining status for non-self-sustaining local caribou populations. Critical habitat for boreal caribou is identified for all boreal caribou ranges, except for northern Saskatchewan’s Boreal Shield range (SK1) where additional information is required for that population. Species assessment and recovery plans are developed in consultation with indigenous communities and stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2017, the provinces were required to update the federal government on any progress associated with their draft caribou range plans. The majority of these plans are now being developed under Species at Risk Conservation agreements, signed between the provinces and the Federal Ministry. These agreements set out goals, objectives and timelines for caribou management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe identification and protection of habitat and the implementation of range plans and land use action plans may, over time, result in additional restrictions on timber harvests and other forest management practices that could increase operating costs for operators of timberlands in Canada. To date, we do not believe that these Canadian measures have had, and we do not believe that in 2025 they will have, a significant effect on our harvesting operations. We anticipate that likely future measures will not disproportionately affect Weyerhaeuser as compared with similar operations of Canadian competitors.\n\n\nFOREST CERTIFICATION STANDARDS\n\n\nWe operate in North America under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative\n®\n \n(SFI). This is a certification standard designed to supplement government regulatory programs with voluntary landowner initiatives to further protect certain public resources and values. SFI is an independent standard, overseen by a governing board consisting of:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenvironmental sector, including non-profit environmental and conservation organizations,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsocial sector, including community and social interest groups, and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neconomic sector, including industry and landowner representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOngoing compliance with SFI may result in some increases in our operating costs and reduction of our timber harvests in some areas. There is also competition from other private certification systems, primarily the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC), coupled with efforts by supporters to further those systems by persuading customers of forest products to require products certified to their preferred system. Certain features of the FSC system could impose additional operating costs on timberland management. Because of the considerable variation in FSC standards, and variability in how those standards are interpreted and applied, if sufficient marketplace demand develops for products made from raw materials sourced from forests certified to these or other non-SFI standards, we could incur substantial additional costs for operations or need to reduce harvest levels in order to comply with such standards.\n\n\nWHAT THESE REGULATIONS AND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS MEAN TO US\n\n\nThe regulatory and non-regulatory forest management programs described above have:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nincreased our operating costs;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nresulted in changes in the value of timber and logs from our timberlands;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontributed to increases in the prices paid for wood products and wood chips during periods of high demand;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsometimes made it more difficult for us to respond to rapid changes in markets, extreme weather or other unexpected circumstances and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npotentially encouraged further reductions in the use of, or substitution of other products for, lumber, oriented strand board, engineered\n \nwood products and plywood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe believe that these regulations and programs have not had, and in 2025 will not have, a significant effect on our total harvest of timber in the United States or Canada. However, these kinds of programs may have such an effect in the future. We expect we will not be disproportionately affected by these programs as compared with typical owners of comparable timberlands. We also expect that these programs will not significantly disrupt our planned operations over large areas or for extended periods.\n\n\nCANADIAN INDIGENOUS RIGHTS\n\n\nMany of the Canadian timberlands are subject to the constitutionally protected treaty or common-law rights of indigenous peoples of Canada. Most of British Columbia (B.C.) is not covered by treaties, and as a result the claims of B.C.’s indigenous peoples relating to forest resources have been largely unresolved. Nonetheless, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the Tsilhqot’in Nation holds indigenous title to approximately 1,900 square kilometers in B.C., the first time the court has declared title to exist based on historical occupation by indigenous peoples. Many indigenous groups continue to be engaged in treaty discussions with the governments of B.C., other provinces and Canada.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n26\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nFinal or interim resolution of claims brought by indigenous groups can be expected to result in:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadditional restrictions on the sale or harvest of timber,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npotential increase in operating costs and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffect on timber supply and prices in Canada.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe believe that such claims will not have a significant effect on our total harvest of timber or production of forest products in 2025, although they may have such an effect in the future.\n \n\n\nPOLLUTION CONTROL REGULATIONS\n\n\nOur operations are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local pollution control laws.\n\n\nThese laws, as well as market demands, impose controls with regard to:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe discharge of pollutants to air, water and land;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsolid and hazardous waste management;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwaste disposal;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nremediation of contaminated sites and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe chemical content of some of our products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nCompliance with these laws and demands may involve capital expenditures or changes to operating procedures, which can increase operating costs. We cannot easily quantify the future amounts of capital expenditures we might have to make to comply with these laws and demands or the effects on our operating costs because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive. In addition, it is difficult to isolate the environmental component of most manufacturing capital projects.\n\n\nOur capital projects typically are designed to:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenhance safety;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nextend the life of a facility;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlower costs and improve efficiency;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimprove reliability;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nincrease capacity;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfacilitate raw material changes and handling requirements;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nincrease the economic value of assets or products and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncomply with regulatory standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP\n\n\nWe are involved in the environmental investigation or remediation of numerous sites, predominantly resulting from historical legacy operations. Of these sites:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe may have the sole obligation to remediate;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe may share that obligation with one or more parties;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseveral parties may have joint and several obligations to remediate and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwe may have been named as a potentially responsible party for contaminated sites, including those designated as U.S. Superfund sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nOur liability with respect to these various sites could range from insignificant to substantial. The amount of liability depends on the:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nquantity, toxicity and nature of materials at the site;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregulatory standards to which the site must be remediated and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnumber and economic viability of the other responsible parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe spent approximately $5 million in 2024 and expect to spend approximately $14 million in 2025 on environmental remediation of these sites.\n\n\nIt is our policy to accrue for environmental remediation costs when we:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndetermine it is probable that such an obligation exists and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncan reasonably estimate the amount of the obligation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nBased on currently available information and analysis, we believe it is reasonably possible that our costs to remediate all the identified sites may exceed our current accrual of $81 million by up to $212 million. This estimate of the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs is much less certain than the estimates we currently are using to determine how much to accrue. The estimate of the upper range also relies on assumptions less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n27\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nREGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN THE U.S.\n\n\nThe United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated regulations under the federal Clean Air Act for air emissions from:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwood products facilities and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindustrial boilers.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThese regulations cover:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhazardous air pollutants that require use of maximum achievable control technology (MACT) and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrols and/or monitoring for pollutants that contribute to smog, haze and more recently, greenhouse gases (GHG).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nThe EPA has issued several rules relating to MACT standards and GHG emissions from various energy-producing sources. Several court decisions have made the extent of applicability of these rules uncertain. Depending on the final outcomes of these decisions, these regulatory programs could affect our operations by increasing the cost of purchasing electricity or from mandated energy demand reductions that could apply to our mills and other facilities that we operate. The EPA is also expected to issue rules relating to biomass emissions, which is a significant source of energy at our mills. The effect of these existing and future emissions regulations, as well as related court decisions, on our operations remains uncertain. We continue to track and evaluate the litigation and regulatory developments but are not able to predict whether the regulations, when complete and implemented, will have a material effect on our operations.\n \nTo address concerns about GHG as a pollutant, we closely monitor legislative, regulatory and scientific developments pertaining to climate change. For more information about the substantial progress we have made in reducing our GHG emissions, see our discussion in Carbon Record in the Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Practices – Environmental Stewardship section of this report.\n\n\nAdditional factors that could affect regulation of GHG emissions in the future include:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npolicy proposals by federal or state governments regarding regulation of GHG emissions;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCongressional legislation regulating or taxing GHG emissions within the next several years and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nestablishment of a multistate or federal GHG emissions reduction trading system with potentially significant implications for all U.S. businesses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe believe these developments have not had, and in 2025 will not have, a significant effect on our operations. Although these measures could have a material adverse effect on our operations in the future, we expect that we will not be disproportionately affected by these measures as compared with owners of comparable operations. We maintain an active forestry research program to track and understand any potential effect from physical climate change related parameters that could affect the forests we own and manage and do not currently anticipate any near-term disruptions to our planned operations.\n\n\nREGULATION OF AIR EMISSIONS IN CANADA\n\n\nOur wood products facilities are regulated in Canada under provincial air quality regulations. The Canadian federal government has also proposed an air quality management system (AQMS) as a comprehensive national approach for improving air quality in Canada to go along with existing provincial air quality regulations. The AQMS includes:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nambient air quality standards for outdoor air quality management across the country;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na framework for air zone air management within provinces and territories that targets specific sources of air emissions;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nregional airsheds that facilitate coordinated action across borders;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nindustrial sector-based emission requirements that set a national base level of performance for major industries in Canada and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimproved intergovernmental collaboration to reduce emissions from the transportation sector.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition to these existing and proposed regulations, Environment and Climate Change Canada, a Canadian federal agency, released the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change, a \"Greenhouse Gas Emission Framework.\" The framework put in place a national, sector-based GHG reduction program applicable to a number of industries, including ours.\n\n\nAll Canadian provincial governments:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhave GHG reporting requirements;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nare working on reduction strategies and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntogether with the Canadian federal government, are considering new or revised emission standards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAlong with clean air regulations, British Columbia, a province in which we operate, has adopted a carbon tax and Alberta, where we also have operations, has a mandatory GHG emission reduction regulation.\n\n\nAlthough these and related regulations and measures have not had, and we do not expect in 2025 that they will have, a material effect on our operations, they could in the future.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n28\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nREGULATION OF WATER IN THE U.S.\n\n\nOur operations are regulated under the federal Clean Water Act, which regulates the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the U.S. This generally means obtaining permits for certain of our silviculture activities and our operating facilities and abiding by applicable restrictions. Federal agency rulemaking and related litigation under the act affects the definition of water subject to the act’s regulation. This, in turn, has affected the number of required federal and state permits in some areas of our operations and led to adjustments of our operational practices, particularly relating to the application of pesticides and herbicides on timberlands, which has increased operating costs.\n \n\n\nState governments in the U.S. continue to promulgate total maximum daily load (TMDL) requirements for pollutants in water bodies that do not meet state or EPA water quality standards. State TMDL requirements may set:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlimits on pollutants that may be discharged to a body of water; or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nadditional requirements, such as best management practices for nonpoint sources, including timberland operations, to reduce the amounts of pollutants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPending and future federal and state rulemaking, and judicial challenges thereto, could make application of the Clean Water Act, as well as comparable state laws, more or less costly to Weyerhaeuser, and we are not able to predict the final resolution of these matters. Although this and related regulations have not had, and we do not expect in 2025 that they will have, a material effect on our operations, they could in the future.\n\n\nREGULATION OF WATER IN CANADA\n\n\nIn Canada, various levels of government have been working to address water issues including use, quality and management. Recent areas of focus include water allocation, regional watershed protection, protection of drinking water, water pricing and a national water quality index.\n\n\nChanges to the Canadian Federal Fisheries Act have moved the focus of that legislation from habitat protection to fisheries protection and increased penalties. We expect further changes to these regulations, but we cannot predict the scope or potential effect, if any, on our operations. Although this and related Canadian regulations have not had, and we do not expect in 2025 that they will have, a material effect on our operations, they could in the future.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\n\n \n\n\nThis report contains statements concerning our future results and performance that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The length and magnitude of industry cycles vary over time, both by market and by product, but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity. Any decline or stagnation in macroeconomic conditions could cause us to experience lower sales volumes and reduced margins for our products.\n\n\nLow demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling can adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nOur business is particularly dependent upon the health of the U.S. housing market, and specifically on demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling. Demand in these markets is sensitive to changes in economic conditions such as the level of employment, consumer confidence, consumer income, the availability of financing and interest rate levels. Other factors that could limit or adversely affect demand for new homes and home repair and remodeling, and hence demand for our products, include factors such as changes in consumer preferences, limited wage growth, increases in non-mortgage consumer debt, any weakening in consumer confidence, as well as any increase in foreclosure rates and distress sales of houses.\n\n\nCatastrophic events may adversely affect the markets for our products and our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n \n\n\nWe are subject to the risk of various catastrophic events, including but not limited to the occurrence of: severe regional or local weather events or trends and related fires or flooding; wide-spread insect or pest infestations on one or more of our properties; significant geological events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and major erosion in the form of landslides; significant geopolitical events, conditions or developments such as significant international trade disputes or domestic or foreign terrorist attacks, domestic or foreign armed conflict and political unrest; and regional health epidemics or global health pandemics, such as the 2020 outbreak of the novel strain of coronavirus and its many subsequent mutations. Any one or more of these events or conditions, or other catastrophic events or developments, could directly or indirectly significantly affect our ability to operate our businesses and adversely affect domestic and foreign general economic conditions and thus domestic or foreign market demand for our products. The impact of any one or more of these events or conditions may also trigger the occurrence of, or exacerbate, other risks discussed herein, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nHomebuyers’ ability to qualify for and obtain affordable mortgages could be affected by changes in interest rates, changes in home loan underwriting standards and government sponsored entities and private mortgage insurance companies supporting the mortgage market.\n\n\nAccess to affordable mortgage financing is critical to the health of the U.S. housing market. Generally, increases in interest rates make it more difficult for home buyers to obtain mortgage financing, which could negatively affect demand for housing and, in turn, negatively affect demand for our wood products. After maintaining interest rates at historically low levels for an extended period of time, in the first quarter of 2022 the U.S. Federal Reserve began implementing a policy of incrementally raising rates, which it continued through 2023. Although the Federal Reserve began reducing rates in 2024, they remain well above pre-2022 levels. We cannot predict the extent to which the U.S. Federal Reserve's current policy will be maintained or the timing, number, extent or direction of future rate adjustments.\n\n\nAlong with prevailing interest rates, other significant factors affecting the demand for new homes relate to the ability of home buyers to obtain mortgage financing. During the last U.S. recession, credit requirements for home lending were severely tightened and the number of mortgage loans available for financing home purchases were thereby severely reduced. Although the availability of credit has improved since that time, the housing market could be limited or adversely affected if credit requirements were to again tighten or become more restrictive for any reason.\n\n\nAdditionally, the liquidity provided to the mortgage industry by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both of which purchase home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities originated by mortgage lenders, has been critical to the home lending market. Any political or other developments that would have the effect of limiting or restricting the availability of financing by these government sponsored entities could also adversely affect interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing. Whether resulting from further direct increases in borrowing rates, tightened underwriting standards on mortgage loans or reduced federal support of the mortgage lending industry, a challenging mortgage financing environment could reduce demand for housing and, therefore, adversely affect demand for our products.\n\n\nChanges in regulations relating to tax deductions for mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes could harm our future sales and earnings.\n\n\nSignificant costs of homeownership include mortgage interest expense and real estate taxes, both of which are generally deductible for an individual’s federal and, in some cases, state income taxes. Federal legislation reduced the amount of mortgage interest and real estate taxes that certain taxpayers may deduct. These and any similar changes to income tax laws by the federal government or by a state government to eliminate or substantially reduce these income tax deductions, or any significant increase in real property taxes by local governments, may increase the cost of homeownership and thus could adversely affect the demand for our products.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n31\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nPRODUCT PRICING AND PROFITABILITY\n\n\nOur profitability is affected by market dynamics outside of our control.\n\n\nBecause commodity products have few distinguishing properties from producer to producer, competition for these products is based largely on price, which is determined by supply relative to demand and competition from substitute products. Prices for our products are also affected by many other factors outside of our control. As a result, we have little influence or control over the timing and extent of price changes, which often are volatile in our industry. Moreover, our profit margins with respect to these products depend, in part, on managing our costs, particularly raw material, labor (including contract labor) and energy costs, which represent significant cost components that also fluctuate based upon market and other factors beyond our control.\n \n\n\nExcess supply of logs and wood products may adversely affect prices and margins.\n\n\nProducers in our industry have in the past put downward pressure on product pricing by selling excess supply into the market. Our industry may increase harvest levels, which could lead to an oversupply of logs. Wood products producers may likewise expand manufacturing capacity, which could lead to an oversupply of manufactured wood products. Any such increases of industry supply to our markets could adversely affect our prices and margins.\n\n\nTHIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS\n\n\nWe depend heavily on third parties for logging and transportation services, and any increase in the cost or any disruption in the availability of these services could materially adversely affect our business and operations and our financial results.\n\n\nOur businesses depend heavily on the availability of third-party service providers for the harvest of our timber and the transportation of our wood products and wood fiber. We are therefore considerably affected by the availability and cost of these services. Any significant increase in the operating costs to our service providers, including without limitation an increase in the cost of fuel, labor or insurance, could have a material negative effect on our financial results by increasing the cost of these services to us, as well as result in an overall reduction in the availability of these services altogether.\n\n\nOur third-party transportation providers are also subject to several events outside of their control, such as disruption of transportation infrastructure, labor issues\n \nincluding shortages of commercial truck drivers and natural disasters. Any failure of a third-party transportation provider to timely deliver our products, including delivery of our wood products and wood fiber to our customers and delivery of wood fiber to our mills, could harm our supply chain, negatively affect our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our reputation.\n\n\nAs a result of weak business conditions in the timber industry that persisted for several years, there are fewer third-party service providers in certain markets to harvest and deliver our logs. This shortage has resulted in an overall increase in logging and hauling costs and, in some cases, compromised the general availability of these contractors. Any increase in harvest levels due to positive changes in macroeconomic conditions driving demand for logs could further strain the existing supply of third-party logging and hauling service providers. This, in turn, could increase the cost of log supply and delivery, or prevent us from fully capitalizing on favorable market conditions by limiting our ability to access and deliver our logs to market.\n\n\nMANAGING COMMERCIAL TIMBERLANDS RISKS\n\n\nOur ability to harvest and deliver timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nOur primary assets are our timberlands. Weather conditions, timber growth cycles, access limitations and availability of contract loggers and haulers may adversely affect our ability to harvest our timberlands. Other factors that may adversely affect our timber harvest include damage to our standing timber by fire or by insect or pest infestation, disease, prolonged drought, flooding, severe weather and other natural disasters. As discussed in more detail in the following risk factors, changes in global climate conditions could intensify the severity and rate of occurrence of any one or more of these risks that we currently face or introduce other risks that we currently cannot predict. Although damage from such causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of standing timber, there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be limited. As is common in the forest products industry, we do not maintain insurance coverage for damage to our timberlands. Our revenues, net income and cash flow from operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels. Therefore, if we were to be restricted from harvesting on a significant portion of our timberlands for a prolonged period of time, or if material damage to a significant portion of our standing timber were to occur, we could suffer materially adverse effects to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nFuture timber harvest levels may also be affected by our ability to timely and effectively replant harvested areas, which depends on several factors including changes in estimates of long-term sustainable yield because of silvicultural advances, natural disasters, fires, pests, insects and other hazards, regulatory constraints, availability of contractors, U.S. immigration policies and other factors beyond our control.\n\n\nTimber harvest activities are also subject to a number of federal, state and local regulations pertaining to the protection of fish, wildlife, water and other resources. Regulations, government agency policy and guidelines, and litigation, can restrict timber harvest activities and increase costs. Examples include federal and state laws protecting threatened, endangered and “at-risk” species, harvesting and forestry road building activities\n \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n32\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nthat may be restricted under the U.S. Federal Clean Water Act, state forestry practices laws, laws protecting aboriginal rights and other similar regulations.\n\n\nOur estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate and include risks inherent in calculating such estimates, which may impair our ability to realize expected revenues.\n\n\nWhether in connection with managing our existing timberland portfolio or assessing potential timberland acquisitions, we make and rely on important estimates of merchantable timber inventories. These include estimates of timber inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested, timber growth rates and end-product yields. Timber growth rates and yield estimates are developed by forest biometricians and other experts using statistical measurements of tree samples on given property. These estimates are central to forecasting our anticipated timber harvests, revenues and expected cash flows. While the company has confidence in its timber inventory processes and the professionals in the field who administer them, future growth and yield estimates are inherently inexact and uncertain and subject to many external variables that could further affect their accuracy. These external variables include, among other things, disease, insect or pest infestation, natural disasters and changes in weather patterns, all of which could be exacerbated by the impacts of climate change. If these estimates are inaccurate, our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be compromised, which may cause our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and our stock price to be adversely affected.\n\n\nOur financial condition, operating results and cash flows will be materially affected by supply and demand for timber.\n\n\nA variety of factors affect prices for timber, including available supply, changes in economic conditions that affect demand, the level of domestic new construction and remodeling activity, interest rates, credit availability, population growth, weather conditions, insect or pest infestation and other factors. These factors vary by region, by timber type (i.e., sawlogs or pulpwood logs) and by species.\n\n\nTimber prices are affected by changes in demand on a local, national and international level. The closure of a mill in a region where we own timber could have a material adverse effect on demand in that region, and therefore pricing. For example, as the demand for paper continues to decline, closures of pulp mills in some of our operating regions have adversely affected the regional demand for pulpwood and wood chips. Additionally, some of our Asian log export markets, particularly China, have a history of significant volatility. Lower demand for our export logs could have a negative effect on timber prices, particularly in the western region.\n\n\nTimber prices are also affected by changes in timber supply and availability at the local, national and international level. Our timberland ownership is concentrated in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon and Washington. In some of these states, much of the timberland is privately owned. Increases in timber prices often result in substantial increases in harvesting on private timberlands, including lands owned by others and not previously made available for commercial timber operations, causing a short-term increase in supply that moderates such price increases. In western states such as Oregon and Washington, where a greater proportion of timberland is government-owned, any substantial increase in timber harvesting from government-owned land could significantly reduce timber prices. On a local level, timber supplies can fluctuate depending on factors such as changes in weather conditions and harvest strategies of local timberland owners, as well as occasionally high timber salvage efforts due to events such as insect or pest infestations, fires or other natural disasters. Demand for timber in foreign markets can fluctuate due to a variety of factors as well, including but not limited to: changes in the fundamental economic conditions that affect demand for logs in a given export market country or region; any substantial increase in supply of logs from local or regional sources, including such sources that periodically supply large amounts of salvage timber as a result of disease or infestation, and other factors.\n\n\nTimberlands make up a significant portion of our business portfolio and we are therefore subject to real estate investment risks.\n\n\nOur real property holdings are primarily timberlands and we may make additional timberlands acquisitions in the future. As the owner and manager of approximately 10.4 million acres of timberlands, we are subject to the risks that are inherent in concentrated real estate investments. A downturn in the real estate industry generally, or the timber or forest products industries specifically, could reduce the value of our properties and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such a downturn could also adversely affect our customers and reduce the demand for our products, as well as our ability to execute upon our strategy of selling nonstrategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses at attractive prices. These risks may be more pronounced than if we diversified our investments outside of real property holdings.\n \n\n\nMANUFACTURING AND SELLING WOOD PRODUCTS RISKS\n\n\nA material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales, and negatively affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n\n\nAny of our manufacturing facilities, or any of our equipment within an otherwise operational facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nunscheduled maintenance outages;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprolonged power failures;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nequipment failure;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchemical spill or release;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexplosion of a boiler;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n33\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other severe weather conditions or catastrophes affecting the production of goods or the supply of raw materials (including fiber);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe effect of drought or reduced rainfall on water supply;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlabor difficulties;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndisruptions in transportation or transportation infrastructure, including roads, bridges, rail, tunnels, shipping and port facilities;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterrorism or threats of terrorism;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncyberattack;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngovernmental regulations;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nother operational problems and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\neffects of viral or disease outbreaks and any resulting epidemic or global pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe cannot predict the duration of any such downtime or extent of facility damage. If one of our facilities or machines were to incur significant downtime, our ability to meet our production targets and satisfy customer demand could be impaired, resulting in lower sales and income. Additionally, we may be required to make significant unplanned capital expenditures. Although some risks are not insurable and some coverage is limited, we purchase insurance on our manufacturing facilities for damage from fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, other severe weather conditions, equipment failures and boiler explosions. Such insurance may not be sufficient to recover all of our damages.\n\n\nSome of our wood products are vulnerable to declines in demand due to competing technologies or materials.\n\n\nOur products compete with non-fiber based alternatives or with alternative products in certain market segments. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to our wood products such as lumber, veneer, plywood and oriented strand board. Changes in prices for oil, chemicals and wood-based fiber can change the competitive position of our products relative to available alternatives and could increase substitution of those products for our products. If use of these or other alternative products grows, demand for and pricing of our products could be adversely affected.\n\n\nOur financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by changes in product mix or pricing.\n\n\nOur results may be materially adversely affected by a change in our product mix or pricing. Some of our wood products, such as lumber, veneer, plywood and oriented strand board, are commodities and are subject to fluctuations in market pricing. If pricing on our commodity products decreases and if we are not successful in increasing sales of higher-priced, higher-value products, or if we are not successful in implementing price increases, or there are delays in acceptance of price increases or higher-priced products, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. Price discounting, if required to maintain our competitive position in one or more markets, could result in lower than anticipated price realizations and margins.\n\n\nWe face intense competition in our markets; any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nWe compete with North American producers and, for some of our product lines, global producers, some of which may have greater financial resources and lower production costs than we do. The principal basis for competition for many of our products is selling price. Our industries also are particularly sensitive to other factors including innovation, design, quality and service, with varying emphasis on these factors depending on the product line. To the extent that any of our competitors are more successful with respect to any key competitive factor, our ability to attract and retain customers and maintain and increase sales could be materially adversely affected. Any failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nCompetition from lumber imports could vary significantly and have a material effect on U.S. timber and lumber prices.\n\n\nThe future amount and pricing of lumber imports entering U.S. markets remain uncertain. Historically, Canada has been the most significant source of lumber for the U.S. market, particularly in the new home construction market. We produce lumber in our Canadian mills, but the bulk of our lumber production is in the U.S. There have been many disputes and subsequent trade agreements regarding sales of softwood lumber between Canada and the U.S. The last agreement, which required Canadian softwood lumber facilities, including our mills, to pay an export tax when the price of lumber is at or below a threshold price, expired in October 2015. Since that time, the U.S. Department of Commerce has issued countervailing and antidumping duties on softwood lumber imports from Canada based on findings of injury to U.S. lumber producers. We are not able to predict when, or if, a new softwood lumber agreement with Canada will be reached or, if reached, what the terms of the agreement would be. Similarly, we are not able to predict if the current U.S. policy of imposing import duties on Canadian softwood lumber will continue. We could, therefore, experience significant downward pressure on timber and lumber prices caused by Canadian lumber imports.\n\n\nWe also periodically face competition from lumber producers in Europe. Historically, European imports to U.S. markets have been more robust during strong domestic lumber market cycles, which can limit the benefits we realize from high timber and lumber prices by creating downward pressure on pricing. As with Canadian imports, we cannot predict the timing nor the extent of future levels of European lumber imports and could therefore experience significant downward pressure on timber and lumber prices stemming from this source of competition.\n\n\nFor more discussion about U.S. trade policy and its potential effects on our business, see the following risk factor entitled \nU.S. and International Trade Policy\n.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n34\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nCustomer demand for certain brands of sustainably-produced products could reduce competition among buyers for our products or cause other adverse effects.\n\n\nWe have adopted the Sustainable Forestry Initiative\n® \n(SFI) standard for wood fiber supplied to our manufacturing facilities, both from our timberlands and from third-party suppliers. If customer preference for a sustainability standard other than SFI\n \nincreases, or if the SFI\n \nstandard falls into disfavor\n,\n there may be reduced demand and lower prices for our products relative to competitors who can supply products sourced from forests certified to competing certification standards. If we seek to comply with such other standards, we could incur materially increased costs for our operations or be required to modify our operations, such as reducing harvest levels. FSC, in particular, employs standards that are geographically variable and could cause a material reduction in the harvest levels of some of our timberlands, most notably in the Pacific Northwest.\n\n\nOur business and operations could be materially adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials and energy.\n\n\nWe rely heavily on certain raw materials (principally wood fiber and chemicals) and energy sources (principally natural gas, electricity and fuel oil) in our manufacturing processes. Our ability to increase earnings has been, and will continue to be, affected by changes in the costs and availability of such raw materials and energy sources. We may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher raw material or energy costs through price increases, productivity improvements, cost-reduction programs or hedging arrangements. The U.S. has experienced significant inflation, which could continue or worsen and therefore negatively affect the cost or availability of raw materials and energy, which we may not be able to fully pass onto our customers.\n\n\nPHYSICAL RISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n\nChanges in global or regional climate conditions could significantly harm our timberland assets and have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\n\n\nClimate change has the potential to cause significant disruptions to our business and results of operations, cash flow and financial condition. There is increasing concern that increases in global average temperatures caused by increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could cause significant changes in weather patterns, including changes to precipitation patterns and growing seasons. These changes could, in the long term and in some locations, lead to slower growth of our trees and, potentially, changes to the species mix that we manage in our timber assets. An increase in global temperature could also lead to an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural disasters. Thus, damage or access to our timberland assets by existing causes, such as fire, insect or pest infestation, disease, prolonged drought, flooding, windstorms and other natural disasters, could be significantly worsened by climate change. Extreme weather and temperatures could also lead to interruptions of normal work conditions in our operations. Any one or more of these negative effects on commercial timberland operations from climate change, both our own and that of other commercial timberland operators, could also have a material adverse impact on our Wood Products business by significantly affecting the availability, cost and quality of the wood fiber used in our mill operations.\n\n\nWORKFORCE RISK\n\n\nOur business is dependent upon attracting, retaining and developing key personnel.\n\n\nOur\n \nsuccess depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract, retain and develop employees to help run our business, including but not limited to employees needed to staff our operations and key personnel capable of performing at a high level to fill roles in senior corporate and operations management. Our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be significantly adversely affected if we were to fail to recruit, retain, and develop such employees, or if there were to occur any significant decrease in the availability of such employees or any significant increase in the cost of providing such employees with competitive total compensation and benefits. For the last few years, we have experienced a competitive and challenging labor market. In addition, most of our operations are located in rural communities where we draw from local labor forces to fill many positions in both our Timberlands and Wood Products operations. These communities are often beset with many challenges ranging from struggling economies to limited community resources and access to educational opportunities, any one or more of which could lead to decreases in location populations and therefore decreases in the availability of an able and qualified workforce. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, whether caused by any singular event such as the global pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic or other factors, could disrupt our operations and lead to increased labor costs, such as an increased need for overtime work by current employees to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees.\n\n\nA strike or other work stoppage, or our inability to renew collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms, could adversely affect our financial results.\n\n\nA significant number of employees in our Western Timberlands and in our Wood Products businesses located in the Pacific Northwest are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and these employees have in the recent past commenced a work stoppage that was subsequently resolved. We also have collective bargaining agreements with smaller groups of employees in various other parts of our business operations. If our unionized workers were to engage in a protracted work stoppage, we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities. Likewise, if our non-unionized operations were to become unionized and thereafter commence a work stoppage, we could experience a significant disruption of operations at our facilities. If we are unable to reach or renew collective bargaining agreements with our unionized workers, we could also experience higher ongoing labor costs. Any work stoppage by any one or more of our significant customers, transportation providers or suppliers could also have similar negative effects on us. Depending on scope and duration, any of these labor disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n35\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nPENSION PLAN LIABILITY RISK\n\n\nVolatility in interest rates and lower than expected returns on our pension assets could reduce the funded status of our defined benefit pension plans, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans.\n\n\nA portion of our current and former employees have accrued benefits under our defined benefit pension plans. Although the plans are not open to newly hired or rehired employees, current employees hired before the plan closure continue to accrue benefits. Requirements for funding our pension plan liabilities are based on a number of actuarial assumptions, including the expected rate of return on our plan assets and the discount rate applied to our pension plan obligations. Fluctuations in equity market returns and changes in long-term interest rates could increase our costs under our defined benefit pension plans and may significantly affect future contribution requirements. It is unknown what the actual investment return on our pension assets will be in future years and what interest rates may be at any given point in time. We cannot therefore provide any assurance of what our actual pension plan costs will be in the future, or whether we will be required under applicable law to make future material plan contributions. See \nNote 8: Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans\n for additional information about these plans, including funding status.\n\n\nSTRATEGIC INITIATIVES AND EXECUTION RISK\n\n\nOur business and financial results may be adversely affected if we are unable to successfully execute on important strategic initiatives.\n\n\nOur strategic initiatives are designed to improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value. These initiatives include, among others, optimizing cash flow through operational excellence, reducing costs to achieve industry-leading cost structure, innovating in higher-margin products and pursuing opportunities in emerging markets through our Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources segment. For example, through our natural climate solutions business we are pursuing opportunities to participate in new and emerging markets for forest carbon credits and carbon storage, and the success of these endeavors is subject to many known and unknown risks. Known risks include but are not limited to market acceptance or changes in demand for our natural climate solutions products and services as these new markets evolve over time. Political and regulatory developments could also make these business opportunities less profitable or even impossible to pursue. We are also investing significant capital resources in constructing a new TimberStrand\n®\n manufacturing facility, and our ability to realize our projected financial and other benefits of the project is also subject to many known and unknown risks. These include but are not limited to our ability to timely commence or complete construction of the facility, our ability to procure necessary government licenses, approvals and permits, our receipt of certain tax abatement and related financial incentives from state and local governments and the performance of vendors and contractors. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement any one or more of our important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations, which could result in an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\n\n\nWe may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy.\n\n\nWe intend to strategically pursue acquisitions and strategic divestitures when market conditions warrant. As with any investment, our acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. In addition, we anticipate financing many of these acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our unsecured credit facilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from strategic asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. Our inability to finance future acquisitions on favorable terms, or at all, could adversely affect our ability to successfully execute strategic acquisitions and thereby adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\n \n\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY RISK\n\n\nWe will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates.\n\n\nWe have manufacturing operations in Canada. We are also an exporter and compete with global producers of products very similar to ours. Therefore, we are affected by changes in the strength of the U.S. dollar, particularly relative to the Canadian dollar, euro, yuan and yen, and the strength of the euro relative to the yen. Changes in exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales volumes, margins and results of operations.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND TAX RISKS\n\n\n \n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS\n\n\nWe could incur substantial costs as a result of compliance with, violations of, or liabilities under applicable environmental laws and other laws and regulations.\n\n\nWe are subject to a wide range of general and industry-specific laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and wildlife, including those governing:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nair emissions,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwastewater discharges,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nharvesting,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsilvicultural activities, including use of pesticides and herbicides,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n36\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nforestry operations and endangered species habitat protection,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsurface water management,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe storage, usage, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nthe cleanup of contaminated sites,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlandfill operation and closure obligations,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbuilding codes and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhealth and safety matters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWe have incurred, and we expect to continue to incur, significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations,\n \nand there can be no assurances that existing accruals for specific matters will be adequate to cover future costs. We also could incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), cleanup and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.\n\n\nAs the owner and operator of real estate, we may be liable under environmental laws for cleanup, closure and other damages resulting from the presence and release of hazardous substances on or from our current or former properties or operations. In addition, surface water management regulations may present liabilities and are subject to change. The amount and timing of environmental expenditures is difficult to predict, and in some cases, our liability may exceed forecasted amounts or the value of the property itself. The discovery of additional contamination or the imposition of additional cleanup obligations at our sites or third-party sites may result in significant additional costs.\n\n\nWe also lease some of our properties to third-party operators for the purpose of exploring, extracting, developing and producing oil, gas, rock and other minerals in exchange for fees and royalty payments. These activities are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations. These operations may create risk of environmental liabilities for any unlawful discharge of oil, gas or other chemicals into the air, soil or water. Generally, these third-party operators indemnify us against any such liability, and we require that they maintain liability insurance during the term of our lease with them. However, if for any reason our third-party operators are not able to honor their indemnity obligation, or if the required liability insurance were not in effect, then it is possible that we could be deemed responsible for costs associated with\n \nenvironmental liability caused by such third-party operators.\n\n\nAny material liability we incur as a result of activities conducted on our properties by us or by others with whom we have a business relationship could adversely affect our financial condition.\n\n\nWe also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding climate change and energy access, security and competitiveness. As discussed below, we expect these developments to address emission of carbon dioxide, renewable energy and fuel standards, and the monetization of carbon. These developments may also include mandated changes to energy use and building codes which could affect homebuilding practices. Enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the interpretation of these laws or regulations, might require significant expenditures. We also anticipate public policy developments at the state, federal and international level regarding taxes and a number of other areas that could require significant expenditures.\n\n\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n\nGovernmental response to climate change at the international, federal and state levels may affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n\nThere continue to be numerous international, U.S. federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S. and Canada, some of these proposals would regulate and/or tax the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use cleaner energy. Indeed, such regulations have already been passed into law in some Canadian provinces and in Washington state, where we have mill operations. Climate change effects, if they occur, and governmental initiatives, laws and regulations to address potential climate concerns, could increase our costs and have a long-term adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations. Future legislation or regulatory activity in this area remains uncertain, and its effect on our operations is unclear at this time.\n \n\n\nHowever, climate change legislation or related government mandates, standards or regulations intended to mitigate or reduce carbon compound, greenhouse gas emissions or other climate change effects could have significant adverse effects on our business and operations as well as our ability to achieve our recently announced business goals in emerging carbon credit and carbon storage markets. Any one or more of such new legal requirements and regulations could, for example, significantly increase the costs for our mills to comply with stricter air emissions regulations. They could also limit harvest levels for commercial timberland operators, which could in turn adversely affect our timberland operations as well as potentially lead to significant increases in the cost of energy, wood fiber and other raw materials for our wood products businesses. Any one or more of these developments, as well as other unforeseeable governmental responses to climate change, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n37\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nLEGAL MATTERS\n\n\nWe are involved in various environmental, regulatory, product liability and other legal matters, disputes and proceedings that, if determined or concluded in a manner adverse to our interests, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\n\nWe are, from time to time, involved in a number of legal matters, disputes and proceedings (legal matters), some of which involve ongoing litigation. These include, without limitation, legal matters involving environmental clean-up and remediation, warranty and non-warranty product liability claims, regulatory issues, contractual and personal injury claims and other legal matters. In some cases, all or a portion of any loss we experience in connection with any such legal matters will be covered by insurance; in other cases, any such losses will not be covered.\n\n\nThe outcome, costs and other effects of current legal matters in which we are involved, and any related insurance recoveries, cannot be determined with certainty. Although the disclosures in \nNote 13: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies\n contain management\n’\ns current views of the effect such legal matters could have on our financial results, there can be no assurance that the outcome of such legal matters will be as currently expected. It is possible that there could be adverse judgments against us in some or all major litigation matters against us, and that we could be required to take a charge and make cash payments for all or a portion of any related awards of damages. Any one or more of such charges or cash payment could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows for the quarter or year in which we record or pay it.\n\n\nREIT STATUS AND TAX IMPLICATIONS\n\n\nIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, our taxable income would be subject to tax at corporate rates and we would not be able to deduct dividends to shareholders.\n\n\nIn any taxable year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT, unless we are entitled to relief under the IRC:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would not be allowed to deduct dividends to shareholders in computing our taxable income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at applicable corporate rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also would be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which we lost qualification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nQualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC or Code) to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations of these provisions. We closely monitor our compliance with all of the various requirements for maintaining our REIT status. For example, we regularly test our compliance with the general requirement that at least 75 percent of the market value of our total assets consist of REIT-qualifying interests in real property (such as timberlands) and certain other specified qualifying assets, and that no more than 25 percent of the market value of our total assets may consist of assets that are not REIT-qualifying assets. Although we operate in a manner consistent with these REIT qualification rules, we cannot provide assurance that we are or will remain qualified.\n\n\nCertain of our business activities are subject to corporate-level income tax and potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.\n\n\nUnder the IRC, REITs generally must engage in the ownership and management of income producing real estate. For the company, this generally includes owning and managing a timberland portfolio for the production and sale of standing timber. Certain activities that generate non-qualifying REIT income could constitute “prohibited transactions.” Prohibited transactions are defined by the Internal Revenue Code generally to be sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business. Accordingly, the harvesting and sale of logs, the development or sale of certain timberlands and other real estate, and the manufacture and sale of wood products are conducted through one or more of our wholly-owned TRSs, the net income of which is subject to corporate-level tax. By conducting our business in this manner, we believe that we satisfy the REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) were to successfully assert that these or any of our activities conducted at the REIT constituted prohibited transactions, we could be subject to the 100 percent tax on the net income from such activities.\n\n\nThe extent of our use of our TRSs may affect our REIT qualification and affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.\n\n\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more TRSs. The use of our TRSs enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the harvesting and sale of logs, manufacture and sale of wood products, and the development and sale of certain higher and better use (HBU) property. Our TRSs are subject to corporate-level income tax. Under the Code, no more than 20 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs’ operations. While we intend to monitor the value of our investments in the stock and securities of our TRSs to ensure compliance with the 20 percent limitation, we cannot provide assurance that we will always be able to comply with the limitation so as to maintain REIT status. If we were to exceed the 20 percent limitation, we may be forced to sell or otherwise distribute assets of our TRSs in order to remain a qualified REIT. Furthermore, our use of TRSs may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use TRSs at all, or as extensively as we use them.\n\n\nThe failure of either of our two subsidiary REITs to maintain their separate REIT qualification could affect the company’s own REIT qualification.\n\n\nThe vast majority of our timberlands are held in two subsidiaries that we operate to qualify as REITs. Our western timberlands and related assets are held in a subsidiary that began qualifying as a REIT beginning in the tax year 2022 and our southern timberlands and related assets are held\n \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n38\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nin another subsidiary that intends to qualify as a REIT beginning in the tax year 2025. While our ownership interests in these subsidiaries are qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the company’s 75 percent asset test described above, any failure of either subsidiary REIT to maintain its own separate REIT status would generally result in the subsidiary being subject to regular U.S. corporate income tax, as described above, and the company’s ownership interest in the subsidiary no longer qualifying as a real estate asset for purposes of the 75 percent asset test. If this were to occur, the company’s own REIT qualification could be adversely affected.\n\n\nWe may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our TRSs.\n\n\nThe ability of the company to receive dividends from our TRSs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income, and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our TRSs and other non-real estate income. This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our TRSs may affect our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed, and income of our TRSs that is not distributed to the company will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement.\n\n\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT and to avoid an excise tax, we are generally required to distribute substantially all of our taxable income to our shareholders.\n\n\nGenerally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income and (to avoid an excise tax) 95 percent of their net capital gains income. Capital gains may be retained by the REIT but would be subject to corporate income taxes. If capital gains were retained rather than distributed, our shareholders would be deemed to have received a taxable distribution (about which we would notify them), with a credit or refund for any federal income tax paid by the company. We believe that we are not required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income. As previously discussed in these Risk Factors, our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount, timing and frequency of our dividends to shareholders.\n\n\nChanges in tax laws or their interpretation could adversely affect our shareholders and our results of operations.\n\n\nFederal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, the United States Department of the Treasury and state taxing authorities. Changes to tax laws could adversely affect our shareholders or increase our effective tax rates. We cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws applicable to us or our shareholders may be changed.\n\n\nU.S. AND INTERNATIONAL TRADE POLICY\n\n\nChanges in U.S. foreign trade policy and responses from other countries may substantially increase the cost of our products in our export markets as well as increase the cost of imported products and raw materials that we use in our operations.\n\n\nOur ability to conduct business can be significantly affected by changes in tariffs, duties, taxes or customs resulting from changes in U.S. and foreign trade policy. For example, we export logs and finished wood products to foreign markets, including Canada and China, and our ability to do so profitably would be affected by trade disputes that result in tariffs being charged on these products.\n\n\nThe new U.S. presidential administration has proposed to significantly increase tariffs on foreign imports into the United States, including imports from countries to which we export our products, such as Canada and China. In addition to increasing the cost of the wood products that we export to U.S. markets from our Canadian operations, this policy could result in one or more of our foreign export market jurisdictions adopting retaliatory trade policy that makes it more difficult or costly for us to export our products to those countries including, for example, by increasing tariffs, taxes or duties on our products or by placing significant import restrictions on our products such as onerous and excessive phytosanitary requirements. We could therefore experience reduced revenues and margins in our businesses that are adversely affected by international trade policy or disputes, including the terms of any settlement of such disputes. To the extent such trade policies increase prices, they could also reduce the overall demand for our products in affected markets. Likewise, U.S.-imposed tariffs on imports could also increase our costs for products and raw materials that we use in our operations, and we may not be able to pass on those cost increases to our customers. These changes could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and financial condition, including facility closures or impairments of assets. We cannot predict future U.S. or foreign trade policy or the terms and conditions of any resolutions or settlements of international trade disputes and their effects on our business.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOTHER RISKS\n\n\n \n\n\nRISKS RELATED TO OWNING OUR STOCK\n\n\nOur cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.\n\n\nOur board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount and timing of our cash dividends to shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to: our results of operations and cash flows; current and forecasted economic conditions; changes in the current or expected prices and demand for our products and the general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses; current and forecasted harvest levels; balancing various capital allocation priorities and considerations including without limitation the company’s capital requirements and debt repayment obligations; various finance\n \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n39\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nconsiderations, including the company’s credit ratings, borrowing capacity, debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments and other related factors and tax considerations. Consequently, the amount, timing and frequency of our dividends, including our quarterly base dividend and annual supplemental dividend, may fluctuate.\n\n\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control.\n\n\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including without limitation those described above and elsewhere in this report, as well as the following:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or our competitors' operating results;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, capacity changes, significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic investments or initiatives;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nour growth rate and our competitors’ growth rates;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconditions in the financial markets;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmarket interest rates and the relative yields on other financial instruments;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeneral perceptions and expectations regarding housing markets, interest rates, commodity prices and currencies;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchanges in stock market analyst recommendations regarding us, our competitors or the forest products industry generally, or lack of analyst coverage of our common stock;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant shareholders;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsales or repurchases of substantial amounts of common stock;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfluctuation in the market price of our products (see \nProduct Pricing and Profitability\n above);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchanges in accounting principles and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchanges in tax laws and regulations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nIn addition, there has been significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of companies, including companies operating in the forest products industry, that often has been unrelated to individual company operating performance. Some companies that have experienced volatile market prices for their securities have had securities litigation brought against them. If litigation of this type is brought against us, it could result in substantial costs and divert management’s attention and resources.\n\n\nCAPITAL MARKETS RISKS\n\n\nDeterioration in economic conditions and capital markets could adversely affect our access to capital.\n\n\nChallenging market conditions could impair the company\n’\ns ability to raise debt or equity capital or otherwise access capital markets on terms acceptable to us, which may, among other effects, reduce our ability to refinance debt maturities or take advantage of growth and expansion opportunities. Moreover, our businesses require substantial capital for repair or replacement of existing facilities or equipment. While we believe our capital resources will be adequate to meet our current projected operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements, if for any reason we are unable to access capital for our operating needs, capital expenditures and other cash requirements on acceptable economic terms, or at all, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nChanges in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized rating organizations could adversely affect our cost of financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\n\n\nCredit rating agencies rate our debt securities on factors that include our operating results and balance sheet, actions that we take, their view of the general outlook for our industry and their view of the general outlook for the economy. Ratings decisions by these agencies include maintaining, upgrading or downgrading our current rating, as well as placing the company on a \"watch list\" for possible future ratings actions. Any downgrade of our credit rating, or decision by a rating agency to place us on a \"watch list\" for possible future downgrading could have an adverse effect on our ability to access credit markets, increase our cost of financing, and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.\n\n\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND CYBERSECURITY\n\n\nRisks associated with our Information Technology (IT) systems, including but not limited to security breaches, system failures or other significant disruptions, as well as risks relating to implementation of new IT systems such as delays, cost overruns and platform integration problems, could compromise our data and adversely affect our operations, reported financial results and reputation and thereby expose us to potential liability or litigation.\n\n\nWe use IT systems to carry out our operating activities, maintain our business records, and collect and store sensitive data, including but not limited to intellectual property and personally identifiable information. Some of our systems are internally managed and some are maintained by third-party service providers. Although we employ, and we believe our third-party service providers employ, what we deem to be reasonably adequate security measures and controls, there can be no assurance that our efforts will be effective against the risks we face from cyber-attacks, including from: computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists; malicious code (such as malware, viruses and ransomware); an intentional or unintentional personnel action; a natural disaster; a hardware or software corruption, failure or error; a telecommunications system failure or disruption; a service provider failure or error; or any one or more other causes of a security breach, system\n \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n40\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nfailure or disruption. The increased prevalence and sophistication of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, such as AI-enabled malware, could increase the risks of cyber-attacks to our systems and to those of our third-party service providers. Implementation of new IT systems, including replacement of legacy systems with new or upgraded versions, could also pose a significant risk to us, as any such implementation could involve system failure, potential loss or corruption of our important data, security or internal control failures, delays, cost overruns and disruption to our operations.\n \n\n\nAlthough we have, on occasion, experienced cybersecurity threats to our data and IT systems, including phishing attacks, to date no events of this nature have had a material adverse effect on our business or otherwise caused material harm to the company. However, if in the future our IT systems are significantly disrupted, shut down or otherwise compromised for any reason, or if our data is destroyed, misappropriated or inappropriately disclosed, our operations and financial results could be negatively affected. Additionally, we could suffer significant losses or incur significant liabilities, including without limitation damage to our reputation, loss of customer confidence or goodwill and significant expenditures of time and money to address and remediate any resulting damages to affected individuals or business partners or to defend ourselves in resulting litigation or other legal proceedings by affected individuals, business partners or regulators.

Highlights of our training program include:\n•\nAt least annual training for company employees who have access to our information systems.\n•\nSpecialized training for all new hires.\n•\nTargeted training for all employees aimed at responding to current and emerging risks and threats using tools such as situational simulations and frequent testing of our employees' ability to identify and appropriately respond to cybersecurity threats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlignment of our program with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework to prevent, detect and respond to cyberattacks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOngoing adoption of a “zero trust” cybersecurity model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular and robust testing of our systems to assess our vulnerability to cyber risk, which includes targeted penetration testing, tabletop incident response exercises, periodic audits of our systems by outside industry experts and regular vulnerability scanning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA formal vendor risk assessment process to ensure any vendors with information access have appropriate security measures and practices in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngaging\n external cybersecurity experts in incident response development and management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness continuity plans and critical recovery backup systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequiring employees and third parties who have access to our systems to treat confidential and private information and data with care.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsurance for damage to property caused by a cyberattack.\n\n\n\n\n \nOur chief information security officer (CISO) is primarily responsible for leading the technical team that assesses and manages cybersecurity risk for the company on a day-to-day basis\n. \nHe and other members of the cybersecurity team have deep and broad experience and training in cybersecurity management, as well as relevant education and industry recognized certifications in information systems security\n.\n \nCYBERSECURITY INCIDENT RESPONSE PROCESS\nWe maintain and actively update a cybersecurity incident response plan that outlines the steps we take to identify, investigate and take action in response to any potentially material cyber incidents. \nOur \nresponse plan ensures that our Cyber Incident Response Team, which includes our \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n41\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nCISO, \nmembers of our senior management team and select members of our legal staff, is timely informed of and consulted with respect to any potentially material cyber incidents.\nBOARD OVERSIGHT OF CYBER RISK\nMembers of management, including our CISO, regularly report on the company’s cybersecurity matters to both our board’s Audit Committee and to the full board\n, which has primary oversight responsibility in this area, as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur cybersecurity program and risks are specifically discussed at least three times per year (including as part of our discussions regarding enterprise risk management).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur internal audit function’s reviews of our information security programs and controls are included in quarterly reports to the Audit Committee\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent information security issues that arise during the year are discussed throughout the year if potentially significant to the company and are discussed with our chairman and Audit Committee chair between board meetings as appropriate.\n \n\n\n\n\nRISK MITIGATION\nWe also manage cybersecurity risk by limiting our threat landscape. For example, we do not store, transmit or process many of the types of data commonly targeted in cyberattacks, such as consumer credit card or financial information, nor do we store or maintain significant proprietary data on our systems. Moreover, our businesses do not involve or represent national infrastructure, the likes of which are common targets of cyber attackers (e.g., energy, oil and gas, transportation, communications and banking and financial systems). We recognize that cyber threats are a permanent part of the risk landscape and that new threats are constantly evolving. For these and other reasons, cybersecurity is a top risk management priority at Weyerhaeuser.\nLike many companies, we face a number of cybersecurity risks in the day-to-day operation of our business.\n Although during the three-year period ended December 31, 2024 and to date these risks have not materialized into any incident or series of incidents that \nhave materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company\n, its business strategy, results of operations or financial condition or otherwise caused material harm to the company\n, we have, on occasion, experienced cybersecurity threats to our data and information systems, including phishing attacks. Over this same time period, certain of our vendors and service providers have notified us of cybersecurity incidents involving their own systems and these cybersecurity incidents, likewise, have not materially affected us, our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition or otherwise caused material harm to the company. To date, we have incurred no expenses for penalties or settlements with a third party relating to any cybersecurity incidents.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply. However, additional mill capacity being added in the U.S. South has led to tightening of markets in certain geographies. Our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment is affected by a variety of factors, including the general state of the economy, local real estate market conditions, the level of construction activity in the U.S. and evolution of emerging renewable energy and carbon-related markets.\n\n\nOver the past year, home sales and building activity moderated in part due to consistently elevated mortgage interest rates and reduced affordability. Specifically, multi-family construction has been hampered by a large supply of recently completed projects as well as higher interest rates and other factors constraining the underwriting of proposed projects. In contrast, new single-family home construction has remained resilient, as existing homeowners continued to be constrained by the lock-in effect of lower mortgage rates, compared to current rates. On a seasonally adjusted annual basis, as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau, housing starts for fourth quarter 2024 averaged 1.4 million units, a 3.5 percent increase from third quarter 2024. Single-family starts averaged 1.0 million units in fourth quarter 2024, a 3.3 percent increase from third quarter 2024. Multi-family starts averaged 376 thousand units in fourth quarter 2024, which was a 4.1 percent increase from third quarter 2024. Single-family construction is the primary driver for our business as compared to multi-family due to the amount of wood products used. Sales of newly built, single-family homes averaged a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 662 thousand units for fourth quarter 2024, a decrease of 6.5 percent from third quarter 2024, primarily driven by a seasonal reduction in buying activity. Over the medium to long-term, we expect a favorable U.S. housing construction market supported by strong demographics in the key home buying age cohorts, a decade of under building and historically low housing inventory.\n\n\nRepair and remodeling expenditures decreased by 0.7 percent from third quarter 2024 to fourth quarter 2024 according to the Census Bureau Advance Retail Spending report. While there continues to be steady demand due to growing home equity and the lock-in effect, many homeowners have been more cautious in discretionary spending on large projects. Additionally, some repair and remodeling activity was accelerated during the pandemic which has had some impact on the level of spending. This softness has been reflected in both the do-it-yourself (DIY) and professionally built segments. Over the longer term, we expect this sector to resume pre-pandemic growth trends with healthy household balance sheets, elevated home equity and an aging U.S. housing stock, with a median age of 45 years.\n\n\nIn U.S. wood product markets, pricing for lumber and OSB increased during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by more constrained market supply. Demand for both products reflected measured buyer sentiment and a typical seasonal reduction in building activity through the winter months. In fourth quarter 2024, the Random Lengths Framing Lumber Composite price averaged $429/MBF and the OSB Composite averaged\n \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n44\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n$401/MSF. Over the course of fourth quarter 2024, composite prices for lumber increased from $396/MBF to $433/MBF and composite prices for OSB increased from $344/MSF to $418/MSF. Recent mill curtailments contributed to the strengthening lumber prices. OSB prices were supported by steady demand and limited open-market supply.\n \n\n\nIn Western log markets, Douglas fir sawlog prices increased 5.6 percent in fourth quarter 2024 compared with third quarter 2024, as reported by Fastmarkets RISI Log Lines based on Weyerhaeuser’s sales mix. Strengthening lumber prices and seasonal reductions in log supply contributed to log price increases in fourth quarter 2024. In the South, delivered sawlog prices decreased 3.0 percent in fourth quarter 2024 compared to third quarter 2024 and declined 2.9 percent from fourth quarter 2023, as reported by TimberMart-South. This was largely driven by ample log supply and ongoing actions taken by mills to align capacity with lower demand for finished products, partially driven by the seasonal reduction in building activity in the winter months.\n \n\n\nCurrency exchange rates, available supply from other countries and trade policy affect our export businesses. During fourth quarter 2024, end use demand in export markets moderated. In Japan, total housing starts decreased 3.4 percent year to date through November compared to the same period in 2023, while the key Post and Beam segment saw a 2.6 percent decrease. The slowing demand was partially offset by a decrease in lumber imports to Japan from Europe, and reduced inventories of European lumber in the Japanese market. China’s log markets were generally stable despite ongoing softness in end-market demand.\n\n\nInterest rates affect our business primarily through their impact on mortgage rates and housing affordability, their general impact on the economy and their influence on our capital management activities. Actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the overall condition of the economy and fluctuations in financial markets are all factors that influence long-term interest rates. 30-year mortgage rates, which are correlated with long-term interest rates, increased from 6.1 percent in third quarter 2024 to 6.9 percent in fourth quarter 2024, according to economic data from Freddie Mac. Many builders have been able to offset higher mortgage rates through discounts, mortgage rate buydowns and modifying product offerings such as home sizes and finishes. Higher rates have also locked-in many existing homeowners from selling, thereby reducing inventories of existing homes for sale which has led to increased demand for available new homes.\n\n\nIncreased inflation affects the cost of our operations across each of our business segments, including costs for raw materials, transportation, energy and labor. The Consumer Price Index increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent as of December 2024 compared to 2.4 percent in September 2024. This rate is markedly down from its peak of over 9.0 percent in June 2022. While we can offset some of the impacts of inflation through our sales activities, operational excellence initiatives and procurement practices, not all costs associated with inflation can be fully mitigated or passed on to the customer.\n\n\nThe condition of the labor market affects all of our businesses as it relates to our ability to attract and retain employees and contractors. The unemployment rate remained flat at 4.1 percent from third quarter 2024 to fourth quarter 2024.\n\n\nGovernments and businesses across the globe are taking action on climate change and are making significant commitments toward decarbonizing operations and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net zero. Achieving these commitments will require governments and companies to take major steps to modify operations, invest in low-carbon activities and purchase credits to reduce environmental impacts. We believe we are uniquely positioned to help entities achieve these commitments through natural climate solutions, including forest carbon sequestration, carbon capture and storage and renewable energy activities.\n \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n45\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nFINANCIAL PERFO\nRMANCE SUMMARY\n\n\n \n\n\nNet Sales by Segment\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nContribution to Earnings by Segment\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n46\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n\n\nRESULTS OF \nOPERATIONS\n\n\n \n\n\nIn reviewing our results of operations, it is important to understand these terms:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSales realizations refer to net selling prices — this includes selling price plus freight minus normal sales deductions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet contribution (charge) to earnings refers to earnings (loss) before interest expense, loss on debt extinguishment and income taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCONSOLIDAT\nED RESULTS\n\n\nHOW WE DID\n\n\nSummary of Financial Results\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER-SHARE FIGURES\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nAMOUNT OF CHANGE\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nvs.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,124\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,674\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(550\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCosts of sales\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,811\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,992\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(181\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating income\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n685\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,186\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(501\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet earnings\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n396\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n839\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(443\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBasic and diluted earnings per share\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n0.54\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1.15\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(0.61\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPARING 2024 WITH 2023\n\n\nNet Sales\n\n\nNet sales decreased $550 million — 7 percent — primarily due to a $436 million decrease in Wood Products net sales attributable to decreased sales realizations and sales volumes across most product lines, as well as a $142 million decrease in Timberlands net sales to unaffiliated customers attributable to decreased log sales realizations and sales volumes in the Western and Southern regions.\n\n\nCosts of Sales\n\n\nCosts of sales decreased $181 million — 3 percent — primarily due to decreased sales volumes across most product lines in Wood Products, as well as decreased sales volumes in our Timberlands segment, partially offset by an increase in acres sold in our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment.\n\n\nOperating Income\n\n\nOperating income decreased $501 million — 42 percent — primarily due to a $369 million decrease in consolidated gross margin (see discussion of components above), as well as an $84 million decrease in gain on sale of timberlands (refer to \nNote 4: Timberland Acquisitions and Divestitures\n).\n\n\nNet Earnings\n\n\nNet earnings decreased $443 million — 53 percent — primarily due to the $501 million decrease in operating income discussed above.

primarily attributable to a 5 percent decrease in sales volumes.\n\n\nIntersegment Sales\n\n\nIntersegment sales decreased $18 million — 3 percent — primarily due to a 6 percent decrease in sales

sales volumes.\n\n\nNet Contribution to Earnings\n\n\nNet contribution to earnings decreased $208 million — 43 percent — primarily due to the change in the components of gross margin, as discussed

Estimated payments of contractually obligated post-employment benefits are not included due to the uncertainty of payment timing.\n\n\nOFF-BALANCE SHE\nET ARRANGEMENTS\n\n\nOff-balance sheet arrangements have not had — and are not reasonably likely to have — a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. \nNote 10: Line of Credit\n contains our disclosures of surety bonds and letters of credit.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, LEGAL PROC\nEEDINGS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\n\n\n \n\n\nSee \nNote 13: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies\n.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nACCOUNTIN\nG MATTERS\n\n\n \n\n\nCRIT\nICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\n\n\nIn the preparation of our financial statements we follow established accounting policies and make estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and assumptions we believe are appropriate and reasonable under current circumstances. Actual results, however, could differ materially from the estimated amounts we have recorded. Some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Accounting policies whose application involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and may have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition are considered critical accounting estimates.\n\n\nDISCOUNT RATES FOR PENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFIT PLANS\n\n\nDiscount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our pension and other post-employment plan obligations. These rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits. The selection of discount rates requires judgment as well as the involvement of actuarial specialists. These specialists assist with selecting yield curves based on published indices for high-quality corporate bonds and projecting the timing and amount of cash flows associated with our obligations to ultimately support our determination of an appropriate discount rate for each plan.\n\n\nOur discount rates as of December 31, 2024 are:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.7 percent for our U.S. pension plans — compared with 5.2 percent at December 31, 2023;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.5 percent for our U.S. post-employment benefit plans — compared with 5.1 percent at December 31, 2023;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.7 percent for our Canadian pension plans — compared with 4.7 percent at December 31, 2023 and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.5 percent for our Canadian post-employment benefit plans — compared with 4.6 percent at December 31, 2023.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPension expenses for 2025 will be based on the 5.7 percent and 4.7 percent assumed discount rates for the U.S. pension plans and the Canadian pension plans, respectively, and the 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent assumed discount rates for the U.S. and Canadian post-employment benefit plans, respectively.\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K \n55\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nOur discount rates are important in determining the cost of our plans.

This measure should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our results reported in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). However, we believe Adjusted EBITDA provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our operating performance, better facilitates period to period comparisons and is widely used by analysts, lenders, rating agencies and other interested parties. Our definition of Adjusted EBITDA may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items.\n \n\n\nAdjusted EBITDA by

Adjusted FAD should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, we believe the measure provides meaningful supplemental information for our investors about our liquidity. Adjusted FAD, as we define it, is net cash from operations adjusted for capital expenditures and significant non-recurring items. Our definition of Adjusted FAD may be different from similarly titled measures reported by other companies, including those in our industry.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in\n Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\nProjected benefit obligations for pensions\n\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's projected benefit obligations for pension plans were $2,234 million as of December 31, 2024, which included the projected benefit obligation for the U.S. qualified pension plans. The Company estimates the liability related to their pension plans using actuarial models that include assumptions about the Company’s discount rates.\n \n\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company’s projected benefit obligation for the U.S. qualified pension plans as a critical audit matter. This is due to the sensitivity of the obligation to changes in the discount rate used and the subjectivity in evaluating the rate. Additionally, the assessment of the discount rate required specialized actuarial skills and knowledge.\n\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the U.S. qualified pension obligation process. This included controls related to the actuarial determination of the discount rate used in the valuation of the projected benefit obligation for the U.S. qualified pension plans. These procedures also included analyzing year-over-year changes to the projected cash flows associated with the obligation. Additionally, we involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in the evaluation of the Company’s discount rate by:\n\n\n•\nevaluating the selected yield curve used to determine the discount rate\n\n\n•\nassessing changes in the discount rate from the prior year against changes in published indices\n\n\n•\nevaluating the discount rate based on the projected cash flows compared with those of similar plans.\n\n\n/s/ \nKPMG LLP\n\n\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\n\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\n\nFebruary 14, 2025\n\n\n \nWEYERHAEUSER

STATEMENTS\n\n\n \n\n\nNOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur significant accounting policies describe:\n \n•\nour election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust,\n•\nhow we report our results,\n•\nchanges in how we report our results and\n•\nhow we account for certain key items.\nREAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUST (REIT)\nWe are organized as a REIT. Our holding company and two subsidiaries, which collectively hold most of the timberland assets related to our Timberlands segment, each operate as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. We also own Taxable REIT Subsidiaries (TRSs), which collectively hold the assets relating to our Wood Products segment and portions of our Timberlands and Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources (Real Estate & ENR) segments. REIT income can be distributed to shareholders without first paying corporate level tax, which substantially eliminates the double taxation of income. We expect to derive most of our REIT income from investments in timberlands, including the sale of standing timber through pay-as-cut sales contracts and lump sum timber deeds. We continue to be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on earnings of our TRSs.\nHOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS\nOur report includes:\n \n•\nconsolidated financial statements,\n•\nour business segments,\n•\nestimates,\n•\nfair value measurements and\n•\nforeign currency translation.\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nOur consolidated financial statements provide an overall view of our results and financial condition. They include our accounts and the accounts of entities that we control, including majority-owned domestic and foreign subsidiaries.\nThey do not include our intercompany transactions and accounts, which are eliminated.\nThroughout these \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n, unless specified otherwise, references to “Weyerhaeuser,” \"the company,\" “we” and “our” refer to the consolidated company.\nOur Business Segments\nReportable business segments are determined based on the company’s \"management approach,\" as defined by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 280, \nSegment Reporting\n. The management approach is based on the way the chief operating decision maker organizes the segments within a company for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their performance.\nWe are principally engaged in:\n \n•\ngrowing and harvesting timber;\n•\nmaximizing the value of our acreage through the sale of higher and better use (HBU) properties and\n \nmonetizing the value of surface and subsurface assets through leases and royalties and\n•\nmanufacturing, distributing and selling products made from trees.\n \nOur business segments are organized based primarily on products and services.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEGMENT\n\n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimberlands\n\n\nLogs, timber, recreational leases and other products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Estate & ENR\n\n\nReal Estate (sales of timberlands) and ENR (rights to explore for and extract hard minerals, construction materials, natural gas production, wind and solar).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWood Products\n\n\nStructural lumber, oriented strand board, engineered wood products and building materials distribution.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n67\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nWe also transfer raw materials, semi-finished materials and end products among our business segments. Because of this intracompany activity, accounting for our business segments involves pricing products transferred between our business segments at current market values.\nUnallocated items are gains or charges not related to, or allocated to, an individual operating segment. They include all or a portion of items such as share-based compensation, pension and post-employment costs, elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, interest income and other.\nEstimates\nWe prepare our financial statements according to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP). This requires us to make estimates and assumptions during our reporting periods and at the date of our financial statements. The estimates and assumptions affect our:\n \n•\nreported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity;\n•\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and\n•\nreported amounts of revenues and expenses.\n \nWhile we believe the assumptions used in preparing these estimates are appropriate and reasonable, actual results can and do differ from those estimates and assumptions.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe use a fair value hierarchy in accounting for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities including:\n \n•\nlong-lived assets (asset groups) measured at fair value for an impairment assessment;\n•\npension plan assets measured at fair value and\n•\nasset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value.\n \nThe fair value hierarchy is based on inputs to valuation techniques that are used to measure fair value that are either observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect a reporting entity’s pricing based upon its own market assumptions.\nThe fair value hierarchy consists of the following three levels:\n \n•\nLevel 1: Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in an active market.\n•\nLevel 2: Inputs are quoted prices in non-active markets for which pricing inputs are observable either directly or indirectly at the reporting date.\n•\nLevel 3: Inputs are derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or value drivers are unobservable.\nForeign Currency Translation\nWe translate foreign currencies into U.S. dollars in two ways:\n \n•\nassets and liabilities — at the exchange rates in effect as of our balance sheet date and\n•\nrevenues and expenses — at average monthly exchange rates throughout the year.\nCHANGES IN HOW WE REPORT OUR RESULTS\nChanges in how we report our results come from:\n \n•\nreclassification of certain balances and results from prior years to make them consistent with our current reporting and\n•\naccounting changes made upon our adoption of new accounting guidance.\nReclassifications\nWe have reclassified certain balances and results from prior years to be consistent with our 2024\n reporting. This makes balances comparable from year to year. Our reclassifications had no effect on consolidated net earnings or equity.\nHOW WE ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN KEY ITEMS\nThis section provides information about how we account for certain key items related to:\n \n•\ncapital investments,\n•\nfinancing our business and\n•\nour operations.\nITEMS RELATED TO CAPITAL INVESTMENTS\nKey items related to accounting for capital investments pertain to property and equipment, timber and timberlands and impairment of long-lived assets.\n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n68\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nProperty and Equipment\nWe maintain property accounts on an individual asset basis and account for them as follows:\n \n•\nImprovements to and replacements of major units of property are capitalized.\n•\nMaintenance, repairs and minor replacements are expensed.\n•\nDepreciation is calculated using a straight-line method at rates based on estimated service lives.\n•\nCosts associated with logging roads that we intend to utilize for a period longer than one year are capitalized. These roads are then amortized over an estimated service life.\n•\nCost and accumulated depreciation of property sold or retired are removed from the accounts and the gain or loss is included in earnings.\nTimber and Timberlands\nWe carry timber and timberlands at cost less depletion. Depletion refers to the carrying value of timber that is harvested or sold.\nKey activities affecting how we account for timber and timberlands include:\n \n•\nreforestation,\n•\ndepletion and\n•\nforest management in Canada.\n \nReforestation.\n Generally, we capitalize initial site preparation and planting costs as reforestation and then expense costs after the first planting as they are incurred or over the period of expected benefit. These expensed costs include:\n \n•\nfertilization,\n•\nvegetation and insect control,\n•\npruning and precommercial thinning and\n•\nproperty taxes.\n \nAccounting practices for these costs do not change when timber becomes merchantable and harvesting starts.\nTimber Depletion.\n To determine depletion rates, we divide the net carrying value of timber by the related volume of timber estimated to be available over the growth cycle. To determine the growth cycle volume of timber, we consider:\n \n•\nregulatory and environmental constraints,\n•\nour management strategies,\n•\ninventory data improvements,\n•\ngrowth rate revisions and recalibrations and\n•\nknown dispositions and inoperable acres.\n \nIn addition, the duration of the harvest cycle varies by geographic region and species of timber.\nDepletion rate calculations do not include estimates for:\n \n•\nfuture silviculture or sustainable forest management costs associated with existing stands;\n•\nfuture reforestation costs associated with a stand's final harvest and\n•\nfuture volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest.\n \n \nWe include the cost of timber harvested in the carrying values of raw materials and product inventories. As these inventories are sold to third parties, we include them in costs of sales.\nForest Management in Canada. \nWe manage timberlands under long-term licenses in various Canadian provinces that are:\n \n•\ngranted by the provincial governments;\n•\ngranted for initial periods of \n15\n to \n25 years\n and\n•\nrenewable provided we meet reforestation, operating and management guidelines.\n \nCalculation of the fees we pay on the timber we harvest:\n \n•\nvaries from province to province,\n•\nis tied to product market pricing and\n•\ndepends upon the allocation of land management responsibilities in the license.\n \n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n69\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever an event or a change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable through future operations. The carrying value is the original cost, less accumulated depreciation and any past impairments recorded. If we evaluate recoverability, we are required to estimate future cash flows and residual values of the asset or asset group. Key assumptions used in developing estimates of future cash flows and residual values could include probability of alternative outcomes, product pricing, raw material cost and product sales. An impairment occurs when the carrying value of a long-lived asset is greater than the amount that could be recovered from the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset and greater than fair market value (the amount we could receive if we were to sell the asset).\n \nImpaired assets held for use are written down to fair value, while impaired assets held for sale are written down to fair value less cost to sell. We determine fair value based on:\n \n•\nappraisals,\n•\nmarket pricing of comparable assets,\n•\ndiscounted value of estimated future cash flows from the asset,\n•\nreplacement values of comparable assets and\n•\nagreed upon sale price or offer price.\n \nKey assumptions used in developing estimates of fair value would include the estimated future cash flows used to assess recoverability, discount rates and probability of alternative outcomes.\n \nITEMS RELATED TO FINANCING OUR BUSINESS\nKey items related to financing our business include financial instruments, cash equivalents and concentration of risk.\nFinancial Instruments\nWe estimate the fair value of financial instruments where appropriate. The assumptions we use — including the discount rate and estimates of cash flows — can significantly affect the fair value. These values are estimates and may not match the amounts we would realize upon sale or settlement of our financial positions.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents are investments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase. We state cash equivalents at cost, which approximates market.\nConcentration of Risk\nWe disclose customers that represent a concentration of risk. As of December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, no c\nustomer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales.\nITEMS RELATED TO OPERATIONS\nKey items related to operations include revenue recognition, inventories, shipping and handling costs, income taxes, pension and other post-employment benefit plans and contingent liabilities.\nRevenue Recognition\nRefer to \nNote 3: Revenue Recognition\n for details on how we account for revenue.\nInventories\nWe state inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost includes labor, materials and production overhead. LIFO applies to major inventory products held at our U.S. domestic locations. We began to use the LIFO method for domestic products in the 1940s as required to conform with the tax method elected. Subsequent acquisitions of entities added new products under the moving average cost or FIFO — the first-in, first-out — methods and those products continue to be recognized under those methods. The moving average cost or FIFO method applies to the balance of our domestic raw material and product inventories, all material and supply inventories and all foreign inventories.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nWe classify shipping and handling costs in \"Costs of sales\" in our \nConsolidated Statement of Operations\n.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Unrecognized tax benefits represent potential future funding obligations to taxing authorities if uncertain tax positions we have taken on previously filed tax returns are not sustained. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized as a component of income tax expense.\n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n70\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect:\n \n•\nfuture tax consequences due to differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases of certain items and\n•\nnet operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\n \nTo measure deferred tax assets and liabilities, we:\n \n•\ndetermine when the differences between carrying amounts and tax bases of affected items are expected to be recovered or resolved and\n•\nuse enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in those years.\nPension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans\nWe recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension and other post-employment benefit plans on our \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n and recognize changes in the funded status through comprehensive income (loss) in the year in which the changes occur.\nActuarial valuations determine the amount of the pension and other post-employment benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit cost we recognize. The net periodic benefit cost includes:\n \n•\ncost of benefits provided in exchange for employees’ services rendered during the year;\n•\ninterest cost of the obligations;\n•\nexpected long-term return on plan assets;\n•\ngains or losses on plan settlements and curtailments;\n•\namortization of prior service costs and plan amendments over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the participants affected by the plan amendment are inactive and\n•\namortization of cumulative unrecognized net actuarial gains and losses — generally in excess of 10 percent of the greater of the benefit obligation or the combination of market-related and fair value of plan assets at the beginning of the year — over the average remaining service period of the active employee group covered by the plans or the average remaining life expectancy in situations where the plan participants are inactive.\n \nPension plans. \nWe have defined benefit pension plans covering appro\nximately \n35\n percent of ou\nr employees. Determination of benefits differs for salaried, hourly and union employees as follows:\n \n•\nSalaried employee benefits are based on each employee’s highest monthly earnings for five consecutive years during the final \n10\n years before retirement.\n•\nHourly and union employee benefits generally are stated amounts for each year of service.\n•\nUnion employee benefits are set through collective-bargaining agreements.\n \nWe contribute to our U.S. and Canadian pension plans according to established funding standards. The funding standards for the plans are:\n \n•\nU.S. pension plans — according to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and\n•\nCanadian pension plans — according to the applicable provincial pension act and the Income Tax Act.\n \nPost-employment benefits other than pensions. \nWe provide certain post-employment healthcare and life insurance benefits for some retired employees. In some cases, we pay a portion of the cost of the benefit.\n \nNote 8: Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans\n \nprovides additional information about our post-employment benefit plans.\nEstimates for pension and other post-employment benefit plans. \nEstimates we use in accounting for our pension and other post-employment benefit plans include the:\n \n \n•\nfair value of our plan assets;\n•\nexpected long-term rate of return on plan assets and\n•\ndiscount rates.\n \nAt the end of every year, we review our estimates with external advisers and make adjustments as appropriate. We use these estimates to calculate plan asset and liability information as of year-end as well as pension and post-employment expense for the following year. Actual experience that differs from our estimates and subsequent changes in our estimates could have a significant effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nFair value of plan assets. \nPlan assets are assets of the pension plan trusts that fund the benefits provided under the pension plans. The fair value of our plan assets estimates the amount that would be received if we were to sell each asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. We estimate the fair value of these assets based on the information available during the year-end reporting process.\n \nRefer to \nNote 8: Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans\n for information about the assets held within our pension plans and their related valuation methods.\n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n71\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets. \nOur expected long-term rate of return is our estimate of the return that our plan assets will earn over time. This rate is used in determining the net periodic benefit or cost we recognize for our plans.\nFactors we consider in determining our expected long-term rate of return include:\n \n•\nhistorical returns for a portfolio of assets similar to our expected allocation and\n•\nexpected future performance of similar asset classes.\n \nThe actual return on plan assets in any given year may vary from our expected long-term rate of return. Actual returns on plan assets affect the funded status of the plans. Differences between actual returns on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return are reflected as adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive loss, a component of total equity.\nDiscount rates. \nDiscount rates are used to estimate the net present value of our plan obligations. The discount rates are determined at the measurement date by matching current spot rates of high-quality corporate bonds with maturities similar to the timing of expected cash outflows for benefits.\nContingent Liabilities\nWe are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental remediation, product and other matters, and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters, as well as the amount or range of potential loss.\nWe record contingent liabilities when:\n \n•\nit becomes probable that a loss has been incurred and\n•\nthe amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.\n \nAssessing probability of loss and estimating the amount of loss can require analysis of multiple factors, such as:\n \n•\nhistorical experience,\n•\nevaluations of relevant legal and environmental authorities and regulations,\n•\njudgments about the potential actions of third-party claimants and courts and\n•\nconsideration of potential environmental remediation methods.\n \nIn addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses, we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred.\nRecorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain. Future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. If estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims, we record additional charges. These exposures and proceedings can be significant and the ultimate outcomes could be material to our operating results or cash flows in any given period. Recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recorded as assets when the recovery is deemed probable and does not exceed the amount of losses previously recorded. See \nNote 13: Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies\n for more information.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSegment Reporting\n \nIn \n2024\n, we \nadopted\n the FASB Accounting Standards Update (ASU) \n2023-07\n,\"Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\", which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for reportable segments, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expenses. The adoption of this standard did \nno\nt impact our \nConsolidated Statement of Operations\n, \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n \nor \nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n. The expanded segment disclosures are incorporated in \nNote 2: Business Segments\n.\n \nIncome Taxes\n \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures”, which expands annual income tax disclosures to disaggregate rate reconciliations and income taxes paid by nature and jurisdiction. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2023-09 should be applied on a prospective basis, however, retrospective application is permitted. The adoption of the new guidance will not impact our \nConsolidated Statement of Operations\n, \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n \nor \nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n. We plan to incorporate these expanded disclosures beginning in fourth quarter 2025.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \"Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\", which expands annual and interim disclosure requirements for certain income statement expenses. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of the new guidance will not impact our \nConsolidated Statement of Operations\n, \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n \nor \nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n.

We account for revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 606, \nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n.\nPERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\nA performance obligation, as defined in ASC Topic 606, is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue at the point in time, or over the period, in which the performance obligation is satisfied.\nPerformance obligations associated with delivered log sales are typically satisfied when the logs are delivered to our customers’ mills or delivered to an ocean vessel in the case of export sales. Performance obligations associated with the sale of wood products are typically satisfied when the products are shipped. We have elected, as an accounting policy, to treat shipping and handling that is performed after a customer obtains control of the product as an activity required to fulfill the promise to transfer the good; therefore we will not evaluate this requirement as a separate performance obligation.\n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n74\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nCustomers are generally invoiced shortly after logs are delivered or after wood products are shipped, with payment generally due within a month or less of the invoice date. ASC Topic 606 requires entities to consider significant financing components of contracts with customers, though allows for the use of a practical expedient when the period between satisfaction of a performance obligation and payment receipt is one year or less. Given the nature of our revenue transactions, we have elected to utilize this practical expedient.\nPerformance obligations associated with real estate sales are generally met when placed into escrow and all conditions of closing have been satisfied.\nCONTRACT ESTIMATES\nSubstantially all of our performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time. Therefore, there is little judgment in determining when control transfers for our business segments as described above.\nThe transaction price for log sales generally equals the amount billed to our customer for logs delivered during the accounting period. For the limited number of log sales subject to a long-term supply agreement, the transaction price is variable but is known at the time of billing. For wood products sales, the transaction price is generally the amount billed to the customer for the products shipped but may be reduced slightly for estimated cash discounts and rebates.\nThere are no significant contract estimates related to the real estate business.\nCONTRACT BALANCES\nIn general, customers are billed and a receivable is recorded as we ship and/or deliver wood products and logs. We generally receive payment shortly after products have been received by our customers. Contract asset and liability balances are immaterial.\nFor real estate sales, the company receives the entire consideration in cash at closing.\n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n75\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nMAJOR PRODUCTS\nA Reconciliation of Revenue Recognized by our Major Products:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales to unaffiliated customers:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTimberlands segment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDelivered logs:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDomestic sales\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n350\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n377\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n414\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExport grade sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n343\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n417\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n590\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal West\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n693\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n794\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,004\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n603\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n643\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n645\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n48\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubtotal delivered logs sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,342\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,485\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,705\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStumpage and pay-as-cut timber\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecreational and other lease revenue\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n77\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n74\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n68\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n42\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales attributable to Timberlands segment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,512\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,654\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,858\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal Estate & ENR segment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal estate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n280\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n237\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n235\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy and natural resources\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n111\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n126\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n133\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales attributable to Real Estate & ENR segment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n391\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n363\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n368\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWood Products segment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructural lumber\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,906\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,123\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,374\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriented strand board\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n979\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n944\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,578\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineered solid section\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n708\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n783\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n862\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEngineered I-joists\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n390\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n447\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n573\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftwood plywood\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n158\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n166\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n193\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedium density fiberboard\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n159\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n155\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n192\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nComplementary building products\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n615\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n704\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n840\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n306\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n335\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n346\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet sales attributable to Wood Products segment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,221\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,657\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n7,958\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,124\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n7,674\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10,184\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nOther Timberlands sales includes sales of seeds and seedlings from our nursery operations as well as wood chips.\n(2)\nOther Wood Products sales include wood chips, other byproducts and third-party residual log sales from our Canadian Forestlands operations. \n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n76\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nNOTE 4: TIMBERLAND ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nALABAMA ACQUISITIONS\nOn July 25, 2024, we announced acquisitions totaling \n84\n thousand acres of Alabama timberlands for $\n244\n million.

The Pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit Plans section of \nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n \nprovides information about how we account for pension and other post-employment plans and benefits.\nPLANS WE SPONSOR\nOVERVIEW OF PLANS\nThe defined benefit pension plans we sponsor in the U.S. and Canada differ according to each country’s requirements. In the U.S., we have plans that qualify under the Internal Revenue Code (qualified plans), as well as plans for select employees that provide additional benefits not qualified under the Internal Revenue Code (nonqualified plans). In Canada, we have plans that are registered under the Income Tax Act and applicable provincial pension acts (registered plans), as well as nonregistered plans for select employees that provide additional benefits that may not be registered under the Income Tax Act or provincial pension acts (nonregistered plans). We also sponsor other post-employment benefit (OPEB) plans in the U.S. and Canada, including retiree medical and life insurance plans. Our defined benefit pension plans were closed to newly hired and rehired salaried and non-union employees effective January 1, 2014, and were closed to union employees at various dates over the course of 2014 to 2019.\nWe sponsor various defined contribution plans for our U.S. and Canadian salaried and hourly employees. Our contributions to these plans were $\n37\n million, $\n35\n million and $\n31\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nActions to Reduce Pension Plan Obligations\nAs part of our continued efforts to reduce pension plan obligations, we transferred approximately $\n420\n million of Canadian registered assets and liabilities to an insurance company through the purchase of a group annuity contract in December 2022 (2022 Retiree Annuity Purchase). In connection with this transaction, we recorded a noncash pretax settlement charge of $\n205\n million during 2022. This settlement charge accelerated the recognition of previously unrecognized losses in \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss,\" that would have been recognized in subsequent periods. Given the timing of the 2022 Retiree Annuity Purchase, the plan remeasurement triggered as a result of the transaction was conducted as part of our annual valuation process.\n \n \n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n79\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nFUNDED STATUS OF PLANS\nThe funded status of the plans we sponsor is determined by comparing the projected benefit obligation with the fair value of plan assets at the end of the year.

the cumulative income or expense that we have recorded associated with the plans. The differences are actuarial (gain) loss and prior service (cost) credit that are deferred and amortized into periodic benefit costs in future periods. Unamortized amounts are recorded in \"Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\", which is a component of total equity on our \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n. The Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss section of \nNote 14: Shareholders' Interest\n details changes in these amounts by component.\n(3)\nFor pension plans with a projected benefit obligation exceeding plan assets, the projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $\n2.0\n billion and $\n1.5\n billion at December 31, 2024\n, respectively, and $\n2.1\n billion and $\n1.7\n billion at \nDecember 31, 2023, respectively. For pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation exceeding plan assets, the accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets were $\n2.0\n billion and $\n1.5\n billion at December 31, 2024\n, respectively, and $\n2.1\n billion and $\n1.7\n billion at \nDecember 31, 2023, respectively.\n(4)\nFor the U.S. defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was \n5.7\n% and \n5.2\n% for \n2024 and 2023, respectively. For the Canadian defined benefit plans, the discount rate assumption was \n4.7\n% for both 2024 and 2023. For U.S. OPEB plans, the discount rate assumption was \n5.5\n% and \n5.1\n% for \n2024 and 2023, respectively. For Canadian OPEB plans, the discount rate assumption was \n4.5\n% and \n4.6\n% for \n2024 and 2023, respectively. For lump sum distributions (for U.S. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only), the interest and mortality assumptions are the same as those mandated by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 for benefits commencing in the current year.\n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n80\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n(5)\nFor the U.S. defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption for both 2024 and 2023 was between \n2.00\n% - \n13.00\n%\n for salaried participants and was decreasing with participant age. For the Canadian defined benefit plans, the rate of compensation increase assumption was \n1.00\n% - \n2.75\n%\n and \n2.00\n% - \n2.75\n%\n for salaried and hourly participants, respectively, for both 2024 and 2023.\n(6)\nU.S. qualified salaried and nonqualified plans only.\n(7)\nFor U.S. OPEB plans, the healthcare cost trend rate assumption for the next year for Pre-Medicare was \n7.00\n% and \n7.25\n% for \n2024 and 2023, respectively. The ultimate healthcare cost trend rate was \n4.50\n% for both 2024 and 2023 and the assumption for the year the ultimate healthcare cost trend rate is reached was \n2035\n for both 2024 and 2023. For Canadian OPEB plans, the healthcare cost trend rate assumption for the next year was \n5.06\n% and \n5.13\n% for \n2024 and 2023, respectively. The ultimate healthcare cost trend rate was \n4.00\n% and the assumption for the year the ultimate healthcare cost trend rate is reached was \n2040\n for both 2024 and 2023\n.\nPENSION ASSETS\nOur Investment Policies and Strategies\nOur investment policies, strategies and advisory agreements guide and direct how the funds are managed for the benefit plans we sponsor. These funds include our:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Pension Trust — funds our U.S. qualified pension plans;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanadian Pension Trust — funds our Canadian registered pension plans and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetirement Compensation Arrangements — fund a portion of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans.\n\n\n\n\nU.S. and Canadian Pension Trusts\nIn 2018, we began to shift pension plan assets to an allocation that more closely aligns with our pension plan liability profile. Our former investment strategy included investments primarily in hedge funds and private equity funds. These asset classes are now in redemption and run-off mode. However, given the long-term nature of these investments, they will continue to comprise a portion of the plan assets for several years. We expect all investments in redemption to be redeemed at amounts materially consistent with their net asset values (NAV). As these investments are redeemed or liquidated, cash proceeds available for investment will be invested in accordance with our current investment strategy.\nOur investment strategy targets a percentage allocation to growth assets and a percentage allocation to liability hedging assets based on each plan’s funded status. We expect to increase the allocation to liability hedging assets over time as the funded status of the pension plans improves. Growth assets may include investments in global public equities, hedge funds (which are in redemption), private equity assets (which are in run-off mode), fixed income and real estate. Liability hedging assets may include corporate credit and government issued fixed income securities as well as treasury futures selected to align with the plan liabilities.\nAssets within our U.S. and Canadian pension trusts were invested as follows:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDECEMBER 31,\n 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDECEMBER 31,\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCash and short-term investments\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n4.0\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.1\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic equity investments\n(2)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed income investments:\n(3)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorporate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n32.4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n45.6\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n21.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16.9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepurchase agreements\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n1.3\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHedge funds and related investments\n(4)(5)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.1\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3.4\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivate equity and related investments\n(5)(6)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25.5\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n30.5\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDerivative instruments, net\n(7)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.1\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.1\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccrued liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.4\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n0.2\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n100.0\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nCash and short-term investments are valued at cost, which approximates market.\n(2)\nPublic equity investments are valued at exit prices quoted in active markets.\n(3)\nFixed income investments include publicly traded corporate and government issued debt. These bonds have varying maturities, credit quality and sector exposure and are selected to align with the duration of our plan liabilities. Additionally, at December 31, 2023 our fixed income portfolio included repurchase agreements, which represent short-term borrowings to hedge against interest rate risk. We have an obligation to return the cash related to these borrowings in accordance with the agreements, which are collateralized by our government bonds. Fixed income investments are valued at exit prices quoted in active or non-active markets or based on observable inputs.\n(4)\nHedge funds and related investments are privately-offered managed pools primarily structured as limited liability entities. General members or partners of these limited liability entities serve as portfolio managers and are thus responsible for the fund’s underlying investment decisions. Underlying investments within these funds may include long and short public and private equities, corporate, mortgage and sovereign debt, options, swaps, forwards and other derivative positions. These funds have varying degrees of leverage, liquidity and redemption provisions. \n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n81\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n(5)\nThese investments are primarily valued based on the NAVs of the funds. These values represent the per-unit price at which new investors are permitted to invest and existing investors are permitted to exit. When NAVs as of the end of the year have not been received, we estimate fair value by adjusting the most recently reported NAVs for market events and cash flows between the interim date and the end of the year.\n(6)\nPrivate equity and related investments include both investments in private equity and investments in mezzanine, distressed, co-investments and other structures. Private equity funds generally participate in buyout and venture capital strategies through unlisted equity and debt instruments. These funds may also borrow at the underlying entity level. Mezzanine and distressed funds generally invest in the debt of public or private companies with additional participation through warrants or other equity options.\n(7)\nDerivative instruments include risk-mitigating futures and are valued based upon valuation statements received from each counterparty\n.\nRetirement Compensation Arrangements\nRetirement compensation arrangements fund a portion of our Canadian nonregistered pension plans. As required by Canadian tax rules, approximately 50 percent of these assets are invested into a non-interest bearing refundable tax account held by the Canada Revenue Agency. This portion of the portfolio does not earn returns. The remaining portion is invested in a portfolio of equities.\nManaging Risk\nInvestments and contracts are subject to risks including market price, interest rate, credit, currency and liquidity risks. We mitigate these risks to our pension plan asset portfolios through advisory agreements, investment in diversified portfolios, inclusion of fixed income investments that align with plan liabilities and investment in assets designed to address both currency and liquidity considerations. In addition, we and our investment advisers perform regular monitoring with ongoing qualitative assessments, quantitative assessments and investment and operational due diligence.\nValuation of Our Plan Assets\nPension assets are stated at fair value or NAV. Fair value is based on the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to settle a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the reporting date. We consider both observable and unobservable inputs that reflect assumptions applied by market participants when setting the exit price of an asset or liability in an orderly transaction within the principal market for that asset or liability.\nWe value the pension plan assets based upon the observability of exit pricing inputs and classify pension plan assets based upon the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the pension plan assets in their entirety. Refer to \nNote 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n for details on the fair value hierarchy. The availability of observable market data is monitored to assess the appropriate classification of financial instruments within the fair value hierarchy. Changes in economic conditions or model-based valuation techniques may require the transfer of financial instruments from one fair value level to another. We evaluate the significance of transfers between levels based upon the nature of the financial instrument and size of the transfer relative to total net assets available for benefits.\nInvestments for which fair value is measured using the NAV per share as a practical expedient are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.\n \n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM

we used the market approach, which is based on quoted market prices we received for the same types and issues of our debt. We believe that our variable-rate long term debt and line of credit instruments have net carrying values that approximate their fair value with only insignificant differences. The inputs to the valuations of our long-term debt are based on market data obtained from independent sources or information derived principally from observable market data. The difference between the fair value and the carrying value represents the theoretical net premium or discount we would pay or receive to retire all debt at the measurement date.\nFAIR VALUE OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nWe believe that our other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, mutual fund investments held in grantor trusts, receivables and payables, have net carrying values that approximate their fair values with only insignificant differences. This is primarily due to the short-term nature of these instruments and the allowance for doubtful accounts.\n\n\nNOTE 13: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThis note provides details about our:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlegal proceedings,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenvironmental matters and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncommitments and other contingencies.\n\n\n\n\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS\nWe are party to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n, \nConsolidated Statement of Operations\n or \nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nSite Remediation\nUnder the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) – commonly known as the “Superfund” – and similar state laws, we are a party to various proceedings related to the cleanup of hazardous waste sites and have been notified that we may be a potentially responsible party related to the cleanup of other hazardous waste sites for which proceedings have not yet been initiated.\nWe have received notification from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and have acknowledged that we are a potentially responsible party in a portion of the Kalamazoo River Superfund site in southwest Michigan. Our involvement in the remediation site is based on our operation of the Plainwell, Michigan mill, located within the remediation site, from 1954 to 1970. Several other companies also have been deemed potentially responsible parties as past or present owners or operators of facilities within the site, or as arrangers under CERCLA.\nWe cooperated with other parties to jointly implement an administrative order issued by the EPA on April 14, 2016, with respect to a portion of the site comprising a stretch of the river approximately 1.7 miles long referred to as the Otsego Township Dam Area. During third quarter 2018, implementation of this administrative order was completed.\nIn 2010, the company, along with others, was named as a defendant by Georgia-Pacific Consumer Products LP, Fort James Corporation and Georgia-Pacific LLC in an action seeking contribution under CERCLA for remediation costs relating to a certain area within the site. On March 29, 2018, the U.S. District Court issued an opinion and order assigning the company responsibility for \n5\n percent of approximately $\n50\n million in past costs incurred by the plaintiffs. The remaining \n95\n percent of this pool of past costs incurred was allocated to the plaintiffs and other defendants. The opinion and order does not establish allocation for future remediation costs, and accordingly, we may incur additional costs in connection with future remediation tasks for other areas of the site.\n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n88\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nIn 2022, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court opinion, finding that Georgia-Pacific’s claims for cost contributions were time barred by the statute of limitations. Georgia-Pacific filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court, which was denied during fourth quarter 2023 and redirected to the district court for further proceedings. As a result, the company was found not responsible for prior costs incurred by Georgia-Pacific. Appeals related to future costs remain ongoing.\nWe have established accruals for estimated remediation costs on the active Superfund sites and other sites for which we are a potentially responsible party. These accruals are recorded in \"Accrued liabilities\" and \"Other liabilities\" on our \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.\nChanges in the Accrual for Environmental Remediation\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccrual balance\n as of December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n75\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharges and adjustments, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPayments\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n5\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccrual balance\n as of December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n81\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nWe change our accrual to reflect:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnew information on any site concerning implementation of remediation alternatives,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nupdates on prior cost estimates and new sites and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncosts incurred to remediate sites.\n\n\n\n\n \nEstimates.\n \nWe believe it is reasonably possible, based on currently available information and analysis, that remediation costs for all identified sites may exceed our existing accruals by up to $\n212\n million. This estimate, in which those additional costs may be incurred over several years, is the upper end of the range of reasonably possible additional costs. The estimate:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nis much less certain than the estimates on which our accruals currently are based and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuses assumptions that are less favorable to us among the range of reasonably possible outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n \nIn estimating our current accruals and the possible range of additional future costs, we:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nassumed we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of every site,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntook into account the ability of other potentially responsible parties to participate and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconsidered each party’s financial condition and probable contribution on a per-site basis.\n\n\n\n\n \nWe have not recorded any amounts for potential recoveries from insurance carriers.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe have obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets consisting primarily of reforestation obligations related to forest management licenses in Canada and obligations to close and cap landfills. Some of our sites have asbestos containing materials. We have met our current legal obligation to identify and manage these materials. In situations where we cannot reasonably determine when asbestos containing materials might be removed from the sites, we have not recorded an accrual because the fair value of the obligation cannot be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an asset retirement obligation of \n$\n34\n million \nand $\n36\n million, respectively.\n \nThese obligations are recorded in \"Accrued liabilities\" and \"Other liabilities\" on our \nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.\n \nCOMMITMENTS AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\nProduct Remediation Contingency and Recovery\nIn July 2017, we announced we were implementing a solution to address concerns regarding our TJI\n®\n Joists coated with our former Flak Jacket\n®\n Protection product. This issue was isolated to Flak Jacket product manufactured after December 1, 2016 and did not affect any of our other products.\n \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we received a product remediation recovery of $\n25\n million related to our prior remediation efforts for Flak Jacket.

Generally, compensation expense would not be reversed if the market condition is not achieved, provided the requisite service period has been completed.\nWeighted Average Assumptions Used in Estimating the Value of PSUs\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n GRANTS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n GRANTS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n GRANTS\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance period\n\n\n \n\n\n2/09/2024\n - \n12/31/2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2/09/2023\n - \n12/31/2025\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2/10/2022\n - \n12/31/2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk-free rate\n\n\n \n\n\n4.19\n% - \n4.27\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.21\n% - \n4.66\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n0.34\n% - \n1.84\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVolatility\n\n\n \n\n\n21.50\n% - \n27.60\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29.26\n% - \n40.19\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n26.27\n% - \n41.01\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nValuation date closing stock price\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n33.28\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n33.96\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n42.16\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \nActivity\nThe following table shows our PSU activity for \n2024:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPERFORMANCE SHARE UNITS\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nWEIGHTED\nAVERAGE\nGRANT-DATE\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(IN THOUSANDS)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFAIR VALUE\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonvested at December 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n984\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n41.35\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted at target\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n412\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n37.90\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nVested\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n317\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n38.50\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nForfeited\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerformance adjustment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n38.50\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNonvested at December 31, 2024\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,082\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n40.86\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were approximately \n65\n thousand\n \nPSUs that had met the requisite service period and will be released as identified in the grant terms.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value for PSUs was:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n37.90\n for \n2024 grants,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n37.58\n for \n2023 grants and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n49.77\n for \n2022 grants.\n\n\n\n\nThe total grant-date fair value of PSUs vested was:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n12\n \nmillion in 2024,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n8\n million in \n2023 and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n$\n12\n million in \n2022.\n\n\n\n\nNonvested PSUs accrue dividends that are paid out when PSUs vest.

Our directors receive shares of common stock as payment for stock equivalent units, except that any directors who are subject to federal or provincial taxation in Canada have the choice to receive a cash amount equal to the fair market value of the company’s common stock on the date of payment. In addition, we credit all stock equivalent accounts with dividend equivalents. The number of common shares to be issued in the future to directors is \n490\n thousand as of December 31, 2024.\nStock equivalent units are liability-classified awards and remeasured to fair value at every reporting date.\nThe fair value of a stock equivalent unit is equal to the market price of our stock.\nActivity\nThe number of stock equivalent units outstanding in our deferred compensation accounts was:\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n506\n thousand\n as of December 31, 2024,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n530\n thousand as of December 31, \n2023 and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n595\n thousand as of December 31, \n2022.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nNOTE 16: LEASES\nThe majority of our operating leases are related to our office and warehouse space, and the majority of our financing leases are related to vehicles and forklifts. Our leases have remaining lease terms of approximately \n1\n year\n to \n25\n years\n. Options to renew, extend or terminate a lease are reflected in our lease terms when we believe it is reasonably certain we will exercise that option. When our leases do not provide an implicit or an explicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments.\nLease

Disclosure controls are controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Act), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n\n\nBased on their evaluation, the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed complies with the SEC’s rules and forms.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nCHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL\n\n\n \n\n\nNo changes occurred in the company's internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nMANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\n\n\n \n\n\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 rules. Management, under our supervision, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Based on our evaluation under the framework in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013), management concluded that the company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included herein.\n\n\n \n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n101\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\n\n \n\n\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nWeyerhaeuser Company:\n\n\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n \n\n\nWe have audited Weyerhaeuser Company and subsidiaries' (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in\n Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in\n Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n \n\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 14, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\n\n\nBasis for Opinion\n \n\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\n\n\nSeattle, Washington\n\n\nFebruary 14, 2025\n\n\nWEYERHAEUSER COMPANY > \n2024 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K\n \n102\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n\n\nOTHER INFORMATION\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nINSIDER TRADING ARRANGEMENTS\n\n\n \n\n\nDuring fourth quarter \n2024, one of the company's \"officers\" (as that term is defined in Rule 16a-1(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\")) adopted a trading plan intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) of the Exchange Act.\nDevin W.
