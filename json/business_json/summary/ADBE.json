The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited; however, we have director and officer insurance coverage that reduces our costs .\n In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. dollars and various other currencies, which subject us to exposure from movements in exchange rates . We may use foreign exchange forward contracts and option contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses . As of November 29, 2024, all contracts were set to expire at various dates through September 2026 .\n A 10% increase in the value of the U.S. Dollar and a corresponding decrease in the hedged foreign currency asset would increase the fair value of our financial hedging instruments by $434 million . As of November 29, 2024 and December 1, 2023, this long-term investment exposure totaled an absolute notional equivalent of $1.19 billion .\n We use foreign exchange purchased forward contracts or option contracts to hedge foreign currency revenue and expenses in Euros, Japanese Yen, British Pounds, Australian Dollars and Canadian Dollars . We hedge these cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts, carried at fair value, have maturities of up to 24 months .\n At November 29, 2024, we had debt securities classified as short-term investments of $273 million .

Fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 were                 52-week years . Revenue is derived from the sale of cloud-enabled software subscriptions, cloud-hosted offerings, term-based, royalty, and perpetual software licenses .\n Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage . Revenue for subscriptions sold as a fee per period is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service . When cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, the individual components are not considered distinct .\n Licenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) and royalty agreements . Licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options are recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met .\n Our transaction-based advertising offerings, where fees are based on a number of impressions per month and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the “as-invoiced” practical expedient . We have concluded that the on-premise/on-device software licenses and cloud services provided in our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud subscription offerings are not distinct from each other .\n Creative Cloud Libraries enable customers to access their work, settings, preferences and other assets seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices . Sensei, Adobe’s cloud-hosted artificial intelligence and machine learning framework, enables features such as automated photo-editing, photograph content-awareness, natural language processing, optical character recognition and automated document tagging .\n When expected period of benefit of an asset which would be capitalized is less than one year, we expense the amount as incurred, utilizing the practical expedient . When revenue arrangements include components of third-party goods and services, for example in transactions which involve resale, fulfillment or providing advertising impressions to our end customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a gross basis, or an agent .\n On a quarterly basis, the amount of revenue that is reserved is calculated based on historical trends and data specific to each reporting period . We offer rebates to our distributors, resellers and/or end-user customers . We also provide a specific reserve in excess of portfolio-level estimated requirements . Subscription contracts are generally non-cancellable, a limited number of customers have the right to cancel their contracts .\n For certain of our usage-based license agreements, typically in our royalty and OEM businesses, we estimate and accrue license revenue . Periods of time after the right of termination are accounted for as optional purchases when they do not represent material rights . Property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives .\n Operating leases are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets . Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are measured at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term . Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets are assigned to one or more reporting units on the date of acquisition . We review our goodwill for impairment annually during our second quarter of each fiscal year .\n In performing our goodwill impairment test, we first perform a qualitative assessment, which requires that we consider events or circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in management or key personnel . We then evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units to its carrying value, including the associated goodwill .\n We monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including our property and equipment, leases and intangible assets, may not be recoverable . We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes . Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes .\n Taxes collected from customers against those remitted to government authorities are not reported as revenue . Advertising expenses for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $1.04.04 billion, $.-970677 million and $-2.04 billion, respectively . Prepayments made for repurchases of our common stock are classified as treasury stock on our Consolidated Balance Sheets .\n In countries outside the United States, we transact business in U.S. dollars and in various other currencies . We may use foreign exchange forward contracts and option contracts to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency denominated revenue and expenses . Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative . Contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting are adjusted to fair value through earnings .\n Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk are short-term fixed-income investments, structured repurchase transactions, foreign currency and interest rate hedge contracts and trade receivables . When the forecasted transaction affects earnings, we reclassify the related gain or loss on the foreign currency revenue . Our cash and investments are held and primarily managed by recognized financial institutions that follow our investment policy .\n Certain contracts with advertising agencies contain sequential liability provisions, under which the agency is not required to pay until payment is received from the agency’s customers . The credit limit given to the customer is based on our risk assessment of their ability to pay, country risk and other factors and is not contingent on the resale of the product or on the collection of payments from their customers .\n In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures, which requires additional disclosure of certain costs and expenses . The updated standard is effective for us beginning with our fiscal year 2026 annual reporting period . We are currently evaluating the impact that the updated standard will have on our financial statement disclosures .\n Our business is organized into the following reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience, Publishing and Advertising . Our Digital Experience segment provides an integrated platform and set of products, services and solutions that enable businesses to create, manage, execute, measure, measure and monetize and optimize customer experiences that span from analytics to commerce .\n We generally categorize revenue by geographic area based on where the customer manages their utilization of our offerings . Revenue by major offerings in our Digital Media reportable segment for fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows: Revenue by major offering in our digital media reportable segment for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2024 .\n Included in trade receivables on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are unbilled receivable balances which have not yet been invoiced . Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to customers . Certain performance obligations may require payment before delivery of the license or service to the customer .\n Contract assets are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion of the Consolidated Balance Sheets . Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements . The deferred revenue balance is influenced by several factors, including the compounding effects of renewals, invoice duration and invoice duration .\n The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services . Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts. erally do not include a significant financing component. During the year ended November 29, 2024, approximately $5.87 billion of revenue was recognized .\n Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized . Remaining performance obligations were approximately $19.96 billion as of November 29, 2024 . Non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above comprised approximately  around approximately  4% of the total remaining performance  obligations .\n Amortization of capitalized costs are included in sales and marketing expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income . Capitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis, to be 5. ith compensation for incremental costs to acquire customer contracts . We did not incur any impairment losses for all periods presented .\n On December 17, 2023, we entered into a mutual termination agreement with Figma to terminate the proposed merger .

Short-term fixed income debt securities: Asset-backed securities; corporate debt securities; U.S. agency securities; Treasury securities; Corporate debt securities .\n We review our debt securities classified as short-term investments on a regular basis for impairment . During fiscal 2024 and 2023, we did not recognize an allowance for credit-related losses on any of our investments . The fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at November 29, 2024 was determined using the following inputs .\n The fair value of our financial assets and liabilities at December 1, 2023 was determined using the following inputs: Fair Value Measurements at Reporting Date Using Quoted Prices and Market Markets for identical Assets . See Note 4 for further information regarding the fair value in this section of the company’s financial statement .\n The fair value of our senior notes was $5.51 billion as of November 29, 2024, based on observable market prices in less active markets .

We therefore categorize all of our fixed income available-for-sale securities as Level 2 .\n We may use derivatives to partially offset our business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows and certain existing assets and liabilities . We enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty . We also enter into collateral security agreements with certain of our counterparties to exchange cash collateral when the net fair value of certain derivative instruments fluctuates .\n We incurred a loss related to the settlement of the instruments which is amortized to interest expense over the term of our debt due February 1, 2030 .
