(including its subsidiaries) (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended).\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision of and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the Company’s management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, the Company’s management has concluded that, as of June 30, 2025, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.” \n/s/  Stéphane de La Faverie\n/s/ Akhil Shrivastava\nStéphane de La Faverie\nAkhil Shrivastava\nPresident and Chief Executive Officer\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nAugust 20, 2025\nF-2\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the related consolidated statements of (loss) earnings, of comprehensive (loss) income, of equity and redeemable noncontrolling interest and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025 appearing on page S-1 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2025 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nF-3\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nInterim Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Assessment – TOM FORD Trademark\nAs described in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated indefinite-lived intangible assets balance was $3,123 million as of June 30, 2025, of which $1,805 million relates to the TOM FORD trademark. Management assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist. Management concluded that the changes in circumstances in the TOM FORD brand, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for an interim impairment review of the TOM FORD trademark. Accordingly, management performed an interim impairment test as of December 31, 2024. Management concluded that the carrying value of the TOM FORD trademark exceeded its estimated fair value and recorded an impairment charge of $773 million. As disclosed by management, the estimated fair value of the trademark intangible asset was determined utilizing an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. The significant assumptions used in this approach include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal value, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and a royalty rate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the interim indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment of the TOM FORD trademark is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the trademark; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, the royalty rate, and the weighted average cost of capital; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment, including controls over the valuation of the TOM FORD trademark. These procedures also included, among others (i) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the trademark; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the relief-from-royalty method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in the relief-from-royalty method; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates, the royalty rate, and the weighted average cost of capital. Evaluating management’s assumption related to revenue growth rates involved evaluating whether the assumption was reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the business; (ii) the consistency with external market and industry data; and (iii) whether the assumption was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating (i) the appropriateness of the relief-from-royalty method and (ii) the reasonableness of the royalty rate and weighted average cost of capital significant assumptions.\nAnnual Indefinite-Lived Intangible Asset Impairment Assessments – DECIEM Trademarks\nAs described in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s consolidated indefinite-lived intangible assets balance was $3,123 million as of June 30, 2025, and as disclosed by management, $1,069 million relates to the DECIEM trademarks. Management assesses indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist. Based on the annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2025, management determined that the estimated fair values of the DECIEM trademarks exceeded their carrying values. The estimated fair values of the trademark intangible assets were determined utilizing an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. The significant assumptions used in this approach include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates.\nF-4\nTable of Contents\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments of the DECIEM trademarks is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value estimate of the trademarks; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates, royalty rates, and the weighted average cost of capital; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 – \nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\nThe Estée Lauder Companies Inc. manufactures, markets and sells skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products around the world. Products are marketed under owned brand names, including: Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Lab Series, Origins, M·A·C, La Mer, Bobbi Brown Cosmetics\n,\n Aveda, Jo Malone London, Bumble and bumble, Darphin Paris, TOM FORD, Smashbox, Le Labo, Editions de Parfums Frédéric Malle, GLAMGLOW, KILIAN PARIS, Too Faced, Dr.Jart+, The Ordinary and NIOD. The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. is also the global licensee of the AERIN, BALMAIN and Dr. Andrew Weil brand names for beauty-related products.\nNOTE 2 – \nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Company”). All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nCertain amounts in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of prior years have been reclassified to conform to current-year presentation.\nManagement Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements. Certain significant accounting policies that contain subjective management estimates and assumptions include those related to revenue recognition, inventory, pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, business combinations and asset acquisitions, goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, income taxes and legal contingencies. Management evaluates the related estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, as relevant, and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates and assumptions. Significant changes, if any, in those estimates and assumptions will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\nCurrency Translation and Transactions\nAll assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates are translated at year-end rates of exchange, while revenue and expenses are translated at monthly average rates of exchange for the period. Unrealized translation gains (losses), net of tax, reported as translation adjustments through other comprehensive income (loss) (“OCI”) attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. were $\n90\n million, $(\n135\n) million and $(\n85\n) million, net of tax, in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. For the Company’s subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary economies, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, and these subsidiaries are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements or liquidity in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. Remeasurement adjustments in financial statements in a highly inflationary economy and other transactional gains and losses are reflected in earnings. \nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions for periods consistent with its identified exposures. The Company also uses cross-currency swap contracts to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. Additionally, the Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. See \nNote 13 – Derivative Financial Instruments\n for further discussion\n.\n The Company categorizes these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading.\nThe accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings include net exchange gains on foreign currency transactions of $\n58\n million, $\n77\n million and $\n57\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nF-11\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include $\n1,017\n million and $\n926\n million of short-term time deposits at June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nInvestments\nInvestments in the common stock of privately-held companies in which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but less than a controlling financial interest, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. For those equity securities without readily determinable fair values where the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, the Company records them at cost, less impairment, plus/minus subsequent observable price changes, and performs an assessment each quarter to determine whether or not a triggering event has occurred that results in changes in fair value. Collectively, these investments were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2025 and 2024 and are included in Other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable, net is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, including credit losses, and customer deductions. Payment terms are short-term in nature and are generally less than one year.\nThe Company is required to measure credit losses based on its estimate of expected losses rather than incurred losses, which generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. The Company evaluates certain criteria, including aging and historical write-offs, the current economic condition of specific customers and future economic conditions of countries utilizing a consumption index to determine the appropriate allowance for credit losses. The Company writes-off receivables once it is determined that the receivables are no longer collectible and as allowed by local laws.\n \nSee \nNote 15 – Revenue Recognition\n for additional information.\nInventory and Promotional Merchandise\nInventory and promotional merchandise only includes inventory considered saleable or usable in future periods, and is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being based on standard cost and production variances, which approximate actual cost on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include raw materials, componentry, direct labor and overhead (e.g., indirect labor, utilities, depreciation, purchasing, receiving, inspection and warehousing) as well as inbound freight. Manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal production capacity. Unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels are recognized as cost of sales in the period in which they are incurred. Promotional merchandise is charged to expense at the time the merchandise is shipped to the Company’s customers. Included in inventory and promotional merchandise is an inventory obsolescence reserve, which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its net realizable value. This reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age and historical results. In addition, and as necessary, specific reserves may be established for future known or anticipated events.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company’s derivative financial instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measured at fair value. All derivatives are (i) designated as a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment (“fair value” hedge), (ii) designated as a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability (“cash flow” hedge), (iii) designated as a hedge of a net investment in certain foreign operations (\"net investment\" hedge), or (iv) not designated as a hedging instrument. \nF-12\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor each derivative contract entered into, where the Company looks to obtain hedge accounting treatment, the Company formally and contemporaneously documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how the hedging instruments’ effectiveness in offsetting the hedged risk will be assessed prospectively and retrospectively. This process includes linking all derivatives to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, net investments in certain foreign operations, or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions. At inception, the Company evaluates the effectiveness of hedge relationships quantitatively, and has elected to perform, after initial evaluation, qualitative effectiveness assessments of certain hedge relationships to support an ongoing expectation of high effectiveness, if effectiveness testing is required. If based on the qualitative assessment, it is determined that a derivative has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company will perform a quantitative assessment to determine whether to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively.\nFor a fair value hedge, changes in the fair value of a derivative are recorded in current-period earnings, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk (including losses or gains on unrecognized firm commitments). For a cash flow hedge, changes in the fair value of a derivative of a forecasted transaction are recorded in OCI. Gains and losses deferred in OCI are then recognized in current-period earnings when earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged forecasted transaction (e.g., when periodic settlements on a variable-rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings). The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations, which are designated as net investment hedges. The net gain or loss on these contracts is recorded within translation adjustments, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss (\"AOCI\") on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, until the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the underlying assets of the Company’s investment. For derivative instruments, such as foreign currency forward contracts or option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value are reported in current-period earnings. \nAll derivative gains and losses relating to fair value hedges and cash flow hedges are recognized in the same income statement line as the hedged items. Cash flows from derivatives are classified within the consolidated statements of cash flows in the same category as the items being hedged. The cross-currency swap contracts designated as fair value hedges are classified within financing activities. The cross-currency swap contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified within investing activities. The foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges are classified within investing activities, except the portion related to the excluded component which is classified within operating activities. Cash flows, and their related gains and losses, from the remaining derivative instruments are classified within operating activities.\nFrom a consolidated balance sheet perspective, derivatives with fair values in a net asset position are bifurcated based on the cash flows expected to occur within the next twelve months (current asset or liability) and those expected to occur beyond twelve months (noncurrent asset or liability). Derivatives with fair values in a net liability position are classified in total as current, regardless of the maturity date.\nSee \nNote 13 – Derivative Financial Instruments\n for further discussion.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment, including leasehold and other improvements that extend an asset’s useful life or productive capabilities, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized during the application development stage and expensed as incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages. Costs incurred for website development are capitalized within each applicable development stage as required. Capital costs incurred while an asset is being built, including any applicable interest costs, are classified as construction in progress and are reclassified to its respective asset class when placed into service. For financial statement purposes, depreciation is provided principally on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from \n3\n to \n40\n years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lives of the respective leases or the expected useful lives of those improvements.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBusiness Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nThe Company evaluates whether a transaction meets the definition of a business. The Company first applies a screen test to determine if substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or group of similar identifiable assets. If the screen test is met, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition. If the screen test is not met, the Company further considers whether the set of assets or acquired entities have at a minimum, inputs and processes that have the ability to create outputs in the form of revenue. If the assets or acquired entities meet this criteria, the transaction is accounted for as a business combination. \nThe Company uses the acquisition method of accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, the Company's consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing date of the acquisition. The Company allocates the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. Any residual purchase price is recorded as goodwill. \nThe Company recognizes assets acquired in an asset acquisition based on the cost to the Company on a relative fair value basis, which includes transaction costs in addition to consideration transferred and liabilities assumed or issued as part of the transaction. Neither goodwill nor bargain purchase gains are recognized in an asset acquisition; any excess of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired, or the opposite, is allocated to qualifying assets based on their relative fair values. \nThe determination of fair value, as well as the expected useful lives of certain assets acquired, requires management to make judgments and may involve the use of significant estimates, including assumptions with respect to estimated future cash flows, discount rates and valuation multiples from comparable publicly traded companies, among other things.\n \nSee \nNote 5 – Asset Acquisition\n for further information.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the estimated fair value of their underlying net assets. Other indefinite-lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.\nThe Company assesses goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment as of the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if certain events or circumstances exist. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the Company’s operating segments. The Company identifies its reporting units by assessing whether the components of its operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and management of each operating segment regularly reviews the operating results of those components. The Company makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to determine carrying values for its reporting units. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The quantitative impairment test for goodwill encompasses calculating the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and comparing the estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded, up to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. When testing other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company also has the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the other indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative test. The quantitative impairment test for other indefinite-lived intangible assets encompasses calculating the estimated fair value of an other indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the estimated fair value to its carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded.\nSee \nNote 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n for further information.\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLong-Lived Assets\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets, primarily intangible assets subject to amortization, right-of-use assets and property, plant and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, a recoverability test is performed comparing projected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset or asset group to its carrying value. The asset group is defined as the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, then an impairment charge would be measured and recorded for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value. The calculated impairment loss for an asset group only reduces the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets of the group and is allocated on a pro rata basis using the relative carrying amounts of those assets, however, the allocated impairment loss cannot reduce the carrying amount of a long-lived asset below its estimated fair value.\nLeases\nThe Company recognizes a lease liability and a related right-of-use (“ROU”) asset at the commencement date for leases on its consolidated balance sheet, excluding short-term leases as noted below. The lease liability is equal to the present value of unpaid lease payments over the remaining lease term. The Company’s lease term at the commencement date may reflect options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such options will be exercised. To determine the present value of the lease liability, if the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable, the Company uses an incremental borrowing rate, which is defined as the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow (on a collateralized basis over a similar term) an amount equal to the lease payments in similar economic environments. The ROU asset is based on the corresponding lease liability adjusted for certain items such as initial direct costs, prepaid lease payments and lease incentives received. Both operating and finance lease ROU assets are reviewed for impairment, consistent with other long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. After an ROU asset is impaired, any remaining balance of the ROU asset is amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life.\nAfter the lease commencement date, the Company evaluates lease modifications, if any, that could result in a change in the accounting for leases. For a lease modification, an evaluation is performed to determine if it should be treated as either a separate lease or a change in the accounting of an existing lease. In addition, significant changes in events or circumstances within the Company’s control are assessed to determine whether a change in the accounting for leases is required.\nFor lease modifications that result in partial termination of the lease, the Company has elected the proportional method whereby the carrying amount of the ROU asset is decreased in proportion with the full or partial termination of the lease based on the adjustment to the carrying value of the lease liability. \nCertain of the Company’s leases provide for variable lease payments for the right to use an underlying asset that vary due to changes in facts and circumstances occurring after the commencement date, other than the passage of time. Variable lease payments that are dependent on an index or rate (e.g., Consumer Price Index) are included in the initial measurement of the lease liability, the initial measurement of the ROU asset, and the lease classification test based on the index or rate as of the commencement date. Any changes from the commencement date estimation of the index- and rate-based variable payments are expensed as incurred in the period of the change. Variable lease payments that are not known at the commencement date and are determinable based on the performance or use of the underlying asset\n,\n are not included in the initial measurement of the lease liability or the ROU asset, but instead are expensed as incurred. The Company’s variable lease payments primarily include rents based on a percentage of sales in excess of stipulated levels, common area maintenance and real estate taxes based on the percentage of the total square footage leased by the Company, as well as variable costs relating to embedded leases, such as third-party manufacturing and logistics agreements.\nCertain of the Company’s contracts contain lease components as well as non-lease components, such as an agreement to purchase services. For purposes of allocating contract consideration, the Company does not separate the lease components from non-lease components for all asset classes. \nShort-term leases (i.e. leases with a term of 12 months or less) are not recorded as ROU assets or lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets, and the related lease payments are recognized in earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFor certain leases relating to automobiles, information technology equipment and office equipment, the Company utilizes the portfolio approach. Under this approach, the Company combines and accounts for leases with similar characteristics (e.g., lease term, discount rates, etc.) as a single lease (as a portfolio), provided its application is not materially different when compared to the application at the individual lease level.\nSee \nNote \n7\n – Leases\n for further information.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company is a worldwide manufacturer, marketer and seller of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products. The Company’s sales subject to credit risk are made primarily to department stores, duty-free retailers, specialty multi retailers, online pure players, perfumeries and pharmacies, and salons and spas. The Company grants credit to qualified customers. While the Company does not believe it is exposed significantly to any undue concentration of credit risk at this time, it continues to monitor its customers' abilities, individually and collectively, to make timely payments.\nRevenue Recognition\nPerformance Obligations\nThe Company recognizes revenue at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product and other promised goods and services to a customer. \nThe Company sells wholesale to customers in distribution channels that include department stores, travel retail, specialty-multi retailers, perfumeries and pharmacies, salons/spas and through various online sites operated by authorized retailers, including pure-play sites. The primary performance obligation related to these channels of distribution is product sales where revenue is recognized as control of the product transfers to the customer. In the Americas region, revenue is generally recognized at the time the product is made available and provided to the customer’s carrier at the Company’s location, and in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa and Asia/Pacific regions, revenue is generally recognized based upon the customer’s receipt. The Company has certain arrangements with customers whereby it is responsible for shipping and handling through the named place of destination, which occurs after the customer has obtained control. As a result, the Company has made a policy election that permits the Company to account for shipping and handling activities that occur after the customer has obtained control of a good as a fulfillment cost rather than as an additional promised service. For these arrangements, the Company accrues all shipping and handling expenses related to the shipped products in the period that the revenue is recognized.\nThe Company also sells direct to consumers across freestanding stores, its brands' websites and through third-party online platforms. At Company-operated freestanding stores, revenue is recognized when control of the product is transferred at the point of sale. Revenue from online sales is recognized when control of the product is transferred, generally based upon the consumer’s receipt. \nIn connection with the sale of product, the Company may provide other promised goods and services that are deemed to be performance obligations. These are comprised of gift with purchase and purchase with purchase promotions, customer loyalty program obligations, gift cards and other promotional products including samples and testers. \nThe Company provides gift with purchase promotional products to certain customers generally without additional charge and also provides purchase with purchase promotional products to certain customers at a discount in relation to prices charged for saleable product. Revenue is allocated between saleable product, gift with purchase product and purchase with purchase product based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices. Revenue is deferred and ultimately recognized based on the timing differences, if any, between when control of these promotional products and control of the related saleable products transfer to the Company’s customer (e.g., a third-party retailer), which is calculated based on the weighted-average number of days between promotional periods. The estimated standalone selling price allocated to these promotional products is based on a cost plus margin approach. \nF-16\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company offers a number of different loyalty programs to its customers across brands, regions and distribution channels including points-based programs, tier-based programs and other programs. Revenue is allocated between the saleable product revenue and the material right loyalty obligations based on relative standalone selling prices when the consumer purchases the products that are earning them the right to the future benefits. Deferred revenue related to the Company’s loyalty programs is estimated based on the standalone selling price and is adjusted for an estimated breakage factor. Standalone selling price is determined primarily using the observable market price of the good or service benefit if it is sold by the Company or a cost plus margin approach for goods/services not directly sold by the Company. Breakage rates consider historical patterns of redemption and/or expiration. Revenue is recognized when the benefits are redeemed or expire. \nThe Company also offers gift cards through Company-operated freestanding stores and Company-owned websites. The related deferred revenue is estimated based on expected breakage that considers historical patterns of redemption taking into consideration escheatment laws as applicable. \nIn situations where promotional products are provided by the Company to its customers at the same time as the related saleable product, such as shipments of samples and testers, the cost of these promotional products are recognized as a cost of sales at the same time as the related revenue is recognized and no deferral of revenue is required.\n \nProduct Returns, Sales Incentives and Other Forms of Variable Consideration \nIn measuring revenue and determining the consideration the Company is entitled to as part of a contract with a customer, the Company takes into account the related elements of variable consideration. Such elements of variable consideration include product returns and sales incentives, such as volume rebates and discounts, markdowns, margin adjustments and early-payment discounts. The Company also enters into arrangements containing other forms of variable consideration and makes payments to certain of its customers related to demonstration, advertising and counter construction. These activities may be arranged either with unrelated third parties or in conjunction with the customer. To the extent the Company receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration and the fair value of the benefit can be reasonably estimated, the Company’s share of the demonstration and advertising costs of these transactions (regardless of to whom they were paid) are reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings, and for counter construction, the costs are capitalized into property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful lives into Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. When the Company does not receive a distinct good or service or for which the Company cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the good or service in these types of arrangements, the adjustments to revenue are recorded at the later of when (i) the Company recognizes revenue for the transfer of the related goods or services to the customer, or (ii) the Company pays, or promises to pay, the consideration.\nFor the sale of goods with a right of return, the Company only recognizes revenue for the consideration it expects to be entitled to (considering the products to be returned) and records a sales return accrual within Other accrued liabilities for the amount it expects to credit back its customers. In addition, the Company recognizes an asset included in Inventory and promotional merchandise and a corresponding adjustment to Cost of sales for the right to recover goods from customers associated with the estimated returns. \nThe sales return accrual and corresponding asset include estimates that directly impact reported net sales. These estimates are calculated based on a history of actual returns, estimated future returns and information provided by retailers regarding their inventory levels. Consideration of these factors results in an estimate for anticipated sales returns that reflects increases or decreases related to seasonal fluctuations. In addition, as necessary, sales return accruals and the related assets may be established for significant future known or anticipated events. The types of known or anticipated events that are considered, and will continue to be considered, include the financial condition of the Company’s customers, store closings by retailers, changes in the retail environment and the Company’s decision to continue to support new and existing products. \nThe Company estimates sales incentives and other variable consideration using the most likely amount method and records accruals within Other accrued liabilities when control of the related product is transferred to the customer. Under this method, certain forms of variable consideration are based on expected sell-through results, which requires subjective estimates. These estimates are supported by historical results as well as specific facts and circumstances related to the current period.\nSee \nNote 15 – Revenue Recognition \nfor further discussion and revenue disaggregated by geographic region\n.\n For revenue disaggregated by product category see \nNote 24 – Segment Data and Related Information\n.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRoyalty Revenue - License Arrangements\nAs a result of the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand, the Company entered into license arrangements with the Marcolin Group (“Marcolin”) and Ermenegildo Zegna N.V. (“Zegna”). As part of these arrangements, the Company licensed the TOM FORD trademark for eyewear (“Eyewear”) to Marcolin and for fashionwear (“Fashion”) to Zegna. Licensing the TOM FORD trademark to customers represents a revenue-generating activity in the ordinary course of business for the Company. \nThe Company’s performance obligation is to license the TOM FORD trademark to Marcolin and to Zegna, which grants them the right to access the symbolic intellectual property. The licensing arrangements stipulate that licensees must pay a sales-based royalty, with a guaranteed minimum, to the Company. The Company satisfies its performance obligation over the license period as it fulfills its promise to grant the licensees rights to use and benefit from the intellectual property, as well as maintain the intellectual property. As such, revenue for both the Marcolin and Zegna arrangements is recognized over time. Royalty payments are collected on a quarterly basis. The Company expects the guaranteed minimum royalty amounts to be exceeded and, as a result, sales-based royalties will be recognized in the period in which the sales occur. The upfront payment received from Marcolin is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the license. \nSee \nNote 5 – Asset Acquisition \nand \nNote 15 - Revenue Recognition\n for further information regarding the acquisition of the TOM FORD brand and related revenue recognition impacts.\nAdvertising and Promotion\nGlobal net advertising, marketing, promotion and product development expenses of $\n3,643\n million, $\n3,657\n million and $\n3,711\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings and are expensed as incurred. The cost of certain promotional products, including samples and testers, are classified within Cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings.\n \nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs of $\n316\n million, $\n360\n million and $\n344\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings and are expensed as incurred.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling expenses of $\n729\n million, $\n792\n million and $\n838\n million in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings and include distribution center costs, promotional shipping costs, third-party logistics costs and outbound freight.\nRoyalty Fees - License Arrangements\nThe Company’s license agreements where it is the licensee provide the Company with worldwide rights to manufacture, market and sell beauty and beauty-related products (or particular categories thereof) using the licensors’ trademarks. The Company's current license arrangements have an initial term of approximately \n3\n years to \n10\n years, and are renewable subject to the Company’s compliance with the license agreement provisions. As of June 30, 2025, the remaining terms considering available renewal periods range from \n1\n year to approximately \n25\n years. Under each license, the Company is required to pay royalties to the licensor, at least annually, based on net sales to third parties.\nCertain license agreements may require minimum royalty payments, incremental royalties based on net sales levels and minimum spending on advertising and promotional activities. Royalty expenses are accrued in the period in which net sales are recognized while advertising and promotional expenses are accrued at the time these costs are incurred.\nF-18\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company records stock-based compensation, measured at the fair value of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest, as an expense in the consolidated financial statements, net of estimated forfeitures. All excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to stock-based compensation awards are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company calculates and provides for income taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which it operates. As the application of various tax laws relevant to the Company’s global business is often uncertain, significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s annual tax expense and in evaluating the Company’s tax positions. The provision for income taxes includes the amounts payable or refundable for the current year, the effect of deferred taxes and impacts from uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, net operating losses, tax credit and other carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates when the assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The Company regularly reviews deferred tax assets for realizability and establishes valuation allowances based on available evidence including historical operating losses, projected future taxable income, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and appropriate tax planning strategies. If the Company’s assessment of the realizability of a deferred tax asset changes, an increase to a valuation allowance will result in a reduction of net earnings at that time, while the reduction of a valuation allowance will result in an increase of net earnings at that time. \nThe Company provides tax reserves for U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax exposures relating to periods subject to audit. The development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. The Company assesses its tax positions and records tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management’s evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting dates. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will be sustained, the Company has recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those tax positions where it is more-likely-than-not that a tax benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company classifies applicable interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. Although the outcome relating to these exposures is uncertain, in management’s opinion adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for estimable potential liabilities emanating from these exposures. If actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated net earnings.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nOn May 18, 2021, the Company acquired additional shares in \nDECIEM\n, a Toronto-based skin care company. The Company originally acquired a minority interest in DECIEM in June 2017. The acquisition of additional shares increased the Company's equity interest and was considered a step acquisition. As part of the increase in the Company's investment, the Company was granted the right to purchase (“Call Option”), and granted the remaining investors a right to sell to the Company (“Put Option”), the remaining interests after a \nthree-yea\nr\n period, with a purchase price based on the future performance of DECIEM (the “net Put (Call) Option”).\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs a result of this redemption feature, the Company recorded redeemable noncontrolling interest, at its acquisition‑date fair value, that was classified as mezzanine equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Noncontrolling interest is adjusted each reporting period for income attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Each reporting period, an adjustment, if any, is then recorded to adjust the noncontrolling interest to the higher of either the redemption value, assuming it was redeemable at the reporting date, or its carrying value. If and when applicable, these adjustments are recorded in Paid-in capital and are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. In addition, based on the Company's policy election, if the redemption value exceeds the fair value of the noncontrolling interest on a cumulative basis, an adjustment is recorded in Retained earnings and the Company will adjust Net earnings attributable to The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. as required by the two-class method when calculating net earnings per common share. Prior to May 31, 2024, the fair value of the noncontrolling interest per share was calculated by incorporating significant assumptions including the starting equity value, revenue growth rates and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and the following key assumptions into the Monte Carlo method: risk-free rate, term to mid of last twelve-month period, operating leverage adjustment, net sales discount rate, EBITDA discount rate, EBITDA volatility and net sales volatility. The Company was not required to record any adjustments, as described above.\nOn May 31, 2024, the Company purchased the remaining interest of approximately \n24\n% on a fully diluted basis in DECIEM at a contractually calculated amount pursuant to the terms of the net Put (Call) Option, which resulted in the settlement of the redeemable noncontrolling interest and DECIEM stock options for $\n743\n million and $\n114\n million, respectively. Transaction costs associated with the purchase were $\n2\n million and were recorded as an adjustment to Paid-in capital. As this purchase did not result in a change in control of DECIEM, the change in ownership interest was accounted for as an equity transaction. Differences between the balance of the redeemable noncontrolling interest at the date of redemption of the remaining interests and the consideration paid were recognized in Paid-in capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. As such, any adjustments in the consideration paid will be recognized in Paid-in capital. Payments for the acquisition of redeemable noncontrolling interest, inclusive of transaction costs, are classified as financing activities and payments to settle the DECIEM stock option liability are classified within operating activities within the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. As of June 30, 2025, the consideration paid to acquire the remaining interest is subject to the final calculation of the purchase price pursuant to the contract. These adjustments are not expected to be material.\nSee \nNote 19 – Stock Programs\n for additional information relating to the DECIEM stock options.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nFASB ASU No. 2022-04 – Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which is intended to enhance the transparency surrounding the use of supplier finance programs. The guidance requires companies that use supplier finance programs to make annual disclosures about the program’s key terms, the balance sheet presentation of related amounts, the confirmed amount outstanding at the end of the period and associated rollforward information. Only the amount outstanding at the end of the period must be disclosed in interim periods. The guidance does not affect the recognition, measurement or financial statement presentation of supplier finance program obligations.\nEffective for the Company\n – The guidance became effective for the Company’s first quarter fiscal 2024 and has been applied on a retrospective basis, except for the requirement to disclose rollforward information annually which \nbecame effective for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 Form 10-K and has been applied on a prospective basis\n.\nImpact on consolidated financial statements\n – The Company has supplier financing arrangements and applied the disclosure requirements as required by the amendments. Such information is included wit\nhin \nNote 10 – Supplier Finance Programs\n.\nF-20\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFASB ASU No. 2023-07 – Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements. Companies are required to disclose significant segment expenses by reportable segment if they are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM). Companies are also required to disclose other segment items by reportable segment. The guidance clarifies that companies may disclose more than one measure of segment profit or loss used by the CODM, provided that at least one of the reported measures includes the segment profit or loss measure that is most consistent with U.S. GAAP measurement principles. All existing annual disclosures about segment profit or loss, as well as the new requirements, must now be provided on an interim basis. Additionally, on an annual basis, the CODM’s title and position is required, as well as an explanation of how the CODM uses the reported measure(s) and other disclosures. The guidance does not change how companies identify their operating segments, aggregates those operating segments, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments.\nEffective for the Company\n – The guidance became effective for the Company’s fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 Form 10-K and has been applied on a retrospective basis and will be applied in interim periods beginning in the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2026.\nImpact on consolidated financial statement\ns\n – The Company applied the disclosure requirements as required by the amendments. See \nNote 24 – Segment Data and Related Information \nfor further discussion.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFASB ASU No. 2025-05: Measurement of Credit Losses for Accounts Receivable and Contract Assets (Topic 326)\nIn July 2025, the FASB issued guidance related to the estimation of expected credit losses for current accounts receivable and current contract assets. The amendment allows entities to elect a practical expedient to assume that current conditions as of the balance sheet date do not change for the remaining life of the asset in the development of a reasonable and supportable forecast as part of estimating expected credit losses. Entities electing the practical expedient are still required to adjust historical loss information to reflect current conditions to the extent that historical loss information does not reflect current conditions. An entity that elects to use the practical expedient is required to disclose that fact.\nEffective for the Company\n: The guidance becomes effective for the Company’s first quarter of fiscal 2027 and is applied prospectively.

The TOM FORD brand is a luxury brand created in 2005, and this acquisition is expected to further strengthen the Company’s TOM FORD BEAUTY brand, which the Company has historically licensed, while simultaneously enabling the Company to create new licensing revenue streams. At the same time as the Company's transaction, an affiliate of Zegna separately purchased the interests in the TOM FORD fashion business that Zegna and its affiliates did not own (including the purchase of interests from the sellers of 001).\nThe TOM FORD Acquisition has been accounted for as an asset acquisition as the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in the value of the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset. The acquisition of 001 included existing license relationships for certain uses of the brand name, which were modified, terminated or otherwise renegotiated in connection with the transaction, and are discussed separately in \nNote 15 – Revenue Recognition\n. \nThe total cost of the asset acquisition is $\n2,578\n million, inclusive of approximately $\n28\n million of transaction related costs and $\n300\n million of deferred consideration payable to the sellers of which $\n150\n million was paid in July 2025, and is reflected in Other accrued liabilities as of June 30, 2025, and the remaining $\n150\n million is due in July 2026 and reflected in Other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2025.\nThe total cost of the asset acquisition was allocated to the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset.

The trademark acquired in connection with the TOM FORD Acquisition is classified as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the trademark was determined using an income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that, in lieu of ownership, a third party would be willing to pay a royalty in order to obtain the rights to use the comparable asset. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value were revenue growth rates, terminal value, beauty royalty savings, the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates. The most significant unobservable input was the weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows.\nOther intangible assets consist of the following:\nJune 30, 2025\nJune 30, 2024\n(In millions)\nGross\nCarrying\nValue\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nTotal Net\nBook Value\nGross\nCarrying\nValue\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nTotal Net\nBook Value\nAmortizable intangible assets:\n \n \n \n \n \n \nCustomer lists and other\n$\n1,984\n \n$\n1,348\n \n$\n636\n \n$\n1,971\n \n$\n895\n \n$\n1,076\n \nNon-amortizable intangible assets:\nTrademarks\n3,123\n \n4,107\n \nTotal other intangible assets, net\n$\n3,759\n \n$\n5,183\n \nThe aggregate amortization expense related to amortizable intangible assets for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $\n131\n million, $\n144\n million and $\n145\n million, respectively. \nThe estimated aggregate amortization expense for each of the next five fiscal years is as follows:\n \nFiscal\n(In millions)\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030\nEstimated aggregate amortization expense\n$\n107\n \n$\n90\n \n$\n73\n \n$\n71\n \n$\n69\n \nFiscal 2025 Impairment Analysis\nFor further information on the Company's policies relating to its impairment assessment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets, see \nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\n and \nLong-Lived Assets \nwithin \nNote 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nDuring the fiscal 2025 second quarter, the TOM FORD brand experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels, including in mainland China, Asia travel retail and Hong Kong SAR. Also during the fiscal 2025 second quarter, the Too Faced reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels. As a result, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its TOM FORD brand and Too Faced reporting unit. Additionally, there were increases in the weighted average cost of capital for both the TOM FORD brand and Too Faced reporting unit as compared to the prior-year annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2024. \nF-25\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the TOM FORD brand and Too Faced reporting unit, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of the TOM FORD trademark and the Too Faced trademark and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of Too Faced’s long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed interim impairment tests for the TOM FORD and Too Faced trademarks and Too Faced goodwill as well as a recoverability test for the Too Faced long-lived assets as of December 31, 2024. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method, and recorded an impairment charge of $\n773\n million for TOM FORD and $\n75\n million for Too Faced. The Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets for Too Faced were recoverable. Additionally, as a result of the interim impairment review, the remaining carrying value of Too Faced’s goodwill was not recoverable and the Company recorded an impairment charge of $\n13\n million, reducing the carrying value to \nzero\n. The significant assumptions used in the relief-from-royalty method include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair value of the TOM FORD and Too Faced trademark intangible assets was the weighted average cost of capital, which was \n11.5\n% and \n14\n%, respectively.\nBased on the Company’s annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2025, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademarks exceeded their estimated fair values. As it relates to Dr.Jart+, a decision was made in the prior year in the reporting unit’s operating plan to exit the travel retail channel. A revised strategy was implemented that included increased direct investment in other areas of the business, including in mainland China, to support the brand’s future growth. However, given the lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions in fiscal 2025, specifically within mainland China and Korea, it was determined that revisions to the internal forecasts were necessary which were finalized and approved in the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter in connection with the brand’s annual planning process, and reflected in the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2025. The Too Faced reporting unit continued to experience lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels and as such, it was determined that revisions to the internal forecasts were necessary. These changes in circumstances were also indicators that the carrying amounts of their respective long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable.\nFor purposes of calculating the estimated fair values of the trademark intangible assets, the Company utilized the relief-from-royalty method and recorded an impairment charge of $\n83\n million for Dr.Jart+ and $\n50\n million for Too Faced. The Company then performed a recoverability analysis of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced long-lived asset groups and, based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset groups, concluded that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets for Dr.Jart+ were not recoverable, whereas for Too Faced were recoverable. For purposes of calculating the impairment charge for the long-lived assets of Dr.Jart+, the asset group was determined to be the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of the asset group was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the asset group. As a result, the calculated impairment charge to be allocated to the long-lived assets of Dr.Jart+ was $\n292\n million. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ customer list intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value, which was determined utilizing the multi-period excess earnings income approach by discounting the incremental after-tax cash flows over multiple periods. The estimated fair value of all other long-lived assets of Dr. Jart+ exceeded their carrying values. As a result, the $\n292\n million impairment charge was allocated entirely to the Dr.Jart+ customer list intangible asset. \nThe significant assumptions used in the calculations of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademark and Dr.Jart+ customer list impairments include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates for trademarks. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the impairments was the weighted average cost of capital, which was \n10.5\n% for Dr.Jart+ for both the trademark and customer list impairments, and \n13.5\n% for Too Faced.\nF-26\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA summary of the impairment charges for the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2025 and the remaining trademark, customer list and goodwill carrying values as of June 30, 2025, for the TOM FORD brand and the Too Faced and Dr.Jart+ reporting units, are as follows:\nImpairment Charges\n(1)\nCarrying Value\n(In millions)\nThree Months Ended\nJune 30, 2025\nTwelve Months Ended\nJune 30, 2025\nAs of June 30, 2025\nBrand/Reporting Unit\nGeographic Region\nTrademark\nCustomer List\nGoodwill\nTrademark\nCustomer List\nGoodwill\nTrademark\n(2)\nCustomer List\nGoodwill\nTOM FORD\nThe Americas\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n773\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,805\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nToo Faced\nThe Americas\n50\n \n—\n \n—\n \n125\n \n—\n \n13\n \n62\n \n50\n \n—\n \nDr.Jart+\n(3)\nAsia/Pacific\n83\n \n292\n \n—\n \n83\n \n292\n \n—\n \n42\n \n189\n \n—\n \nTotal\n$\n133\n \n$\n292\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n981\n \n$\n292\n \n$\n13\n \n$\n1,909\n \n$\n239\n \n$\n—\n \n(1)\nThe date of the fair value measurement for the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset was December 31, 2024.

The date of the fair value measurement for the Dr. Jart+ trademark intangible asset and asset group was April 1, 2025.\n(2)\nThe carrying values of the trademark intangible assets, immediately subsequent to the impairment charges, are equal to their estimated fair values.\n(3)\nThe carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ asset group, immediately subsequent to the customer list impairment charge, was equal to its estimated fair value.\nThe impairment charge related to the TOM FORD trademark intangible asset of $\n773\n million was reflected in the fragrance, makeup and other product categories of $\n549\n million, $\n170\n million and $\n54\n million, respectively. The trademark and goodwill impairment charges related to Too Faced were reflected in the makeup product category. The trademark and customer list impairment charges related to Dr.Jart+ were reflected in the skin care product category. The aggregate trademark and customer list impairments are recorded in the Impairment of other intangible assets line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings.\nFiscal 2024 Impairment Analysis\nBased on the Company’s annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2024, the Company determined that the carrying value of the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit and trademark exceeded their estimated fair values. Given the lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions, the reporting unit has made a strategic shift in its operating plan to exit the travel retail channel. This revised strategy also includes increased direct investment in other areas of the business, including in mainland China, to support the brand’s future growth. As a result of these changes in strategy, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit which were finalized and approved in the fiscal 2024 fourth quarter, and reflected in the goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2024. These changes in circumstances were also indicators that the carrying amounts of its respective long-lived assets may not be recoverable. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible asset exceeded its estimated fair value, which was determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $\n180\n million. The Company then performed a recoverability analysis of the Dr.Jart+ long-lived asset group and, based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows of the asset group, concluded that the carrying amount of the long-lived assets were recoverable. After adjusting the carrying value of the trademark, the Company completed a quantitative impairment test for goodwill. As the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n291\n million. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit was based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting unit. The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal value, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, comparable market multiples for the reporting unit, and royalty rate for the trademark. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and trademark intangible asset was the weighted average cost of capital, which was \n10.5\n%.\nF-27\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA summary of the impairment charges for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024 and the remaining trademark and goodwill carrying values as of June 30, 2024 are as follows:\nImpairment Charges\n(1)\nCarrying Value\n(In millions)\nTwelve Months Ended\nJune 30, 2024\nAs of June 30, 2024\nReporting Unit\nGeographic Region\nTrademark\nGoodwill\nTrademark\n(2)\nGoodwill\nDr.Jart+\nAsia/Pacific\n$\n180\n \n$\n291\n \n$\n129\n \n$\n—\n \n(1)\n    The date of the fair value measurement for the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit and trademark intangible asset was April 1, 2024.\n(2) \n   The carrying value of the trademark intangible asset, immediately subsequent to the impairment charge, is equal to its estimated fair value.\nThe impairment charges for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024 were reflected in the skin care product category.\nFiscal 2023 Impairment Analysis\nDuring the fiscal 2023 second quarter, given the lower-than-expected results in the overall business, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Smashbox reporting unit. The Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting unit triggered the need for an interim impairment review of its trademark intangible asset. The remaining carrying value of the trademark intangible asset was not recoverable and the Company recorded an impairment charge of $\n21\n million reducing the carrying value to \nzero\n. \nDuring the fiscal 2023 second quarter, the Dr.Jart+ reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions and channels that continue to be impacted by the spread of COVID-19 variants, resurgence in cases, and the potential future impacts relating to the uncertainty of the duration and severity of COVID-19 impacting the financial performance of the reporting unit. In addition, due to macro-economic factors, Dr.Jart+ has experienced lower-than-expected growth within key geographic regions. The Too Faced reporting unit experienced lower-than-expected results in key geographic regions and channels coupled with delays in future international expansion to areas that continue to be impacted by COVID-19. As a result, the Company made revisions to the internal forecasts relating to its Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units. Additionally, there were increases in the weighted average cost of capital for both reporting units as compared to the prior year annual goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing as of April 1, 2022. \nThe Company concluded that the changes in circumstances in the reporting units, along with increases in the weighted average cost of capital, triggered the need for interim impairment reviews of their trademarks and goodwill. These changes in circumstances were also an indicator that the carrying amounts of Dr.Jart+’s and Too Faced’s long-lived assets, including customer lists, may not be recoverable. Accordingly, the Company performed interim impairment tests for the trademarks and a recoverability test for the long-lived assets as of November 30, 2022. The Company concluded that the carrying value of the trademark intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair values, which were determined utilizing the relief-from-royalty method to determine discounted projected future cash flows and recorded an impairment charge of $\n100\n million for Dr.Jart+ and $\n86\n million for Too Faced. The Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the long-lived assets were recoverable. After adjusting the carrying values of the trademarks, the Company completed interim quantitative impairment tests for goodwill. As the estimated fair value of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced reporting units were in excess of their carrying values, the Company concluded that the carrying amounts of the goodwill were recoverable and did not record a goodwill impairment charge related to these reporting units. The estimated fair values of these reporting units were based upon an equal weighting of the income and market approaches, utilizing estimated cash flows and a terminal value, discounted at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows, as well as valuation multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies that are applied to operating performance of the reporting units. The significant assumptions used in these approaches include revenue growth rates and profit margins, terminal values, weighted average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows and royalty rates for trademarks. The most significant unobservable input used to estimate the fair values of the Dr.Jart+ and Too Faced trademark intangible assets was the weighted average cost of capital, which was \n11\n% and \n13\n%, respectively.\nF-28\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA summary of the impairment charges for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 and the remaining trademark and goodwill carrying values as of June 30, 2023, for each reporting unit, are as follows:\nImpairment Charges\n(1)\nCarrying Value\n(In millions)\nTwelve Months Ended\nJune 30, 2023\nAs of June 30, 2023\nReporting Unit\nGeographic Region\nTrademarks\nGoodwill\nTrademarks\n(2)\nGoodwill\nSmashbox\nThe Americas\n$\n21\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \nDr.Jart+\nAsia/Pacific\n100\n \n—\n \n325\n \n304\n \nToo Faced\nThe Americas\n86\n \n—\n \n186\n \n13\n \nTotal\n$\n207\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n511\n \n$\n317\n \n(1) \n    The date of the fair value measurement for the Smashbox, Dr.Jart+, and Too Faced trademark intangible assets was December 31, 2022, November 30, 2022, and November 30, 2022, respectively.\n(2) \n    The carrying values of the trademark intangible assets, immediately subsequent to the impairment charges, are equal to their estimated fair values.\nThe impairment charges for the twelve months ended June 30, 2023 were reflected in the skin care product category for Dr.Jart+ and the makeup product category for Smashbox and Too Faced.\nNOTE 7 – \nLEASES\nThe Company has operating and finance leases primarily for real estate properties, including corporate offices, facilities to support the Company’s manufacturing, assembly, research and development and distribution operations and retail stores, as well as information technology equipment, automobiles and office equipment, with remaining terms of approximately \n1\n year to \n55\n years.

The plan is designed to improve gross margin, lower the cost base and reduce overhead expenses, while increasing investments in key consumer-facing activities. Upon completion of this plan, the Company expects to have improved its gross margin and expense base to drive greater operating leverage for the future.\nAs a component of the PRGP, on February 5, 2024, the Company announced a \ntwo-year\n restructuring program. The restructuring program’s main focus included the reorganization and rightsizing of certain areas of the Company as well as simplification and acceleration of processes. The Company committed to this course of action on February 1, 2024. \nIn connection with the restructuring program, the Company estimated a net reduction in the range of approximately \n1,800\n to \n3,000\n positions globally, which was about \n3\n-\n5\n% of its positions including temporary and part-time employees as of June 30, 2023. This reduction took into account the elimination of some positions as well as retraining and redeployment of certain employees in select areas. \nThe Company planned to substantially complete specific initiatives under the restructuring program through fiscal 2026. The Company expected that the restructuring program would result in restructuring and other charges totaling between $\n500\n million and $\n700\n million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset-related costs, contract terminations and other costs associated with implementing these initiatives.\nAfter reviewing additional potential initiatives and the progress of previously approved initiatives, on February 3, 2025, the Company committed to the expansion of the PRGP, including an expansion of the restructuring program. \nThe expansion of the overall PRGP is focused on three key areas. First, the Company plans to adopt a more competitive approach to procurement, a key pillar of savings, by further consolidating spending and strategically re-evaluating key supplier relationships. Second, the Company plans to further improve efficiencies within its supply chain network through a zero-waste approach, aiming to improve demand forecasting and innovation planning to minimize excess inventory and product destruction. Third, the Company is outsourcing select services to proven global partners. \nThe expanded component of the restructuring program began during the Company’s fiscal 2025 third quarter with all initiatives to be approved by the end of fiscal 2026. Specific initiatives under the expanded component of the restructuring program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2027. The focus of the now expanded restructuring program (now, collectively the “Restructuring Program”) includes (i) reorganization and rightsizing of certain areas and (ii) simplification and acceleration of processes, along with the newly added focus on (i) outsourcing of select services and (ii) evolution of go-to-market footprint and selling models.\nF-31\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn connection with the Restructuring Program, as of June 30, 2025 the Company estimates a net reduction in the range of approximately \n5,800\n to \n7,000\n positions globally, which is about \n9\n-\n11\n% of its positions including temporary and part-time employees as of June 30, 2023. This net reduction takes into account the elimination of positions after retraining and redeployment of certain employees in select areas. \nThe Company expects that the Restructuring Program will result in restructuring and other charges totaling between $\n1,200\n million and $\n1,600\n million, before taxes, consisting of employee-related costs, asset-related costs, contract terminations and other costs associated with implementing these initiatives, which other than the non-cash charges, are expected to result in future cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations.  \nRestructuring Program Component of the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan Approvals \nCumulative charges for initiatives approved by the Company in connection with the Restructuring Program as of June 30, 2025 and through August 13, 2025 were:\nSales\nReturns\n(included in\nNet Sales)\nCost of Sales\nOperating Expenses\nTotal\n(In millions)\nRestructuring\nCharges\nOther\nCharges\nTotal Charges Approved\nFiscal 2024\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n109\n \n$\n78\n \n$\n187\n \nFiscal 2025\n4\n \n10\n \n443\n \n36\n \n493\n \nCumulative charges approved through June 30, 2025\n4\n \n10\n \n552\n \n114\n \n680\n \nJuly 1, 2025 - August 13, 2025\n—\n \n—\n \n31\n \n36\n \n67\n \nCumulative charges approved through August 13, 2025\n$\n4\n \n$\n10\n \n$\n583\n \n$\n150\n \n$\n747\n \nIncluded in the above table, cumulative restructuring charges for initiatives approved by the Company in connection with the Restructuring Program as of June 30, 2025 and through August 13, 2025 were:\n(In millions)\nEmployee-\nRelated\nCosts\nAsset-\nRelated\nCosts\nContract\nTerminations\nOther Exit\nCosts\nTotal\nRestructuring Charges Approved\nFiscal 2024\n$\n93\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n9\n \n$\n109\n \nFiscal 2025\n419\n \n7\n \n3\n \n14\n \n443\n \nCumulative charges approved through June 30, 2025\n512\n \n14\n \n3\n \n23\n \n552\n \nJuly 1, 2025 - August 13, 2025\n27\n \n4\n \n—\n \n—\n \n31\n \nCumulative charges approved through August 13, 2025\n$\n539\n \n$\n18\n \n$\n3\n \n$\n23\n \n$\n583\n \nSpecific actions taken since the Restructuring Program inception to drive future sales growth and productivity to rebuild gross and operating margin profitability include:\n•\nValue Chain Optimization\n – The Company approved initiatives to reduce spans and layers and right-size organizational capability within its supply chain and research and development functions. These actions will primarily result in employee severance through a net reduction in workforce, as well as asset write-offs and costs to decommission and relocate activities.\n•\nEnabling Function Re-Invention\n – The Company approved initiatives to reorganize and right-size various corporate functions. These activities will primarily result in employee severance through a net reduction in workforce. \n•\nFuture of Brand-led Model\n – The Company approved initiatives to redesign spans and layers in its marketing, creative and other functions within the brand and product category structures to make them leaner, faster and more agile.

These activities will result in employee severance through a net reduction in workforce, inventory write-offs, as well as costs associated with sales returns.\n•\nDigital Organization Transformation\n – The Company approved initiatives to begin to reorganize and right-size its technology functions, which support its internal enterprise and commercial capabilities, to create a leaner, faster, more effective and more agile technology organization. These activities will primarily result in employee severance through a net reduction in workforce.\nOnce the relevant accounting criteria have been met, the Company expects to record cumulative restructuring and other charges of approximately $\n747\n million (before tax) in connection with these initiatives, which other than the non-cash charges, are expected to result in future cash expenditures funded from cash provided by operations.\nRestructuring Program Restructuring and Other Charges\nThe Company classifies restructuring charges as follows:\nEmployee-Related Costs –\n Employee-related costs are primarily comprised of severance and other post-employment benefit costs, calculated based on salary levels, prior service and other statutory minimum benefits, if applicable.\nAsset-Related Costs – \nAsset related costs primarily consist of asset write-offs or accelerated depreciation related to long-lived assets (including operating lease right-of-use assets) that will be taken out of service prior to their existing useful life as a direct result of a restructuring initiative.\nContract Terminations\n – Costs related to contract terminations include continuing payments to a third party after the Company has ceased benefiting from the rights conveyed in the contract, or a payment made to terminate a contract prior to its expiration.  \nOther Exit Costs\n – Other exit costs related to restructuring activities generally include costs to relocate facilities or employees, recruiting to fill positions as a result of relocation of operations, and outplacement for separated employees. \nThe Company classifies other charges associated with restructuring activities as follows:\nSales Returns and Cost of Sales\n – Product returns (offset by the related cost of sales) and inventory write-offs or write-downs as a direct result of an approved restructuring initiative to exit certain businesses or locations will be recorded as a component of Net sales and/or Cost of sales when estimable and reasonably assured. \nOther Charges\n – Other charges related to the design and implementation of approved initiatives, which are charged to Operating expenses as incurred and primarily include the following:\n•\nConsulting and other professional services for organizational design of the future structures and processes as well as the implementation thereof;\n•\nTemporary labor backfill;\n•\nCosts to establish and maintain a Project Management Office for the duration of the Restructuring Program, including internal costs for employees dedicated solely to project management activities, and consulting services to assist with business case development and execution;

the reduction in brick-and-mortar point of sale employees and related support staff; and the redesign of the Company’s regional branded marketing organizations, plus select opportunities in global brands and functions. \nAs of June 30, 2025, the net reduction of positions over the duration of the PCBA Program was approximately \n2,800\n positions globally. This reduction included the elimination of some positions, retraining and redeployment of certain employees and investment in new positions in key areas. As of June 30, 2025, over the duration of the PCBA program, the Company closed approximately \n16\n% of its freestanding stores.\nThe Company approved specific initiatives under the PCBA Program through fiscal 2022 and has substantially completed those initiatives.

These closures reflected changing consumer behaviors including higher demand for online and omnichannel capabilities. These activities resulted in product returns, termination of contracts, a net reduction in workforce, and inventory and other asset write-offs.\n•\nExit of the Global Distribution of BECCA Products\n – In reviewing the Company's brand portfolio to improve efficiency and the sustainability of long-term investments, the decision was made to exit the global distribution of BECCA products due to its limited distribution, the ongoing decline in product demand and the challenging environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, this legislation includes significant provisions, such as the permanent extension of certain expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\"), modifications to the international tax framework and the restoration of certain business tax provisions. The legislation has multiple effective dates, with certain provisions becoming effective in fiscal 2026. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new legislation.\nOn August 16, 2022, the U.S. federal government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, including a tax provision implementing a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax based on global adjusted financial statement income. The corporate alternative minimum tax did not have an impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024.\nOn July 20, 2020, the U.S. government released final and proposed regulations under the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions of the TCJA that provide for a high-tax exception to the GILTI tax. These regulations are retroactive to the original enactment of the GILTI tax provision, commencing with the Company's 2019 fiscal year. The Company has elected to apply the GILTI high-tax exception beginning with fiscal 2019 through 2024, and intends to make the election for fiscal 2025.\n \nIn December 2021, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued \"Pillar Two\" Global Anti-Base Erosion model rules for countries to enact into domestic law that would establish a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis for multinational companies. In certain countries that have enacted legislation incorporating the global minimum tax, it became effective for the Company at the beginning of fiscal 2025. The estimated tax impact of such legislation has been included in the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025 and was not material. The Company is continuing to monitor and evaluate the potential impact of newly enacted legislation incorporating the global minimum tax in additional countries. \nF-38\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn August 26, 2024, the U.S. Tax Court issued a decision in Varian Medical Systems, Inc. v. Commissioner. The decision related to the TCJA deduction for certain deemed foreign dividends otherwise subject to the Transition Tax on unrepatriated earnings of applicable foreign subsidiaries. Based on the Company's evaluation of the technical merits of this decision, the Company has filed a protective refund claim with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service in the fiscal 2025 fourth quarter. At this time the Company believes it is more-likely-than-not that such income tax benefit will not be sustained. The Company has accrued a $\n73\n million estimated tax benefit in the provision for income taxes, offset by an uncertain tax position reserve accrual for the estimated $\n73\n million Transition Tax at issue. As a result, there was no net impact to the provision for income taxes and accompanying consolidated statement of (loss) earnings, or to the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the year ended June 30, 2025. \nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the Company’s actual effective tax rate on (loss) earnings before income taxes is as follows:\nYear Ended June 30,\n2025\n2024\n2023\nProvision for income taxes at statutory rate\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\n21.0\n \n%\nIncrease (decrease) due to\n(1)\n:\nState and local income taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n(\n0.2\n)\n1.1\n \n0.3\n \nStock-based compensation arrangements – excess tax expense (benefits), net\n(\n3.4\n)\n3.0\n \n(\n0.8\n)\nTaxation of foreign operations\n(\n10.4\n)\n15.9\n \n8.6\n \nIncome tax reserve adjustments\n0.3\n \n(\n0.4\n)\n(\n0.1\n)\nNondeductible goodwill impairment charges\n(\n0.1\n)\n7.9\n \n—\n \nU.S. research and development tax credit\n1.2\n \n(\n2.2\n)\n(\n0.9\n)\nChanges in valuation allowance\n(\n16.5\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nOther, net\n(\n0.8\n)\n0.7\n \n(\n0.4\n)\nEffective tax rate\n(2)\n(\n8.9\n)\n%\n47.0\n \n%\n27.7\n \n%\n(1)\nIn fiscal 2025, as a result of the loss before income taxes, all reconciling items that are income tax expenses are presented as decreases to the rate, and all reconciling items that are income tax benefits are presented as increases to the rate.\n(2)\nFor fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, the reconciling items between the Company's U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and the Company's actual effective tax rate were materially impacted by the decrease in earnings before income taxes from fiscal 2024 to fiscal 2025 and from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, respectively.\n \nIncome tax reserve adjustments represent changes in the Company’s net liability for unrecognized tax benefits related to prior-year tax positions including the impact of tax settlements and lapses of the applicable statutes of limitations.\nAll excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to stock-based compensation awards are recorded as income tax expense or benefit in the consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. The Company recognized $\n35\n million and $\n23\n million of income tax expense for tax deficiencies associated with stock-based compensation for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, as compared to $\n11\n million of excess tax benefits, net as a reduction to the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023, in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings.\nThe Company has $\n4,466\n million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of June 30, 2025. Included in this amount is approximately $\n1,117\n million of earnings considered permanently reinvested for which no deferred income taxes have been provided. If these reinvested earnings were repatriated into the United States as dividends, the Company would be subject to approximately $\n77\n million in taxes, primarily related to foreign withholding taxes as well as additional state and local income taxes. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, in connection with a planned change in the Company's legal entity structure that exempts foreign withholding tax on certain undistributed earnings, the Company changed its assertion regarding its ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries and determined that $\n5,548\n million of undistributed earnings of such foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. The federal, state, local and foreign deferred income tax impact of this change was not material. \nF-39\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\n \nJune 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\nDeferred tax assets:\n \n \nCompensation-related expenses\n$\n201\n \n$\n198\n \nInventory obsolescence and other inventory related reserves\n101\n \n103\n \nRetirement benefit obligations\n45\n \n45\n \nVarious accruals not currently deductible\n340\n \n228\n \nNet operating loss, credit and other carryforwards\n615\n \n405\n \nUnrecognized state tax benefits and accrued interest\n11\n \n13\n \nLease liabilities\n511\n \n462\n \nResearch-related expenses\n276\n \n248\n \nOther differences between tax and financial statement values\n120\n \n103\n \n \n2,220\n \n1,805\n \nValuation allowance for deferred tax assets\n(\n454\n)\n(\n238\n)\nTotal deferred tax assets\n1,766\n \n1,567\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nFixed assets and intangibles\n(\n353\n)\n(\n614\n)\nROU assets\n(\n464\n)\n(\n422\n)\nOther differences between tax and financial statement values\n(\n36\n)\n(\n32\n)\nTotal deferred tax liabilities\n(\n853\n)\n(\n1,068\n)\nTotal net deferred tax assets\n$\n913\n \n$\n499\n \nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $\n913\n million, of which $\n1,339\n million is included in Other assets and $\n426\n million is included in Other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had net deferred tax assets of $\n499\n million, of which $\n1,018\n million is included in Other assets and $\n519\n million is included in Other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of June 30, 2025 and 2024, certain subsidiaries had $\n972\n million and $\n657\n million of foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, the tax effect of which was $\n213\n million and $\n170\n million, respectively, as well as U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards of $\n172\n million and $\n180\n million, respectively, and state and local tax credit carryforwards of $\n11\n million and $\n8\n million, respectively. With the exception of $\n436\n million of net operating losses with an indefinite carryforward period as of June 30, 2025, these net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates through fiscal 2039. The state and local tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2029. \nThe Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $\n454\n million and $\n238\n million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, principally against certain net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of management, it is more-likely-than-not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. During fiscal 2025, the Company established a U.S. valuation allowance of $\n172\n million against general foreign tax credit and research and development tax credit carryforwards as it was determined more-likely-than-not that these deferred tax assets would not be realized. This determination was driven by the Company's weighing of relevant evidence including lower U.S. taxable income in fiscal 2025 as compared to recent years, reflecting reduced income from its travel retail business, and the resulting uncertainty about the ability to realize the carryforwards prior to expiration.\nAs of June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023, the Company had gross unrecognized tax benefits of $\n140\n million, $\n65\n million, and $\n63\n million, respectively. At June 30, 2025, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $\n133\n million. The increase in the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2025 as compared to June 30, 2024 was primarily attributable to having established an uncertain tax position reserve accrual for the Transition Tax at issue based on the August 26, 2024 U.S. Tax Court decision in Varian v. Commissioner, as discussed above.\nF-40\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe Company classifies applicable interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of the provision for income taxes. The total gross accrued interest and penalty expense recorded during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 in the accompanying consolidated statements of (loss) earnings was $\n2\n million, $\n3\n million and $\n2\n million, respectively. The total gross accrued interest and penalties in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2025 and 2024 was $\n19\n million and $\n17\n million, respectively. \nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\n \nJune 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nBalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year\n$\n65\n \n$\n63\n \n$\n61\n \nGross amounts of increases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period\n83\n \n4\n \n9\n \nGross amounts of decreases as a result of tax positions taken during a prior period\n(\n9\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n5\n)\nGross amounts of increases as a result of tax positions taken during the current period\n7\n \n5\n \n4\n \nAmounts of decreases in unrecognized tax benefits relating to settlements with taxing authorities\n(\n2\n)\n(\n1\n)\n(\n4\n)\nReductions to unrecognized tax benefits as a result of a lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations\n(\n4\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n2\n)\nBalance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year\n$\n140\n \n$\n65\n \n$\n63\n \nEarnings from the Company’s global operations are subject to tax in various jurisdictions both within and outside the United States. The Company participates in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) Compliance Assurance Program (“CAP”). The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of income tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations.\nDuring the fiscal 2025 second quarter, the Company received notification of the formal conclusion of the compliance process with respect to its fiscal 2023 income tax return under the IRS CAP, which had no impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2025.\nSubsequent to June 30, 2025, the IRS completed its examination procedures with respect to fiscal 2024 under the IRS CAP. There was no impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company expects to receive formal notification of the conclusion of the IRS CAP process for fiscal 2024 during fiscal 2026. As of June 30, 2025, the compliance process was ongoing with respect to fiscal 2025.\nThe Company is currently undergoing income tax examinations and controversies in several state, local and foreign jurisdictions. These matters are in various stages of completion and involve complex multi-jurisdictional issues common among multinational enterprises, including transfer pricing, which may require an extended period of time for resolution.\nDuring fiscal 2025, the Company concluded various state, local and foreign income tax audits and examinations while several other matters, including those noted above, were initiated or remained pending. On the basis of the information available as of June 30, 2025, the Company does not expect significant changes to the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months.\nF-41\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe tax years subject to examination vary depending on the tax jurisdiction. As of June 30, 2025, the following tax years remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions indicated:\nMajor Jurisdiction\nOpen Fiscal Years\nBelgium\n2019 – 2025\nCanada\n2020 – 2025\nChina\n2022 – 2025\nFrance\n2019 – 2025\nGermany\n2017 – 2025\nHong Kong\n2019 – 2025\nIndia\n2013 – 2018, 2020 – 2025 \nItaly\n2020 – 2025\nJapan\n2020 – 2025\nKorea\n2021 – 2025\nSpain\n2018 – 2025\nSwitzerland\n2024 – 2025\nUnited Kingdom\n2024 – 2025\nUnited States\n2024 – 2025\nState of California\n2020 – 2025\nState and City of New York\n2019 – 2025\nThe Company is also subject to income tax examinations in numerous other state, local and foreign jurisdictions. The Company believes that its tax reserves are adequate for all years subject to examination.\nNOTE 10 – \nSUPPLIER FINANCE PROGRAMS\nUnder its supplier finance programs, the Company agrees to pay the banks the stated amount of confirmed invoices from its designated suppliers on the due dates of the invoices.

The 364-Day Facility expires on May 22, 2026. Up to the equivalent of $\n1,000\n million of the 364-Day Facility is available for multi-currency loans. Interest rates on borrowings under the 364-Day Facility will be based on prevailing market interest rates in accordance with the agreement. The costs incurred to establish the 364-Day Facility were not material. The 364-Day Facility has an annual fee of $\n0.7\n million, payable quarterly, which can fluctuate based on the Company’s current credit ratings each period. The 364-Day Facility contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $\n175\n million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility. At June 30, 2025, \nno\n borrowings were outstanding under the 364-Day Facility. \nIn December 2024, the Company repaid the outstanding principal balance of its $\n500\n million, 2024 Senior Notes at maturity with cash from operations. \nIn June 2024, the Company replaced its $\n2,500\n million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that was set to expire in October 2026 with a new $\n2,500\n million senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “2024 Facility”). The 2024 Facility expires on June 7, 2029 unless extended for up to \ntwo\n additional years in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement. Up to the equivalent of $\n750\n million of the 2024 Facility is available for multi-currency loans. Interest rates on borrowings under the 2024 Facility will be based on prevailing market interest rates in accordance with the agreement. The costs incurred to establish the 2024 Facility were not material. In fiscal 2025, the 2024 Facility's annual fee was $\n1.8\n million, payable quarterly, which can fluctuate based on the Company’s credit ratings each period. The 2024 Facility contains a cross-default provision whereby a failure to pay other material financial obligations in excess of $\n175\n million (after grace periods and absent a waiver from the lenders) would result in an event of default and the acceleration of the maturity of any outstanding debt under this facility. The 2024 Facility may be increased, at the election of the Company, by up to $\n500\n million in accordance with the terms set forth in the agreement. At June 30, 2025, \nno\n borrowings were outstanding under the 2024 Facility. \nIn February 2024, the Company completed a public offering of $\n650\n million aggregate principal amount of its 2034 Senior Notes. The Company used the proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, including funding a portion of the price to purchase the remaining interest in DECIEM, operating expenses, working capital, capital expenditures and redemptions and repayment of short-term or long-term borrowings, including outstanding commercial paper as it matured. \nThe Company maintains uncommitted credit facilities in various regions throughout the world. Interest rate terms for these facilities vary by region and reflect prevailing market rates for companies with strong credit ratings. During fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2024, there were \nno\n amounts outstanding.\nRefer to \nNote 17 – Commitments and Contingencies\n for the Company’s projected debt service payments as of June 30, 2025 and over the next five fiscal years.\nF-46\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 13 – \nDERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company addresses certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Costs associated with entering into derivative financial instruments have not been material to the Company’s consolidated financial results. At June 30, 2025, the notional amount of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments was $\n3,250\n million. \nFair Value Hedges\nThe Company enters into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its funded indebtedness. At June 30, 2025, the Company has interest rate swap agreements, with notional amounts totaling $\n700\n million and $\n300\n million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on its 2030 Senior Notes and 2031 Senior Notes, respectively, to variable interest rates based on three month fallback SOFR plus a margin. These interest rate swap agreements are designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt, and the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are exactly offset by the change in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.\nThe Company enters into cross-currency swap contracts to manage the exposure of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on its intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. At June 30, 2025, the Company has cross-currency swap contracts with notional amounts totaling $\n491\n million, to hedge the impact of foreign currency changes on certain intercompany foreign currency denominated debt. The cross-currency swap contracts are designated as fair value hedges of the related intercompany debt, and the gains and losses representing hedge components included in the assessment of effectiveness are presented in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction in the consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized over the life of the hedge on a systematic and rational basis. The earnings recognition of excluded components is presented in the same line item as the earnings effect of the hedged transaction in the consolidated statements of (loss) earnings. Any difference between the changes in the fair value of the excluded components and amounts recognized in (loss) earnings will be recognized in AOCI.\nThe estimated net gain on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges as of June 30, 2025 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $\n14\n million. The accumulated net gain (loss) on derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in AOCI was $\n7\n million and $(\n7\n) million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nCash Flow Hedges\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge anticipated transactions and receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies, for periods consistent with the Company’s identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the cash flows that the Company receives from foreign subsidiaries. The foreign currency forward contracts entered into to hedge anticipated transactions and receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies have been designated as cash flow hedges and have varying maturities through the end of December 2026. Hedge effectiveness of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on the forward method, which includes forward points in the effectiveness assessment. At June 30, 2025, the Company had cash flow hedges outstanding with a notional amount totaling $\n1,517\n million.\nFor foreign currency hedge contracts that are no longer deemed highly effective, hedge accounting is discontinued and gains and losses in AOCI are reclassified to Net sales when the underlying forecasted transaction occurs. If it is probable that the forecasted transaction will no longer occur, then any gains or losses in AOCI are reclassified to current-period Net sales. As of June 30, 2025, the Company’s foreign currency cash flow hedges were highly effective.\nThe Company may enter into interest rate forward contracts to hedge anticipated issuance of debt for periods consistent with the Company’s identified exposures. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of interest rate movements on the cost of debt issuance.\nF-47\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe estimated net loss on the Company’s derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges as of June 30, 2025 that is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings, net of tax, within the next twelve months is $\n29\n million. The accumulated net (loss) gain on derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges in AOCI was $(\n13\n) million and $\n75\n million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, designated as net investment hedges, to hedge a portion of its net investment in certain foreign operations. Forward points and cross-currency basis spreads, respectively, are excluded from the effectiveness assessment and are recognized under a systematic and rational method over the life of the hedging instrument in Selling, general and administrative expenses. The purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on the Company’s net investment in these foreign operations. The net investment hedge contracts have varying maturities through the end of November 2029. Hedge effectiveness of the net investment hedge contracts is based on the spot method. At June 30, 2025, the Company had net investment hedges outstanding with notional amounts totaling $\n1,055\n million.\nCredit Risk\nAs a matter of policy, the Company enters into derivative contracts only with counterparties that have a long-term credit rating of at least A- or higher by at least \ntwo\n nationally recognized rating agencies. The counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions. Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of contracts in asset positions, which totaled $\n82\n million at June 30, 2025.

The inputs are unobservable in the market and significant to the instrument’s valuation.\nF-52\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the Company’s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2025:\n(In millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets:\n \n \n \n \nMoney market funds\n$\n727\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n727\n \nForeign currency forward contracts\n—\n \n32\n \n—\n \n32\n \nCross-currency swap contracts\n—\n \n50\n \n—\n \n50\n \nTotal\n$\n727\n \n$\n82\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n809\n \nLiabilities:\nForeign currency forward contracts\n$\n—\n \n$\n97\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n97\n \nInterest rate contracts\n—\n \n104\n \n—\n \n104\n \nCross-currency swap contracts\n—\n \n15\n \n—\n \n15\n \nTotal\n$\n—\n \n$\n216\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n216\n \nThe following table presents the Company’s hierarchy for its financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of June 30, 2024:\n(In millions)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nAssets:\nMoney market funds\n$\n1,507\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,507\n \nForeign currency forward contracts\n—\n \n68\n \n—\n \n68\n \nCross-currency swap contracts\n—\n \n80\n \n—\n \n80\n \nTotal\n$\n1,507\n \n$\n148\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,655\n \nLiabilities:\nForeign currency forward contracts\n$\n—\n \n$\n21\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n21\n \nInterest rate contracts\n—\n \n145\n \n—\n \n145\n \nTotal\n$\n—\n \n$\n166\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n166\n \nF-53\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments not measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:\nJune 30,\n2025\n2024\n(In millions)\nCarrying\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nCarrying\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nCurrent and long-term debt\n$\n7,317\n \n$\n6,794\n \n$\n7,771\n \n$\n7,174\n \nDeferred consideration payable\n$\n322\n \n$\n323\n \n$\n341\n \n$\n340\n \nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the Company’s financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:\nCash and cash equivalents –\n Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, time deposits and money market funds (classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy). Cash deposits in interest bearing accounts and time deposits are carried at cost, which approximates fair value, due to the short maturity of cash equivalent instruments.\nForeign currency forward contracts –\n The fair values of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on an income approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from an independent pricing service. To determine the fair value of contracts under the model, the difference between the contract price and the current forward rate was discounted using SOFR forward curves.\nCross-currency swap contracts –\n The fair values of the Company’s cross-currency swap contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, such as swap yield curves and currency spot and forward rates, were obtained from independent pricing services.\nInterest rate contracts –\n The fair values of the Company’s interest rate contracts were determined using an industry-standard valuation model, which is based on the income approach. The significant observable inputs to the model, such as treasury yield curves, swap yield curves and SOFR forward curves, were obtained from independent pricing services.\nCurrent and long-term debt\n – The fair value of the Company’s debt was estimated based on the current rates offered to the Company for debt with the same remaining maturities. To a lesser extent, debt also includes finance lease obligations for which the carrying amount approximates the fair value. The Company’s debt is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy.\nDeferred consideration payable \n–\n The deferred consideration payable consists primarily of deferred payments associated with the TOM FORD Acquisition. The fair value of the payments treated as deferred consideration payable are calculated based on the net present value of cash payments using an estimated borrowing rate based on quoted prices for a similar liability. The Company’s deferred consideration payable is classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Refer to \nNote 5 – Asset Acquisition\n for additional information associated with the TOM FORD Acquisition.\nNonfinancial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nIn connection with its interim and annual impairment assessment of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and the Dr.Jart+ other intangible asset impairment, the Company has measured certain nonfinancial assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 6 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for discussion of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value, the description of the inputs and information used to develop those inputs.\nF-54\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 15 – \nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nDisaggregation of net sales by the Company's geographic regions are as follows:\n \nYear Ended June 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nThe Americas\n$\n4,411\n \n$\n4,581\n \n$\n4,518\n \nEurope, the Middle East & Africa\n5,375\n \n6,140\n \n6,225\n \nAsia/Pacific\n4,537\n \n4,888\n \n5,194\n \n14,323\n \n15,609\n \n15,937\n \nReturns associated with restructuring and other activities\n3\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n27\n)\nNet sales\n$\n14,326\n \n$\n15,608\n \n$\n15,910\n \n(1)\nThe net sales from the Company’s travel retail business are included in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa region, with the exception of net sales of Dr.Jart+ in the travel retail channel that are reflected in Korea in the Asia/Pacific region.\n \nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable, net is stated net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, including credit losses, and customer deductions totaling $\n38\n million and $\n26\n million as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, respectively. Payment terms are short-term in nature and are generally less than one year.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses are as follows:\nJune 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\nAllowance for credit losses, beginning of year\n$\n14\n \n$\n16\n \nProvision (adjustment) for expected credit losses\n11\n \n(\n4\n)\nWrite-offs, net & other\n1\n \n2\n \nAllowance for credit losses, end of year\n$\n26\n \n$\n14\n \nThe remaining balance of the allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions of $\n12\n million as of June 30, 2025 and June 30, 2024, relates to non-credit losses, which are primarily due to customer deductions.\nDeferred Revenue\nChanges in deferred revenue are as follows:\nJune 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\nDeferred revenue, beginning of year\n$\n560\n \n$\n572\n \nRevenue recognized that was included in the deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period\n(\n288\n)\n(\n316\n)\nRevenue deferred during the period\n257\n \n316\n \nOther\n4\n \n(\n12\n)\nDeferred revenue, end of year\n$\n533\n \n$\n560\n \nF-55\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nTransaction Price Allocated to the Remaining Performance Obligations\nAt June 30, 2025, the combined estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the next \ntwelve months\n related to performance obligations for customer loyalty programs, gift with purchase promotions, purchase with purchase promotions, gift card liabilities, and the Marcolin license arrangement related to TOM FORD that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) is $\n314\n million.

The Company also maintains post-retirement benefit plans that provide certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees. \nRetirement Growth Account Plan (U.S.)\nThe Retirement Growth Account Plan is a trust-based, noncontributory qualified defined benefit pension plan. The Company seeks to maintain appropriate funded percentages. For contributions, the Company seeks to contribute an amount or amounts that would not be less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), as amended, and subsequent pension legislation, and would not be more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.\nRestoration Plan (U.S.)\nThe Company also has an unfunded, non-qualified domestic noncontributory pension Restoration Plan to provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations.\nInternational Pension Plans\nThe Company maintains international pension plans, the most significant of which are defined benefit pension plans. The Company’s funding policies for these plans are determined by local laws and regulations. The Company’s most significant defined benefit pension obligations are included in the plan summaries below.\nPost-retirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company maintains a domestic post-retirement benefit plan which provides certain medical and dental benefits to eligible employees. Employees hired after January 1, 2002 are not eligible for retiree medical benefits when they retire. Certain retired employees who are receiving monthly pension benefits are eligible for participation in the plan. Contributions required and benefits received by retirees and eligible family members are dependent on the age of the retiree. It is the Company’s practice to fund a portion of these benefits as incurred and may provide discretionary funding for future liabilities up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes.\nCertain of the Company’s international subsidiaries and affiliates have post-retirement plans, although most participants are covered by government-sponsored or administered programs.\nF-57\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED

for determining future net periodic benefit cost is based on a review of highly rated long-term bonds. The discount rate for the Company’s domestic plans is based on a bond portfolio that includes only long-term bonds with an Aa rating, or equivalent, from a major rating agency. The Company used an above-mean yield curve which represents an estimate of the effective settlement rate of the obligation, and the timing and amount of cash flows related to the bonds included in this portfolio are expected to match the estimated defined benefit payment streams of the Company’s domestic plans. For the Company’s international plans, the discount rate in a particular country was principally determined based on a yield curve constructed from high quality corporate bonds in that respective country, with the resulting portfolio having a duration matching that particular plan. In determining the long-term rate of return for a plan, the Company considers the historical rates of return, the nature of the plan’s investments and an expectation for the plan’s investment strategies.\nThe weighted-average interest crediting rate used to determine the benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost relating to the Company’s U.S. Pension Plans was \n4.24\n% and \n5.20\n% as of and for the years ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. \nAssumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. The assumed weighted-average health care cost trend rate for the coming year is \n8.06\n% while the weighted-average ultimate trend rate of \n4.02\n% is expected to be reached in approximately \n15\n years to \n25\n years. \nAmounts recognized in AOCI (before tax) as of June 30, 2025 are as

Assets\nThe Company’s investment strategy for its pension plan assets is to maintain a diversified portfolio of asset classes with the primary goal of meeting long-term cash requirements as they become due. Assets are primarily invested in diversified funds that hold equity or debt securities to maintain the security of the funds while maximizing the returns within each plan’s investment policy. The investment policy for each plan specifies the type of investment vehicles appropriate for the plan, asset allocation guidelines, criteria for selection of investment managers and procedures to monitor overall investment performance, as well as investment manager performance.\nThe Company’s target asset allocation at June 30, 2025 is as

valuation methodologies used for plan assets measured at fair value:\nCash and cash equivalents –\n Cash and all highly-liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash and cash equivalents, primarily consisting of cash deposits in interest bearing accounts, time deposits and money market funds. These assets are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nF-62\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nShort-term investment funds –\n The fair values are determined using the Net Asset Value (“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets at the measurement date. These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. For some assets the Company is utilizing the NAV as a practical expedient and those investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy.\nGovernment and agency securities –\n The fair values are determined using third-party pricing services using market prices or prices derived from observable market inputs such as benchmark curves, broker/dealer quotes, and other industry and economic factors. These investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds –\n The fair values of publicly traded funds are based upon market quotes and are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The fair values for non-publicly traded funds are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator of the fund when the Company has the ability to redeem the assets at the measurement date. These assets are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. When the Company is utilizing the NAV as a practical expedient those investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy. These investments have monthly redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from \n10\n to \n14\n days. There are no unfunded commitments related to these investments.\nInsurance contracts –\n The fair values are based on negotiated value and the underlying investments held in separate account portfolios, as well as the consideration of the creditworthiness of the issuer. The underlying investments are primarily government, asset-backed and fixed income securities. Insurance contracts are generally classified as Level 3 as there are no quoted prices or other observable inputs for pricing.\nInterests in limited partnerships and hedge fund investments\n – The fair values are determined using the NAV provided by the administrator as a practical expedient, and therefore these investments are not included in the valuation hierarchy. These investments have monthly and quarterly redemption frequencies with redemption notice periods ranging from \n30\n to \n90\n days. Unfunded commitments related to these investments are de minimis.\n401(k) Savings Plan (U.S.)\nThe Company’s 401(k) Savings Plan (“Savings Plan”) is a contributory defined contribution plan covering substantially all regular full-time U.S. employees who have completed the hours and service requirements, as defined by the plan document. Regular full-time employees are eligible to participate in the Savings Plan \nthirty days\n following their date of hire. The Savings Plan is subject to the applicable provisions of ERISA. The Company matches a portion of the participant’s contributions after \none year\n of service under a predetermined formula based on the participant’s contribution level. The Company’s contributions were $\n51\n million, $\n51\n million and $\n50\n million for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are not an investment option in the Savings Plan and the Company does not use such shares to match participants’ contributions.\nDeferred Compensation\nThe Company has agreements with certain employees and outside directors who defer compensation. The Company accrues for such compensation, and either interest thereon or for the change in the value of cash units. The amounts included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets under these plans were $\n41\n million and $\n44\n million as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The benefit for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $\n3\n million, $\n14\n million and $\n7\n

Refer to \nNote 7 – Leases\n for information regarding future minimum lease payments relating to the Company’s finance leases. Interest costs on long-term and current debt in fiscal 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030 and thereafter are projected to be $\n290\n million, $\n289\n million, $\n274\n million, $\n243\n million, $\n233\n million and $\n2,276\n million, respectively. Projected interest costs on variable rate instruments were calculated using market rates at June 30, 2025.\n(2)\nUnconditional purchase obligations primarily include: inventory commitments, information technology contract commitments, accrued restructuring, deferred consideration payable, advertising commitments and royalty payments pursuant to license agreements. Future royalty and advertising commitments were estimated based on planned future sales for the term that was in effect at June 30, 2025, without consideration for potential renewal periods.\n(3)\nRefer to \nNote 9 – Income Taxes\n for information regarding unrecognized tax benefits. As of June 30, 2025, the noncurrent portion of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, was $\n157\n million. At this time, the settlement period for the noncurrent portion of the unrecognized tax benefits, including related accrued interest and penalties, cannot be determined and therefore was not included.\n(4)\nThe Transition Tax may be paid over an \neight-year\n period and this amount represents the remaining liability as of June 30, 2025.\n(5)\nRefer to \nNote 7 – Leases\n for information regarding future minimum lease payments relating to the Company’s operating leases.\nLegal Proceedings\nThe Company is involved, from time to time, in litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to its business, including product liability matters (including asbestos-related claims), advertising, regulatory, employment, intellectual property, real estate, environmental, trade relations, securities, tax, and privacy. \nThe Company establishes accruals for loss contingencies when it has determined that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss, or range of loss, can be reasonably estimated. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely on estimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. Any such accruals are adjusted thereafter as appropriate to reflect changes in circumstances. The Company also determines estimates of reasonably possible losses or ranges of reasonably possible losses in excess of related accrued liabilities, if any, when it has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, and it is able to determine such estimates. Legal defense costs are recognized as incurred when the legal services are provided.\nRefer below for the assessment of loss contingencies associated with the Company's Securities Class Action and Derivative Matters and Cosmetic Talcum Powder Matters.\nManagement believes that the outcome of all remaining current litigation and other legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Reasonably possible losses in addition to the amounts accrued for the Company's remaining litigation and legal proceedings are not expected to be material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. However, management’s assessment of the Company’s current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the Securities Class Action and Derivative Matters and Cosmetic Talcum Powder Matters, could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company not presently known to the Company or determinations by judges, juries or other finders of fact which are not in accord with management’s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation or proceedings. \nF-64\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSecurities Class Action and Derivative Matters\nOn December 7, 2023 and January 22, 2024, the Company and its then Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer were named as defendants in separate purported securities class action complaints filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On February 20, 2024, those \ntwo\n purported securities class actions were consolidated into \none\n action. On March 22, 2024, plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended class action complaint, which alleges that defendants made materially false and misleading statements during the period February 3, 2022 to October 31, 2023 in press releases, the Company’s public filings and during conference calls with analysts that artificially inflated the price of the Company’s stock in violation of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. On March 31, 2025, the Court denied defendants' motion to dismiss. Defendants intend to defend the action vigorously. \nOn February 1, 2024 and March 15, 2024, stockholder derivative action complaints were filed against certain of the Company’s officers as of those dates, all the Company’s directors as of those dates and certain of the Company’s former directors as of those dates in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In April 2024, both complaints were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. Subsequently, the Company's Board of Directors (\"the Board\") received stockholder litigation demands, requesting, among other things, that the Board investigate potential claims on behalf of the Company based on the same alleged course of conduct identified in the securities case complaint (which were also the subject of the voluntarily dismissed stockholder derivative actions complaints) described above. A committee of the Board has been formed to review the stockholder demands and make recommendations, as appropriate in its discretion, to the Board.\nOn May 8, 2025, \ntwo\n additional stockholder derivative action complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against certain of the Company’s officers and directors alleging breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment from the sale of stock by certain individual defendants during the time period surrounding the allegations of false and misleading statements in the purported securities class action described above. Then, on June 23, 2025, another stockholder derivative action complaint was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in Kings County against certain of the Company’s officers and directors, also alleging breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment as well as claims of waste, gross mismanagement, unjust enrichment, and insider trading.\nThe Company believes that it is not possible at this time to reasonably assess the outcome of these matters or to estimate the loss or range of losses, if any, as the matters are in their early stages.\nCosmetic Talcum Powder Matters\nThe Company has been named as a defendant in civil actions alleging that certain cosmetic talcum powder products sold by the Company were contaminated with asbestos. Most of these actions involve a number of co-defendants from a variety of different industries. As of June 30, 2025, there were \n84\n individual cases pending against the Company in state and federal courts throughout the United States, as compared to \n273\n cases as of June 30, 2024. During the year ended June 30, 2025, \n76\n new cases were filed and \n265\n cases were resolved by settlement or voluntary dismissal (including pursuant to the cases that were settled in the talcum litigation settlement agreements described below).\nIn view of the number of cases pending against the Company at June 30, 2024 as well as the evolution of the litigation landscape and expectations regarding future claims at that time, the Company took action from the end of August 2024 through October 2024 to mitigate its future exposure. During the period, the Company reached agreements with certain plaintiff law firms (collectively, the “talcum litigation settlement agreements”) for: (i) the resolution of over \n200\n pending cosmetic talcum powder matters handled by those firms as well as (ii) a process for resolving potential future cosmetic talcum powder claims expected to be brought on behalf of plaintiffs by those firms from January 1, 2025 through December 31, 2029, with annual capped amounts per year for each participating law firm. \nTo account for the talcum litigation settlement agreements, the Company recorded a charge of $\n159\n million during the fiscal 2025 first quarter for the amount agreed to settle the current and potential future claims (amounts recorded for potential future claims is based on the best estimate of the probable loss and a reasonably possible loss beyond the amounts recorded is not expected to be material). As of June 30, 2025, $\n22\n million is recorded in Other accrued liabilities and $\n85\n million is recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet related to the talcum litigation settlement agreements.\nF-65\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThere are and could be other plaintiff law firms outside of those included in the talcum litigation settlement agreements that bring claims against the Company. The value of other settlements outside of the talcum litigation settlement agreements, either individually or in the aggregate, for the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 were not material. Given the inherent uncertainties of litigation, it is not possible to predict the outcome of all individual cases pending against the Company or potential unasserted claims, and therefore a specific estimate and associated provision is made, as needed, for a small number of individual cases that have advanced to the later stages of legal proceedings. For the remaining filed cases, the Company records an estimate of exposure loss on an aggregated and ongoing basis, which takes into account the historical outcomes of cases the Company has resolved to date. Any adverse outcomes, either in an individual case or in the aggregate, could be material. While the Company and its legal counsel intend to continue to defend these cases vigorously, there can be no assurances regarding the ultimate resolution of these matters. The amounts recorded during the years ended June 30, 2025, 2024 and 2023 for such litigation, outside of the talcum litigation settlement agreements, are not material to the Company's consolidated financial statements. The range of reasonably possible losses in excess of accrued liabilities currently cannot be reasonably estimated for cosmetic talcum matters. \nThe Company believes that a portion of its costs incurred in defending and resolving these claims may be covered by insurance policies issued by several insurance carriers, subject to deductibles, exclusions, retentions and policy limits. Amounts received to date have not been material.\nNOTE 18 – \nCOMMON STOCK\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Company’s authorized common stock consists of \n1,300\n million shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $\n.01\n per share, and \n304\n million shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $\n.01\n per share. Class B Common Stock is convertible into Class A Common Stock, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time at the option of the holder, on the basis of \none\n share of Class A Common Stock for each share of Class B Common Stock converted. Holders of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are entitled to \none\n vote per share and holders of the Company’s Class B Common Stock are entitled to \nten\n votes per share.\nInformation about the Company’s common stock outstanding is as follows:\n(Shares in thousands)\nClass A\nClass B\nBalance at June 30, 2022\n231,513.5\n \n125,542.0\n \nAcquisition of treasury stock\n(1)\n(\n1,220.7\n)\n—\n \nStock-based compensation\n1,785.1\n \n—\n \nBalance at June 30, 2023\n232,077.9\n \n125,542.0\n \nAcquisition of treasury stock\n(1)\n(\n316.5\n)\n—\n \nStock-based compensation\n1,385.2\n \n—\n \nBalance at June 30, 2024\n233,146.6\n \n125,542.0\n \nAcquisition of treasury stock\n(1)\n(\n482.5\n)\n—\n \nStock-based compensation\n1,560.7\n \n—\n \nBalance at June 30, 2025\n234,224.8\n \n125,542.0\n \n(1)\nIn fiscal 2023, this amount represents shares repurchased under our authorized share repurchase program, as well as shares repurchased to satisfy tax withholding obligations upon the payout of certain stock-based compensation arrangements.

These Plans currently provide for the issuance of approximately \n100.8\n million shares of Class A Common Stock, which consist of shares cumulatively provided for and shares transferred to the Fiscal 2002 Plan from other inactive plans and employment agreements, to be granted in the form of stock-based awards to key employees and non-employee directors of the Company. As of June 30, 2025, approximately \n15.3\n million shares of Class A Common Stock were reserved and available to be granted pursuant to these Plans. The Company may satisfy the obligation of its stock-based compensation awards with either new or treasury shares. The Company’s equity compensation awards include stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance share units (“PSUs”), long-term PSUs, including long-term price-vested units (“PVUs”), and share units. \nTotal net stock-based compensation expense is attributable to the granting of and the remaining requisite service periods of stock options, RSUs, PSUs, long-term PSUs and share units. Compensation expense attributable to net stock-based compensation is as follows:\nYear Ended June 30,\n(In millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nCompensation

underlying stock. The implied volatilities were obtained from publicly available data sources. For the weighted-average expected option life assumption, the Company considers the exercise behavior for past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises. The average risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury strip rate for the expected term of the options and the average dividend yield is based on historical experience. \nF-68\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company granted RSUs in

On September 3, 2024, since the Company achieved positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the PSU award agreement, and since the executive completed the requisite service, the Company issued \n195,940\n shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock to its then Chief Executive Officer in accordance with the terms of these PSUs. At the time of issuance, the total fair value of shares granted was $\n18\n million.\nIn March 2021, the Company granted to the Company’s then CEO PSUs with an aggregate payout of \n68,578\n shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock, to incentivize him to continue serving through at least June 30, 2024. Generally, no portion of this award will vest unless the Company has achieved positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the performance share unit award agreement, during the relevant performance period. The PSUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as any delivery of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. The aggregate grant date fair value of the PSUs of approximately $\n20\n million was estimated using the closing stock price of the Company's Class A Common Stock on the date of grant. Since the Company achieved positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the PSU award agreement, and since the then CEO completed the requisite service, \n68,578\n shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are anticipated to be issued, and the related dividends to be paid, in accordance with the terms of the grant on September 2, 2025.\nLong-term Price-Vested Units \nIn March 2021, the Company granted to the Company’s then CEO PVUs with an aggregate payout of \n85,927\n shares, divided into \nthree\n tranches, of the Company's Class A Common Stock, to incentivize him to continue serving through at least June 30, 2024. Generally, no portion of this award will vest unless the Company has achieved positive Cumulative Operating Income, as defined in the price-vested unit award agreement, during the relevant performance period. In addition, the vesting of each tranche is contingent upon the Company’s achievement of the respective stock price goal, which means that the average closing price per share of the Company’s Class A Common Stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange be at or above the applicable stock price goal (noted in the table below) for \n20\n consecutive trading days during the applicable performance period. The PVUs are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that will be payable in cash at the same time as any delivery of shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. \nF-70\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe number of shares subject to each tranche of the price-vested unit award, as well as the stock price goals, service periods, performance periods and share delivery dates for each tranche are as follows:\nNumber \nof \nShares \nper \nTranche\nStock Price Goal \n(per Share)\nService Period\nPerformance Period for Stock Price Goal\nPerformance Period for Cumulative Operating Income Goal\nShare Delivery Date\nFirst tranche\n27,457\n \n$\n323.03\n \nMarch 11, 2021 - June 30, 2024\nMarch 11, 2021 - June 30, 2024\nJuly 1, 2021 - June 30, 2025\nSeptember 2, 2025\nSecond tranche\n28,598\n \n$\n333.21\n \nMarch 11, 2021 - June 30, 2024\nMarch 11, 2021 - June 30, 2024\nJuly 1, 2021 - June 30, 2025\nSeptember 2, 2025\nThird tranche\n29,872\n \n$\n343.61\n \nMarch 11, 2021 - June 30, 2024\nMarch 11, 2021 - June 30, 2024\nJuly 1, 2021 - June 30, 2025\nSeptember 2, 2025\nTotal shares\n85,927\n \nThe aggregate grant date fair value of the PVUs of approximately $\n20\n million was estimated using the Monte Carlo Method, which requires certain assumptions. \nThe significant assumptions used for this award were as follows:\nExpected volatility\n31.8\n \n%\nDividend yield\n0.8\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n0.4\n \n%\nExpected term\n3.3\n years\nThe Stock Price Goals (per Share) were all achieved during fiscal 2022 and since the Company achieved positive Cumulative Operating Income as of June 30, 2025, as defined in the award agreement, and since the CEO completed the requisite service, \n85,927\n shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are anticipated to be issued, and the related dividends to be paid, in accordance with the terms of the grant on September 2, 2025.\nShare Units\nThe Company grants share units to certain non-employee directors under the Amended and Restated Non-Employee Director Share Incentive Plan. The share units are convertible into shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock as provided for in that plan. Share units are accompanied by dividend equivalent rights that are converted to additional share units when such dividends are declared.\nThe following is a summary of the status of the Company’s share units as of June 30, 2025 and activity during the fiscal year then ended:\n(Shares in thousands)\nShares\nWeighted-Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value Per Share\nOutstanding at June 30, 2024\n113.6\n \n$\n90.02\n \nGranted\n12.0\n \n63.90\n \nDividend equivalents\n2.5\n \n78.85\n \nConverted \n(1)\n(\n21.2\n)\n73.35\n \nOutstanding at June 30, 2025\n106.9\n \n90.15\n \n(1) \nThe total intrinsic value of share units converted during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $\n1.6\n million, $\n1.5\n million, and $\n4.1\n million, respectively.\n \nF-71\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash Units\nCertain non-employee directors defer cash compensation in the form of cash payout share units, which are not subject to the Plans. These share units are classified as liabilities and, as such, their fair value is adjusted to reflect the current market value of the Company’s Class A Common Stock. The Company recorded $\n3\n million, $\n13\n million and $\n8\n million as compensation income, net to reflect additional deferrals and the change in the market value for fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDECIEM Stock Options\nAs a result of the fiscal 2021 acquisition of additional shares of DECIEM, the Company had a stock option plan relating to its majority-owned subsidiary DECIEM (“DECIEM Stock Option Plan”). The DECIEM stock options were issued in replacement of and exchange for certain vested and unvested DECIEM employee stock options previously issued by DECIEM. The DECIEM stock options were subject to the terms and conditions of the DECIEM 2021 Stock Option Plan.

that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company’s chief operating decision maker is the Chief Executive Officer (the “CEO”). As a result of the similarities in the manufacturing, marketing and distribution processes for the Company’s products, much of the information provided in the consolidated financial statements is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the CEO. While the Company’s results of operations are reviewed on a consolidated basis, the CEO also reviews data segmented on a basis that facilitates comparison to industry statistics. Although the Company operates in \none\n business segment, beauty products, the CEO evaluates performance based on its \nfour\n major product categories: skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care. These product categories meet the definition of operating and reportable segments and, accordingly, additional financial data is provided below. Skin care products include moisturizers, serums, cleansers, toners, eye care, body care, exfoliators, acne and oil corrections, facial masks and sun care products. Makeup products include foundations, powders, concealers, and setting sprays, lipsticks, lip liners and lip glosses, and mascaras, eyeshadows and eye liners. Fragrance products include parfum, eau de parfum, eau de toilette, eau de cologne and body spray, as well as lotions, creams, powders, candles and soaps that are based on a particular fragrance. Hair care products include shampoos, conditioners, styling products, treatment, finishing sprays and hair color products. Royalty revenue associated with the license of the TOM FORD trademark as discussed in \nNote 15 - Revenue Recognition,\n as well as sales and related results of ancillary products and services that do not fit within the Company's definitions of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care are included in the other category. \nThe CEO assesses each reportable segment’s performance using their respective operating income. Segment operating income is used in developing the overall strategy and during the annual budget process, as well as considered in budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis when making decisions about the allocation of operating and capital resources to each reportable segment. Segment net sales and operating income is before the impacts of restructuring and other activities and the impacts from the other category described above. Returns and charges associated with restructuring and other activities are not allocated to the Company's segments because they are centrally directed and controlled, are not included in internal measures of segment performance and result from activities that are deemed Company-wide initiatives to redesign, resize and reorganize select areas of the business. \nThe accounting policies for the Company’s reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies, with the exception that the impacts of restructuring and other activities are not allocated to the reportable segments. The assets and liabilities of the Company are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the consolidated financial statements; thus, no additional information is produced for the CEO or included herein.\nF-75\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInformation about the Company's \nfour\n operating segments is as follows:\n(in millions)\nJune 30, 2025\nSkin Care\nMakeup\nFragrance\nHair Care\nTotal\nNet sales\n$\n14,326\n \nLess: Other category net sales\n100\n \nLess: Returns associated with restructuring and other activities\n3\n \nSegment net sales\n$\n6,962\n \n$\n4,205\n \n$\n2,491\n \n$\n565\n \n$\n14,223\n \nCost of sales\n1,817\n \n1,131\n \n571\n \n158\n \n3,677\n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n4,196\n \n3,048\n \n1,749\n \n448\n \n9,441\n \nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets\n375\n \n308\n \n549\n \n—\n \n1,232\n \nOther segment items\n(1)\n—\n \n159\n \n—\n \n—\n \n159\n \nSegment operating income (loss)\n$\n574\n \n$\n(\n441\n)\n$\n(\n378\n)\n$\n(\n41\n)\n$\n(\n286\n)\nOther category operating loss\n(\n13\n)\nCharges associated with restructuring and other activities\n(\n486\n)\nOperating loss\n(\n785\n)\nReconciliation to loss before income taxes:\nInterest expense\n(\n357\n)\nInterest income and investment income, net\n114\n \nOther components of net periodic benefit cost\n(\n12\n)\nLoss before income taxes\n$\n(\n1,040\n)\nSegment depreciation and amortization\n$\n403\n \n$\n243\n \n$\n144\n \n$\n33\n \n$\n823\n \nOther category\n6\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n829\n \n(1)\n Other segment items include Talcum litigation settlement agreements\nF-76\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions)\nJune 30, 2024\nSkin Care\nMakeup\nFragrance\nHair Care\nTotal\nNet sales\n$\n15,608\n \nLess: Other category net sales\n115\n \nLess: Returns associated with restructuring and other activities\n(\n1\n)\nSegment net sales\n$\n7,908\n \n$\n4,470\n \n$\n2,487\n \n$\n629\n \n$\n15,494\n \nCost of sales\n2,278\n \n1,290\n \n624\n \n191\n \n4,383\n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n4,424\n \n3,087\n \n1,598\n \n490\n \n9,599\n \nImpairment of goodwill and other intangible assets\n471\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n471\n \nSegment operating income (loss)\n$\n735\n \n$\n93\n \n$\n265\n \n$\n(\n52\n)\n$\n1,041\n \nOther category operating income\n53\n \nCharges associated with restructuring and other activities\n(\n124\n)\nOperating income\n970\nReconciliation to earnings before income taxes:\nInterest expense\n(\n378\n)\nInterest income and investment income, net\n167\n \nOther components of net periodic benefit cost\n13\n \nEarnings before income taxes\n$\n772\n \nSegment depreciation and amortization\n$\n418\n \n$\n236\n \n$\n132\n \n$\n33\n \n$\n819\n \nOther category\n6\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n825\n \nF-77\nTable of Contents\nTHE ESTÉE LAUDER COMPANIES INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(in millions)\nJune 30, 2023\nSkin Care\nMakeup\nFragrance\nHair Care\nTotal\nNet sales\n$\n15,910\n \nLess: Other category net sales\n53\n \nLess: Returns associated with restructuring and other activities\n(\n27\n)\nSegment net sales\n$\n8,249\n \n$\n4,532\n \n$\n2,451\n \n$\n652\n \n$\n15,884\n \nCost of sales\n2,397\n \n1,319\n \n617\n \n188\n \n4,521\n \nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n4,475\n \n3,127\n \n1,464\n \n500\n \n9,566\n \nImpairment of other intangible assets\n100\n \n107\n \n—\n \n—\n \n207\n \nSegment operating income (loss)\n$\n1,277\n \n$\n(\n21\n)\n$\n370\n \n$\n(\n36\n)\n$\n1,590\n \nOther category operating income\n4\n \nCharges associated with restructuring and other activities\n(\n85\n)\nOperating income\n1,509\nReconciliation to earnings before income taxes:\nInterest expense\n(\n255\n)\nInterest income and investment income, net\n131\n \nOther components of net periodic benefit cost\n12\n \nEarnings before income taxes\n$\n1,397\n \nSegment depreciation and amortization\n$\n383\n \n$\n211\n \n$\n117\n \n$\n31\n \n$\n742\n \nOther category\n2\n \nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n744\n \nFor the Company’s geographic region presentation, as disclosed in \nNote 15 – Revenue Recognition, \nnet sales are attributed to a country based on the legal entity sale location, and this predominantly aligns with the location of the customer, with the primary exception related to the Company’s net sales from the travel retail business. The net sales from the Company’s global travel retail business are included in the Europe, the Middle East & Africa geographic region, with the exception of net sales of Dr.Jart+ in the travel retail channel that are reflected in Korea in the Asia/Pacific geographic region. For the presentation of net sales by country below, the Company has presented this based on the location of the customer (e.g., the customer is the retailer in the wholesale business and the consumer in the direct-to-consumer business), and as such has attributed net sales from the travel retail business to the country to which the product is shipped, and not the Company’s country of legal sale. \nThe Company is domiciled in the United States. Net sales in the United States, including net sales from travel retail locations in the United States, as well as net sales in foreign countries, including net sales from travel retail locations in that country, that contribute 10% or more of net sales of the Company in fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nJune 30,\n(in millions)\n2025\n2024\n2023\nUnited States\n$\n3,762\n \n$\n3,887\n \n$\n3,848\n \nMainland China\n3,652\n \n4,019\n \n4,380\n \nKorea\n(1)\n718\n \n1,299\n \n1,558\n \nAll other countries\n6,194\n \n6,403\n \n6,124\n \nNet sales\n$\n14,326\n \n$\n15,608\n \n$\n15,910\n \n(1)\nKorea contributed \n10\n% of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023.
