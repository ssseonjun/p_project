  "item1_summary": " Devon's business and operations, and our industry in general, are subject to a variety of risks . If any of the following risks should occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted . Holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in Devon . The risks described below may not be the only risks we face .\n The U.S. oil and natural gas industry is facing a wide range of economic and geopolitical challenges . The UVA will provide an analysis of the global economic and political conditions in the United States, China, Europe and South America . The company will provide a detailed assessment of the risks and risks associated with the U.V. oil industry .\n The process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data . Different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data . The reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors, including additional development and appraisal activity .\n rrent development activity is focused on unconventional oil and gas assets, which generally have significantly higher decline rates as compared to conventional assets . Future oil, gas and NGL production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves . Our business requires significant capital to find and acquire new reserves, such as identifying additional producing zones in existing properties .\n Costs of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences . Declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted . In addition, our oil and gas properties can become damaged, our operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled .\n Many of the factors described above have negatively impacted and currently impact our operations and may do so again in the future . The occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property, as well as significant liabilities . Certain of these events historically have, and in the . future could, result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties, including persons living in proximity to our operations, our employees and employees of our contractors .\n We enter into financial derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil, gas and NGL price volatility . Many of our contract counterparties have become subject to increasing governmental oversight and regulations in recent years, which could adversely affect the cost and availability of our hedging arrangements . We have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties and investments .\n All or a portion of our production in one or more regions may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants, pipelines or gathering systems . Any bankruptcy involving, or any misconduct or other improper activities committed by, our business partners or other counterparties could negatively impact our own business or reputation .\n The rising costs and scarcity caused by this competitive pressure will generally increase during periods of higher commodity prices . Competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs . We experienced higher operating costs throughout 2023 due to steep cost inflation. Although cost inflation moderated somewhat in 2024, such inflationary pressures could continue or increase in 2025 .\n If permits are delayed or not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned . Certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells, including corporate successors of former operators . We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and remediation costs .\n Federal policy makers have expressed support for, and taken steps to implement, additional regulation of oil and gas leasing, permitting and development on federal lands . Changes in public policy may indirectly impact our operations by, among other things, increasing the cost of supplies and equipment and fostering general economic uncertainty . Such changes could significantly impact our profitability, financial condition and liquidity .\n Federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of hydraulic fracturing process . EPA has issued regulations under the federal Clean Air Act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities . State and local governments in areas in which we operate have adopted or stated intentions to adopt laws or regulations that mandate further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing . Beyond these regulatory efforts, various policy makers, regulatory agencies and political leaders have proposed implementing even further restrictions .\n Any new restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs, delays or cessation in development or other restrictions on our operations . Environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties .\n Increased regulation and attention given to water disposal activities could lead to greater efforts to limit or prohibit oil and gas activities . These or similar actions directed at our operating areas could limit the takeaway capacity for produced water in the impacted area, which could increase our operating expenses, require us to curtail our development plans or otherwise adversely impact our operations . We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income, capital and other taxes .\n A change in any U.S. federal, state or local or foreign tax law, treaty, policy, statute, rule, regulation or ordinance could also adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows . We are still assessing the potential impacts of the CAMT and the Pillar Two rules to our business . Climate Change and Related Regulatory, Social and Market Actions May Adversely Affect Our Business .\n EPA finalized more stringent methane rules for new, modified and reconstructed facilities in December 2023 . Rules have been subject to legal challenge, although OOOOb is already in effect . IRA imposed a new charge or fee with respect to excess methane emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas facilities starting in 2024 and annually increasing through 2026 . Fines and penalties for violations of these rules can be substantial .\n Policy makers have also advocated for expanding existing, or creating new, reporting and disclosure requirements regarding GHG emissions and other climate-related matters . The EPA adopted amendments in May 2024 to its GHG Reporting Program . The SEC finalized rules in March 2024 that require public companies to include extensive climate related disclosures in their SEC filings . The European Union recently adopted a set of policy initiatives, including the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive .\n Policy makers and political leaders have made, or expressed support for, a variety of proposals, such as cap-and-trade or carbon tax programs . At the international level, over 190 countries have signed the Paris Agreement, which requires member nations to submit non-binding GHG emissions reduction goals every five years . The Trump Administration re-withdrew the United States from Paris Agreement in January 2025 .\n In addition to regulatory risk, other market and social initiatives relating to climate change present risks for our business . These and other initiatives could negatively impact our business through restrictions or cancellations of oil and natural gas activities, greater costs of compliance or consumption . Increasing number of financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital have restricted or eliminated their investment in oil .\n Climate change may also result in increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events or changes in meteorological and hydrological patterns, that may adversely impact our operations . These and the other risks discussed above could result in additional costs, new restrictions on our operations and reputational harm to us, as well as reduce the actual and forecasted demand for our products .\n Public statements with respect to environmental targets or other ESG-related goals are becoming increasingly subject to heightened scrutiny from public and governmental authorities . If our ESG initiatives do not meet our investors’ or other stakeholders’ expectations and standards, investment in us may be viewed as less attractive and our reputation and business may be adversely impacted . As emission measurement protocols mature and related technologies continue to develop, we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals .\n Devon is subject to claims, litigation, audits, investigations and other proceedings . The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to numerous uncertainties . Devon may be exposed to losses in excess of any liabilities recorded, and such amounts could be material . Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows .\n The European Union approved new regulations imposing fossil fuel import standards, which could impact our ability to sell production in European markets . Governments may take similar actions in the future, particularly in the event of disruption in energy markets or national emergency . Disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations .\n As of December 31, 2024, we had total indebtedness of $8.9 billion . We receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the U.S. with respect to our debt . Any Downgrade of Our Credit Rating could Adversely Impact us . Our business has been adversely impacted by counterparty defaults in the past and we may experience similar defaults again in the future .\n Any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit . Cyberattacks and other cyber-related incidents have increasingly targeted our industry . Perpetrators of cyberattacks often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating confidential, proprietary or personal information, intellectual property or financial assets .\n We are not aware of any previous cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company . We devote significant resources to prevent cybersecurity incidents and protect our data, but our systems and procedures for identifying and protecting against such attacks may prove to be insufficient due to system vulnerabilities, human error or malfeasance .\n The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have an adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity . As the sophistication and volume of cyberattacks continue to increase, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities . We may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates .\n In recent years, proxy contests and other forms of shareholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies . Such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting our Board of Directors and employees from our long-term strategy, requiring us to incur increased advisory fees and related costs . If we are unable to make attractive acquisitions, our future growth could be limited .\n Mill acquisition, they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks . Acquisitions also have inherent risks, including possible delays or failures in closing, the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the disposed assets or business . volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders, unsuccessful sales efforts .\n Devon maintains a corporate information security policy and program designed to identify, assess and appropriately manage risk from cybersecurity threats . Devon can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or execute share repurchases at the current rate or at all . Devon maintains disaster recovery plans related to cybersecurity incidents as part of our broader corporate emergency preparedness program .\n We have made efforts to align the Program with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework for risk management . We conduct an annual assessment to identify areas for potential improvement and benchmark maturity relative to peers and other companies . The Manager of Digital Security has approximately 15 years of cybersecurity experience, a degree in management information systems .\n The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight of Devon’s risks from cybersecurity threats . Devon is not aware of any previous cybersecurity threats that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect Devon .
