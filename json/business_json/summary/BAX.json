European Union's medical device regulations for previously registered products, which primarily consist of contractor costs and other direct third-party costs .

No goodwill impairments were recorded for our remaining reporting units in connection with our annual goodwill impairment tests because the fair values of those reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts . We performed trigger-based impairment tests for each of the reporting units within our Hillrom segment (currently referred to as our Healthcare Systems & Technologies segment) in the third quarter of 2022 .\n Further adverse changes to macroeconomic conditions or our earnings forecasts could lead to additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods .
