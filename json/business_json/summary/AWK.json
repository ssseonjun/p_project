The Company (through AWCC) does not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes and does not use leveraged instruments .\n The Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations .

Contracts entered into are for periods consistent with the related underlying exposures .\n In February 2024, parent company and AWCC filed with the SEC a universal shelf registration statement that enables the Company to meet its capital needs through the offer and sale to the public from time to time of an unlimited amount of various types of securities .

Failure to comply with these covenants could lead to a default in the United States . The agreement is subject to a maximum of 0.70 to 1.00 per cent of the amount of long-term indebtedness owed to creditors .\n The Company does not have any material borrowings that are subject to default or prepayment as a result of the downgrading of these security ratings . Such a downgrading could increase fees and interest charges under its credit facility . Access to the capital markets, including the commercial paper market, and respective financing costs in those markets, may be directly affected by the Company’s securities ratings .\n The Company carries various property, casualty, cyber and financial insurance policies with limits, deductibles and exclusions that it believes are consistent with industry standards .

The Company is self-insured to the extent that losses are within the policy deductible or exceed the amount of insurance maintained . Management believes that the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy .\n Management has reviewed the critical accounting polices described below with the Company’s Audit, Finance and Risk Committee . The Company follows the authoritative accounting principles required for rate regulated utilities, which requires the Company to reflect the effects of rate regulation in its Consolidated Financial Statements . As of December 31, 2024, the Company concluded that the operations of its utilities met the criteria .\n Accounting principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a non-regulated entity, to be deferred as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates . Conversely, the principles require the creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future . If subsequent events indicate that the regulatory assets or liabilities no longer meet the criteria for probable future recovery or probable future settlement, the Company’s financial position could be materially affected .\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s regulatory asset balance was $1.2 billion .

Management evaluates each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing a tax judge .\n The Company evaluates the probability of realizing deferred tax assets quarterly by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income . The Company also assesses its ability to utilize tax attributes, including those in the form of carryforwards, for which the benefits have already been reflected in the financial statements . For the Company’s regulated entities, the change in deferred taxes are recorded as either an offset to a regulatory asset or a regulatory liability .\n The resulting tax balances as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, are appropriately accounted for in accordance with the applicable authoritative guidance . The ultimate outcome of tax matters could result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to the Consolidated Financial Statements . The Company maintains noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering eligible employees of its regulated utility and shared services operations .\n The discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits, which are based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future . Management projects the future return on plan assets considering prior performance, but primarily based upon the plans’ mix of assets . Management adopted the Society of Actuaries Pri-2012 base mortality table, the most recent table developed from private pension plan experience .\n The Company uses an approach that approximates the process of settlement of obligations tailored to the plans’ expected cash flows . The weighted-average discount rate assumption for determining pension benefit obligations was 5.70%, 5.18% and 5.58% at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively .\n The trustee for the Company’s defined benefit pension and postretirement welfare plans uses an independent valuation firm to calculate the fair value of plan assets .

The Company expects to make pension contributions to the plan trusts of $44 million in 2025 . The actual amounts contributed could change materially from this estimate . The impact of assumptions are reviewed annually and at any interim re-measurement of the plan obligations . There are generally no significant financing components or variable consideration .\n Unbilled revenue for the Company’s regulated utilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $219 million and $193 million, respectively . Company also recognizes revenues for certain ratemaking mechanisms that meet criteria for alternative revenue program accounting . Changes in the timing of meter reading schedules and the number and type of customers scheduled for each meter reading date would also have an effect on the unbilled revenue calculation .\n Company records loss contingencies when management determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss or a range of losses can be reasonably estimated . Revenues recognized during the period in excess of billings on construction contracts are recorded as unbilled revenues or other long-term assets . Unbilled revenue within Other as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $96 million and $109 million .\n The Company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices, equity prices and interest rates . As of December 31, 2024, a hypothetical 1% increase in average interest rates applied to the Company’s short-term borrowing balances throughout 2024 would result in an increased annual interest expense of approximately $2 million .\n The fair value of the treasury locks at December 31, 2024, was in a gain position of $24 million . These treasury lock agreements terminate in June 2025 and December 2025 and have an average fixed rate of 4.03% When entering into treasury locks, the Company is subject to market risk with respect to changes in the underlying benchmark interest rate .\n The Company is exposed to credit risk through its water, wastewater and related services . The Company’s primary credit risk is exposure to customer default on contractual obligations and the associated loss that may be incurred due to the non-payment of customer accounts receivable balances . Credit risk is managed through established credit and collection policies which are in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements .\n The Company is exposed to a potential national economic recession or deterioration in local economic conditions in the markets in which it operates . The credit quality of the Company’s customer accounts receivable is dependent on the economy and the ability of its customers to manage through unfavorable economic cycles and other market changes .

Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements .\n A company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles . Because of its inherent limitations, internal control may not prevent or detect misstatements, also, also may not detect misstatement statements .\n The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion . The communication relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the accounts and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments . The Company’s regulated utilities are subject to regulation by multiple state .\n The principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to accounting for the effects of rate regulation is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management in accounting for regulatory assets and liabilities relative to whether regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probable future recovery .
