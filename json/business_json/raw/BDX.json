  "item1_text": "Item 1. Business.\nAs previously disclosed, on July 21, 2023, BD received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its updated BD Alaris™ Infusion System, which enabled both remediation and a return to market for the BD Alaris™ Infusion System. To address open recalls and ensure devices at customer sites are running a recent, cleared version of the BD Alaris™ Infusion System Software, BD Alaris™ Infusion System devices in the U.S. market are being remediated or replaced with the updated 510(k) cleared version, which we expect to be substantially complete over the next calendar year. The overall timing and cost of replacement or remediation of the BD Alaris™ Infusion Systems and return to market in the U.S. may be impacted by, among other things, customer readiness, supply continuity, and our continued engagement with the FDA.\nIn addition, the European Union (“EU”) has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/745, the “EU MDR”) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/746, the “EU IVDR”), each of which impose stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the area of clinical evidence, quality management systems and post-market surveillance. Although the EU MDR has been fully applicable for previously approved self-certified medical devices since May 2021, the application of the EU MDR has been extended until 2027 for certain devices considered higher-risk and to 2028 for other devices. This longer transition timeline applies only to devices that are transitioning to MDR and meet other specific conditions. The EU IVDR has been applicable since May 2022, but transition periods apply for certain in vitro diagnostic medical devices. Complying with and maintaining devices under these regulations requires us to incur significant expenditures. Additionally, the availability of EU-notified body services certified under the new requirements is limited, which may delay the marketing approval for some of our products under these regulations. Any such delays, or any failure to meet these requirements could adversely impact our business in the EU and other regions that tie their product registrations to EU conformity requirements.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe are also subject to complex and rapidly evolving privacy and data protection laws, regulations and standards which govern the collection, use, storage, transfer, sharing and processing of personal data (particularly sensitive health information) across the U.S. and a significant number of other countries where we operate. The nature of our technologies and data-driven solutions amplifies privacy and data protection risks, especially as we employ could-based infrastructures, AI and other emerging digital capabilities. These innovations can introduce new vectors for data exposure, algorithmic bias, and regulatory scrutiny. These laws, rules and regulations require, among other things, proactive implementation of comprehensive compliance programs, continuous enhancement of internal policies, business practices, processes, and integration of technical and organizational safeguards across all assets and activities that process personal data. These requirements often entail operational constraints and higher compliance costs and may require us to modify existing or future products, potentially impacting innovation timelines and financial performance.\nFurthermore, privacy and data protection risks extend beyond our direct operations. Non-compliance by third-party vendors, manufacturers, or service providers (especially those involved in data processing) can expose us to liability indirectly. Cybersecurity incidents, system failures, or breaches involving our own infrastructure or that of our partners may trigger regulatory scrutiny, financial penalties, business interruption, reputational harm, loss of competitive advantage and customer trust, as well as privacy litigation and civil lawsuits with damages.\nFinally, changes in the tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our tax expense and/or tax payments, increase tax uncertainty and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development published Pillar Two Model Rules, which impose a 15% global minimum tax, that became effective in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate in fiscal year 2025, and we continue to assess their impact. Future changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, including under Pillar Two, whether prospective or retroactive, could materially impact our effective tax rate, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nDefects or quality issues associated with our products and related regulatory actions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial statements.\nThe design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to injury or other serious adverse events. The acquisition and integration of acquired companies increases our exposure to this risk. Such events have in the past and could in the future lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. In addition, any recall could result in the establishment or increase in financial reserves, which in turn would increase financial reporting and other disclosure obligations, the loss of sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies and related fines and penalties, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements.\nOur operations are dependent in part on patents and other intellectual property assets.\nMany of our businesses rely on patent, trademark and other intellectual property assets. These intellectual property assets, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. We can lose the protection afforded by these intellectual property assets through patent expirations, legal challenges or governmental action. Any patent applications we own or license may not result in patents being issued and any issued patents we obtain may not provide us with any competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may fail to accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable, and if we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Patents attained by competitors, particularly as patents on our products expire, may also adversely affect our competitive position. Competitors may design around our intellectual property to develop competing \n25\nTable of Contents\ntechnologies and products without infringing our intellectual property rights. In addition, competitors may seek to invalidate patents on our products or claim that our products infringe upon, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property, which could result in a loss of competitive advantage or the payment of significant legal fees, damages and past or future royalties, as well as injunctions against future sales of our products. We also operate in countries that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S., which could make it easier for competitors to compete with us in those countries. Further, governmental regulation and laws related to AI and other emerging technologies may increase the burden and cost of research and development or require increased transparency that makes it more difficult to protect our intellectual property.\nWe also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how with which we seek to protect our products, in part, by confidentiality agreements with certain employees, consultants and other parties. These agreements may not adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights. These agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors.\nThe loss of a significant portion of our portfolio of intellectual property assets may have an adverse effect on our earnings, financial condition or cash flows.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness \nWe may not be able to service all of our indebtedness.\nWe depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. However, our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations and to utilize other methods to make scheduled payments will depend on a range of economic, competitive and business factors, many of which are outside of our control. There can be no assurance that these sources will be adequate. Further, our ability to refinance our indebtedness could be adversely impacted by the loss of our “well-known seasoned issuer” status upon the filing of this annual report due to our entry into a December 2024 SEC Order. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, through the raising of additional capital or otherwise, we will be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, seek additional capital, sell assets or refinance our indebtedness. Any such action may not be successful and we may be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, we may not be able to refinance existing debt on favorable or comparable terms.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness impose restrictions that may affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various affirmative and negative covenants that may, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur debt and the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, have liens on our property, merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person. In addition, the agreements also require us to comply with certain financial covenants, including financial ratios. Our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations and could result in a default and acceleration under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations.\n26\nTable of Contents\nRisks Relating to the Proposed Combination of Our Biosciences and Diagnostics Solutions Business with Waters \nThe proposed combination of our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters may not be completed, on the currently contemplated timeline or at all. \nOn July 13, 2025, we entered into a definitive agreement with Waters to combine our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters. The transaction, if consummated, would result in our shareholders owning approximately 39.2% of the combined company and existing Waters shareholders owning approximately 60.8% of the combined company. The transaction is expected to close around the end of the first quarter of calendar year 2026, subject to receipt of required regulatory approvals, Waters stockholder approval, compliance with applicable SEC requirements, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service regarding certain matters germane to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the transactions and satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. No assurances can be provided that such closing conditions will be satisfied or waived or that the transaction will be consummated, on the currently contemplated timeline or at all. A failure to complete the transaction, or a delay in doing so, could adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In the event that the transaction does not close, we will be required to bear significant non-recurring costs in connection with the transaction. \nThe announcement and pendency of the combination of our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters could cause disruptions in our business. \nThe completion of the separation of our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business and combination of the business with Waters will require significant amounts of time and effort, which could divert management attention, disrupt the activities of our employees and have negative implications for our relationships with our customers and other third parties. We have already incurred and expect to incur additional costs and expenses in connection with the separation and combination. Until the consummation or termination of the transaction, we are also required to operate the business in the ordinary course and we are restricted from taking certain specified actions with respect to our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business without Waters’ consent. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, result of operations and cash flows. \nWe may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the combination of our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business with Waters. \nIf the separation of our Biosciences and Diagnostic Solutions business and combination of the business with Waters is completed, the anticipated operational, financial, strategic and other benefits of such transaction to us and our shareholders may not be achieved. In addition, we have agreed to provide certain transition services to the combined company, which may result in additional expenses and may divert our focus and resources that would otherwise be invested into maintaining or growing our businesses. An inability to realize tsome or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction, as well as any delays encountered in the process, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, while it is expected that the transaction would be generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes to us and our shareholders, no assurances can be provided that the transaction will qualify for such treatment. If the transaction is ultimately determined to be taxable, this could result in significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities for us and our shareholders. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. \nRisks Relating to the Spin-off of Embecta Corp.\nOn April 1, 2022, we completed the spin-off of Embecta Corp. (“Embecta”) (NASDAQ: EMBC), which holds our former Diabetes Care business. The spin-off is intended to be a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If any facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from BD and Embecta regarding the past and future conduct of their respective businesses and other matters are incorrect or not \n27\nTable of Contents\notherwise satisfied, the spin-off may not qualify for tax-free treatment, which could result in significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities for us and our shareholders.\nGeneral Business Risks\nWe cannot guarantee that any of our strategic acquisitions, investments or alliances will be successful.\nWe seek to supplement our internal growth through strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances. Such transactions are inherently risky, and the integration of any newly-acquired business requires significant effort and management attention. The success of any acquisition, investment or alliance may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to properly assess and value the potential business opportunity or to successfully integrate any business we may acquire into our existing business. There can be no assurance that any past or future transaction will be successful. \nNatural disasters, public health crises, war and other events beyond our control could disrupt our business and adversely affect our future revenues and operating income.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, earthquakes, wildfires, floods and other extreme weather events (including those caused by climate change), war, public health crises (such as pandemics and epidemics), terrorism, social or political unrest, labor disruptions and international conflicts and other events beyond our control, and actions taken by the U.S. and other governments, private health institutions or by our customers or suppliers in response to such events, could cause significant economic disruption and political and social instability in the U.S. and areas outside of the U.S. in which we operate. Such events are inherently unpredictable, and our responses may involve the implementation of measures which may not be successful. These events could have a negative impact on the capital markets or result in decreased demand for our products, adversely affect our manufacturing and distribution capabilities or increase the costs for or cause interruptions in the supply of materials from our suppliers.\n28\nTable of Contents\nInformation About our Executive Officers\nThe following is a list of the executive officers of BD as of September 30, 2025, their ages and all positions and offices held by each of them during the past five years.

Using various tools and techniques, we proactively monitor for suspicious activity and perform risk assessments, penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities. \nWe also engage independent third parties to conduct cybersecurity assessments and attestations, and we collaborate with government and industry leaders, including industry working groups, to gather and share cybersecurity threat intelligence.\n We provide mandatory quarterly cybersecurity awareness training tailored to associates’ and contractors’ role-based responsibilities, and we send phishing simulation emails monthly to all users with a BD email address and an assigned computing device. Where permitted by law, we also use tools to monitor the sharing of personal, confidential and proprietary information to detect intentional or unintentional exfiltration from BD systems. Our cybersecurity risk management program includes a documented incident response and critical incident management plan to identify, assess and manage the potential impact of cybersecurity threats or vulnerabilities and prioritize risk mitigation and/or remediation measures to safeguard BD products, manufacturing and distribution OT, enterprise IT and BD data, including data of our customers.\nWe strive to align BD Information Security policies and procedures with industry best practices, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0, International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 27001:2022 standards for information security, Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”) 2900-1 Cybersecurity Standard for Medical Devices, and U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s pre-market and post-market guidance for cybersecurity in medical devices as required by law under Section 524B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). The Healthcare Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC) Joint Security Plan (JSP) 2.0 is a recognized industry standard that informs how we manage the security of our products. These policies and procedures establish processes for handling data, assets, systems and other technology resources to help protect BD products, manufacturing and distribution OT, enterprise IT and BD data. In 2022, BD achieved ISO/IEC 27001:2022 certification at the enterprise level, demonstrating that BD’s Information Security Management System (ISMS) conforms to internationally recognized cybersecurity standards. In 2025, BD engaged a third-party auditor to complete its third enterprise-level annual surveillance audit for ISO 27001, which determined that BD continues to meet these rigorous standards.\nWe also incorporate cybersecurity risk management into our Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) program. Through our ERM program, we identify, assess and manage a broad range of risks across our businesses, regions and functions, and we align our risk management efforts with our corporate strategy. Our enterprise IT, manufacturing and distribution OT, third-party and product cybersecurity risks are each assessed as part of our ERM program. As part of our cybersecurity risk management program, we engage a range of third-party experts each year, including advisors, consultants and auditors, to evaluate and enhance our program through security attestations and certifications, maturity assessments and security testing. We also engage third parties for staff augmentation to strengthen our cybersecurity program through additional dedicated resources. In addition, we actively engage with intelligence agencies, law enforcement, and advocacy and industry groups.\nWe also identify, assess and manage risks associated with our use of third-party service providers and maintain a third-party risk management program that monitors third-party cybersecurity risk throughout the procurement lifecycle—from planning and sourcing through relationship conclusion. This program includes supplier cybersecurity vetting at onboarding, and cybersecurity risk assessments, remediation, and cyber vulnerability monitoring while in-use, and deeper dive cyber risk assessments and security compliance \n30\nTable of Contents\nmonitoring is in place for our highest-risk suppliers. Our third-party risk management program is assessed for maturity by an independent third party and is aligned with NIST and ISO/IEC frameworks. We remain focused on continuous improvement through intelligence sharing with industry groups.\nThere can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent, mitigate or remediate cybersecurity incidents or breaches. Although we have experienced cyberattacks as discussed in “"
