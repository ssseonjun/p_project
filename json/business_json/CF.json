With our employees focused on safe and reliable operations, environmental stewardship, and disciplined capital and corporate management, we are on a path to decarbonize our ammonia production network – the world’s largest – to enable low-carbon hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement, and other industrial activities. Our manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, an extensive storage, transportation and distribution network in North America, and logistics capabilities enabling a global reach underpin our strategy to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy. Our principal customers are cooperatives, retailers, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, wholesalers and industrial users. Our core product is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which contains 82% nitrogen and 18% hydrogen. Products derived from ammonia that are most often used as nitrogen fertilizers include granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) and ammonium nitrate (AN). AN is also used extensively by the commercial explosives industry as a component of explosives. Products derived from ammonia that are sold primarily to industrial customers include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia. \nOur principal assets as of December 31, 2024 include:\n•\nsix U.S. manufacturing facilities, located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana (the largest ammonia production complex in the world); Sergeant Bluff, Iowa (our Port Neal complex); Yazoo City, Mississippi; Claremore, Oklahoma (our Verdigris complex); Woodward, Oklahoma; and Waggaman, Louisiana. The Waggaman facility is wholly owned by us, and the other five U.S. manufacturing facilities are wholly owned directly or indirectly by CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN), of which we own approximately 89% and CHS Inc. (CHS) owns the remainder (see Note 19—Noncontrolling Interest for additional information on our strategic venture with CHS);\n•\ntwo Canadian manufacturing facilities, located in Medicine Hat, Alberta (the largest ammonia production complex in Canada) and Courtright, Ontario;\n•\na United Kingdom manufacturing facility located in Billingham;\n•\nan extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States; and\n30\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n•\na 50% interest in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited (PLNL), an ammonia production joint venture located in Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad) that we account for under the equity method.\nOur Strategy \nAt our core, CF Industries is a producer of ammonia. We use the Haber-Bosch process to fix atmospheric nitrogen with hydrogen from natural gas to produce anhydrous ammonia, whose chemical composition is NH\n3\n. We sell the ammonia itself or upgrade it to products such as granular urea, UAN and DEF. A majority of the ammonia and ammonia-derived products we manufacture are used as fertilizer, as the nitrogen content provides energy essential for crop growth. Other important uses of our products include emissions control.\nOur strategy is to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy. We believe this strategy builds upon our leadership in ammonia production to capture emerging opportunities to produce ammonia with a lower carbon intensity (“low-carbon ammonia”) than that of ammonia produced through traditional processes. These opportunities include traditional applications in agriculture to help reduce the carbon footprint of food production and the life cycle carbon intensity of ethanol production, enabling production of sustainable aviation fuel, among other purposes. These opportunities also include new growth opportunities from energy-intensive industries, such as power generation and marine shipping, as ammonia represents an efficient mechanism to both ship and store hydrogen, as well as a clean energy fuel source in its own right as ammonia does not contain or emit carbon when combusted. Our strategy also strengthens our existing business.\nWe execute our strategy across four dimensions: \n•\ndecarbonizing our existing network to accelerate the availability of low-carbon ammonia and upgraded nitrogen products for traditional agricultural and industrial applications; \n•\nevaluating new low-carbon ammonia capacity growth to supply emerging opportunities from power generation and marine shipping, among others; \n•\nforging partnerships to accelerate our timeline, reducing risks and bridging gaps in areas where we do not have expertise; and \n•\ncollaborating to build understanding of ammonia’s clean energy capability, safety track record and regulatory environment.\nAt our Donaldsonville and Yazoo City complexes, our decarbonization projects are leveraging carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to enable us to convert a portion of our existing ammonia production to low-carbon ammonia. CCS requires the construction of carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) dehydration and compression units to enable process CO\n2\n captured from the ammonia production process to be transported and sequestered, which prevents approximately 60% of the CO\n2\n generated by ammonia production from being emitted to the atmosphere. Construction of the dehydration and compression unit at our Donaldsonville complex is in advanced stages, with an estimated total cost of approximately $200 million over the life of the project. Construction of the dehydration and compression unit at our Yazoo City complex is expected to cost approximately $100 million over the life of the project. For each facility we have contracted with ExxonMobil to transport and sequester the captured CO\n2 \nin permanent geologic storage. At Donaldsonville, CCS is expected to commence in 2025 and annually will sequester up to approximately 2 million metric tons of CO\n2 \nthat would otherwise have been emitted to the atmosphere. At Yazoo City, CCS is expected to commence in 2028 and annually will sequester up to approximately 500,000 metric tons of CO\n2 \nthat would otherwise have been emitted to the atmosphere.\n \nEach project is expected to qualify under Section 45Q of the Internal Revenue Code for tax credits per metric ton of sequestered CO\n2\n.\nDecarbonization projects in our existing network also include our electrolyzer project at our Donaldsonville complex to produce ammonia with hydrogen sourced from an electrolysis process that produces no CO\n2\n emissions. Commissioning of the 20-megawatt alkaline water electrolysis plant to produce hydrogen was suspended due to an issue experienced in the fourth quarter of 2024. Upon identification and remediation of the issue, we expect to resume commissioning activities. At full electrolyzer capacity, we will be able to produce approximately 20,000 tons of low-carbon ammonia per year.\nOur decarbonization projects also include front-end engineering and design (FEED) studies to inform our evaluation of whether, and how best, to invest in export-oriented, low-carbon ammonia capacity at our Blue Point complex in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, to supply developing clean energy markets and traditional ammonia markets where demand for low-carbon product is emerging. \nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, we received results from a FEED study evaluating the use of autothermal reforming (ATR) ammonia production technology alongside CCS to enable the production of low-carbon ammonia. ATR technology, when combined with CCS to capture and sequester process CO\n2 \nemissions, is expected to reduce CO\n2 \nemissions from the ammonia \n31\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nproduction process by more than 90% compared to conventional ammonia plants. The FEED study results estimate the costs of a project with these attributes to be approximately $4 billion for the approximately 1.4 million metric ton capacity greenfield ATR ammonia facility and CCS technologies. Additionally, we estimate approximately $500 million would be required for the scalable common infrastructure for our Blue Point complex, such as ammonia storage and a vessel loading dock. \nWe have entered into joint development agreements (JDAs) with two potential partners, Mitsui & Co., Ltd. and JERA Co., Inc. for the development of the greenfield low-carbon ammonia capacity. Our evaluation includes assessing whether the ammonia production technology under consideration will satisfy carbon intensity and other requirements for potential end users. Should a positive final investment decision (FID) be reached to construct greenfield low-carbon ammonia capacity at our Blue Point complex, construction and commissioning is expected to take approximately four years from a positive FID. \nIn addition to discussions with existing customers who have interest in using low-carbon ammonia for traditional applications, we are engaged in discussions regarding the supply of low-carbon ammonia for new applications. We are evaluating and are in various stages of discussions with other companies for long-term offtake and/or potential joint investments related to new and traditional applications for low-carbon ammonia. These discussions continue to advance as we gain greater clarity regarding demand for low-carbon ammonia, including associated carbon intensity requirements, government incentives and regulatory developments.  \nIndustry Factors \nWe operate in a highly competitive, global industry. Our operating results are influenced by a broad range of factors, including those outlined below.\nGlobal Supply and Demand Factors\nOur products are global commodities or derived from global commodities and are subject to price competition. The customers for our products make their purchasing decisions principally on the basis of delivered price and, to a lesser extent, on reliability, customer service and product quality. The selling prices of our products fluctuate in response to global market conditions, changes in supply and demand and cost factors.\nHistorically, global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, gross domestic product growth, changes in dietary habits, planted acreage, and application rates, among other things. We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long-term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Short-term fertilizer demand growth may depend on global economic conditions, farm sector income, weather patterns, the level of global grain stocks relative to consumption, fertilizer application rates, and governmental regulations, including fertilizer subsidies or requirements mandating increased use of bio-fuels or industrial nitrogen products, such as DEF. Geopolitical factors such as temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention, shipping delays and/or cost increases resulting from regional conflicts or changes in the buying/selling patterns of key exporting/consuming countries, including China, India, Russia and Brazil, among others, often play a major role in shaping near-term market fundamentals. The economics of nitrogen-based fertilizer manufacturing play a key role in decisions to increase or reduce production capacity. Supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs and availability, government policies and global trade. Raw materials are dependent on energy sources such as natural gas or coal; therefore, supply costs are affected by the supply of and demand for those commodities. \nGlobal Trade in Fertilizer\nProfitability of our products within a particular geographic region is determined not only by the relationship between global supply and demand, but also by the supply/demand balance within that region. Regional supply and demand can be influenced significantly by factors affecting trade within regions. Some of these factors include the relative cost to produce and deliver product, relative currency values, the availability of credit, agricultural supply and demand, industrial product demand and policies such as emissions abatement, government support for manufacturers or purchasers and governmental nitrogen product trade policies, including the imposition of duties, tariffs or quotas, that affect foreign trade or investment. Government energy or carbon policies may also affect regional nitrogen supply and demand. The development of additional natural gas reserves in North America has decreased natural gas costs in North America relative to the rest of the world, making North American nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive. Changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world.\nThe North American nitrogen fertilizer market for certain products is dependent on imports to balance supply and demand, and imports traditionally account for a significant portion of nitrogen fertilizer products consumed in North America. Producers of nitrogen-based fertilizers located in the Middle East, Trinidad, Africa and Russia have been major exporters to North America in recent years. \n32\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nFarmers’ Economics\nThe demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns, crop and fertilizer prices, fertilizer products used and timing of applications, expected yields and the types of crops planted.\nMarket Conditions\nNitrogen Selling Prices and Sales Volume\nOur nitrogen products are globally traded commodities with selling prices that fluctuate in response to global market conditions, changes in supply and demand, and other cost factors including domestic and local conditions. Intense global competition—reflected in import volumes and prices—strongly influences delivered prices for nitrogen fertilizers. In general, the prevailing global prices for nitrogen products must be at a level to incent the high-cost marginal producer to produce product at a breakeven or above price, or else they would cease production and leave a portion of global demand unsatisfied. \nAverage selling prices for all of our major products were lower in 2024 than in 2023, as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. The average selling price for our products was $313 per ton in 2024 compared to $347 per ton in 2023. The 10% decrease in the average selling price for our products in 2024 compared to 2023 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net sales of approximately $716 million. \nOur total sales volume was 1% lower in 2024 than in 2023, due primarily to lower sales volume in our UAN, AN and Other segments, partially offset by higher sales volume in our Ammonia segment as a result of the Waggaman acquisition on December 1, 2023. We shipped 18.9 million tons of product in 2024 compared to 19.1 million tons in 2023.  \nIn January 2024, a winter storm produced extremely cold temperatures that impacted our operations, including the temporary shut-down and lost production at certain of our plants. Due to the impact of plant downtime resulting from the adverse weather and additional plant maintenance activity in the first quarter of 2024, we purchased and resold approximately 62,000 tons of ammonia and 48,000 tons of granular urea at near breakeven margins in order to fulfill sales commitments. The plant downtime led to approximately $75 million of additional costs in the first quarter of 2024 for maintenance, repairs and certain unabsorbed fixed costs.\nThe acquisition of the Waggaman ammonia production facility closed on December 1, 2023, and therefore provided incremental net sales in the first eleven months of 2024. As a result, the Waggaman acquisition increased our 2024 sales volume by 644,000 tons and increased our net sales by $249 million due to the incremental eleven months of ownership compared to 2023.\nSales volume for our products in 2024, 2023 and 2022 is shown in the table below. \n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \nSales Volume (tons)\nNet Sales\nSales Volume (tons)\nNet Sales\nSales Volume (tons)\nNet Sales\n \n(tons in thousands; dollars in millions)\nAmmonia\n4,085 \n$\n1,736 \n3,546 \n$\n1,679 \n3,300 \n$\n3,090 \nGranular Urea\n4,522 \n1,600 \n4,570 \n1,823 \n4,572 \n2,892 \nUAN\n6,771 \n1,678 \n7,237 \n2,068 \n6,788 \n3,572 \nAN\n1,464 \n419 \n1,571 \n497 \n1,594 \n845 \nOther\n(1)\n2,101 \n503 \n2,206 \n564 \n2,077 \n787 \nTotal\n18,943 \n$\n5,936 \n19,130 \n$\n6,631 \n18,331 \n$\n11,186 \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nOther segment products primarily include DEF, urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia.\nNatural Gas \nNatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce our nitrogen products. Natural gas is both a chemical feedstock and a fuel used to produce nitrogen products. Natural gas is a significant cost component of our manufactured nitrogen products, representing approximately 28% and 40%, respectively, of our production costs in 2024 and 2023. Most of our \n33\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nmanufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada. As a result, the price of natural gas in North America directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, warmer-than-normal average temperatures in North America drove lower heating demand for natural gas, in spite of a short-lived period of extremely cold temperatures in January 2024 that affected most of North America. North American natural gas supply remained strong through the quarter, with a decline in supply occurring near the end of the quarter as producers responded to a weaker price environment. In addition, although the higher cost for natural gas outside of North America incentivized liquefaction facilities in the United States to export domestic natural gas during the first quarter of 2024, an outage at the Freeport liquefied natural gas facility limited total gas exports, supporting domestic supply. \nDuring the second quarter of 2024, there was a decline in natural gas supply as producers responded to a weaker price environment, limiting the domestic supply available to be injected into storage during the quarter. In addition, natural gas demand for power generation reached record levels in the second quarter of 2024 as higher-than-normal temperatures drove increased cooling demand. \nIn the third quarter of 2024, the decline in natural gas supply continued as producers curtailed production in response to low natural gas prices. Natural gas demand from the power generation sector set records despite increased solar and wind generation, as low natural gas prices increased demand for gas-fired power. Liquefied natural gas exports were steady through the quarter as delays on commissioning of new facilities and maintenance activities at existing plants held exports at levels reached during the second quarter of 2024. Natural gas in storage remained above historical levels despite continued below-average injections into storage during the third quarter.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, natural gas supply increased as producers responded to higher prices by restarting previously curtailed production. After a warm start to the quarter, December temperatures turned colder-than-normal, raising demand for heat and power generation. Liquefied natural gas exports increased to the highest level of the year due to strong global demand for natural gas and the startup of a new liquefaction facility in the U.S. Gulf. The higher demand decreased the storage surplus compared to historical levels. The average daily market price of natural gas at the Henry Hub, the most heavily-traded natural gas pricing point in North America, was $4.25 per MMBtu for the period from January 1, 2025 through February 14, 2025.\nThe following table presents the average daily market price of natural gas at the Henry Hub for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022: \n \nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 v. 2023\n2023 v. 2022\nAverage daily market price of natural gas Henry Hub (Louisiana)\n$\n2.25 \n$\n2.53 \n$\n6.38 \n$\n(0.28)\n(11)\n%\n$\n(3.85)\n(60)\n%\nThe total cost of natural gas used for production at our manufacturing facilities, which includes the impact of realized natural gas derivatives, decreased 35% to $2.40 per MMBtu in 2024 from $3.67 per MMBtu in 2023. The decrease in natural gas costs in 2024 as compared to 2023 resulted in an increase in gross margin of approximately $436 million, excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition. \nFinancial Executive Summary\nWe reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $1.22 billion in 2024 compared to $1.53 billion in 2023, a decrease in net earnings of 20%, or $307 million. The decrease in net earnings primarily reflects a decrease in gross margin partially offset by a lower income tax provision and a decrease in net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest.\nGross margin decreased by $489 million, or 19%, to $2.06 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $2.55 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a 10% decrease in average selling prices to $313 per ton in 2024 from $347 per ton in 2023, which decreased gross margin by $716 million, excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition, and a decrease in sales volume, which decreased gross margin by $123 million, excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition. These factors that decreased gross margin were partially offset by (i) lower natural gas costs, which increased gross margin by $436 million, excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition, and (ii) the impact of the Waggaman acquisition completed on December 1, 2023, which increased our 2024 gross margin by $57 million due to the incremental eleven months of ownership compared to 2023.\nLower gross margin was partially offset by a decrease in the income tax provision of $125 million due primarily to lower pre-tax earnings in 2024 and a decrease of $54 million in net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest.\n34\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nDiluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased $1.13 per share, to $6.74 per share in 2024 compared to $7.87 per share in 2023 due primarily to lower net earnings, partially offset by lower weighted-average common shares outstanding as a result of shares repurchased under our share repurchase programs. Diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding were 180.7 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2024, a decrease of 7% compared to diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding of 193.8 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2023. \nAcquisition of Waggaman Ammonia Production Facility\nOn December 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana from Dyno Nobel Louisiana Ammonia, LLC (DNLA), a U.S. subsidiary of Australia-based Incitec Pivot Limited (IPL), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with DNLA and IPL. The facility has a nameplate production capacity of 880,000 tons of ammonia annually. Our acquisition of the Waggaman facility expanded our ammonia manufacturing and distribution capacity.\nIn connection with the acquisition, we entered into a long-term ammonia offtake agreement providing for us to supply up to 200,000 tons of ammonia per year to IPL’s Dyno Nobel, Inc. subsidiary. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, $425 million of the purchase price of $1.675 billion, subject to adjustment, was allocated by the parties to the ammonia offtake agreement. We funded the balance of the initial purchase price on the acquisition date with $1.223 billion of cash on hand.\nThe consideration transferred on the acquisition date reflected an estimated net working capital adjustment and other adjustments to the purchase price, which was subject to further adjustment pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement. The purchase price adjustments required under the asset purchase agreement were finalized in the second quarter of 2024, which resulted in a $2 million reduction in the purchase price with a corresponding reduction in goodwill. As a result, the final purchase price was $1.221 billion.\nIn connection with recording the acquisition, we recognized, among other items, goodwill, intangible assets and a supply contract liability. See Note 6—Acquisition of Waggaman Ammonia Production Facility for additional information.\nItems Affecting Comparability of Results\n During the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we reported net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $1.22 billion and $1.53 billion, respectively. In addition to the impact of market conditions and the acquisition of the Waggaman ammonia production facility discussed above, certain items affected the comparability of our financial results during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The following table and related discussion outline these items and their impact on the comparability of our financial results for these periods.

At certain times, we have managed the risk of changes in natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments. The derivatives that we use for this purpose are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps, basis swaps and options. We use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting. This can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives, which are reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. In 2024 and 2023, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives of $35 million and $39 million, respectively.\nImpact of employee benefit plan policy change\nIn 2024, we recognized income of $16 million pertaining to a policy change to an employee benefit plan that is included in both cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations.\nU.K. operations restructuring\nIn 2023, we recognized total charges of $10 million, consisting primarily of the recognition of an asset retirement obligation and post-employment benefits related to contractual and statutory obligations due to employees as a result of our approved plan to permanently close the ammonia plant at our Billingham complex.\nAcquisition and integration costs\nOn December 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, as described above under “Acquisition of Waggaman Ammonia Production Facility.” In 2024, we incurred approximately $4 million of integration costs related to the Waggaman acquisition. In 2023, we incurred $36 million of acquisition-related costs and $3 million of integration costs related to the Waggaman acquisition. These costs are included in acquisition and integration costs in our consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment of equity method investment in PLNL\nPLNL, our joint venture in Trinidad, operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied, under a gas sales contract (the NGC Contract), by The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC). The NGC Contract had an expiration date of September 2023. In the third quarter of 2023, PLNL entered into a new gas sales contract with NGC (the New NGC Contract), which is effective October 2023 through December 2025. \nIn the third quarter of 2023 and due to the terms of the New NGC Contract, we assessed our investment in PLNL for impairment and determined that the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded its fair value. As a result, we recorded an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $43 million, which is reflected in equity in earnings (loss) of operating affiliate in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nCanada Revenue Agency Competent Authority Matter\n \nIn the second half of 2022, as a result of the conclusion of arbitration proceedings and the settlement provisions between the United States and Canadian competent authorities related to tax years 2006 through 2011, we paid additional income taxes and related interest of $124 million and $100 million, respectively, to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and Alberta Tax and Revenue Administration (Alberta TRA). In the third quarter of 2024, we were informed that the CRA granted us discretionary interest relief for certain tax years from 2006 through 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we received the CRA portion of the interest relief consisting of interest refunds of $21 million and related interest of $2 million. The interest relief from the Alberta TRA is estimated to be approximately $16 million, consisting of interest refunds of $15 million and related interest of $1 million, based on current estimates and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2024. As a result, in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $39 million of income consisting of a $36 million reduction in interest expense and $3 million of interest income.\n36\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nThe following table presents our consolidated results of operations and certain supplemental data for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022: \n \nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 v. 2023\n2023 v. 2022\n \n(in millions, except as noted)\nNet sales \n$\n5,936 \n$\n6,631 \n$\n11,186 \n$\n(695)\n(10)\n%\n$\n(4,555)\n(41)\n%\nCost of sales (COS)\n3,880 \n4,086 \n5,325 \n(206)\n(5)\n%\n(1,239)\n(23)\n%\nGross margin\n2,056 \n2,545 \n5,861 \n(489)\n(19)\n%\n(3,316)\n(57)\n%\nGross margin percentage\n34.6 \n%\n38.4 \n%\n52.4 \n%\n(3.8)\n%\n(14.0)\n%\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n320 \n289 \n290 \n31 \n11 \n%\n(1)\n— \n%\nU.K. long-lived and intangible asset impairment\n— \n— \n239 \n— \n— \n%\n(239)\n(100)\n%\nU.K. operations restructuring\n— \n10 \n19 \n(10)\n(100)\n%\n(9)\n(47)\n%\nAcquisition and integration costs\n4 \n39 \n— \n(35)\n(90)\n%\n39 \nN/M\nOther operating—net\n(10)\n(31)\n10 \n21 \n68 \n%\n(41)\nN/M\nTotal other operating costs and expenses\n314 \n307 \n558 \n7 \n2 \n%\n(251)\n(45)\n%\nEquity in earnings (loss) of operating affiliate\n4 \n(8)\n94 \n12 \nN/M\n(102)\nN/M\nOperating earnings\n1,746 \n2,230 \n5,397 \n(484)\n(22)\n%\n(3,167)\n(59)\n%\nInterest expense\n121 \n150 \n344 \n(29)\n(19)\n%\n(194)\n(56)\n%\nInterest income\n(123)\n(158)\n(65)\n35 \n22 \n%\n(93)\n(143)\n%\nLoss on debt extinguishment\n— \n— \n8 \n— \n— \n%\n(8)\n(100)\n%\nOther non-operating—net\n(14)\n(10)\n15 \n(4)\n(40)\n%\n(25)\nN/M\nEarnings before income taxes\n1,762 \n2,248 \n5,095 \n(486)\n(22)\n%\n(2,847)\n(56)\n%\nIncome tax provision \n285 \n410 \n1,158 \n(125)\n(30)\n%\n(748)\n(65)\n%\nNet earnings\n1,477 \n1,838 \n3,937 \n(361)\n(20)\n%\n(2,099)\n(53)\n%\nLess: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest\n259 \n313 \n591 \n(54)\n(17)\n%\n(278)\n(47)\n%\nNet earnings attributable to common stockholders \n$\n1,218 \n$\n1,525 \n$\n3,346 \n$\n(307)\n(20)\n%\n$\n(1,821)\n(54)\n%\nDiluted net earnings per share attributable to common stockholders \n$\n6.74 \n$\n7.87 \n$\n16.38 \n$\n(1.13)\n(14)\n%\n$\n(8.51)\n(52)\n%\nDiluted weighted-average common shares outstanding\n180.7 \n193.8 \n204.2 \n(13.1)\n(7)\n%\n(10.4)\n(5)\n%\nDividends declared per common share\n$\n2.00 \n$\n1.60 \n$\n1.50 \n$\n0.40 \n25 \n%\n$\n0.10 \n7 \n%\nNatural gas supplemental data (per MMBtu)\nNatural gas costs in COS\n(1)\n$\n2.28 \n$\n3.26 \n$\n7.16 \n$\n(0.98)\n(30)\n%\n$\n(3.90)\n(54)\n%\nRealized derivatives loss in COS\n(2)\n0.12 \n0.41 \n0.02 \n(0.29)\n(71)\n%\n0.39 \nN/M\nCost of natural gas used for production in COS\n$\n2.40 \n$\n3.67 \n$\n7.18 \n$\n(1.27)\n(35)\n%\n$\n(3.51)\n(49)\n%\nAverage daily market price of natural gas Henry Hub (Louisiana)\n$\n2.25 \n$\n2.53 \n$\n6.38 \n$\n(0.28)\n(11)\n%\n$\n(3.85)\n(60)\n%\nUnrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives\n$\n(35)\n$\n(39)\n$\n41 \n$\n4 \n10 \n%\n$\n(80)\nN/M\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n925 \n$\n869 \n$\n850 \n$\n56 \n6 \n%\n$\n19 \n2 \n%\nCapital expenditures \n$\n518 \n$\n499 \n$\n453 \n$\n19 \n4 \n%\n$\n46 \n10 \n%\nSales volume by product tons (000s)\n18,943 \n19,130 \n18,331 \n(187)\n(1)\n%\n799 \n4 \n%\nProduction volume by product tons (000s): \nAmmonia\n(3)\n9,800 \n9,496 \n9,807 \n304 \n3 \n%\n(311)\n(3)\n%\nGranular urea\n4,404 \n4,544 \n4,561 \n(140)\n(3)\n%\n(17)\n— \n%\nUAN (32%)\n(4)\n6,753 \n6,852 \n6,706 \n(99)\n(1)\n%\n146 \n2 \n%\nAN\n1,392 \n1,520 \n1,517 \n(128)\n(8)\n%\n3 \n— \n%\n37\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nN/M—Not Meaningful\n(1)\nIncludes the cost of natural gas used for production and related transportation that is included in cost of sales during the period under the first-in, first-out inventory cost method. \n(2)\nIncludes realized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives settled during the period.

For a discussion and analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to the year ended December 31, 2022, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 22, 2024.\nNet Sales\nOur net sales are derived primarily from the sale of nitrogen products and are determined by the quantities of nitrogen products we sell and the selling prices we realize. The volumes, mix and selling prices we realize are determined to a great extent by a combination of global and regional supply and demand factors. Net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers. Sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.\nOur total net sales decreased $695 million, or 10%, to $5.94 billion in 2024 compared to $6.63 billion in 2023. The change in our net sales reflects (i) the impact of the Waggaman acquisition completed on December 1, 2023, which increased our net sales by $249 million, and (ii) a $944 million, or 14%, decline in our net sales excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition, due to a 10% decrease in average selling prices and a 4% decrease in sales volume.\nOur average selling price was $313 per ton in 2024 compared to $347 per ton in 2023, a decrease of 10%, due to lower average selling prices across all of our segments, as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. The impact of lower average selling prices, excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition, was a decrease in net sales of approximately $716 million for 2024 compared to 2023. \nOur total sales volume of 18.9 million product tons in 2024 was 1% lower compared to 19.1 million product tons in 2023, due primarily to lower sales volume in our UAN, AN and Other segments, partially offset by higher sales volume in our Ammonia segment driven by the impact of the Waggaman acquisition, which increased our 2024 sales volume by 644,000 tons due to the incremental eleven months of ownership compared to 2023. Excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition, the impact of lower sales volume was a decrease in net sales of approximately $228 million.\nGross ammonia production for 2024 increased to approximately 9.8 million tons compared to 9.5 million tons in 2023. We expect gross ammonia production for 2025 will be approximately 10 million tons. \nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, purchased product costs, distribution and storage costs, and freight. Manufacturing costs, the most significant element of cost of sales, consist primarily of raw materials, realized and unrealized gains and losses on natural gas derivatives, maintenance, direct labor, depreciation and other plant overhead expenses. Purchased product costs primarily include the cost to purchase nitrogen fertilizers to augment or replace production at our facilities. Distribution costs consist of the cost of freight required to transport finished products from our manufacturing facilities to our distribution facilities, which are recognized in cost of sales when the product is sold to our customers. Storage costs consist of costs incurred prior to final shipment to customers. Freight consists of shipping and handling costs incurred by us to deliver the product to our customer’s intended destination.\nOur total cost of sales decreased $206 million, or 5%, to $3.88 billion in 2024 as compared to $4.09 billion in 2023. The decrease in our cost of sales primarily reflects lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives. The impact of lower realized natural gas costs decreased cost of sales by $436 million, excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition. The impact of lower realized natural gas costs was partially offset by higher costs for planned and unplanned maintenance and repair activities in 2024, including the impact of the adverse weather in January 2024, as discussed above under “Nitrogen Selling Prices and Sales Volume,” and the impact of the Waggaman acquisition, which increased our cost of sales by $192 million due to the incremental eleven months of ownership compared to 2023. \nCost of sales also includes the impact of a $35 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in 2024 compared to a $39 million gain in 2023. \n38\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCost of sales averaged $204 per ton in 2024, a 5% decrease from $214 per ton in 2023. Our cost of natural gas, including the impact of realized derivatives, decreased 35% to $2.40 per MMBtu in 2024 from $3.67 per MMBtu in 2023. \nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate office expenses such as salaries and other payroll-related costs for our executive, administrative, legal, financial, IT, and sales functions, as well as certain taxes and insurance and other professional service fees, including those for corporate initiatives, and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $31 million to $320 million in 2024 compared to $289 million in 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase of $21 million in amortization expense related to the customer relationships recognized in conjunction with the Waggaman acquisition on December 1, 2023, and an increase in costs related to certain corporate initiatives.  \nU.K. Operations Restructuring\nIn 2023, related to our U.K. operations, we recognized total charges of $10 million, consisting primarily of the recognition of an asset retirement obligation and post-employment benefits related to contractual and statutory obligations due to employees as a result of our approved plan to permanently close the ammonia plant at our Billingham complex. See Note 7—United Kingdom Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges for further discussion of the Billingham ammonia plant closure.\nAcquisition and Integration Costs\nOn December 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, as described above under “Acquisition of Waggaman Ammonia Production Facility.” In 2024, we incurred $4 million of integration costs related to the Waggaman acquisition. In 2023, we incurred $36 million of acquisition-related costs and $3 million of integration costs. \nOther Operating—Net\nOther operating—net includes administrative costs that do not relate directly to our central operations and can include foreign currency transaction gains and losses, unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivatives, litigation expenses, gains and losses on the disposal of fixed assets and FEED study costs related to our clean energy initiatives.\nOther operating—net was $10 million of income in 2024 compared to $31 million of income in 2023. In both 2024 and 2023, the income recognized consists primarily of gains on sales of emission credits, partially offset by FEED study costs for our clean energy initiatives. See “Our Strategy,” above, for additional information related to our clean energy initiatives.\nEquity in Earnings (Loss) of Operating Affiliate\nEquity in earnings (loss) of operating affiliate consists of our 50% ownership interest in PLNL. We include our share of the net earnings from our equity method investment in PLNL as an element of earnings from operations because this investment provides additional production and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities. \nEquity in earnings (loss) of operating affiliate was $4 million of earnings in 2024 compared to an $8 million loss in 2023, which includes an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $43 million recognized in the third quarter of 2023. See “Items Affecting Comparability of Results—Impairment of equity method investment in PLNL,” above, for further discussion. Lower equity in earnings of operating affiliate in 2024 compared to 2023, excluding the impact from the impairment charge, primarily reflects a decrease in the operating results of PLNL as a result of a plant turnaround in the second quarter of 2024 at the PLNL facility in Trinidad, lower ammonia selling prices, higher natural gas costs and lower operating rates at PLNL due to lower availability of natural gas.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense includes interest on our long-term debt, amortization of the related fees required to execute financing agreements, annual fees pursuant to our revolving credit agreement and interest on tax liabilities. Capitalized interest relating to the construction of major capital projects reduces interest expense as the interest is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. \nInterest expense was $121 million in 2024 compared to $150 million in 2023. The decrease of $29 million was due primarily to a reduction in interest on tax liabilities driven by a $36 million reduction in interest expense recognized in 2024 related to discretionary interest relief granted to us by Canadian taxing authorities that is further described above under “Items Affecting Comparability of Results—Canada Revenue Agency Competent Authority Matter.” \n39\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nInterest Income\nInterest income includes amounts earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and investments and any interest earned related to income tax refunds.\nInterest income was $123 million in 2024 compared to $158 million in 2023. The decrease of $35 million was due primarily to a $52 million decrease in interest income on short-term investments in 2024, partially offset by $3 million of interest income in 2024 related to discretionary interest relief that is further described above under “Items Affecting Comparability of Results—Canada Revenue Agency Competent Authority Matter.”\nIncome Tax Provision \nOur income tax provision for 2024 was $285 million on pre-tax income of $1.76 billion, or an effective tax rate of 16.2%, compared to an income tax provision of $410 million on pre-tax income of $2.25 billion, or an effective tax rate of 18.3%, in 2023.\nOur effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in CFN, as our consolidated income tax provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Our effective tax rate for 2024 of 16.2%, which is based on pre-tax income of $1.76 billion, would be 2.8 percentage points higher, or 19.0%, if based on pre-tax income exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest of $259 million. Our effective tax rate for 2023 of 18.3%, which is based on pre-tax income of $2.25 billion, would be 2.9 percentage points higher, or 21.2%, if based on pre-tax income exclusive of the earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest of $313 million.\nBoth 2024 and 2023 were impacted by additional discrete tax items. See Note 12—Income Taxes for additional information.\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest\nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest includes the net earnings attributable to the approximately 11% CHS minority equity interest in CFN, a subsidiary of CF Holdings. \nNet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased $54 million, or 17%, to $259 million in 2024 compared to $313 million in 2023 due to lower earnings of CFN driven by lower average selling prices as described above under “Net Sales,” partially offset by lower natural gas costs.\nDiluted Net Earnings Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nNet earnings per share attributable to common stockholders decreased 14% to $6.74 per diluted share in 2024 from $7.87 per diluted share in 2023. This decrease was due primarily to a decrease in gross margin, driven by lower average selling prices, partially offset by lower natural gas costs. Lower gross margin was partially offset by a decrease in the income tax provision resulting from lower profitability and a decrease in net earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest. Additionally, diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding declined 7% from 193.8 million shares for 2023 to 180.7 million shares for 2024, due primarily to repurchases of common shares under our share repurchase programs.\n40\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nOperating Results by Business Segment \n \nOur reportable segment structure reflects how our chief operating decision maker, as defined in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP), assesses the performance of our reportable segments and makes decisions about resource allocation. These segments are differentiated by products. Our management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. Total other operating costs and expenses (consisting primarily of selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating—net) and non-operating expenses (consisting primarily of interest and income taxes), are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management.

The increase in our net sales reflects a 15% increase in sales volume, including the impact of the Waggaman acquisition completed on December 1, 2023, partially offset by a 10% decrease in average selling prices. Average selling prices decreased to $425 per ton in 2024 compared to $473 per ton in 2023 as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. \nIn January 2024, a winter storm produced extremely cold temperatures that impacted our operations, including the temporary shut-down of certain of our plants. As a result of the adverse weather, we incurred additional maintenance costs in the first quarter of 2024. Due to the impact of plant downtime resulting from the adverse weather and additional plant maintenance activity in the first quarter of 2024, we purchased and resold 62,000 tons of ammonia at near breakeven margins in order to fulfill sales commitments.\nAmmonia sales volume in 2024 was 4.1 million tons, an increase of 15% compared to 3.5 million tons in 2023. The increase in sales volume reflects both the impact of the Waggaman acquisition completed on December 1, 2023, which increased our ammonia sales volume in 2024 by 644,000 tons due to the incremental eleven months of ownership compared to 2023, and 62,000 tons of ammonia purchased and resold as described above, partially offset by lower demand due to lower spring ammonia applications in North America compared to the prior year as a result of unfavorable weather.\nCost of Sales.\n  Cost of sales in our Ammonia segment averaged $304 per ton in 2024, a 5% decrease from $320 per ton in 2023. The decrease was due primarily to lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, partially offset by higher costs for maintenance, repairs and certain unabsorbed fixed costs as a result of plant downtime, including the impact of the adverse weather in January 2024 as discussed above. The impact of the Waggaman acquisition on our cost of sales per ton in our Ammonia segment was not material. \n42\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nGross Margin\n.  Gross margin in our Ammonia segment decreased by $48 million, or 9%, to $493 million in 2024 from $541 million in 2023, and our gross margin percentage was 28.4% in 2024 compared to 32.2% in 2023. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a 10% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by $160 million, a net increase in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs, which decreased gross margin by $121 million, and, excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition, a decrease in sales volume, which decreased gross margin by $8 million. These factors that decreased gross margin were partially offset by the impact of a decrease in realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, which increased gross margin by $182 million, and the impact of the Waggaman acquisition, which increased gross margin by $57 million. Gross margin also includes the impact of a $13 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in 2024 compared to an $11 million gain in 2023. \nGranular Urea Segment\nOur Granular Urea segment produces granular urea, which contains 46% nitrogen. Produced from ammonia and carbon dioxide, it has the highest nitrogen content of any of our solid nitrogen fertilizers. Granular urea is produced at our Donaldsonville, Port Neal and Medicine Hat complexes.\nThe following table presents summary operating data for our Granular Urea segment:  \n \nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 v. 2023\n2023 v. 2022\n \n(in millions, except as noted)\nNet sales\n$\n1,600 \n$\n1,823 \n$\n2,892 \n$\n(223)\n(12)\n%\n$\n(1,069)\n(37)\n%\nCost of sales\n926 \n1,010 \n1,328 \n(84)\n(8)\n%\n(318)\n(24)\n%\nGross margin\n$\n674 \n$\n813 \n$\n1,564 \n$\n(139)\n(17)\n%\n$\n(751)\n(48)\n%\nGross margin percentage\n42.1 \n%\n44.6 \n%\n54.1 \n%\n(2.5)\n%\n(9.5)\n%\nSales volume by product tons (000s)\n4,522 \n4,570 \n4,572 \n(48)\n(1)\n%\n(2)\n— \n%\nSales volume by nutrient tons (000s)\n(1)\n2,080 \n2,102 \n2,103 \n(22)\n(1)\n%\n(1)\n— \n%\nAverage selling price per product ton\n$\n354 \n$\n399 \n$\n633 \n$\n(45)\n(11)\n%\n$\n(234)\n(37)\n%\nAverage selling price per nutrient ton\n(1)\n$\n769 \n$\n867 \n$\n1,375 \n$\n(98)\n(11)\n%\n$\n(508)\n(37)\n%\nGross margin per product ton\n$\n149 \n$\n178 \n$\n342 \n$\n(29)\n(16)\n%\n$\n(164)\n(48)\n%\nGross margin per nutrient ton\n(1)\n$\n324 \n$\n387 \n$\n744 \n$\n(63)\n(16)\n%\n$\n(357)\n(48)\n%\nDepreciation and amortization\n$\n284 \n$\n285 \n$\n272 \n$\n(1)\n— \n%\n$\n13 \n5 \n%\nUnrealized net mark-to-market (gain) loss on natural gas derivatives\n$\n(9)\n$\n(11)\n$\n13 \n$\n2 \n18 \n%\n$\n(24)\nN/M\n______________________________________________________________________________\nN/M—Not Meaningful\n(1)\nGranular urea represents 46% nitrogen content.

Average selling prices decreased to $354 per ton in 2024 compared to $399 per ton in 2023 as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. Sales volume in 2024 was 4.5 million tons, a decrease of 1% compared to 4.6 million tons in 2023. Lower sales volume in the first quarter of 2024, which was due primarily to a reduction in ammonia available for upgrade and lower supply availability from the impact of severe weather that caused urea plant outages, was largely offset by higher sales volume in the second and third quarters of 2024 due primarily to a production mix that favored granular urea production. Sales volume in 2024 includes the impact of 48,000 tons of granular urea purchased and resold in the first quarter of 2024 due to the impact of the severe weather described above.\nCost of Sales.\n  Cost of sales in our Granular Urea segment averaged $205 per ton in 2024, a 7% decrease from $221 per ton in 2023, due primarily to lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, partially offset by higher costs associated with maintenance activity in 2024. \nGross Margin\n.  Gross margin in our Granular Urea segment decreased by $139 million, or 17%, to $674 million in 2024 from $813 million in 2023, and our gross margin percentage was 42.1% in 2024 compared to 44.6% in 2023. The \n43\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\ndecrease in gross margin was driven by an 11% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by approximately $185 million, a net increase in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs, which decreased gross margin by $37 million, and a 1% decrease in sales volume, which decreased gross margin by $21 million. These factors that decreased gross margin were partially offset by lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, which increased gross margin by $106 million. Gross margin also includes the impact of a $9 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in 2024 compared to an $11 million gain in 2023.\nUAN Segment\nOur UAN segment produces urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN). UAN, a liquid fertilizer product with a nitrogen content that typically ranges from 28% to 32%, is produced by combining urea and ammonium nitrate.

Average selling prices decreased to $248 per ton in 2024 compared to $286 per ton in 2023 due primarily to lower global energy costs reducing the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. The decrease in sales volume was due primarily to lower supply availability resulting from lower beginning inventory entering 2024 and the impact of a production mix that favored granular urea production. \nCost of Sales.\n  Cost of sales in our UAN segment averaged $158 per ton in 2024, a 9% decrease from $173 per ton in 2023, due primarily to the impact of lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives.\nGross Margin.\n  Gross margin in our UAN segment decreased by $208 million, or 25%, to $609 million in 2024 from $817 million in 2023, and our gross margin percentage was 36.3% in 2024 compared to 39.5% in 2023. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a 13% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by $274 million, and a 6% decrease in sales volume, which decreased gross margin by $57 million. These factors that decreased gross margin were partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, which increased gross margin by $113 million, and a net decrease in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs, which increased gross margin by $11 million. Gross margin also includes the impact of a $10 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in 2024 compared to an $11 million gain in 2023. \n44\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nAN Segment\nOur AN segment produces ammonium nitrate (AN).

Average selling prices decreased to $286 per ton in 2024 compared to $316 per ton in 2023 as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. Sales volume declined due primarily to lower supply availability resulting from lower production in 2024.\nCost of Sales.  \nCost of sales in our AN segment averaged $232 per ton in 2024, a 2% increase from $228 per ton in 2023. The increase was due primarily to higher costs for maintenance activity in North America, which was partially offset by the impact of lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, and, for our United Kingdom operations, a lower cost per ton for purchased ammonia used for upgrading into AN. \nGross Margin\n.  Gross margin in our AN segment decreased by $59 million, or 43%, to $79 million in 2024 from $138 million in 2023, and our gross margin percentage was 18.9% in 2024 compared to 27.8% in 2023. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a 9% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by $65 million, and a 7% decrease in sales volume, which decreased gross margin by $14 million. These factors that decreased gross margin were partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, which increased gross margin by $12 million, and a net decrease in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs, which increased gross margin by $9 million. The net decrease in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs primarily reflects lower costs for purchased ammonia in the United Kingdom, partially offset by higher costs for maintenance activity in North America.

Average selling prices decreased to $239 per ton in 2024 compared to $256 per ton in 2023 as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand. The decrease in sales volume was due primarily to lower DEF sales volume, partially offset by higher nitric acid sales volume.\nCost of Sales.\n  Cost of sales in our Other segment averaged $143 per ton in 2024, a 4% decrease from $149 per ton in 2023, due primarily to the impact of lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, partially offset by higher costs for maintenance activity.\nGross Margin\n.  Gross margin in our Other segment decreased by $35 million, or 15%, to $201 million in 2024 from $236 million in 2023, and our gross margin percentage was 40.0% in 2024 compared to 41.8% in 2023. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a 7% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by $32 million, a 5% decrease in sales volume, which decreased gross margin by $23 million, and a net increase in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs, which decreased gross margin by $1 million. These factors that decreased gross margin were partially offset by a decrease in realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, which increased gross margin by $23 million. Gross margin includes the impact of a $2 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in 2024 compared to a $4 million gain in 2023.\n46\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary uses of cash are generally for operating costs, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, investments, taxes, share repurchases, dividends, and our clean energy initiatives. Our working capital requirements are affected by several factors, including demand for our products, selling prices, raw material costs, freight costs and seasonal factors inherent in the business. We may also utilize our cash to fund acquisitions. In addition, we may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases, in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nGenerally, our primary source of cash is cash from operations, which includes cash generated by customer advances. We may also from time to time access the capital markets or engage in borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.  \nAs of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.61 billion, a decrease of $418 million from $2.03 billion at December 31, 2023. At December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenant requirements under our revolving credit agreement and senior notes, and unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement was $750 million. \nIn each of the quarters of 2024, quarterly dividends of $0.50 per common share were declared and paid, representing a 25% increase from the quarterly dividends of $0.40 per common share that were declared and paid in each of the quarters of 2023.\nCash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of three months or less. Under our short-term investment policy, we may invest our cash balances, either directly or through mutual funds, in several types of investment-grade securities, including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations. Securities issued by governmental entities include those issued directly by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments; those issued by state, local or other governmental entities; and those guaranteed by entities affiliated with governmental entities.\nCapital Spending \nWe make capital expenditures to sustain our asset base, increase our capacity or capabilities, improve plant efficiency, comply with various environmental, health and safety requirements, and invest in our clean energy strategy. Capital expenditures totaled $518 million in 2024 compared to $499 million in 2023. \nCapital expenditures in 2025 are estimated to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million. Planned capital expenditures are generally subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, delays in the receipt of equipment, adverse weather, defects in materials and workmanship, labor or material shortages, transportation constraints, acceleration or delays in the timing of the work and other unforeseen difficulties. Any of these changes in planned capital expenditures, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our decarbonization projects include FEED studies to inform our evaluation of whether, and how best, to invest in an export-oriented, low-carbon ammonia capacity at our Blue Point complex in Ascension Parish, Louisiana, to supply developing energy markets and traditional ammonia markets where demand for low-carbon product is emerging. Our estimated capital expenditures for 2025, which are described above, exclude any amounts that would be required in connection with this project, and such amounts could be significant. See “Overview of CF Holdings—Our Strategy,” above, for additional information on our clean energy initiatives.\nAcquisition of Waggaman Ammonia Production Facility\nOn December 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana from Dyno Nobel Louisiana Ammonia, LLC (DNLA), a U.S. subsidiary of Australia-based Incitec Pivot Limited (IPL), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with DNLA and IPL. In connection with the acquisition, we entered into a long-term ammonia offtake agreement providing for us to supply up to 200,000 tons of ammonia per year to IPL’s Dyno Nobel, Inc. subsidiary. Under the terms of the asset purchase agreement, $425 million of the purchase price of $1.675 billion, subject to adjustment, was allocated by the parties to the ammonia offtake agreement. We funded the balance of the initial purchase price on the acquisition date with $1.223 billion of cash on hand. \n47\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe consideration transferred on the acquisition date reflected an estimated net working capital adjustment and other adjustments to the purchase price, which was subject to further adjustment pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement. The purchase price adjustments required under the asset purchase agreement were finalized in the second quarter of 2024, which resulted in a $2 million reduction in the purchase price. As a result, the final purchase price was $1.221 billion.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nOn November 3, 2021, our Board of Directors (the Board) authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of CF Holdings common stock through December 31, 2024 (the 2021 Share Repurchase Program). The 2021 Share Repurchase Program was completed in the second quarter of 2023. On November 2, 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of CF Holdings common stock commencing upon completion of the 2021 Share Repurchase Program and effective through December 31, 2025 (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program). Repurchases under our share repurchase programs may be made from time to time in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, through block transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, or otherwise. The manner, timing and amount of repurchases will be determined by our management based on the evaluation of market conditions, stock price, and other factors. \nThe following table summarizes the share repurchases under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program.\nShares\nAmounts\n(1)\n(in millions)\nShares repurchased in 2023:\nSecond quarter\n0.8 \n$\n50 \nThird quarter\n1.9 \n150 \nFourth quarter\n2.9 \n225 \nTotal shares repurchased in 2023\n5.6 \n$\n425 \nShares repurchased in 2024:\nFirst quarter\n4.3 \n$\n347 \nSecond quarter\n4.0 \n305 \nThird quarter\n6.1 \n476 \nFourth quarter\n4.4 \n385 \nTotal shares repurchased in 2024\n18.8 \n$\n1,513 \nShares repurchased as of December 31, 2024\n24.4 \n$\n1,938 \n______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nAs defined in the 2022 Share Repurchase Program, amounts reflect the price paid for the shares of common stock repurchased, excluding commissions paid to brokers and excise taxes.\n In 2024, we repurchased approximately 18.8 million shares under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program for approximately $1.51 billion, of which $10 million was accrued and unpaid as of December 31, 2024. In 2024, we retired approximately 18.7 million shares of repurchased stock, and we held approximately 0.4 million shares of treasury stock as of December 31, 2024.\nIn 2023, we completed the 2021 Share Repurchase Program with the repurchase of approximately 2.3 million shares for $155 million, and we repurchased 5.6 million shares under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program for $425 million.\nGovernment Policies\nThe policies or laws of governments around the world can result in the imposition of taxes, duties, tariffs or other restrictions or regulatory requirements on imports and exports of raw materials, finished goods or services from a particular country or region of the world. The policies and laws of governments can also impact the subsidization of natural gas prices, and subsidies or quotas applied to domestic producers or farmers. Due to the critical role that fertilizers play in food production, the construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic, political and social objectives. Additionally, the import or export of fertilizer can be subject to local taxes imposed by governments which can have the effect of either encouraging or discouraging import and export activity. The impact of changes in governmental policies or laws or the political or social objectives of a country could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices and therefore could impact our liquidity. In addition, changing political leadership, including the new U.S. presidential administration and regulatory leadership, have proposed, and may propose further, policy, regulatory, and enforcement changes, which are and may continue to be subject to administrative and judicial challenges, that create additional uncertainty for our business.\n48\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCanada Revenue Agency Competent Authority Matter\nIn connection with the matter described above under “Items Affecting Comparability of Results—Canada Revenue Agency Competent Authority Matter,” in the third quarter of 2024, we were informed that the CRA granted us discretionary interest relief for certain tax years from 2006 through 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we received interest relief from the CRA consisting of interest refunds of $21 million and related interest of $2 million. In addition, interest relief from the Alberta TRA is estimated to be approximately $16 million, consisting of interest refunds of $15 million and related interest of $1 million, based on current estimates and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2024. We expect to receive the interest refunds from the Alberta TRA in the first half of 2025.\nRepatriation of Foreign Earnings and Income Taxes \nWe have operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and a 50% interest in a joint venture in Trinidad. Historically, the estimated additional U.S. and foreign income taxes due upon repatriation of the earnings of these foreign operations to the United States were recognized in our consolidated financial statements as the earnings were recognized, unless the earnings were considered to be permanently reinvested based upon our then current plans. However, the cash payment of the income tax liabilities associated with repatriation of earnings from foreign operations occurred at the time of the repatriation. As a result, the recognition of income tax expense related to foreign earnings, as applicable, and the payment of taxes resulting from repatriation of those earnings could occur in different periods. \nIn light of changes made by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, commencing with the 2018 tax year, the United States no longer taxes earnings of foreign subsidiaries even when such earnings are earned or repatriated to the United States, unless such earnings are subject to U.S. rules on passive income or certain anti-abuse provisions. Foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the United States.\nCash balances held by our joint venture are maintained at sufficient levels to fund local operations as accumulated earnings are repatriated from the joint venture on a periodic basis.\nAs of December 31, 2024, approximately $346 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of $1.61 billion was held by our Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded a deferred tax liability of $14 million on the undistributed earnings of our Canadian subsidiaries for which the Company does not have an indefinite reinvestment assertion. We have not provided for deferred taxes on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings would not give rise to additional tax liabilities upon repatriation.\nDebt\nRevolving Credit Agreement \nWe have a senior unsecured revolving credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement), which provides for a revolving credit facility of up to $750 million with a maturity of October 26, 2028 and includes a letter of credit sub-limit of $125 million. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes. CF Industries is the lead borrower, and CF Holdings is the sole guarantor, under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement can be denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros and British pounds. Borrowings in U.S. dollars bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at our option, an applicable adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate or base rate plus, in either case, a specified margin. We are required to pay an undrawn commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement and customary letter of credit fees. The specified margin and the amount of the commitment fee depend on CF Holdings’ credit rating at the time.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including one financial covenant. The financial covenant requires that the total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) be not greater than 3.75:1.00 (the Maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio) as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, provided that, if any borrower or subsidiary consummates a material acquisition during any fiscal quarter, CF Industries may elect to increase the Maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio to 4.25:1.00 for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters commencing with such fiscal quarter (and no further such election may be made unless and until the Maximum Total Net Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 3.75:1.00 as of the end of two consecutive fiscal quarters after the end of such period).\nAs of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement. \n49\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains events of default (with notice requirements and cure periods, as applicable) customary for a financing of this type, including, but not limited to, non-payment of principal, interest or fees; inaccuracy of representations and warranties in any material respect; and failure to comply with specified covenants. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default under the Revolving Credit Agreement and after any applicable cure period, subject to specified exceptions, the administrative agent may, and at the request of the requisite lenders is required to, accelerate the loans under the Revolving Credit Agreement or terminate the lenders’ commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had unused borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement of $750 million and no outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and during the years then ended, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. \nLetters of Credit Under Bilateral Agreement\nWe are party to a bilateral agreement providing for the issuance of up to $425 million of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $324 million of letters of credit were outstanding under this agreement.\nSenior Notes\nLong-term debt presented on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 consisted of the following debt securities issued by CF Industries:  \n \nEffective Interest Rate\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nPrincipal Outstanding\nCarrying Amount\n(1)\nPrincipal Outstanding\nCarrying Amount\n(1)\n \n(in millions)\nPublic Senior Notes:\n5.150% due March 2034\n5.293%\n$\n750 \n$\n742 \n$\n750 \n$\n741 \n4.950% due June 2043\n5.040%\n750 \n742 \n750 \n742 \n5.375% due March 2044\n5.478%\n750 \n741 \n750 \n741 \nSenior Secured Notes:\n4.500% due December 2026\n(2)\n4.783%\n750 \n746 \n750 \n744 \nTotal long-term debt\n$\n3,000 \n$\n2,971 \n$\n3,000 \n$\n2,968 \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nCarrying amount is net of unamortized debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs. Total unamortized debt discount was $6 million and $7 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and total deferred debt issuance costs were $23 million and $25 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.    \n(2)\nEffective August 23, 2021, these notes are no longer secured, in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture.\nPublic Senior Notes\nUnder the indentures (including the applicable supplemental indentures) governing our senior notes due 2034, 2043 and 2044 identified in the table above (the Public Senior Notes), each series of Public Senior Notes is guaranteed by CF Holdings. Interest on the Public Senior Notes is payable semiannually, and the Public Senior Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices. \nThe indentures governing the Public Senior Notes contain covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, to incur liens on certain assets to secure debt, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions, to merge or consolidate with other entities and to sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity. Each of the indentures governing the Public Senior Notes provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest on the applicable Public Senior Notes; failure to comply with other covenants or agreements under the indenture; certain defaults on other indebtedness; the failure of CF Holdings’ guarantee of the applicable Public Senior Notes to be enforceable; and specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Under each indenture governing the Public Senior Notes, in the case of an event of default arising from one of the specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the applicable Public Senior Notes would become due and payable immediately, and, in the case of any other event of default (other than an event of default related to CF Industries’ and CF Holdings’ reporting obligations), the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the applicable Public Senior Notes then outstanding may declare all of such Public Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately.\n50\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nUnder each of the indentures governing the Public Senior Notes, specified changes of control involving CF Holdings or CF Industries, when accompanied by a ratings downgrade, as defined with respect to the applicable series of Public Senior Notes, constitute change of control repurchase events. Upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event with respect to a series of Public Senior Notes, unless CF Industries has exercised its option to redeem such Public Senior Notes, CF Industries will be required to offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase.\nSenior Secured Notes\nUnder the terms of the indenture governing the 4.500% senior secured notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes), the 2026 Notes are guaranteed by CF Holdings. Interest on the 2026 Notes is payable semiannually, and the 2026 Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices.\nUnder the indenture governing the 2026 Notes, specified changes of control involving CF Holdings or CF Industries, when accompanied by a ratings downgrade, as defined with respect to the 2026 Notes, constitute change of control repurchase events. Upon the occurrence of a change of control repurchase event with respect to the 2026 Notes, unless CF Industries has exercised its option to redeem such notes, CF Industries will be required to offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase.\nThe indenture governing the 2026 Notes contains covenants that limit, among other things, the ability of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries, including CF Industries, to incur liens on certain assets to secure debt, to engage in sale and leaseback transactions, to merge or consolidate with other entities and to sell, lease or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of CF Holdings and its subsidiaries to another entity. The indenture governing the 2026 Notes provides for customary events of default, which include (subject in certain cases to customary grace and cure periods), among others, nonpayment of principal or interest of the 2026 Notes; failure to comply with other covenants or agreements under the indenture; certain defaults on other indebtedness; the failure of CF Holdings’ guarantee of the 2026 Notes to be enforceable; and specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency. Under the indenture governing the 2026 Notes, in the case of an event of default arising from one of the specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, the 2026 Notes would become due and payable immediately, and, in the case of any other event of default (other than an event of default related to CF Industries’ and CF Holdings’ reporting obligations), the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes then outstanding may declare all of such notes to be due and payable immediately.\nForward Sales and Customer Advances\nWe offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose. Therefore, our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices and margins available at the time of shipment.  \nCustomer advances, which typically represent a portion of the contract’s value, are received shortly after the contract is executed, with any remaining unpaid amount generally being collected by the time control transfers to the customer, thereby reducing or eliminating the accounts receivable related to such sales. Any cash payments received in advance from customers in connection with forward sales contracts are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets as a current liability until control transfers and revenue is recognized. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $118 million and $130 million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWhile customer advances are generally a significant source of liquidity, the level of forward sales contracts is affected by many factors, including current market conditions, our customers’ outlook of future market fundamentals and seasonality. During periods of declining prices, customers tend to delay purchasing fertilizer in anticipation that prices in the future will be lower than the current prices. If the level of sales under our forward sales programs were to decrease in the future, our cash received from customer advances would likely decrease and our accounts receivable balances would likely increase. Additionally, borrowing under the Revolving Credit Agreement could become necessary. Due to the volatility inherent in our business and changing customer expectations, we cannot estimate the amount of future forward sales activity.\nUnder our forward sales programs, a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors. These delays generally subject the customer to potential charges for storage or may be grounds for termination of the contract by us. Such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customer’s inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales.\n51\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nNatural Gas\nNatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce our nitrogen products. We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN and other products. Expenditures on natural gas are a significant portion of our production costs, representing approximately 28% of our total production costs in 2024. As a result of these factors, natural gas prices have a significant impact on our operating expenses and can thus affect our liquidity. Natural gas costs in our cost of sales, including the impact of realized natural gas derivatives, decreased 35% to $2.40 per MMBtu in 2024 from $3.67 per MMBtu in 2023. \nWe enter into agreements for a portion of our future natural gas supply and related transportation. As of December 31, 2024, our natural gas purchase agreements have remaining terms that range from five months to five years and a total minimum commitment of approximately $2.64 billion, and our natural gas transportation agreements have terms that range from one to eight years and a total minimum commitment of approximately $62 million. Our minimum commitments to purchase and transport natural gas are based on prevailing market-based forward prices excluding reductions for plant maintenance and turnaround activities.  \nMost of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities are located in the United States and Canada. As a result, the price of natural gas in North America directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the daily closing price at the Henry Hub, the most heavily-traded natural gas pricing point in North America, reached a low of $1.23 per MMBtu on four consecutive days in November 2024 and a high of $12.97 per MMBtu on four consecutive days in January 2024.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas that will be purchased in the future. Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products. From time to time, we may also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Volatility in reported quarterly earnings can result from the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments in the value of the derivatives. In 2024 and 2023, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives of $35 million and $39 million, respectively, which is reflected in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDerivatives expose us to counterparties and the risks associated with their ability to meet the terms of the contracts. For derivatives that are in net asset positions, we are exposed to credit loss from nonperformance by the counterparties. We control our credit risk through the use of multiple counterparties that are multinational commercial banks, other major financial institutions or large energy companies, and the use of International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) master netting arrangements. The ISDA agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for over-the-counter derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk, in part, by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff, the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement.\nThe ISDA agreements for most of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as cross default provisions. In the event of certain defaults or termination events, our counterparties may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in net liability positions was zero and $34 million, respectively, which also approximates the fair value of the assets that may be needed to settle the obligations if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our open natural gas derivative contracts consisted of natural gas fixed price swaps and basis swaps for 16.0 million MMBtus. As of December 31, 2023, our open natural gas derivative contracts consisted of natural gas fixed price swaps, basis swaps and options for 49.0 million MMBtus. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts. The credit support documents executed in connection with certain of our ISDA agreements generally provide us and our counterparties the right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the ISDA agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified termination event.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nWe made cash contributions of $22 million to our pension plans in 2024. We expect to contribute approximately $6 million in total to our U.S. and U.K. pension plans in 2025, and, as currently agreed with the plans’ trustees, approximately $13 million to our U.K. pension plans in 2026.\n52\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nDistributions to Noncontrolling Interest in CFN \nThe CFN Board of Managers approved semi-annual distribution payments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, in accordance with CFN’s limited liability company agreement, as follows:  \nApproved and paid\nDistribution Period\nDistribution Amount \n(in millions)\nFirst quarter of 2025\nSix months ended December 31, 2024\n$\n129 \nThird quarter of 2024\nSix months ended June 30, 2024\n164 \nFirst quarter of 2024\nSix months ended December 31, 2023\n144 \nThird quarter of 2023\nSix months ended June 30, 2023\n204 \nFirst quarter of 2023\nSix months ended December 31, 2022\n255 \nThird quarter of 2022\nSix months ended June 30, 2022\n372 \nCash Flows\nNet cash provided by operating activities in 2024 was $2.27 billion, a decrease of $486 million compared to $2.76 billion in 2023. The decrease in cash flow from operations was due primarily to lower net earnings. Net earnings in 2024 was $1.48 billion, a decrease of $361 million compared to $1.84 billion in 2023. The decrease in net earnings was due primarily to a decrease in gross margin, driven by lower average selling prices, partially offset by lower natural gas costs, a lower income tax provision and a decrease in net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest. During 2024, net changes in working capital also impacted cash flow from operations by contributing $63 million more toward net cash from operations in 2024 than in 2023. These changes primarily occurred in changes in accounts payable, accrued expenses and customer advances, partially offset by changes in inventories.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $469 million in 2024 compared to $1.68 billion in 2023, or a decrease of $1.21 billion. The decrease was due primarily to the consideration paid of $1.223 billion for the Waggaman acquisition in 2023. See “Acquisition of Waggaman Ammonia Production Facility,” above for additional information. During 2024, capital expenditures totaled $518 million compared to $499 million in 2023. \nNet cash used in financing activities was $2.21 billion in 2024 compared to $1.37 billion in 2023. The increase was due primarily to an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid, partially offset by a decrease in distributions to the noncontrolling interest. In 2024, we paid $1.51 billion for share repurchases compared to $580 million for share repurchases in 2023. In 2024, dividends paid on common stock were $364 million compared to $311 million in 2023. The increase in dividends paid on common stock reflects quarterly dividends of $0.50 per common share declared and paid in 2024, compared to quarterly dividends of $0.40 per common share that were declared and paid in 2023. In 2024, distributions to the noncontrolling interest were $308 million compared to $459 million in 2023 due to lower earnings of CFN. \nCritical Accounting Estimates \nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. U.S. GAAP requires that we select policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate. The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting estimates.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliate\nWe review the carrying values of our property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets, including our finite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate in accordance with U.S. GAAP in order to assess recoverability. Factors that we must estimate when performing impairment tests include production and sales volumes, selling prices, raw material costs, operating rates, operating expenses, inflation, discount rates, exchange rates, tax rates, capital spending and the impact that future market dynamics and geopolitical events could have on these factors. Judgment is involved in estimating each of these factors, which include inherent uncertainties. The factors we use are consistent with those used in our internal planning process. The recoverability of the values associated with our goodwill, long-lived assets and our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is dependent upon future operating performance of the specific businesses to which \n53\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nthey are attributed. Certain of the operating assumptions are particularly sensitive to the cyclical nature of the fertilizer industry. Adverse changes in demand for our products, increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review. \nThe recoverability and impairment tests of long-lived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. For goodwill, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate is reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that its carrying value may not be recoverable. When circumstances indicate that the fair value of our investment is less than its carrying value, and the reduction in value is other than temporary, the reduction in value would be recognized immediately in earnings.\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter at the reporting unit level. Our evaluation generally begins with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value. If after performing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then no further analysis is necessary. However, if it is unclear based on the results of the qualitative test, we perform a quantitative test, which involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. We use an income-based valuation method, determining the present value of future cash flows, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further testing is necessary. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill impairment would be recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nWe review property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets at the asset group level in order to assess recoverability based on expected future undiscounted cash flows. If the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived assets.\nPLNL is our joint venture investment in Trinidad and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied, under a gas sales contract, by the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC). The joint venture is accounted for under the equity method. The joint venture experienced past curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which reduced the ammonia production at PLNL. The prior gas sales contract had an expiration date of September 2023. In the third quarter of 2023, PLNL entered into a new gas sales contract with NGC (the New NGC Contract), which is effective October 2023 through December 2025. In the third quarter of 2023 and due to the terms of the New NGC Contract, we assessed our investment in PLNL for impairment and determined that the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded its fair value. As a result, we recorded an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $43 million, which is reflected in equity in earnings (loss) of operating affiliate in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nAny NGC commitment to supply gas beyond December 2025 will be based on new agreements. If NGC does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to PLNL at prices that permit profitable operations, PLNL may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in PLNL. The carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL at December 31, 2024 was $29 million. \nProjected Benefit Obligations\nThe projected benefit obligations (PBOs) for our defined benefit pension plans are affected by plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates. Key assumptions that affect our PBO are discount rates and, in addition for our United Kingdom plans, inflation rates, including an adjusted U.K. retail price index (RPI).  \nThe December 31, 2024 PBO was computed based on a weighted-average discount rate of 5.2% for our North America plans and 5.5% for our United Kingdom plans, which were based on yields for high-quality (AA rated or better) fixed income debt securities that match the timing and amounts of expected benefit payments as of the measurement date of December 31, 2024. Declines in comparable bond yields would increase our PBO. For our United Kingdom plans, the 3.1% RPI used to calculate our PBO is developed using a U.K. government gilt prices only retail price inflation curve, which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and index-linked government bonds.\nFor North America qualified pension plans, our PBO was $278 million as of December 31, 2024, which was $21 million lower than pension plan assets. For our United Kingdom pension plans, our PBO was $317 million as of December 31, 2024, which was $28 million lower than pension plan assets. The table below estimates the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our December 31, 2024 PBO: \n54\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nIncrease/(Decrease) in December 31, 2024 PBO\nNorth America Plans\nUnited Kingdom Plans\nAssumption\n+50 bps\n-50 bps\n+50 bps\n-50 bps\n(in millions)\nDiscount Rate\n$\n(15)\n$\n17 \n$\n(16)\n$\n17 \nRPI\nn/a\nn/a\n9 \n(9)\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nn/a—not applicable\nSee Note 13—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits for further discussion of our pension plans.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to the income tax laws of the many jurisdictions in which we operate, and we recognize expense, assets and liabilities based on estimates of amounts that ultimately will be determined to be taxable or deductible in tax returns filed in various jurisdictions. These tax laws are complex, and how they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold but are not highly certain are measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authority. Differences in interpretation of the tax laws and regulations, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state and international tax audits, can result in differences in taxes paid, which may be higher or lower than our estimates. The judgments made at a point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to, or further interpretations of, tax laws and regulations, and these changes could significantly impact the provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable and the deferred tax asset and liability balances. We adjust our income tax provision in the period in which these changes occur. As of December 31, 2024, we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, of $285 million.\nWe also engage in a significant amount of cross border transactions. The taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators across the globe, including the jurisdictions in which we operate. The tax rules and regulations of the various jurisdictions in which we operate are complex, and in many cases, there is not symmetry between the rules of the various jurisdictions. As a result, there are instances where regulators within the jurisdictions involved in a cross-border transaction may reach different conclusions regarding the taxability of the transaction in their respective jurisdictions based on the same set of facts and circumstances. We work closely with regulators to reach a common understanding and conclusion regarding the taxability of cross border transactions. \nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3—New Accounting Standards for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\n55\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. \nOur business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\nTo manage such risks, we may, from time to time, utilize derivatives that enable us to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk. Our use of derivatives can result in volatility in reported earnings due to the unrealized mark-to-market adjustments that occur from changes in the value of the derivatives to which we do not apply hedge accounting. To the extent that our derivative positions lose value, our counterparties may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or, under certain ISDA agreements, may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position, adversely affecting our liquidity.\nCommodity Prices\nOur gross margin, cash flows and estimates of future cash flows related to nitrogen-based products are sensitive not only to selling prices of our products, but also to changes in market prices of natural gas and other raw materials. A $1.00 per MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia, granular urea, UAN (assuming a 32% nitrogen content) and AN by approximately $33, $22, $14 and $16, respectively.\nNatural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products. From time to time, we utilize natural gas derivatives to hedge our financial exposure to the price volatility of natural gas, the principal raw material we use in the production of nitrogen-based products. We may use natural gas futures, swaps and option contracts traded in over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. These derivatives settle using primarily a NYMEX futures price index, which represents the basis for fair value at any given time. The contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods. As of December 31, 2024, we had natural gas derivative contracts covering certain periods through March 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 16.0 million MMBtus and 49.0 million MMBtus, respectively. A $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas at December 31, 2024 would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of approximately $14 million, and a $1.00 per MMBtu decrease in the forward curve prices of natural gas would change their fair value unfavorably by approximately $14 million.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may purchase nitrogen products on the open market to augment or replace production at our facilities.\nInterest Rates\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had four series of senior notes totaling $3.00 billion of principal outstanding with maturity dates of December 1, 2026, March 15, 2034, June 1, 2043 and March 15, 2044. The senior notes have fixed interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, the carrying value and fair value of our senior notes was approximately $2.97 billion and $2.83 billion, respectively. \nOur primary exposure to interest rate risk results from borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement, if any, which bear current market rates of interest plus a specified margin. As of and during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. \nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nWe are directly exposed to changes in the value of the Canadian dollar, the British pound and the euro. We generally do not maintain any exchange rate derivatives or hedges related to these currencies, but we may from time to time use foreign currency derivatives (primarily forward exchange contracts) to mitigate foreign currency exchange rate risk.\n56\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors \nCF Industries Holdings, Inc.:\nOpinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control \n–\n Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nMeasurements of projected benefit obligations\nAs discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s projected benefit obligation (PBO) associated with its defined benefit pension plans established in North America and the United Kingdom was $278 million and $317 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. The Company’s PBO represents an actuarially determined estimate of the present value of the vested benefits to which each eligible employee is currently entitled, based on the employee’s expected date of separation or retirement. Determining the PBO requires the Company to make assumptions, including the selection of a discount rate for each of the North America and United Kingdom plans. \nWe identified the evaluation of the Company’s measurements of the PBO as a critical audit matter. Specialized skills were needed to evaluate the discount rates utilized in the measurement of the PBO for each of the North America and United Kingdom plans. In addition, subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate these discount rates, as minor changes to these discount rates could have a significant impact on the PBO.\n57\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s PBO accounting process, including controls related to the determination of discount rates. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n•\ndeveloping an understanding and assessing the methods used by the Company’s actuaries to develop the discount rates\n•\nevaluating the relevance and reliability of information used by the Company’s actuaries in the development of the discount rates\n•\nevaluating the change in North America discount rates period over period using market trends based on published yield curves and indices\n•\nrecalculating the Company’s discount rate for the North America plans using the PBO cash flows and the Company’s actuaries’ proprietary yield curve for the North America discount rates\n•\nindependently developing a single equivalent discount rate for the North America plans using the PBO cash flows and publicly available yield curves for pension plans in North America, and comparing that to the Company’s selected discount rates for the North America plans\n•\nevaluating discount rates using benchmark yield curves for the United Kingdom, adjusted for the assessment of the timing of payments expected to be made to beneficiaries under the Company’s United Kingdom pension plans, and comparing those to the Company’s selected discount rates for the United Kingdom plans.\n(signed) KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1983.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 20, 2025

STATEMENTS\n1.     \nBackground and Basis of Presentation\nOur mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably. With our employees focused on safe and reliable operations, environmental stewardship, and disciplined capital and corporate management, we are on a path to decarbonize our ammonia production network – the world’s largest – to enable low-carbon hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement, and other industrial activities. Our manufacturing complexes in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, an extensive storage, transportation and distribution network in North America, and logistics capabilities enabling a global reach underpin our strategy to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy. Our principal customers are cooperatives, retailers, independent fertilizer distributors, traders, wholesalers and industrial users. Our core product is anhydrous ammonia (ammonia), which contains 82% nitrogen and 18% hydrogen. Products derived from ammonia that are most often used as nitrogen fertilizers include granular urea, urea ammonium nitrate solution (UAN) and ammonium nitrate (AN). AN is also used extensively by the commercial explosives industry as a component of explosives. Products derived from ammonia that are sold primarily to industrial customers include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia. \nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP). \nAll references to “CF Holdings,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to CF Industries Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes clear that the reference is to CF Industries Holdings, Inc. only and not its subsidiaries. All references to “CF Industries” refer to CF Industries, Inc., a 100% owned subsidiary of CF Industries Holdings, Inc.\nOur principal assets as of December 31, 2024 include:\n•\nsix\n U.S. manufacturing facilities, located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana; Sergeant Bluff, Iowa (our Port Neal complex); Yazoo City, Mississippi; Claremore, Oklahoma (our Verdigris complex); Woodward, Oklahoma; and Waggaman, Louisiana. The Waggaman facility is wholly owned by us, and the other five U.S. manufacturing facilities are wholly owned directly or indirectly by CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN), of which we own approximately \n89\n% and CHS Inc. (CHS) owns the remainder. See Note 19—Noncontrolling Interest for additional information on our strategic venture with CHS;\n•\ntwo\n Canadian manufacturing facilities, located in Medicine Hat, Alberta and Courtright, Ontario; \n•\na United Kingdom manufacturing facility, located in Billingham;\n•\nan extensive system of terminals and associated transportation equipment located primarily in the Midwestern United States; and\n•\na \n50\n% interest in Point Lisas Nitrogen Limited (PLNL), an ammonia production joint venture located in Trinidad and Tobago (Trinidad) that we account for under the equity method.\n2.     \nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nConsolidation and Noncontrolling Interest\nThe consolidated financial statements of CF Holdings include the accounts of CF Industries and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nWe own approximately \n89\n% of the membership interests in CFN and consolidate CFN in our financial statements. CHS’ minority equity interest in CFN is included in noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 19—Noncontrolling Interest for additional information.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented. Such estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to, net realizable value of inventories, environmental remediation liabilities, environmental and litigation contingencies, asset retirement obligations, the cost of emission credits required to meet \n64\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nenvironmental regulations, the cost of customer incentives, the fair values utilized in the allocation of purchase price in an acquisition, useful lives of property and identifiable intangible assets, the evaluation of potential impairments of property, investments, identifiable intangible assets and goodwill, income tax reserves and the assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets, measurement of the fair values of investments for which markets are not active, the determination of the funded status and annual expense of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans and the valuation of stock-based compensation awards granted to employees.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe follow a five-step model for revenue recognition. The five steps are: (1) identification of the contract(s) with the customer, (2) identification of the performance obligation(s) in the contract(s), (3) determination of the transaction price, (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligation(s), and (5) recognition of revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. Control of our products transfers to our customers when the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, our products, which occurs at the later of when title or risk of loss transfers to the customer. Control generally transfers to the customer at a point in time upon loading of our product onto transportation equipment or delivery to a customer destination. Revenue from forward sales programs is recognized on the same basis as other sales regardless of when the customer advances are received.\nIn situations where we have agreed to arrange delivery of the product to the customer’s intended destination and control of the product transfers upon loading of our product, we have elected to not identify delivery of the product as a performance obligation. We account for freight income associated with the delivery of these products as freight revenue, since this activity fulfills our obligation to transfer the product to the customer. Shipping and handling costs incurred by us are included in cost of sales.\nWe offer cash incentives to certain customers based on the volume of their purchases over a certain period. Customer incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash with original maturities of \nthree months\n or less. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value.\nInvestments\nShort-term investments and noncurrent investments are accounted for primarily as available-for-sale securities reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale equity securities are recognized through earnings. The carrying values of short-term investments, if any, approximate fair values because of the short maturities and the highly liquid nature of these investments.\nInventories\nInventories are reported at the lower of cost and net realizable value with cost determined on a first-in, first-out and average cost basis. Inventory includes the cost of materials, production labor and production overhead. Inventory at warehouses and terminals also includes distribution costs to move inventory to the distribution facilities. Net realizable value is reviewed at least quarterly. Fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales in the period incurred\n.\nInvestment in Unconsolidated Affiliate\nThe equity method of accounting is used for our investment in an affiliate that we do not consolidate, but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence. Our equity method investment for which the results are included in operating earnings consists of our \n50\n% ownership interest in PLNL, which operates an ammonia production facility in Trinidad. Our share of the net earnings from this investment is reported as an element of earnings from operations because PLNL’s operations provide additional production and are integrated with our supply chain and sales activities in the Ammonia segment.\nProfits resulting from sales or purchases with equity method investees are eliminated until realized by the investee or investor, respectively. Investments in affiliates are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If circumstances indicate that the fair value of an investment in an affiliate is less than its carrying value, and the reduction in value is other than temporary, the reduction in value would be recognized immediately in earnings.\n65\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nSee Note 10—Equity Method Investment for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method and are recorded over the estimated useful life of the property, plant and equipment. Useful lives are as follows:\n \nYears\nMobile and office equipment\n3\n to \n10\nProduction facilities, including machinery and equipment\n2\n to \n30\nLand improvements\n10\n to \n30\nBuildings\n10\n to \n40\nWe periodically review the useful lives assigned to our property, plant and equipment and we change the estimates to reflect the results of those reviews.\nScheduled inspections, replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds. Plant turnarounds are accounted for under the deferral method, as opposed to the direct expense or built-in overhaul methods. Under the deferral method, expenditures related to turnarounds are capitalized in property, plant and equipment when incurred and amortized to production costs on a straight-line basis over the period benefited, which is until the next scheduled turnaround in up to \nfive years\n. If the direct expense method were used, all turnaround costs would be expensed as incurred. Internal employee costs and overhead amounts are not considered turnaround costs and are not capitalized. Turnaround costs are classified as investing activities and included in capital expenditures in our consolidated statements of cash flows. See Note 8—Property, Plant and Equipment—Net for additional information.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nWe review property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets at the asset group level in order to assess recoverability based on expected future undiscounted cash flows whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected future net undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. For property, plant and equipment that is planned for abandonment, we first consider a market or income-based valuation method. In situations where a secondary market does not exist and the assets have been idled and planned for abandonment and therefore will not generate future cash flows from operations, we estimate a salvage value for those assets. See Note 7—United Kingdom Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges and Note 8—Property, Plant and Equipment—Net for additional information.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year at the reporting unit level. Our evaluation generally begins with a qualitative assessment of the factors that could impact the significant inputs used to estimate fair value. If after performing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then no further analysis is necessary. However, if the results of the qualitative test are unclear, we perform a quantitative test, which involves comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. We use an income-based valuation method, determining the present value of future cash flows, to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further analysis is necessary. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, goodwill impairment would be recognized equal to the amount of the carrying value in excess of the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. See Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional information regarding our goodwill.\n \n66\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nLeases\nRight-of-use (ROU) assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The discount rate used to calculate the present value represents our secured incremental borrowing rate and is calculated based on the treasury yield curve commensurate with the term of each lease, and a spread representative of our secured borrowing costs. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nLeases may be classified as either operating leases or finance leases. We have made an accounting policy election to not include leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on the balance sheet. For finance leases, if any, ROU assets are amortized over the lease term on a straight-line basis and interest expense is recognized using the effective interest method and based on the lease liability at period end. For operating leases, rental payments, including rent holidays, leasehold incentives, and scheduled rent increases are expensed on a straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the depreciable lives of the corresponding fixed assets or the lease term including any applicable renewals. For our rail car leases, barge tow charters, and terminal and warehouse storage agreements, we have made an accounting policy election to not separate lease and non-lease components, such as operating costs and maintenance, due to sufficient data not being available. As a result, the non-lease components are included in the ROU assets and lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. See Note 25—Leases for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those differences are projected to be recovered or settled. Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character in future periods. A valuation allowance is established if it is determined to be more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Significant judgment is applied in evaluating the need for and magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred tax assets. \nWe record our tax expense for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) as an expense in the period in which incurred and as such do not record a deferred tax liability for taxes that may be due in future periods. \nInterest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reported as interest expense and income tax expense, respectively. \nSee Note 12—Income Taxes for additional information.\nCustomer Advances\nCustomer advances represent cash received from customers following acceptance of orders under our forward sales programs. Under such advances, the customer prepays a portion of the value of the sales contract prior to obtaining control of the product, thereby reducing or eliminating accounts receivable from customers. Revenue is recognized when the customer obtains control of the product.\n \nDerivative Financial Instruments\nNatural gas is the principal raw material used to produce nitrogen-based products. We manage the risk of changes in natural gas prices primarily through the use of derivative financial instruments. The derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps, basis swaps and options traded in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The derivatives reference primarily a NYMEX futures price index, which represent the basis for fair value at any given time. These derivatives are traded in months forward and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated gas purchases during those future periods. From time to time, we may also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives.\nDerivative financial instruments are accounted for at fair value and recognized as current or noncurrent assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. We use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting. As a result, changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized in earnings. The fair values of derivative instruments and any related cash collateral are reported on a gross basis rather than on a net basis. Cash flows related to natural gas derivatives are reported as operating activities. \nSee Note 17—Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.\n67\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nDebt Issuance Costs\nCosts associated with the issuance of debt are recorded on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. Costs associated with entering into revolving credit facilities are recorded as an asset in noncurrent assets. All debt issuance costs are amortized over the term of the related debt using the effective interest rate method. Debt issuance discounts are netted against the related debt and are amortized over the term of the debt using the effective interest method. See Note 14—Financing Agreements for additional information.\nEnvironmental\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that increase the capacity or extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety or efficiency of the operations, or mitigate or prevent future environmental contamination are capitalized. Liabilities are recorded when it is probable that an obligation has been incurred and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Environmental liabilities are not discounted.\nEmission Credits\nEmission credits may be generated by or granted to us through emissions trading systems or other\n \nregulatory programs. From time to time, we may also purchase emission credits. We have elected to account for emission credits using the intangible asset model. Under this model, emission credits that are purchased are measured at their cost basis and tested for impairment annually. We do not recognize any internally generated emission credits under the intangible asset model until a monetary transaction occurs, such as a sale of the emission credits. If a facility exceeds regulatory emissions allowance levels and offsetting credits are not held by us, our obligation is recognized as an operating expense and a liability at the fair value of the emissions allowance deficit.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe grant stock-based compensation awards under our equity and incentive plans. The awards that have been granted to date are nonqualified stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units. The cost of employee services received in exchange for the awards is measured based on the fair value of the award on the grant date and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the period during which the employee is required to provide the services. We have elected to recognize equity award forfeitures as they occur in determining the compensation cost to be recognized in each period. See Note 21—Stock-based Compensation for additional information.\nTreasury Stock\nWe periodically retire treasury shares acquired through repurchases of our common stock and return those shares to the status of authorized but unissued. We account for treasury stock transactions under the cost method. For each reacquisition of common stock, the number of shares and the acquisition price for those shares is added to the treasury stock count and total value. When treasury shares are retired, we allocate the excess of the repurchase price over the par value of shares acquired to both retained earnings and paid-in capital. The portion allocated to paid-in capital is determined by applying the average paid-in capital per share, and the remaining portion is recorded to retained earnings. Payments of excise taxes associated with treasury stock repurchases are classified as a financing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, we are subject to ordinary, routine legal proceedings related to the usual conduct of our business. We may also be involved in proceedings regarding public utility and transportation rates, environmental matters, taxes and permits relating to the operations of our various plants and facilities. Accruals for such contingencies are recorded to the extent management concludes their occurrence is probable and the financial impact of an adverse outcome is reasonably estimable. Legal fees are recognized as incurred and are not included in accruals for contingencies. Disclosure for specific legal contingencies is provided if the likelihood of occurrence is at least reasonably possible and the exposure is considered material to the consolidated financial statements. \nIn making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters, many factors are considered. These factors include, but are not limited to, history, scientific and other evidence, and the specifics and status of each matter. If the assessment of various factors changes, the estimates may change. Predicting the outcome of claims and litigation, and estimating related costs and exposure, involves substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates and accruals.\n68\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement\nWe translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries with non-U.S. dollar functional currencies using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for each period for revenues and expenses. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) within stockholders’ equity. \nForeign currency-denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at exchange rates existing at the respective balance sheet dates. Gains and losses resulting from these foreign currency transactions are included in other operating—net in our consolidated statements of operations. Gains and losses resulting from intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature, if any, are reported in other comprehensive income.\n3.     New Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). We adopted this ASU effective December 31, 2024. See Note 22—Segment Disclosures, which includes the additional disclosures required by this ASU. \nRecently Issued Pronouncements\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. This ASU adds new guidance that further enhances income tax disclosures, primarily through standardization and disaggregation of rate reconciliation categories and income taxes paid by jurisdiction. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. We are continuing to evaluate the impact that our adoption of this ASU will have on the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. This ASU requires disclosure, within the footnotes to the financial statements, of specified costs and expenses disaggregated from the amounts presented on consolidated statements of operations. The guidance in this ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact that our adoption of this ASU will have on the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements.\n4.   Revenue Recognition \nOur performance obligations under a customer contract correspond to each shipment of product that we make to our customer under the contract. As a result, each contract may have more than one performance obligation based on the number of products ordered, the quantity of product to be shipped and the mode of shipment requested by the customer. When we enter into a contract with a customer, we are obligated to provide the product in that contract during a mutually agreed upon time period. Depending on the terms of the contract, either we or the customer arranges delivery of the product to the customer’s intended destination. When we arrange delivery of the product and control of the product transfers upon loading, we recognize freight revenue, which was $\n78\n million for 2024, $\n92\n million for 2023, and $\n91\n million for 2022.\nCertain of our contracts require us to supply products on a continuous basis to the customer. We recognize revenue on these contracts based on the quantity of products transferred to the customer during the period. For 2024, 2023 and 2022, the total amount of revenue for these contracts was $\n115\n million, $\n61\n million and $\n65\n million, respectively.\nFrom time to time, we will enter the marketplace to purchase product in order to satisfy the obligations of our customer contracts. When we purchase product for this purpose, we are the principal in the transaction and recognize revenue on a gross basis. As discussed in Note 10—Equity Method Investment, we have transactions in the normal course of business with PLNL, reflecting our obligation to purchase \n50% of the ammonia produced by PLNL\n at current market prices. Other than products purchased from PLNL, products purchased in the marketplace in order to satisfy the obligations of our customers were not material during 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n69\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nTransaction Price\nWe agree with our customers on the selling price of each transaction. This transaction price is generally based on the product, market conditions, including supply and demand balances, freight arrangements including where control transfers, and customer incentives. In our contracts with customers, we allocate the entire transaction price to the sale of product to the customer, which is the basis for the determination of the relative standalone selling price allocated to each performance obligation. \nAny sales tax, value added tax, and other tax we collect concurrently with our revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue.\n Returns of our product by our customers are permitted only when the product is not to specification. Returns were not material during 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nWe offer cash incentives to certain customers generally based on the volume of their purchases over the fertilizer year ending June 30. Our cash incentives do not provide an option to the customer for additional product. Accrual of these incentives involves the use of estimates, including how much product the customer will purchase and whether the customer will achieve a certain level of purchases within the incentive period. The balances of customer incentives accrued at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not material.\nRevenue Disaggregation\nWe track our revenue by product and by geography.

Products sold to our customers on credit are recorded as accounts receivable when the customer obtains control of the product. Customers that purchase our products on credit are required to pay in accordance with our customary payment terms, which are generally less than \n30\n days. For 2024, 2023 and 2022, the amount of customer bad debt expense recognized was not material.\nFor forward sales, the customer prepays a portion of the value of the sales contract prior to obtaining control of the product. These prepayments, when received, are recorded as customer advances and are recognized as revenue when the customer obtains control of the product. Forward sales are customarily offered for periods of less than one year in advance of when the customer obtains control of the product. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $\n118\n million and $\n130\n million, respectively, in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets. The decrease in the balance of customer advances was due primarily to lower average selling prices in 2024 compared to 2023. All of our customer advances that were recorded as of December 31, 2023 were recognized as revenue in 2024.\nWe have certain customer contracts with performance obligations where if the customer does not take the required amount of product specified in the contract, then the customer is required to make a payment to us, the amount of which may vary based upon the terms and conditions of the applicable contract. As of December 31, 2024, excluding contracts with original durations of less than one year, and based on the minimum product tonnage to be sold and current market price estimates, our remaining performance obligations under these contracts were approximately $\n2.2\n billion. We expect to \n70\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nrecognize approximately \n24\n% of these performance obligations as revenue in 2025, approximately \n26\n% as revenue during 2026-2028, approximately \n17\n% as revenue during 2029-2031, and the remainder as revenue thereafter. Subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable contracts, if these customers do not satisfy their purchase obligations under such contracts, the minimum amount that they would be required to pay to us under such contracts, in the aggregate, was approximately $\n1.2\n billion as of December 31, 2024. Other than the performance obligations described above, any performance obligations with our customers that were unfulfilled or partially filled at December 31, 2024 will be satisfied in 2025.\nAll of our contracts require that the period between the payment for goods and the transfer of those goods to the customer occur within normal contractual terms that do not exceed one year; therefore, we have elected the practical expedient and not adjusted the transaction price of any of our contracts to recognize a significant financing component. We have also elected the practical expedient to not capitalize any incremental costs associated with obtaining a contract that has a duration of less than one year, and there were no costs capitalized during 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nSupply Contract Liability\nIn connection with our acquisition of the Waggaman ammonia production facility, we entered into a long-term ammonia offtake agreement providing for us to supply up to \n200,000\n tons of ammonia per year to Dyno Nobel, Inc. (the Supply Contract). The terms of the Supply Contract were determined to be unfavorable compared to market as of the acquisition date. As a result, we recorded an intangible liability with an acquisition date fair value of $\n757\n million, which is being amortized to net sales over the estimated life of the Supply Contract of \n25\n years. For the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, we amortized $\n30\n million and $\n3\n million, respectively, of the Supply Contract liability into net sales. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $\n724\n million and $\n754\n million, respectively, in Supply Contract liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Estimated amortization of the Supply Contract liability for each of the fiscal years from 2025 to 2029 is approximately $\n30\n million. See Note 6—Acquisition of Waggaman Ammonia Production Facility for additional information.\n5.   \nNet Earnings Per Share \nNet earnings per share were computed as follows:\n \nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet earnings attributable to common stockholders\n$\n1,218\n \n$\n1,525\n \n$\n3,346\n \nBasic earnings per common share:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding\n180.4\n \n193.3\n \n203.3\n \nNet earnings attributable to common stockholders\n$\n6.75\n \n$\n7.89\n \n$\n16.45\n \nDiluted earnings per common share:\nWeighted-average common shares outstanding\n180.4\n \n193.3\n \n203.3\n \nDilutive common shares—stock-based awards\n0.3\n \n0.5\n \n0.9\n \nDiluted weighted-average common shares outstanding\n180.7\n \n193.8\n \n204.2\n \nNet earnings attributable to common stockholders\n$\n6.74\n \n$\n7.87\n \n$\n16.38\n \nDiluted earnings per common share is calculated using weighted-average common shares outstanding, including the dilutive effect of stock-based awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In the computation of diluted earnings per common share, potentially dilutive stock-based awards are excluded if the effect of their inclusion is anti-dilutive. Shares for anti-dilutive stock-based awards not included in the computation of diluted earnings per common share were \nzero\n for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n6.   Acquisition of Waggaman Ammonia Production Facility\nOn December 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana, from Dyno Nobel Louisiana Ammonia, LLC (DNLA), a U.S. subsidiary of Australia-based Incitec Pivot Limited (IPL), pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with DNLA and IPL. The facility has a nameplate production capacity of \n880,000\n tons of ammonia annually. Our acquisition of the Waggaman facility expanded our ammonia manufacturing and distribution capacity.\nIn connection with the acquisition, we entered into a long-term ammonia offtake agreement providing for us to supply up to \n200,000\n tons of ammonia per year to IPL’s Dyno Nobel, Inc. subsidiary (the Supply Contract). Under the terms of the asset \n71\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\npurchase agreement, $\n425\n million of the purchase price of $\n1.675\n billion, subject to adjustment, was allocated by the parties to the ammonia offtake agreement. We funded the balance of the initial purchase price on the acquisition date with $\n1.223\n billion of cash on hand.\nThe consideration transferred on the acquisition date reflected an estimated net working capital adjustment and other adjustments to the purchase price, which was subject to further adjustment pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement. The purchase price adjustments required under the asset purchase agreement were finalized in the second quarter of 2024, which resulted in a $\n2\n million reduction in the purchase price with a corresponding reduction in goodwill. As a result, the final purchase price was $\n1.221\n billion, and we finalized our purchase accounting for the Waggaman ammonia production facility in the second quarter of 2024.\nIn connection with the Waggaman acquisition, we incurred $\n4\n million of integration costs in 2024 and $\n3\n million and $\n36\n million, respectively, of integration costs and acquisition-related costs in 2023, which are included in acquisition and integration costs in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe accounted for the acquisition as a business combination. The following table summarizes the allocation of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was based on the estimated net realizable value for inventory, a replacement cost approach for property, plant and equipment and the income approach for intangible assets and the Supply Contract liability. \nOriginal Valuation\n(1)\nNet Adjustments \nto Fair Value\n(2)\nFinal \nValuation\n(in millions)\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed\nCurrent assets\n$\n37\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n37\n \nProperty, plant and equipment\n1,022\n \n—\n \n1,022\n \nGoodwill\n406\n \n(\n2\n)\n404\n \nOther assets\n539\n \n—\n \n539\n \nTotal assets acquired\n2,004\n \n(\n2\n)\n2,002\n \nCurrent liabilities\n18\n \n—\n \n18\n \nSupply Contract liability\n757\n \n—\n \n757\n \nOther liabilities\n6\n \n—\n \n6\n \nTotal liabilities assumed\n781\n \n—\n \n781\n \nTotal net assets acquired\n$\n1,223\n \n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n1,221\n \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nThe purchase price related to the acquisition was initially allocated based on the information available at the acquisition date. \n(2)\nWe finalized our purchase accounting for the Waggaman ammonia production facility in the second quarter of 2024.\nCurrent assets acquired included accounts receivable of $\n32\n million and inventory of $\n5\n million. The acquired property, plant and equipment is being depreciated over a period consistent with our fixed assets depreciation policy.\nThe acquisition resulted in the recognition of $\n404\n million of goodwill, which is recognized in our ammonia segment. Goodwill arising from the acquisition is expected to be deductible for tax reporting purposes. Other assets acquired included intangible assets of $\n526\n million, including $\n455\n million of customer relationships and $\n71\n million related to a favorable personal property tax agreement. The acquired intangible assets are being amortized over a period consistent with our existing intangible asset amortization policy. See Note 9—Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, for additional information related to goodwill and the acquired intangible assets.\nIn addition, the terms of the Supply Contract were determined to be unfavorable compared to market as of the acquisition date. As a result, we recorded an intangible liability, reflected as Supply Contract liability in the table above, with an acquisition date fair value of $\n757\n million, which is being amortized to net sales over the estimated life of the Supply Contract of \n25\n years.\nFinancial results of the Waggaman facility are included in our consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date of December 1, 2023. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the amount of net sales and net earnings of the Waggaman facility included in our consolidated statement of operations was $\n28\n million and $\n7\n million, respectively.\n72\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nEstimates utilized in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities \nThe valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of our acquisition of the Waggaman ammonia production facility on December 1, 2023, required us to make significant estimates and assumptions. \nWe estimated the fair value of the customer relationships of $\n455\n million using the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach, which incorporated the estimated future cash flows associated with the net earnings attributable to the acquired customer relationships. The estimated future cash flows were discounted to their present value using an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate from the perspective of a market participant. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows included forecasted product selling prices, future production and sales volumes, probability of renewal, projected natural gas costs, operating rates, operating expenses, inflation, tax rates, capital spending, and contributory asset charges, among other factors. The discount rate utilized in estimating the fair value of the customer relationships was \n9.0\n% and was derived using a capital asset pricing model and publicly available data for comparable companies to estimate the cost of equity financing. We used Moody’s Baa corporate bonds as a benchmark to estimate the cost of debt. Additional assumptions utilized in the valuation of the customer relationships included the duration of the forecasted cash flows and the tax amortization benefit, among other factors. \nThe terms of the Supply Contract were determined to be unfavorable compared to market as of the acquisition date. Therefore, we estimated the fair value of the Supply Contract liability of $\n757\n million using the with and without method of the income approach. This method included estimating the future cash flows by applying both a market price and the contract price in determining the respective forecasted sales. The difference in the estimated future cash flows using the resulting forecasted sales was then discounted to present value at the date of acquisition using an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate from the perspective of a market participant. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows included forecasted product selling price, specifically the market price in excess of the contract price, future production and sales volumes, probability of renewal, and inflation, among other factors. The discount rate utilized in estimating the fair value of the Supply Contract liability was \n6.2\n% and was derived based on the historical cost of our issued debt and treasury and corporate bond yields as of the acquisition date. Additional assumptions utilized in the valuation of the Supply Contract liability included the duration of the forecasted cash flows, among other factors. \nDue to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts.\n7.   \nUnited Kingdom Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges\nImpairment and Restructuring\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the United Kingdom began experiencing an energy crisis that included a substantial increase in the price of natural gas. The U.K. energy crisis necessitated evaluations of the long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, and goodwill of our U.K. operations to determine if their fair value had declined to below their carrying value. For the full year ended December 31, 2021, these evaluations resulted in goodwill and long-lived and intangible asset impairment charges. As of December 31, 2021, no goodwill related to our U.K. reporting units remained.\nDuring the first quarter of 2022, we concluded that the continued impacts of the U.K. energy crisis, including further increases and volatility in natural gas prices due in part to geopolitical events as a result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, triggered an additional long-lived asset impairment test. The results of this test indicated that \nno\n additional long-lived asset impairment existed, as the undiscounted estimated future cash flows were in excess of the carrying values for each of the U.K. asset groups.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, we approved and announced our proposed plan to restructure our U.K. operations, including the planned permanent closure of the Ince facility, which had been idled since September 2021, and optimization of the remaining manufacturing operations at our Billingham facility. Pursuant to our proposed plan to restructure our U.K. operations and dispose of the Ince facility assets before we originally intended, we concluded that an evaluation of our long-lived assets and an additional impairment test was required. Our assessment then identified the U.K. asset groups as U.K. Ammonia, U.K. AN and U.K. Other, comprising our ongoing U.K. operations, and Ince, U.K. In response to this impairment indicator, we compared the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the Ince, U.K. asset group to its carrying amount and concluded the carrying amount was not recoverable and should be adjusted to its fair value. As a result, in the second quarter of 2022, we recorded total charges of $\n162\n million related to the Ince facility as follows:\n•\nasset impairment charges of $\n152\n million consisting of the following:\n73\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n◦\nan impairment charge of $\n135\n million related to property, plant and equipment that is planned for abandonment at the Ince facility, including a liability of approximately $\n9\n million for the costs of certain asset retirement activities related to the Ince site;\n◦\nan intangible asset impairment charge of $\n8\n million related to trade names; and\n◦\nan impairment charge of $\n9\n million related to the write-down of spare parts and certain raw materials at the Ince facility;\nand\n•\na charge for post-employment benefits totaling $\n10\n million, which is included in the U.K. operations restructuring line item in our consolidated statements of operations, related to contractual and statutory obligations due to employees whose employment would be terminated in the proposed plan. \nThere was \nno\n additional asset impairment indicated for the three asset groups that comprise the continuing U.K. operations as the undiscounted estimated future cash flows were in excess of the carrying values for each of these asset groups.\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the United Kingdom continued to experience extremely high and volatile natural gas prices. Russian natural gas flows to Europe via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline ceased, causing the United Kingdom to experience unprecedented natural gas prices. In addition, the European Union announced a desire to cap the price that Europe would pay Russia for natural gas deliveries, further contributing to the uncertainty in European energy markets. Given these factors and the lack of a corresponding increase in global nitrogen product market prices, in September 2022, we temporarily idled ammonia production at our Billingham complex. As a result, we concluded that an additional impairment test was triggered for the asset groups that comprise the continuing U.K. operations. The results of our impairment test indicated that the carrying values for our U.K. Ammonia and U.K. AN asset groups exceeded the undiscounted estimated future cash flows. As a result, we recognized asset impairment charges of $\n87\n million, primarily related to property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets. \nIn August 2022, the final restructuring plan for our U.K. operations was approved, and decommissioning activities were initiated. As a result, in the third quarter of 2022, we incurred additional charges related to our U.K. restructuring of $\n8\n million, primarily related to one-time termination benefits. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we incurred additional charges related to our U.K. restructuring of $\n1\n million, primarily related to one-time termination benefits.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2022, as a result of the above, we recognized total impairment and restructuring charges of $\n258\n million, consisting of long-lived and intangible asset impairment charges of $\n239\n million and restructuring charges of $\n19\n million.\nIn July 2023, we approved and announced our proposed plan to permanently close the ammonia plant at our Billingham complex, and, in September 2023, the final plan was approved. As a result, in 2023, we recognized total charges of $\n10\n million, which is included in the U.K. operations restructuring line item in our consolidated statements of operations, consisting primarily of the recognition of an asset retirement obligation and post-employment benefits related to contractual and statutory obligations due to employees whose employment would be terminated.\nAssumptions in the 2022 impairment evaluations\nThe valuation of our asset groups and reporting units required significant judgment in evaluating recent indicators of market activity and estimating future cash flows, discount rates, and other factors. The expected cash flows used in the long-lived asset impairment tests reflected assumptions about product selling prices and natural gas costs, as well as estimated future production and sales volumes, operating rates, operating expenses, inflation, discount rates, tax rates and capital spending. The valuations also incorporated assumptions regarding the time it could take for the U.K. energy crisis to be resolved. In addition, assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of the long-lived assets in our asset groups, which included replacement cost and, for the Ince, U.K. asset group that is planned for abandonment, salvage value.\nThe discount rates utilized to discount the cash flows in calculating long-lived asset impairment were derived using a capital asset pricing model and analyzing published rates for industries relevant to our reporting units to estimate the cost of equity financing. The discount rates were commensurate with the risks and uncertainties inherent in the business and in the United Kingdom and our cash flow forecasts, updated for recent events at that time.  \nAdditional assumptions utilized in the long-lived asset impairment analyses were royalty rates and attrition rates in estimating the fair value of our definite-lived intangible assets, consisting of trade names and customer relationships, for which we used the relief from royalty method of the income approach and the multi-period excess earnings method, respectively. \n74\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nFor the asset groups that comprise the continuing U.K. operations, the fair value of our property, plant and equipment utilized in the long-lived asset impairment analyses was estimated using the indirect method of the cost approach by determining the reproduction cost new, or replacement cost, of the assets and applying appropriate adjustments for depreciation including an inutility adjustment based on the cash flows expected to be generated by those asset groups. For property, plant and equipment within the Ince, U.K. asset group, an asset group planned for abandonment, we first considered use of a market or income-based valuation method. However, given that a secondary market did not exist and the assets had been idled with a planned abandonment and therefore would not generate future cash flows from operations, we estimated the fair value of the asset group by determining the replacement cost of the underlying assets and then adjusting each of the asset categories to an estimated salvage value utilizing industry recognized price publications.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties involved in making estimates and assumptions, actual results may differ from those assumed in our forecasts.\n8.   \nProperty, Plant and Equipment—Net\nProperty, plant and equipment—net consists of the following: \n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(in millions)\nLand\n$\n114\n \n$\n114\n \nMachinery and equipment\n13,801\n \n13,716\n \nBuildings and improvements\n1,011\n \n1,020\n \nConstruction in progress\n482\n \n394\n \nProperty, plant and equipment\n(1)\n15,408\n \n15,244\n \nLess: Accumulated depreciation and amortization\n8,673\n \n8,103\n \nProperty, plant and equipment—net\n$\n6,735\n \n$\n7,141\n \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had property, plant and equipment that was accrued but unpaid of approximately $\n101\n million and $\n68\n million, respectively.\nDepreciation and amortization related to property, plant and equipment was $\n921\n million, $\n861\n million and $\n838\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nPlant turnarounds\n—Scheduled inspections, replacements and overhauls of plant machinery and equipment at our continuous process manufacturing facilities during a full plant shutdown are referred to as plant turnarounds.

Given the increase in the price of natural gas in the United Kingdom and the lack of a corresponding increase in global nitrogen product market prices, in September 2022, we temporarily idled ammonia production at our Billingham complex. As a result, we concluded that an additional impairment test was triggered for the asset groups that comprise the continuing U.K. operations, which resulted in asset impairment charges of $\n87\n million in our U.K. Ammonia and U.K. AN asset groups, of which $\n15\n million related to intangible assets, consisting of $\n6\n million related to customer relationships and $\n9\n million related to trade names. As a result of these impairment charges, intangible assets related to our U.K. operations were fully written off. See Note 7—United Kingdom Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges for additional information.\n10.   \nEquity Method Investment\nWe have a \n50\n% ownership interest in PLNL, which operates an ammonia production facility in Trinidad. We include our share of the net earnings from this equity method investment as an element of earnings from operations because PLNL provides additional production to our operations and is integrated with our other supply chain and sales activities in the Ammonia segment.\nPLNL operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied, under a gas sales contract (the NGC Contract), by The National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited (NGC). The NGC Contract had an expiration date of September 2023. In the third quarter of 2023, PLNL entered into a new gas sales contract with NGC (the New NGC Contract), which is effective October 2023 through December 2025. \nIn the third quarter of 2023 and due to the terms of the New NGC Contract, we assessed our investment in PLNL for impairment and determined that the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded its fair value. As a result, we recorded an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $\n43\n million, which is reflected in equity in earnings (loss) of operating affiliate on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2024, the total carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL was $\n29\n million. \nWe have transactions in the normal course of business with PLNL reflecting our obligation to purchase \n50% of the ammonia produced by PLNL\n at current market prices. Our ammonia purchases from PLNL totaled $\n90\n million, $\n142\n million and $\n259\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \n11.   \nFair Value Measurements\nOur cash and cash equivalents and other investments consist of the following:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\n \nCost Basis\nUnrealized\nGains\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair Value\n \n(in millions)\nCash\n$\n168\n \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n168\n \nCash equivalents:\nU.S. and Canadian government obligations\n932\n \n— \n— \n932\n \nOther debt securities\n514\n \n— \n— \n514\n \nTotal cash and cash equivalents\n$\n1,614\n \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n1,614\n \nNonqualified employee benefit trusts\n15\n \n2\n \n—\n \n17\n \n77\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n \nCost Basis\nUnrealized\nGains\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair Value\n \n(in millions)\nCash\n$\n208\n \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n208\n \nCash equivalents:\nU.S. and Canadian government obligations\n1,488\n \n— \n— \n1,488\n \nOther debt securities\n336\n \n— \n— \n336\n \nTotal cash and cash equivalents\n$\n2,032\n \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n2,032\n \nNonqualified employee benefit trusts\n16\n \n1\n \n—\n \n17\n \nUnder our short-term investment policy, we may invest our cash balances, either directly or through mutual funds, in several types of investment-grade securities, including notes and bonds issued by governmental entities or corporations and also in bank deposits.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, our cash equivalents consisted primarily of U.S. and Canadian government obligations and money market mutual funds that invest in U.S. government obligations and other investment-grade securities. \nNonqualified Employee Benefit Trusts\nWe maintain trusts associated with certain nonqualified supplemental pension plans. The fair values of the trust assets are based on daily quoted prices in an active market and are included on our consolidated balance sheets in other assets. Debt \n78\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nsecurities are accounted for as available-for-sale securities, and changes in fair value are reported in other comprehensive income. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale equity securities in the trust assets are recognized through earnings. \nDerivative Instruments\nThe derivative instruments that we use are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps, basis swaps and options traded in the OTC markets with multi-national commercial banks, other major financial institutions or large energy companies. The natural gas derivative contracts represent anticipated natural gas needs for future periods, and settlements are scheduled to coincide with anticipated natural gas purchases during those future periods. The natural gas derivative contracts settle using primarily a NYMEX futures price index. To determine the fair value of these instruments, we use quoted market prices from NYMEX and standard pricing models with inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data such as forward curves supplied by an industry-recognized independent third party. See Note 17—Derivative Financial Instruments for additional information.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying amount and estimated fair value of our financial instruments are as follows:\n \nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n \nCarrying\nAmount\nFair Value\nCarrying\nAmount\nFair Value\n \n(in millions)\nLong-term debt\n$\n2,971\n \n$\n2,827\n \n$\n2,968\n \n$\n2,894\n \nThe fair value of our long-term debt was based on quoted prices for identical or similar liabilities in markets that are not active or valuation models in which all significant inputs and value drivers are observable and, as a result, they are classified as Level 2 inputs.\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any instruments included in other current assets and other current liabilities that meet the definition of financial instruments, approximate fair values because of their short-term maturities.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nWe also have assets and liabilities that may be measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the assets and liabilities are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of impairment, when there is allocation of purchase price in an acquisition or when a new liability is being established that requires fair value measurement. These include long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, such as equity method investments, which may be written down to fair value as a result of impairment. The fair value measurements related to assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis rely primarily on Company-specific inputs. Since certain of the Company’s assumptions would involve inputs that are not observable, these fair values would reside within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. \nOn December 1, 2023, we acquired the Waggaman ammonia production facility. See Note 6—Acquisition of Waggaman Ammonia Production Facility for information on the inputs utilized in the allocation of purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nIn the third quarter of 2023, we determined the carrying value of our equity method investment in PLNL exceeded its fair value and recorded an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $\n43\n million.

As a result, earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest of $\n259\n million, $\n313\n million and $\n591\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which are included in earnings before income taxes, impacted the effective tax rate in all three years. See Note 19—Noncontrolling Interest for additional information. \nThe foreign tax rate differential is impacted by the inclusion of equity earnings from our equity method investment in PLNL, a foreign operating affiliate, which are included in pre-tax earnings on an after-tax basis. \nU.S. tax on foreign earnings is inclusive of the U.S. tax on our \n50\n% ownership in PLNL, current year tax on GILTI, benefit from the GILTI Section 250 deduction and foreign tax credits, as well as adjustments to prior year amounts for these items.\n80\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nCanada Revenue Agency Competent Authority Matter\nIn 2016, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and Alberta Tax and Revenue Administration (Alberta TRA) issued Notices of Reassessment for tax years 2006 through 2009 to one of our Canadian subsidiaries asserting a disallowance of certain patronage deductions. We filed Notices of Objection with respect to the Notices of Reassessment with the CRA and Alberta TRA and posted letters of credit in lieu of paying the additional tax liability assessed. The letters of credit served as security until the matter was resolved, as discussed below. In 2018, the matter, including the related transfer pricing topic regarding the allocation of profits between Canada and the United States, was accepted for consideration under the bilateral settlement provisions of the U.S.-Canada tax treaty (the Treaty) by the United States and Canadian competent authorities, and included tax years 2006 through 2011. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company submitted the transfer pricing aspect of the matter into the arbitration process under the terms of the Treaty.\nIn February 2022, we were informed that a decision was reached by the arbitration panel for tax years 2006 through 2011. In March 2022, we received further details of the results of the arbitration proceedings and the settlement provisions between the United States and Canadian competent authorities, and we accepted the decision of the arbitration panel. Under the terms of the arbitration decision, additional income for tax years 2006 through 2011 was subject to tax in Canada, resulting in our having additional Canadian tax liability for those tax years of approximately $\n129\n million. \nAs a result of the impact of these events on our Canadian and U.S. federal and state income taxes, we recognized an income tax provision of $\n78\n million, reflecting the net impact of $\n129\n million of accrued income taxes payable to Canada for tax years 2006 to 2011, partially offset by net income tax receivables of approximately $\n51\n million in the United States, and we accrued net interest of $\n102\n million, primarily reflecting the estimated interest payable to Canada. The $\n69\n million in the effective tax rate table above excludes the state income tax liability of $\n9\n million, which is included in the line “State income tax, net of federal.”\nIn the second half of 2022, this tax liability and the related interest was assessed and paid, resulting in total payments of $\n224\n million, which also reflect the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. As a result, the letters of credit we had posted in lieu of paying the additional tax liability assessed by the Notices of Reassessment were cancelled. Due primarily to the availability of additional foreign tax credits to offset in part the increased Canadian tax referenced above, we filed amended tax returns in the United States to request a refund of taxes paid.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we were informed that the CRA granted us discretionary interest relief for certain tax years from 2006 through 2011. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we received the CRA portion of the interest relief consisting of interest refunds of $\n21\n million and related interest of $\n2\n million. Based on current estimates and foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2024, the interest relief from the Alberta TRA is estimated to be approximately $\n16\n million, consisting of interest refunds of $\n15\n million and related interest of $\n1\n million. As a result, in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized $\n39\n million of income consisting of a $\n36\n million reduction in interest expense and $\n3\n million of interest income.\n81\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nDeferred Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are as follows: \n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(in millions)\nDeferred tax assets:\n \n \nNet operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, state\n$\n56\n \n$\n68\n \nNet operating loss and capital loss carryforwards, foreign\n49\n \n116\n \nRetirement and other employee benefits\n2\n \n14\n \nForeign tax credits\n57\n \n55\n \nState tax credits\n11\n \n16\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n66\n \n63\n \nOther\n34\n \n38\n \n275\n \n370\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n107\n)\n(\n194\n)\n168\n \n176\n \nDeferred tax liabilities:\nDepreciation and amortization\n(\n273\n)\n(\n300\n)\nInvestments in partnerships\n(\n659\n)\n(\n780\n)\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n(\n63\n)\n(\n63\n)\nForeign earnings\n(\n14\n)\n(\n9\n)\nOther\n(\n30\n)\n(\n23\n)\n(\n1,039\n)\n(\n1,175\n)\nNet deferred tax liability\n$\n(\n871\n)\n$\n(\n999\n)\nThe Company does not have an indefinite reinvestment assertion in any of our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2024, we recorded a deferred tax liability of $\n14\n million on the undistributed earnings of our Canadian subsidiaries. We have not provided for deferred taxes on the remainder of our undistributed earnings from our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings would not give rise to additional tax liabilities upon repatriation. \nAs of December 31, 2024, our net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards consist primarily of state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n56\n million, of which $\n15\n million will expire at various dates between 2036 and 2044 and the remaining $\n41\n million can be carried forward indefinitely, and foreign capital loss carryforwards of $\n49\n million, which can be carried forward indefinitely. Our foreign subsidiaries have operations that do not normally generate capital gains and have no practical plans to do so in the future. As a result, we have recorded a full valuation allowance against all foreign capital loss carryforwards.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have state tax credit carryforwards resulting in a deferred tax asset of $\n11\n million. The state tax credits have expiration dates generally ranging from 2039 to 2044.\nIn 2024, the net decrease in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to a reduction of $\n83\n million in a capital loss carryforward and the associated valuation allowance for one of our foreign subsidiaries in Canada. Additionally, based on income generated in the United Kingdom and the reversal of deferred tax assets, the remaining valuation allowance originally recorded in 2022 for one of our foreign subsidiaries in the United Kingdom was released in 2024, resulting in an $\n11\n million decrease to the valuation allowance. Both of these decreases were partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nIn 2023, the net increase in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to excess foreign tax credits associated with certain U.S. taxed foreign branch income and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by the utilization of deferred tax assets of one of our foreign subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. The excess foreign tax credits carried forward, subject to U.S. foreign tax credit limitation rules, are not expected to be utilized prior to expiration and have a full valuation allowance of $\n55\n million reflecting an increase of $\n11\n million in 2023. Based on recent income generated in the United Kingdom, a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance had been recorded in 2022 was \n82\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nutilized in 2023, resulting in a $\n7\n million decrease to the deferred tax assets and the valuation allowance of one of our foreign subsidiaries in the United Kingdom.\nIn 2022, the net increase in the valuation allowance is primarily attributable to excess foreign tax credits associated with certain U.S. taxed foreign branch income and the reversal of future deductible temporary differences of one of our foreign subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The excess foreign tax credits carried forward, subject to U.S. foreign tax credit limitation rules, are not expected to be utilized prior to expiration and have a full valuation allowance of $\n44\n million reflecting an increase of $\n26\n million in 2022. Based on recent losses generated in the United Kingdom, and projections for future income over the period for which the deferred tax assets will reverse, we believe it is more likely than not that the foreign subsidiary in the United Kingdom will not realize the deferred tax assets and therefore have recorded a full valuation allowance of $\n24\n million. See Note 7—United Kingdom Operations Restructuring and Impairment Charges for additional detail.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: \n \nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(in millions)\nUnrecognized tax benefits:\nBalance as of January 1\n$\n222\n \n$\n181\n \nAdditions for tax positions taken during the current year\n1\n \n5\n \nAdditions for tax positions taken during prior years\n7\n \n69\n \nReductions related to lapsed statutes of limitations\n—\n \n—\n \nReductions related to settlements with tax jurisdictions\n—\n \n(\n33\n)\nBalance as of December 31\n$\n230\n \n$\n222\n \nIn 2024, we increased the amount of our unrecognized tax benefit by $\n8\n million, which primarily relates to transfer pricing positions. As of December 31, 2024, we had $\n230\n million of unrecognized tax benefits. The majority of our unrecognized tax benefits relate to transfer pricing positions, which have a corollary receivable for the other jurisdiction impacted by the transfer pricing relationship. Recognizing these unrecognized tax benefits would result in additional tax expense of $\n49\n million in the future. These receivables are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn 2023, we increased the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits by $\n74\n million, which primarily relates to refunds claimed on the U.S. amended returns filed during the year, as discussed above under Canada Revenue Agency Competent Authority Matter. In addition, we reduced the amount of unrecognized tax benefits by $\n33\n million, reflecting primarily the settlement of issues raised on state and Canadian income tax audits for various open tax years.\nIn 2022, we increased the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits by $\n154\n million, which relates primarily to the Canada Revenue Agency Competent Authority Matter discussed above. As a result of the outcome of the arbitration decision, we evaluated our transfer pricing positions between Canada and the United States for open years 2012 and after. In order to mitigate the assessment of future Canadian interest on these Canadian transfer pricing positions, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we made payments to the Canadian taxing authorities of CAD $\n363\n million (approximately $\n267\n million), which were recorded as noncurrent income tax receivables and included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet. For the amounts ultimately owed and paid to the Canadian tax authorities upon resolution of these tax years, we would seek refunds of related taxes paid in the United States.\nWe file federal, provincial, state and local income tax returns principally in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as in certain other foreign jurisdictions. In general, filed tax returns remain subject to examination by United States tax jurisdictions for years 2017 and thereafter, by Canadian tax jurisdictions for years 2012 and thereafter, and by the United Kingdom for years 2022 and thereafter. As a result of uncertainties regarding tax audits and their possible outcomes, an estimate of the range of possible impacts to unrecognized tax benefits in the next twelve months cannot be made at this time.\nInterest expense and penalties related to our unrecognized tax benefits of $\n8\n million, $(\n4\n) million and $\n66\n million were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets for accrued interest and penalties related to our unrecognized tax benefits of $\n55\n million and $\n51\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, are included in other liabilities.\n83\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n13.   \nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe maintain \nfive\n funded pension plans, consisting of\n \nthree\n in North America (\none\n U.S. plan and \ntwo\n Canadian plans) and \ntwo\n in the United Kingdom. Both U.K. pension plans are closed to new employees and future accruals. All of our North American plans are closed to new employees. As a result of plan amendments in the fourth quarter of 2022, as further described below, one of the Canadian plans ceased future accruals effective December 31, 2023, and the cash balance portion of the U.S. plan that provided benefits based on years of service and interest credits was closed to new employees effective December 31, 2022. We also provide group medical insurance benefits, which vary by group and location, to certain retirees in North America. \nOn July 15, 2022, we entered into an agreement with an insurance company to purchase a non-participating group annuity contract and transfer approximately $\n375\n million of our primary U.S. defined benefit pension plan’s projected benefit obligation. The transaction closed on July 22, 2022 and was funded with plan assets. Under the transaction, the insurance company assumed responsibility for pension benefits and annuity administration for approximately \n4,000\n retirees or their beneficiaries. As a result of this transaction, in the third quarter of 2022, we remeasured the plan’s projected benefit obligation and plan assets and recognized a non-cash pre-tax \npension settlement loss\n of $\n24\n million, reflecting the unamortized net unrecognized postretirement benefit costs related to the settled obligations, with a corresponding offset to accumulated other comprehensive loss. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the final settlement of the non-participating group annuity contract resulted in a refund of $\n4\n million, which decreased the settlement loss by $\n3\n million to $\n21\n million.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2022, we remeasured certain of our defined benefit pension plans due to plan amendments resulting from a revision to our North American retirement plan strategy, which, among other things, closed the cash balance portion of the U.S. plan that was previously open to new employees and established effective dates for each of the three North America plans to freeze future benefit accruals through the end of 2025. The plan curtailments resulted in a reduction in our benefit obligations of $\n20\n million and curtailment gains of $\n4\n million, which are reflected in other non-operating—net in our consolidated statement of operations. \nOur plan assets, benefit obligations, funded status and amounts recognized on our consolidated balance sheets for our North America and United Kingdom plans as of the December 31 measurement date are as follows: \nPension Plans\nRetiree Medical Plans\n \nNorth America\nUnited Kingdom\nNorth America\nDecember 31,\nDecember 31,\nDecember

pension funding policy in North America is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet minimum legal funding requirements plus discretionary amounts that we may deem to be appropriate. Actual contributions may vary from estimated amounts depending on changes in assumptions, actual returns on plan assets, changes in regulatory requirements and funding decisions.\nIn accordance with United Kingdom pension legislation, our United Kingdom pension funding policy is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the funding level target agreed between the employer and the trustees of the United Kingdom plans.  Actual contributions are usually agreed with the plan trustees in connection with each triennial valuation and may vary following each such review depending on changes in assumptions, actual returns on plan assets, changes in regulatory requirements and funding decisions.\nWe currently estimate that our consolidated pension funding cash contributions for 2025 will be approximately $\n1\n million for our North American plans and, as agreed with the plans’ trustees, $\n5\n million for our United Kingdom plans. \nThe expected future benefit payments for our pension and retiree medical plans are as follows: \nPension Plans\nRetiree Medical Plans\nNorth America\nUnited Kingdom\nNorth America\n \n(in millions)\n2025\n$\n14\n \n$\n25\n \n$\n2\n \n2026\n15\n \n25\n \n2\n \n2027\n16\n \n26\n \n2\n \n2028\n16\n \n27\n \n2\n \n2029\n17\n \n27\n \n2\n \n2030-2034\n92\n \n148\n \n7\n \nThe following assumptions were used in determining the benefit obligations and expense: \nPension Plans\nRetiree Medical Plans\n \nNorth America\nUnited Kingdom\nNorth America\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024\n2023\n2022\nWeighted-average discount rate—obligation\n5.2\n \n%\n4.8\n \n%\n5.1\n \n%\n5.5\n \n%\n4.6\n \n%\n4.8\n \n%\n5.4\n \n%\n4.8\n \n%\n5.0\n \n%\nWeighted-average discount rate—expense\n4.8\n \n%\n5.1\n \n%\n3.6\n \n%\n4.6\n \n%\n4.8\n \n%\n2.0\n \n%\n4.8\n \n%\n5.0\n \n%\n2.7\n \n%\nWeighted-average cash balance interest crediting rate—obligation \n4.4\n \n%\n3.9\n \n%\n3.9\n \n%\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nWeighted-average cash balance interest crediting rate—expense\n3.9\n \n%\n3.9\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nWeighted-average rate of increase in future compensation\n3.3\n \n%\n3.3\n \n%\n3.8\n \n%\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nWeighted-average expected long-term rate of return on assets—expense\n5.0\n \n%\n4.8\n \n%\n3.9\n \n%\n6.5\n \n%\n6.1\n \n%\n3.4\n \n%\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nWeighted-average retail price index—obligation\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n3.1\n \n%\n3.0\n \n%\n3.2\n \n%\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nWeighted-average retail price index—expense\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n3.0\n \n%\n3.2\n \n%\n3.3\n \n%\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n______________________________________________________________________________\nn/a—not applicable\nThe discount rates for all plans are developed by plan using spot rates derived from a hypothetical yield curve of high quality (AA rated or better) fixed income debt securities as of the year-end measurement date to calculate discounted cash flows (the projected benefit obligation) and solving for a single equivalent discount rate that produces the same projected benefit obligation. In determining our benefit obligation, we use the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which each eligible employee is currently entitled, based on the employee’s expected date of separation or retirement. \nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. plan is based on the greater of 10-year Treasuries or \n3.0\n%.\nFor our North America plans, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on analysis of historical rates of return achieved by equity and non-equity investments and current market characteristics, adjusted for estimated plan expenses and weighted by target asset allocation percentages. As of January 1, 2025, our weighted-average expected long-term rate of \n87\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nreturn on assets for our North America plans is \n5.1\n%, which will be used in determining net periodic benefit cost for our North America plans for 2025.\nFor our United Kingdom plans, the expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on the expected long-term performance of the underlying investments, adjusted for investment managers’ fees and estimated plan expenses. As of January 1, 2025, our weighted-average expected long-term rate of return on assets for our United Kingdom plans is \n6.1\n%, which will be used in determining net periodic benefit cost for our United Kingdom plans for 2025.\nThe retail price index for our United Kingdom plans is developed using a U.K. Government Gilt Prices Only retail price inflation curve, which is based on the difference between yields on fixed interest government bonds and index-linked government bonds. \nFor the measurement of the benefit obligation at December 31, 2024 for our primary (U.S.) retiree medical benefit plans, the assumed health care cost trend rates, for pre-age 65 retirees, start with an \n8.4\n% increase in 2025, followed by a gradual decline in increases to \n4.5\n% for\n 2034 \nand thereafter. For post-age 65 retirees, the assumed health care cost trend rates start with a \n9.8\n% increase in 2025, followed by a gradual decline in increases to \n4.5\n% for \n2034 a\nnd thereafter. For the measurement of the benefit obligation at December 31, 2023 for our primary (U.S.) retiree medical benefit plans, the assumed health care cost trend rates, for pre-age 65 retirees, started with an \n8.0\n% increase in 2024, followed by a gradual decline in increases to \n4.5\n% for 2033 and thereafter. For post-age 65 retirees, the assumed health care cost trend rates started with an \n8.4\n% increase in 2024, followed by a gradual decline in increases to \n4.5\n% for 2033 and thereafter. \nThe objectives of the investment policies governing the pension plans are to administer the assets of the plans for the benefit of the participants in compliance with all laws and regulations, and to establish an asset mix that provides for diversification and considers the risk of various different asset classes with the purpose of generating favorable investment returns. The investment policies consider circumstances such as participant demographics, time horizon to retirement and liquidity needs, and provide guidelines for asset allocation, planning horizon, general portfolio issues and investment manager evaluation criteria. The investment strategies for the plans, including target asset allocations and investment vehicles, are subject to change within the guidelines of the policies.\nThe target asset allocation for our U.S. pension plan is \n80\n% non-equity and \n20\n% equity, which has been determined based on analysis of actual historical rates of return and plan needs and circumstances. The equity investments are tailored to exceed the growth of the benefit obligation and are a combination of U.S. and non-U.S. total stock market index mutual funds. The non-equity investments consist primarily of investments in debt securities and money market instruments that are selected based on investment quality and duration to mitigate volatility of the funded status and annual required contributions. The non-equity investments have a duration profile that is similar to the benefit obligation in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on the funded status. This investment strategy is achieved through the use of mutual funds and individual securities.\nThe target asset allocation for both of the Canadian plans is \n100\n% non-equity. This investment strategy is achieved through the use of individual securities. The investments consist primarily of investments in debt securities that are selected based on investment quality and duration to mitigate volatility of the funded status and annual required contributions. The investments have a duration profile that is similar to the benefit obligation in order to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on the funded status.\nThe pension assets in the United Kingdom plans are each administered by a Board of Trustees consisting of employer-nominated trustees, member-nominated trustees and an independent trustee, with a requirement that member-nominated trustees represent at least one-third of each Board of Trustees. It is the responsibility of the trustees to ensure prudent management and investment of the assets in the plans. The trustees meet on a quarterly basis to review and discuss fund performance and other administrative matters. The trustees’ investment objectives are to hold assets that generate returns sufficient to cover prudently each plan’s liability without exposing the plans to unacceptable risk. This is accomplished through the asset allocation strategy of each plan. For both plans, if the asset allocation moves more than plus or minus 5% from the target allocation, the plans’ appointed investment manager would amend the asset allocation. The trustees formally review the investment strategy on an annual basis which includes taking account of the latest actuarial data, such as changes to member experience. A full review is also completed of the investment strategy at every triennial actuarial valuation to ensure that the strategy remains consistent with its funding principles. The trustees may review the strategy more frequently if opportunities arise to reduce risk within the investments without jeopardizing the funding position.\nAssets of the United Kingdom plans are invested in pooled funds managed by the appointed investment manager. The assets are allocated between a growth portfolio and a matching portfolio. The growth portfolio seeks a return premium on investments across multiple asset classes. Growth portfolio funds may include, among others, traditional equities and bonds, growth fixed income, and hedged funds, and may use derivatives. The matching portfolio seeks to align asset changes with \n88\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nchanges in liabilities due to interest rates and inflation expectations. Matching portfolio funds are composed of corporate bonds, U.K. gilts and liability-driven investment funds and generally invest in fixed income debt securities including government bonds, gilts, gilt repurchase agreements, swaps and investment grade corporate bonds and may use derivatives. The target asset allocation for one of the United Kingdom plans was reduced to \n25\n% from \n46\n% in the growth portfolio and increased to \n75\n% from \n54\n% in the matching portfolio. The target asset allocation for the other United Kingdom plan was reduced to \n30\n% from \n57\n% in the growth portfolio and increased to \n70\n% from \n43\n% in the matching portfolio.

Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes. CF Industries is the lead borrower, and CF Holdings is the sole guarantor, under the Revolving Credit Agreement. \nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement can be denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros and British pounds. Borrowings in U.S. dollars bear interest at a per annum rate equal to, at our option, an applicable adjusted term Secured Overnight Financing Rate or base rate plus, in either case, a specified margin. We are required to pay an undrawn commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement and customary letter of credit fees. The specified margin and the amount of the commitment fee depend on CF Holdings’ credit rating at the time.\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had unused borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement of $\n750\n million and \nno\n outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and during the years then ended, there were \nno\n borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. \nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants under the Revolving Credit Agreement. \nLetters of Credit Under Bilateral Agreement\nWe are party to a bilateral agreement providing for the issuance of up to $\n425\n million of letters of credit.

Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products. From time to time, we may also use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The derivatives that we use to reduce our exposure to changes in prices for natural gas are primarily natural gas fixed price swaps, basis swaps and options traded in the OTC markets. These natural gas derivatives settle using primarily a NYMEX futures price index, which represents the basis for fair value at any given time. We enter into natural gas derivative contracts with respect to natural gas to be consumed by us in the future, and settlements of those derivative contracts are scheduled to coincide with our anticipated purchases of natural gas used to manufacture nitrogen products during those future periods. We use natural gas derivatives as an economic hedge of natural gas price risk, but without the application of hedge accounting. As a result, changes in fair value of these contracts are recognized in earnings. As of December 31, 2024, we had natural gas derivative contracts covering certain periods through March 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2024, our open natural gas derivative contracts consisted of natural gas fixed price swaps and basis swaps for \n16.0\n million MMBtus of natural gas. As of December 31, 2023, we had open natural gas derivative contracts consisting of natural gas fixed price swaps, basis swaps and options for \n49.0\n million MMBtus of natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we used derivatives to cover approximately \n15\n% of our natural gas consumption.\nThe effect of derivatives in our consolidated statements of operations is shown in the table below. \n \nGain (loss) recognized in income\n \n \nYear ended December 31,\nLocation\n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n \n(in millions)\nNatural gas derivatives\nUnrealized net gains (losses) \nCost of sales\n$\n35\n \n$\n39\n \n$\n(\n41\n)\nRealized net (losses) gains  \nCost of sales\n(\n40\n)\n(\n139\n)\n10\n \nNet derivative losses\n \n$\n(\n5\n)\n$\n(\n100\n)\n$\n(\n31\n)\nThe fair values of derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets are shown below.

Our derivative contracts are executed with several counterparties under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements. The ISDA agreements are master netting arrangements commonly used for OTC derivatives that mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk, in part, by creating contractual rights of netting and setoff, the specifics of which vary from agreement to agreement. These rights are described further below:\n•\nSettlement netting generally allows us and our counterparties to net, into a single net payable or receivable, ordinary settlement obligations arising between us and our counterparties under the ISDA agreement on the same day, in the same currency, for the same types of derivative instruments, and through the same pairing of offices.\n•\nClose-out netting rights are provided in the event of a default or other termination event (as defined in the ISDA agreements), including bankruptcy. Depending on the cause of early termination, the non-defaulting party may elect to terminate all or some transactions outstanding under the ISDA agreement. The values of all terminated transactions and certain other payments under the ISDA agreement are netted, resulting in a single net close-out amount payable to or by the non-defaulting party. \n•\nSetoff rights are provided by certain of our ISDA agreements and generally allow a non-defaulting party to elect to set off, against the final net close-out payment, other matured and contingent amounts payable between us and our \n94\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\ncounterparties under the ISDA agreement or otherwise. Typically, these setoff rights arise upon the early termination of all transactions outstanding under an ISDA agreement following a default or specified termination event.\nMost of our ISDA agreements contain credit-risk-related contingent features such as cross default provisions. In the event of certain defaults or termination events, our counterparties may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades or, under certain ISDA agreements, may require us to collateralize derivatives in a net liability position. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate fair value of the derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in net liability positions was \nzero\n and $\n34\n million, respectively, which also approximates the fair value of the assets that may be needed to settle the obligations if the credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered at the reporting dates. The credit support documents executed in connection with certain of our ISDA agreements generally provide us and our counterparties the right to set off collateral against amounts owing under the ISDA agreements upon the occurrence of a default or a specified termination event. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had \nno\n cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts. \nThe following table presents amounts relevant to offsetting of our derivative assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024 and 2023: \n \nAmounts presented in consolidated\nbalance sheets\n(1)\nGross amounts not offset in consolidated balance sheets\n \nFinancial\ninstruments\nCash collateral received (pledged)\nNet\namount\n \n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\n \n \n \n \nTotal derivative assets\n$\n4\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n4\n \nTotal derivative liabilities\n(\n3\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n3\n)\nNet derivative assets\n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \nDecember 31, 2023\n \n \n \n \nTotal derivative assets\n$\n1\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1\n \nTotal derivative liabilities\n(\n35\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n35\n)\nNet derivative liabilities\n$\n(\n34\n)\n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n34\n)\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nWe report the fair values of our derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on our consolidated balance sheets.

We own the remaining membership interests. Under the terms of CFN’s limited liability company agreement, each member’s interest will reflect, over time, the impact of the profitability of CFN, any member contributions made to CFN and withdrawals and distributions received from CFN. For financial reporting purposes, the assets, liabilities and earnings of the strategic venture are consolidated into our financial statements. CHS’ interest in the strategic venture is recorded in noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements. CHS also receives deliveries pursuant to a supply agreement under which CHS has the right to purchase annually from CFN up to approximately \n1.1\n million tons of granular urea and \n580,000\n tons of UAN at market prices. As a result of its equity interest in CFN, CHS is entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. We are also entitled to semi-annual cash distributions from CFN. The amounts of distributions from CFN to us and CHS are based generally on the profitability of CFN and determined \n97\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nbased on the volume of granular urea and UAN sold by CFN to us and CHS pursuant to supply agreements, less a formula driven amount based primarily on the cost of natural gas used to produce the granular urea and UAN, and adjusted for the allocation of items such as operational efficiencies and overhead amounts. \nOn January 31, 2025, the CFN Board of Managers approved semi-annual distribution payments for the distribution period ended December 31, 2024, in accordance with CFN’s limited liability company agreement. On January 31, 2025, CFN distributed $\n129\n million to CHS for the distribution period ended December 31, 2024.\n20.   \nStockholders’ Equity\nCommon Stock\nOur Board of Directors (the Board) has authorized certain programs to repurchase shares of our common stock. These programs have generally permitted repurchases to be made from time to time in the open market, through privately-negotiated transactions, through block transactions, through accelerated share repurchase programs, or otherwise. The manner, timing and amount of repurchases will be determined by our management based on the evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors.\nOn November 3, 2021, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $\n1.5\n billion of CF Holdings common stock through December 31, 2024 (the 2021 Share Repurchase Program). The 2021 Share Repurchase Program was completed in the second quarter of 2023. On November 2, 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $\n3\n billion of CF Holdings common stock commencing upon completion of the 2021 Share Repurchase Program and effective through December 31, 2025 (the 2022 Share Repurchase Program). \nThe following table summarizes the share repurchases under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program. \nShares\nAmounts\n(1)\n(in millions)\nShares repurchased in 2023:\nSecond quarter\n0.8\n \n$\n50\n \nThird quarter\n1.9\n \n150\n \nFourth quarter\n2.9\n \n225\n \nTotal shares repurchased in 2023\n5.6\n \n$\n425\n \nShares repurchased in 2024:\nFirst quarter\n4.3\n \n$\n347\n \nSecond quarter\n4.0\n \n305\n \nThird quarter\n6.1\n \n476\n \nFourth quarter\n4.4\n \n385\n \nTotal shares repurchased in 2024\n18.8\n \n$\n1,513\n \nShares repurchased as of December 31, 2024\n24.4\n \n$\n1,938\n \n \n______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nAs defined in the 2022 Share Repurchase Program, amounts reflect the price paid for the shares of common stock repurchased, excluding commissions paid to brokers and excise taxes.\nIn 2024, we repurchased approximately \n18.8\n million shares under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program for approximately $\n1.51\n billion, of which $\n10\n million was accrued and unpaid as of December 31, 2024.

If the Board authorizes us to retire the shares, they are returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares. As part of the retirements, we reduce our treasury stock, paid-in capital and retained earnings balances. In 2024, we retired \n18.7\n million shares of repurchased stock.

The 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan replaced the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan (the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan) and permits grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards, which in each case may be conditioned on performance criteria, to employees and certain consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries and non-employee directors of the Company.  \nShare Reserve and Individual Award Limits \nThe maximum number of shares reserved for the grant of awards under the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan is the sum of (i) \n2.5\n million shares, plus (ii) the number of shares that remain available for new grants under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan when the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders, plus (iii) the number of shares subject to stock options granted under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan or the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. 2009 Equity and Incentive Plan that were outstanding when the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders, but only to the extent such awards terminate or expire without the delivery of shares, plus (iv) \n1.61\n times the number of shares subject to restricted stock or restricted stock unit awards (including performance restricted stock unit awards) granted under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan that were outstanding when the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders, but only to the extent such awards terminate or expire without the delivery of shares. In no event will the number of shares available for issuance under the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan exceed \n10,615,515\n shares. Shares issued with respect to all awards granted under the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan are counted against the share reserve on a one-for-one basis. The shares subject to any outstanding award under the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan will be available for subsequent award and issuance under the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan to the extent those awards subsequently expire, are forfeited or cancelled, or terminate for any reason prior to issuance of the shares subject to those awards. In addition, shares tendered or withheld in payment of the exercise price of an award and shares withheld by the Company to satisfy tax withholding obligations related to an award will be available for subsequent award under the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan. As of December 31, 2024, we had approximately \n6.6\n million shares available for future awards under the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan. The 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan provides that no more than \n5.0\n million shares may be issued pursuant to the exercise of incentive stock options, subject to adjustment upon certain capitalization events. \nRestricted Stock Awards, Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Stock Units\nThe fair value of a restricted stock award (RSA) or a restricted stock unit (RSU) is equal to the number of shares subject to the award multiplied by the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant. We estimated the fair value of each performance restricted stock unit (PSU) on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation. Generally, RSUs vest in three equal annual installments following the date of grant. PSUs are granted to key employees and generally vest \nthree years\n from the date of grant subject to the attainment of applicable performance goals during the performance period. The RSAs awarded to non-management members of the Board vest the earlier of \none year\n from the date of the grant or the date of the next annual stockholder meeting. During the vesting period, the holders of the RSAs are entitled to dividends and voting rights. During the vesting period, the holders of the RSUs are paid dividend equivalents in cash to the extent we pay cash dividends. PSUs accrue dividend equivalents to the extent we pay cash dividends on our common stock during the performance and vesting periods. Upon vesting of the PSUs, holders are paid the cash equivalent of the dividends paid during the performance and vesting periods based on the shares of common stock, if any, delivered in settlement of PSUs. Holders of RSUs and PSUs are not entitled to voting rights unless and until the awards have vested.\n100\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nA summary of restricted stock activity during the year ended December 31, 2024 is presented below.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nRestricted Stock Units\nPerformance Restricted Stock Units\n \nShares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nShares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nShares\nWeighted-\nAverage\nGrant-Date\nFair Value\nOutstanding as of December 31, 2023\n24,873\n \n$\n74.79\n \n432,639\n \n$\n67.07\n \n408,445\n \n$\n79.03\n \nGranted\n23,367\n \n79.59\n \n312,712\n \n80.45\n \n153,304\n \n86.76\n \nRestrictions lapsed (vested)\n(1)\n(\n24,873\n)\n74.79\n \n(\n242,668\n)\n58.85\n \n(\n277,241\n)\n77.56\n \nForfeited\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n31,026\n)\n79.56\n \n(\n12,508\n)\n84.04\n \nOutstanding as of December 31, 2024\n23,367\n \n79.59\n \n471,657\n \n79.36\n \n272,000\n \n84.66\n \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nFor performance restricted stock units, the shares represent the performance restricted stock units granted in 2021, for which the three-year performance period ended December 31, 2023.\nThe 2024, 2023 and 2022 weighted-average grant-date fair value for RSAs was $\n79.59\n, $\n74.79\n and $\n95.59\n, for RSUs was $\n80.45\n, $\n81.44\n and $\n71.68\n, and for PSUs was $\n86.76\n, $\n93.61\n and $\n81.38\n, respectively. \nThe actual tax benefit realized from restricted stock vested in each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n14\n million, $\n13\n million and $\n14\n million, respectively.

These segments are differentiated by products. Our chief operating decision maker (CODM) is our President and Chief Executive Officer, who uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. The CODM meets periodically with other members of senior management to analyze segment performance, including comparing actual results to projected results, with consideration to the costs incurred to produce and deliver the product. In addition, our CODM uses gross margin by reportable segment to make key operating decisions, such as the determination of capital expenditures and the allocation of operating budgets, to help guide strategic decisions to align with company-wide goals.

These payments were made in order to mitigate the assessment of future Canadian interest on transfer pricing positions. See Note 12—Income Taxes—“Unrecognized Tax Benefits” for additional information.\n24.   \nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAsset retirement obligations (AROs) are legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. AROs are initially recognized as incurred when sufficient information exists to estimate fair value. We have AROs at our nitrogen manufacturing complexes and at our distribution and storage facilities that are conditional upon cessation of operations. These AROs include certain decommissioning activities as well as the removal and disposal of certain chemicals, waste materials, structures, equipment, vessels, piping and storage tanks. Also included are reclamation of land and the closure of certain effluent ponds and/or waste storage areas. The most recent estimate of the aggregate cost of conditional AROs for our complexes and facilities, expressed in 2024 dollars, is approximately $\n139\n million, which excludes recorded AROs discussed below. \nWe have not recorded a liability for these conditional AROs as of December 31, 2024, because we do not believe there is currently a reasonable basis for estimating a date or range of dates of cessation of operations at our nitrogen manufacturing facilities or our distribution and storage facilities, which is necessary in order to estimate fair value. In reaching this conclusion, we considered the historical performance of each complex or facility and considered factors such as planned maintenance, asset replacements and upgrades of plant and equipment, which if conducted as in the past, can extend the physical lives of our nitrogen manufacturing facilities and our distribution and storage facilities indefinitely. We also considered the possibility of changes in technology, risk of obsolescence, and availability of raw materials in arriving at our conclusion.\nWe have recorded AROs for certain assets for which a fair value can be estimated. As of December 31, 2024, AROs recorded in other current liabilities and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet was approximately $\n5\n million.\n \n106\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\n25.   \nLeases \nWe have operating leases for certain property and equipment under various noncancelable agreements, the most significant of which are rail car leases and barge tow charters for the distribution of our products. The rail car leases currently have minimum terms ranging from \none\n to \neleven years\n and the barge tow charter commitments range from \none\n to \nsix years\n. Our rail car leases and barge tow charters commonly contain provisions for automatic renewal that can extend the lease term unless cancelled by either party. We also have operating leases for terminal and warehouse storage for our distribution system, some of which contain minimum throughput requirements. The storage agreements contain minimum terms generally ranging from \none\n to \nfour years\n and commonly contain provisions for automatic renewal thereafter unless cancelled by either party. The renewal provisions for our rail car leases, barge tow charters and terminal and warehouse storage agreements are not reasonably certain to be exercised. \nThe components of lease costs were as follows:\nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions)\nOperating lease cost\n$\n112\n \n$\n113\n \n$\n103\n \nShort-term lease cost\n40\n \n30\n \n48\n \nVariable lease cost\n5\n \n4\n \n6\n \nTotal lease cost\n$\n157\n \n$\n147\n \n$\n157\n \nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: \nYear ended December 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n \n(in millions)\nOperating cash flows - cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities\n$\n98\n \n$\n107\n \n$\n100\n \nRight-of-use (ROU) assets obtained in exchange for operating lease obligations\n107\n \n103\n \n106\n \nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\n \n(in millions)\nOperating lease ROU assets\n$\n266\n \n$\n259\n \nCurrent operating lease liabilities\n$\n86\n \n$\n96\n \nOperating lease liabilities\n189\n \n168\n \nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$\n275\n \n$\n264\n \nOther information related to leases was as follows:\nDecember 31,\n \n2024\n2023\nOperating leases\nWeighted-average remaining lease term\n5\n years\n5\n years\nWeighted-average discount rate\n5.0\n \n%\n4.7\n \n%\nAs of December 31, 2024, we have entered into four additional leases that have not yet commenced, with future minimum lease payments totaling $\n37\n million with minimum terms ranging from \nfive\n to \nseven years\n.\n107\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe following table reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for our operating leases to the operating lease liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024:\n \nOperating\nlease payments\n \n(in millions)\n2025\n$\n96\n \n2026\n74\n \n2027\n51\n \n2028\n38\n \n2029\n20\n \nThereafter\n39\n \nTotal lease payments\n318\n \nLess: imputed interest\n(\n43\n)\nPresent value of lease liabilities\n275\n \nLess: Current operating lease liabilities\n(\n86\n)\nOperating lease liabilities\n$\n189\n \n108\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nITEM 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.\nNone.\nITEM 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.\n(a)\n    Disclosure Controls and Procedures.\n    The Company’s management, with the participation of the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on such evaluation, the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in (i) ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and (ii) ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including the Company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n(b)    \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    \nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, for the Company. Under the supervision and with the participation of our senior management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, using the criteria set forth in the \nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, 2024. KPMG LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, which appears on the following page.\n(c)\n    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\n    There have not been any changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nWhile there was no impact on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024, beginning in the second quarter of 2025, the Company is implementing a new procurement and plant asset management system. As a result, related changes in its internal control over financial reporting are expected due to the implementation.\n109\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nCF Industries Holdings, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nWe have audited CF Industries Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control \n– \nIntegrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control \n– \n Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 20, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion \nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n(signed) KPMG LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 20, 2025 \n110\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nITEM 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION. \nDuring the quarter ended December 31, 2024, there were no Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (as defined in Item 408(a) of Regulation S-K) or non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangements (as defined in Item 408(c) of Regulation S-K) \nadopted\n or \nterminated\n by any director or officer (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. \nITEM 9C.    DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS.\nNot applicable.\nPART III\nITEM 10.    DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE. \nInformation appearing in the Proxy Statement under the headings “Proposal 1: Election of Directors—Director Nominees”; “Proposal 1: Election of Directors—Director Nominee Biographies”; “Executive Officers”; “Corporate Governance—Committees of the Board—Audit Committee”; and, if required, “Delinquent Section 16(a) Reports” is incorporated herein by reference.\nWe have adopted a Code of Corporate Conduct that applies to our employees, directors and officers, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer.

Toelle served as the members of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board.\nInformation appearing under the following headings of the Proxy Statement is incorporated herein by reference: “Compensation Discussion and Analysis,” “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Compensation Discussion and Analysis: In Detail—Other Compensation Governance Practices and Considerations—Compensation and Benefits Risk Analysis,” “Compensation Committee Report,” “Executive Compensation” and “Corporate Governance—Director Compensation.”\n111\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nITEM 12.    SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.\nInformation appearing under the following headings of the Proxy Statement is incorporated herein by reference: “Common Stock Ownership—Common Stock Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners” and “Common Stock Ownership—Common Stock Ownership of Directors and Management.”\nWe currently issue stock-based compensation under the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan (the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan) which permits grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards, which in each case may be conditioned on performance criteria, to employees and certain consultants of the Company and its subsidiaries and non-employee directors of the Company. \nEquity Compensation Plan Information as of December 31, 2024\nPlan category\nNumber of securities\nto be issued upon\nexercise of\noutstanding options,\nwarrants and rights\n(1)\nWeighted-average\nexercise price of\noutstanding options,\nwarrants and rights\n(2)\nNumber of securities\nremaining available for future\nissuance under equity\ncompensation plans\n(excluding securities\nreflected in the first column)\n(3)\nEquity compensation plans approved by security holders\n1,573,148 \n$\n34.67 \n6,579,925 \nEquity compensation plans not approved by security holders\n— \n— \n— \nTotal\n1,573,148 \n$\n34.67 \n6,579,925 \n_______________________________________________________________________________\n(1)\nIncludes 76,645 shares issuable pursuant to outstanding nonqualified stock options, 471,657 shares issuable pursuant to restricted stock units (RSUs) and 1,024,846 shares issuable pursuant to performance restricted stock units (PSUs) under the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan, the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan (the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan) and the CF Industries Holdings, Inc. 2009 Equity Incentive Plan. PSUs are subject to attainment of the applicable performance goals during the three-year performance period and are reflected at their maximum potential payout. The PSUs included in this table reflect the full amount awarded to plan participants in 2022, 2023 and 2024. The three-year performance periods for the PSUs awarded in 2022, 2023 and 2024 are in each case composed of three one-year periods with performance goals set annually. Because accounting rules require performance goals to be set before a PSU is determined for accounting purposes to have been granted, the number of PSUs reported as outstanding as of December 31, 2024 in Note 21—Stock-based Compensation reflects all of the PSUs awarded in 2022, but only two-thirds of the PSUs awarded in 2023 and one-third of the PSUs awarded in 2024. \n(2)\nRSUs and PSUs are not reflected in the weighted-average exercise price as these awards do not have an exercise price.\n(3)\nUnder the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan, upon the grant of an award, the number of shares available for issuance is reduced by one share for each share subject to or issued in respect of such awards. Under the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan, shares withheld for taxes on awards are added to the number of shares available for issuance. If any restricted stock units (including any performance restricted stock units) granted under the 2014 Equity and Incentive Plan terminates or expires without delivery of shares, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan is increased by 1.61 shares for each share that had been subject to such restricted stock unit at the time of such termination or expiration.\nSee Note 21—Stock-based Compensation for additional information on the 2022 Equity and Incentive Plan.\nITEM 13.    CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS, AND DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE. \nInformation appearing in the Proxy Statement under the headings “Corporate Governance—Director Independence” and “Policy Regarding Related Person Transactions” is incorporated herein by reference.\nITEM 14.    PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT FEES AND SERVICES. \nInformation appearing in the Proxy Statement under the headings “Proposal 3: Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2025—Audit and Non-Audit Fees” and “Proposal 3: Ratification of Selection of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm for 2025—Pre-Approval of Audit and Non-Audit Services” is incorporated herein by reference.\n112\nTable of Contents\nCF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, INC.\nPART IV\nITEM 15.    EXHIBITS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES.\n(a)\nDocuments filed as part of this report:\n(1)\nAll financial statements:\n        The following financial statements are included in Part II, Item 8.
