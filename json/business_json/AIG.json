Terrorism risks are modeled using a third-party vendor model for various terrorism attack modes and scenarios. Adjustments are made to account for vendor model gaps and the nature of the General Insurance companies’ exposures. \nOur largest terrorism concentrations are in New York City, and estimated losses are largely driven by the Property and Workers’ Compensation lines of business. Our exposure to terrorism risk in the U.S. is mitigated by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (TRIPRA) in addition to limited private reinsurance protections. TRIPRA covers certified terrorist attacks within the U.S. or U.S. missions and against certain U.S. carriers or vessels and excludes certain lines of business as specified by applicable law. \nWe offer terrorism coverage in many other countries through various insurance products and participate in country terrorism pools when applicable. International terrorism exposure is estimated using scenario-based modeling and exposure concentration is monitored routinely. Targeted reinsurance purchases are made for some lines of business to cover potential losses due to terrorist attacks. We also rely on the government-sponsored and government-arranged terrorism reinsurance programs, including pools, in force in applicable non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nReinsurance Activities\nWe purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations. Reinsurance facilitates insurance risk management (retention, volatility, concentrations) and capital planning. We may purchase reinsurance on a pooled basis. \nReinsurance is used primarily to manage overall capital adequacy and mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events, such as natural and man-made catastrophes, death events, or single policy level events. Our subsidiaries operate worldwide primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct account on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those risks exceed the desired retention level. In addition, as a condition of certain direct underwriting transactions, we may be required by clients, agents or regulation to cede all or a portion of risks to specified reinsurance entities, such as captives, other insurers, local reinsurers and compulsory pools.\nReinsurance contracts do not relieve our subsidiaries from their direct obligations to insureds. However, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses.\nReinsurance Recoverable\nAIG’s reinsurance recoverable assets are comprised of paid losses recoverable, ceded loss reserves, ceded reserves for unearned premiums, and Life and Annuity reinsurance recoverables (ceded policy and claim reserves and policyholder contract deposits).\nAt December 31, 2024, total reinsurance recoverable assets were $38.0 billion. These assets include general reinsurance paid losses recoverable of $3.8 billion, ceded loss reserves of $29.1 billion including reserves for IBNR claims, and ceded reserves for unearned premiums of $4.3 billion, as well as life reinsurance recoverable of $0.8 billion. The methods used to estimate IBNR and to establish the resulting ultimate losses involve projecting the frequency and severity of losses over multiple years. These methods are continually reviewed and updated by management. Any adjustments are reflected in income. We believe that the amount recorded for ceded loss reserves at December 31, 2024 reflects a reasonable estimate of the ultimate losses recoverable. Actual losses may, however, differ from the reserves currently ceded.\nAt December 31, 2024, we held $20.1 billion of collateral, in the form of funds withheld, securities in reinsurance trust accounts and/or irrevocable letters of credit, in support of reinsurance recoverable assets from unaffiliated reinsurers.\nAt December 31, 2024, we had no significant reinsurance recoverable due from any individual reinsurer that was financially troubled. Reduced profitability associated with lower interest rates, market volatility and catastrophe losses (including COVID-19), could potentially result in reduced capacity or rating downgrades for some reinsurers. The Reinsurance Credit Department, in conjunction with the credit executives within ERM, reviews these developments, monitors compliance with credit triggers that may require AIG's reinsurer to post collateral, and seeks to use other appropriate means to mitigate any material risks arising from these developments.\nFor additional information on reinsurance recoverable, see Critical Accounting Estimates – Reinsurance Assets.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n87\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nGlossary\nGlossary\nAccident year  \nThe annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid.\nAccident year combined ratio, as adjusted (Accident year combined ratio, ex-CAT)  \nThe combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.\nAccident year loss ratio, as adjusted (Accident year loss ratio, ex-CAT)  \nThe loss ratio excluding catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums, prior year development, net of premium adjustments, and the impact of reserve discounting.\nAcquisition ratio  \nAcquisition costs divided by net premiums earned.

We believe this measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the fair value of investments that can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in market conditions. We also exclude the portion of DTA representing U.S. tax attributes related to net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs), corporate alternative minimum tax credits (CAMTCs) and foreign tax credits (FTCs) that have not yet been utilized. Amounts for interim periods are estimates based on projections of full-year attribute utilization. As NOLs, CAMTCs and FTCs are utilized, the corresponding portion of the DTA utilized is included. We exclude AIG’s ownership interest in Corebridge since it is not a core long-term investment for AIG.

If the amount of premium paid by the ceding reinsurer is less than the related ceded loss reserves, the resulting gain is deferred and amortized over the settlement period of the reserves. Any related development on the ceded loss reserves recoverable under the contract would increase the deferred gain if unfavorable, or decrease the deferred gain if favorable.\nExpense ratio  \nSum of acquisition expenses and general operating expenses, divided by net premiums earned.\nGeneral operating expense ratio  \nGeneral operating expenses divided by net premiums earned. General operating expenses are those costs that are generally attributed to the support infrastructure of the organization and include but are not limited to personnel costs, projects and bad debt expenses. General operating expenses exclude losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, acquisition expenses, and investment expenses.\nIBNR  \nIncurred But Not Reported  \nEstimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported to us.\nISDA Master Agreement  \nAn agreement between two counterparties, which may have multiple derivative transactions with each other governed by such agreement, that generally provides for the net settlement of all or a specified group of these derivative transactions, as well as pledged collateral, through a single payment, in a single currency, in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions.\nLoan-to-value ratio  \nPrincipal amount of loan amount divided by appraised value of collateral securing the loan.\nLoss Adjustment Expenses\n \nThe expenses directly attributed to settling and paying claims of insureds and include, but are not limited to, legal fees, adjuster’s fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim settlement costs.\nLoss ratio  \nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned.\nLoss reserve development  \nThe increase or decrease in incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to prior years as a result of the re-estimation of loss reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims.\nLoss reserves  \nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO)\n.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO\n.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n92\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8 | \nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Insurance Liabilities - Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses (Loss Reserves), Net of Reinsurance\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, loss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of unpaid claims, including estimates for claims incurred but not reported and loss adjustment expenses, less applicable discount. As of December 31, 2024, the Company’s net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses was $40.1 billion. As disclosed by management, the estimate of the loss reserves relies on several key judgments, including (i) actuarial methods, (ii) relative weights given to these methods by product line, (iii) underlying actuarial assumptions, and (iv) groupings of similar product lines. Actuarial assumptions include (i) expected loss ratios and (ii) loss development factors. During management’s actuarial reviews, various factors are considered, including economic conditions; the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment; medical cost trends; policy pricing, terms and conditions; changes in the claims handling process; and the impact of reinsurance. As described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, management uses a combination of actuarial methods to project ultimate losses for both long-tail and short-tail exposures.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of insurance liabilities - loss reserves, net of reinsurance is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing their estimate, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment in performing the audit procedures related to the estimate, (ii) the significant audit effort and judgment in evaluating the audit evidence related to the actuarial methods, weights given to these methods by product line, groupings of similar product lines, and the aforementioned actuarial assumptions, and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of the net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense, including controls over the selection of actuarial methods and development of significant assumptions, as well as controls designed to identify and address management bias and contrary evidence. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing one or a combination of procedures for a sample of product lines, including (i) independently estimating reserves using actual historical data and loss development patterns, as well as industry data and other benchmarks, and comparing management’s actuarially determined reserves to these independent estimates and (ii) evaluating management’s actuarial reserving methods and aforementioned factors, including actuarial assumptions and judgments impacting loss reserves and the consistency of management’s approach period-over-period. Performing these procedures involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data used by management on a sample basis. \n/s/ \nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 13, 2025\nWe

Consolidated Financial Statements\n |\n \n1. Basis of Presentation\n1. Basis of Presentation\nAmerican International Group, Inc. is a leading global insurance organization. AIG provides insurance solutions that help businesses and individuals in over \n200\n countries and jurisdictions protect their assets and manage risks through AIG operations, licenses and authorizations as well as network partners. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “AIG,” “we,” “us,” “our” or \"the Company\" mean American International Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, and the term “AIG Parent” means American International Group, Inc. and not any of its consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of AIG Parent, our controlled subsidiaries (generally through a greater than 50 percent ownership of voting rights and voting interests), and variable interest entities (VIEs) of which we are the primary beneficiary. \nEquity investments in entities that we do not consolidate, including corporate entities in which we have significant influence and partnership and partnership-like entities in which we have more than minor influence over the operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method unless we have elected the fair value option.\nPrior to the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2022, certain of our foreign property and casualty subsidiaries reported on the basis of a fiscal year ending November 30. The effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations of all material events occurring at these subsidiaries from November 30 through December 31 of the periods previously presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements was considered for adjustment and/or disclosure.\nEffective with the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022, the foreign property and casualty subsidiaries now report on a calendar year ending December 31. The elimination of a one-month reporting lag of a subsidiary is considered a change in accounting principle. We believe this change in accounting principle is preferable given that it aligns the reporting dates with other consolidated entities, which allows for a timelier and more consistent basis of reporting within our Consolidated Financial Statements. A change in accounting principle requires retrospective application. However, we determined that the effect of not retroactively applying this change was not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the current and prior periods. Therefore, we reported the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle within the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss) for the year ended December 31, 2022 and did not retrospectively apply the effects of this change to prior periods. The adoption impact was an increase to net income of $\n100\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP).\n \nAll material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n \nSALES/DISPOSALS OF ASSETS AND BUSINESSES\nCrop Risk Services\nOn July 3, 2023, AIG closed the sale of Crop Risk Services, Inc. (CRS) to American Financial Group, Inc. (AFG) and in substance, AIG exited the crop business. The gross proceeds, before deducting commissions, were $\n234\n million, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $\n72\n million for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n. \nValidus Re\nOn November 1, 2023, AIG completed the sale of Validus Reinsurance, Ltd. (Validus Re), including AlphaCat Managers Ltd. and the Talbot Treaty reinsurance business, to RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd. (RenaissanceRe) and received cash proceeds of $\n2.7\n billion from RenaissanceRe and \n1.3\n million shares of RenaissanceRe common stock valued at $\n290\n million as of the closing date, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $\n78\n million for the \nyear ended December 31, 2023\n. The results of Validus Re are reported in North America Commercial and International Commercial segments.\nAdditionally, AIG agreed to retain \n95\n percent of the difference between (i) the reserves with respect to the business as of the closing date of the sale for losses occurring prior to the closing date and (ii) the associated reserve development following the closing date with respect to such losses. Any reserve development will be settled annually, commencing with the calendar year ending December 31, 2024. This arrangement stays in effect until the parties determine to terminate such arrangement (which they will re-evaluate on an annual basis beginning 5 years after the closing date) or until all such liabilities of the acquired reinsurance business have run off. The reserve cover is considered contingent consideration and was recognized at fair value of $\n130\n million when the sale closed.\n100\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8 | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n |\n \n1. Basis of Presentation\nOn September 4, 2023, AIG entered into an Adverse Development Cover Excess of Loss Agreement (the ADC Agreement) to hedge the risk of adverse development pertaining to Validus Re’s reserves with Clarendon National Insurance Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of Enstar Group Limited. Under the ADC Agreement, AIG will be reimbursed up to $\n400\n million of adverse development for all policies in force as of December 31, 2022 when paid losses exceed the baseline reserve balance of $\n3.043\n billion. The premium expensed in connection with the ADC Agreement was $\n80\n million. \nGlobal Personal Travel Business\nOn December 2, 2024, AIG concluded the sale of its global individual personal travel insurance and assistance business to Zurich Insurance Group (Zurich) for $\n600\n million in cash plus additional earn-out consideration, resulting in a pre-tax gain of $\n511\n million for the \nyear ended December 31, 2024\n. The global individual personal travel insurance and assistance business is reported in Global Personal segment. AIG has also agreed to provide transition services to Zurich for \n30\n months after the transaction date. Additionally, AIG has fronting agreements in place to front \n100\n percent of all new travel business produced by Zurich; whereby all of the economics of the new travel business will pass to Zurich through the fronting arrangements which is recognized as a component of Net gain (loss) on divestitures and other.\nOTHER EVENTS\nOn December 14, 2022, AIG announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, AIG Financial Products Corp. (AIGFP), filed a voluntary petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and filed a proposed plan of reorganization. The reorganization will not have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheets of AIG or our respective businesses. AIGFP has no material operations or businesses and no employees. In conjunction with the bankruptcy filing, AIGFP and its consolidated subsidiaries were deconsolidated from the results of AIG, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $\n114\n million for the year ended December 31, 2022, reported in Net gain (loss) on divestitures and other. In addition, AIGFP and its subsidiaries were determined to be an unconsolidated variable interest entity\n.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the application of accounting policies that often involve a significant degree of judgment. Accounting policies that we believe are most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions are considered our critical accounting estimates and are related to the determination of:\n•\nloss reserves;\n•\nreinsurance assets, including the allowance for credit losses and disputes;\n•\nallowance for credit losses on certain investments, primarily on loans and available for sale fixed maturity securities;\n•\nfair value measurements of certain financial assets and financial liabilities;\n•\nincome taxes, in particular the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and establishment of provisions for uncertain tax positions; and\n•\ngoodwill impairment.\nThese accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially affected.\n \n \nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n101\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n |\n \n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n \nThe following list identifies our significant accounting policies presented in other Notes to these Consolidated Financial Statements, with a reference to the Note where a detailed description can be found:\nNote 6. \n Investments\n•\nFixed maturity and equity securities\n•\nOther invested assets \n•\nNet investment income\n•\nNet realized gains (losses)\n•\nAllowance for credit losses\nNote 7. \n Lending Activities\n•\nMortgage and other loans receivable – net of allowance\nNote 8.  \nReinsurance\n•\nReinsurance assets – net of allowance\n•\nRetroactive reinsurance\nNote 9. \n Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nNote 10.\n  Variable Interest Entities\nNote 11.\n  Derivatives and Hedge Accounting\n•\nDerivative assets and liabilities, at fair value\nNote 12. \n Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nNote 13.  \nInsurance Liabilities\n•\nLiability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n•\nDiscounting of reserves\nNote 14.  \nDebt\n•\nLong-term debt\n•\nDebt of consolidated investment entities\nNote 15. \n Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees\n•\nLegal contingencies\nNote 17. \n Earnings Per Common Share (EPS)\nNote 21.  \nIncome Taxes\nOTHER SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPremiums\n are presented net of reinsurance, as applicable. Premiums for short-duration contracts are recorded as written on the inception date of the policy. Premiums are earned primarily on a pro rata basis over the term of the related coverage. Sales of extended services contracts are reflected as premiums written and earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related coverage. In addition, certain miscellaneous income is included as premiums written and earned. The reserve for unearned premiums includes the portion of premiums written relating to the unexpired terms of coverage. Reinsurance premiums are typically earned over the same period as the underlying policies or risks covered by the contract. As a result, the earnings pattern of a reinsurance contract may extend up to \n24\n months, reflecting the inception dates of the underlying policies throughout the year. Premiums from long-duration life products, other than universal and variable life contracts, are recognized as revenues when due. \nReinsurance premiums for assumed business are estimated based on information received from ceding companies and reinsurers. Any subsequent differences that arise regarding such estimates are recorded in the periods in which they are determined.\n \nCash\n \nrepresents cash on hand and demand deposits.\nShort-term investments \ninclude interest bearing investments and time deposits. Securities included within short-term investments are stated at estimated fair value.\nPremiums and other receivables – net of allowance for credit losses and disputes\n \ninclude premium balances receivable, amounts due from agents and brokers and policyholders, receivables resulting from sales of securities that had not yet settled, cash collateral posted to derivative counterparties that is not eligible to be netted against derivative liabilities and other receivables.\nDeposit assets and liabilities\n \nWe have entered into certain insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not contain sufficient insurance risk to be accounted for as insurance or reinsurance. When we receive premiums on such contracts, the premiums received, after deduction for certain related expenses, are recorded as deposits within Deposit accounting liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net proceeds of these deposits are invested and generate Net investment income. When we pay premiums on such contracts, the premiums paid are recorded as deposits within Deposit accounting assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The deposit asset or liability is adjusted as amounts are paid, consistent with the underlying contracts. Deferred gains on retroactive reinsurance agreements are also reflected within deposit accounting liabilities.\nOther assets \nconsist of prepaid expenses, deposits, other deferred charges, real estate, other fixed assets, capitalized software costs, goodwill, intangible assets other than goodwill, restricted cash, derivative assets, and accrued interest income.\n102\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n |\n \n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nThe cost of buildings and furniture and equipment is depreciated principally on the straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives (maximum of \n40\n years for buildings and \n10\n years for furniture and fixtures). Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to income as incurred and expenditures for improvements are capitalized and depreciated. We periodically assess the carrying amount of our real estate for purposes of determining any asset impairment. Capitalized software costs, which represent costs directly related to obtaining, developing or upgrading internal use software, are capitalized and amortized using the straight-line method over a period generally not exceeding \nten years\n.\n \nOther liabilities \nconsist of other funds on deposit, other payables, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities sold but not yet purchased, liabilities resulting from purchases of securities that have not yet settled, derivative liabilities, cash collateral received from derivative counterparties that contractually cannot be netted against derivative assets and allowance for credit losses in relation to off-balance sheet commitments.\nForeign currency \nFinancial statement accounts expressed in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars. Functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars generally using rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date of each respective subsidiary and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income, net of any related taxes, in Total AIG shareholders’ equity. Income statement accounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates during the period. Functional currencies are generally the currencies of the local operating environment. Financial statement accounts expressed in currencies other than the functional currency of a consolidated entity are remeasured into that entity’s functional currency resulting in exchange gains or losses recorded in income. The adjustments resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign entities operating in highly inflationary economies are recorded in income.\nNon-redeemable noncontrolling interest\n is the portion of equity (net assets) and net income (loss) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to AIG.\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED DURING 2024\nFair Value Measurement\nOn June 30, 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update to address diversity in practice by clarifying that a contractual sale restriction should not be considered in the measurement of the fair value of an equity security. It also requires entities with investments in equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions to disclose certain qualitative and quantitative information about such securities. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2024, prospectively for entities other than investment companies. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on AIG Consolidated Financial Statements. \nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to address improvements to reportable segment disclosures. The standard primarily requires the following disclosure on an annual and interim basis: (i) significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision makers (CODMs) and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss; and (ii) other segment items and description of its composition. The standard also requires current annual disclosures about a reportable segment's profits or losses and assets to be disclosed in interim periods and the title and position of the CODMs with an explanation of how the CODMs uses the reported measure(s) of segment profits or losses in assessing segment performance. The Company adopted the standard for its 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K, retrospectively. \nFor additional detail, see Note 3\nFUTURE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nIncome Tax\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued an accounting standard update to address improvements to income tax disclosures. The standard requires disaggregated information about a company’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. The standard should be applied on a prospective basis, but retrospective application is permitted. We are assessing the impact of this standard.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nOn November 4, 2024, the FASB issued new guidance requiring additional disclosure of the nature of expenses included in the income statement. The new standard requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the income statement. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim reporting periods within annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027. The requirements will be applied prospectively with the option for retrospective application. We are assessing the impact of the standard.\n \nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n103\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n3. Segment Information\n3. Segment Information\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company realigned its organizational structure and the composition of its reportable segments to reflect changes in how the Company manages its operations, specifically the level at which its chief operating decision makers (CODMs) regularly review operating results and allocate resources. Our CODMs are the chief executive officer (CEO) and chief financial officer (CFO). The CODMs evaluate performance of the segments based on underwriting income (loss). The CODMs use this measure to benchmark AIG’s performance, assessing performance of the segments and in establishing management’s compensation.\nAIG has \nthree\n reportable segments: North America Commercial, International Commercial and Global Personal. Prior years’ presentations have been recast to conform to the new reportable segments. Our General Insurance business (General Insurance) consists of our \nthree\n segments and the Net investment income related to our insurance operations.\nNORTH AMERICA COMMERCIAL \nNorth America Commercial consists of insurance businesses in the United States, Canada and Bermuda.\nINTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL \nInternational Commercial consists of insurance businesses in Japan, the United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA region), Asia Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean, and China. International also includes the results of Talbot Underwriting Ltd. as well as AIG’s Global Specialty business.\nGLOBAL PERSONAL\nGlobal Personal consists primarily of insurance businesses in the United States as well as Japan, the United Kingdom, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA region), Asia Pacific, Latin America and Caribbean, and China. \nPRODUCTS\nThe segments consist of the following products:\n–\nNorth America and International Commercial consists of Property & Short Tail, Casualty, Financial Lines and Global Specialty.\n–\nGlobal Personal consists of Global Accident & Health and Personal Lines.\nFor further discussion on recent activity in the General Insurance business, see Note 1. \nOTHER OPERATIONS\nOther Operations predominantly consists of Net Investment Income from our AIG Parent liquidity portfolio, Corebridge dividend income, corporate General operating expenses, and Interest expense. \nSEGMENT RESULTS\nManagement uses Underwriting income (loss) as the basis for the segment performance reviews. AIG calculates Underwriting income (loss) by subtracting Losses and loss adjustment expense incurred, Amortization of DAC, Other acquisition cost, and General operating expense from Net premiums earned.

Discontinued Operations Presentation\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS PRESENTATION\nWe present a business, or a component of an entity, as discontinued operations if a) it meets the held-for-sale criteria, or is disposed of by sale, or is disposed of other than by sale, and b) the disposal of the business, or component of an entity, represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on AIG’s financial results.\nPre-Deconsolidation of Corebridge\nCorebridge completed its initial public offering in September 2022 and AIG continued to sell its interest in Corebridge through secondary offerings. On May 16, 2024, AIG entered into a stock purchase agreement with Corebridge and Nippon Life Insurance Company (Nippon). On June 3, 2024, AIG closed on a secondary offering of \n30\n million shares of Corebridge common stock. The sale was recorded as an equity transaction as AIG controlled Corebridge as of the transaction date. The aggregate gross proceeds of the offering, before deducting underwriting discounts and commission and other expenses payable by AIG, were $\n876\n million. As a result of the offering, AIG recorded an increase of $\n261\n million in Total AIG shareholders' equity.\nDeconsolidation of Corebridge\nOn June 9, 2024, AIG held \n48.4\n percent of Corebridge common stock, waived its right to majority representation on the Corebridge Board of Directors and one of AIG's designees resigned from the Corebridge Board of Directors as of June 9, 2024 (the Deconsolidation Date). As a result, AIG met the requirements for the deconsolidation of Corebridge. \nIn the second quarter of 2024, AIG recognized a loss of $\n4.8\n billion as a result of the deconsolidation, mainly due to the recognition of an accumulated comprehensive loss of $\n7.2\n billion. The loss is recorded as a component of discontinued operations.\nThe historical financial results of Corebridge, for all periods presented, are reflected in these Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations. In addition, the assets and liabilities of Corebridge are classified as Assets of discontinued operations and Liabilities of discontinued operations in AIG’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2023. \nPost Deconsolidation of Corebridge\nSubsequent to the Deconsolidation Date, AIG elected the fair value option and reflects its retained interest in Corebridge as an equity method investment in Other invested assets using Corebridge’s stock price as its fair value. Dividends received from Corebridge and changes in its stock price are recognized in Net investment income.\nFrom August 2024 to November 2024, AIG sold approximately \n43\n million shares of Corebridge common stocks. The aggregate proceeds received from these transactions were approximately $\n1.3\n billion.\nOn December 9, 2024, AIG completed the sale of approximately \n120\n million shares of its Corebridge common stock, representing a \n21.6\n percent ownership stake, to Nippon for $\n31.47\n per share for an aggregate purchase price of $\n3.8\n billion, which resulted in a $\n282\n million gain recognized in Net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2024.\nDue to share repurchases by Corebridge and sale of shares by AIG after the Deconsolidation Date, as of December 31, 2024, AIG held \n22.7\n percent of the outstanding common stock of Corebridge. \nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n107\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n4.

Fair Value Measurements\n5. Fair Value Measurements\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS\nWe carry certain of our financial instruments at fair value. We define the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We are responsible for the determination of the value of the investments carried at fair value and the supporting methodologies and assumptions.\nThe degree of judgment used in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally inversely correlates with the level of observable valuation inputs. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Financial instruments with quoted prices in active markets generally have more pricing observability and less judgment is used in measuring fair value. Conversely, financial instruments for which no quoted prices are available have less observability and are measured at fair value using valuation models or other pricing techniques that require more judgment. Pricing observability is affected by a number of factors, including the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established, the characteristics specific to the transaction, liquidity and general market conditions.\nFair Value Hierarchy\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are measured and classified in accordance with a fair value hierarchy consisting of three “levels” based on the observability of valuation inputs:\n•\nLevel 1:\n Fair value measurements based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that we have the ability to access for identical assets or liabilities. Market price data generally is obtained from exchange or dealer markets. We do not adjust the quoted price for such instruments.\n•\nLevel 2:\n Fair value measurements based on inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.\n•\nLevel 3:\n Fair value measurements based on valuation techniques that use significant inputs that are unobservable. Both observable and unobservable inputs may be used to determine the fair values of positions classified in Level 3. The circumstances for using these measurements include those in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability. Therefore, we must make certain assumptions about the inputs a hypothetical market participant would use to value that asset or liability.\nIn certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. \nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for instruments carried at fair value. These methodologies are applied to assets and liabilities across the levels discussed above, and the observability of the inputs used determines the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for the respective asset or liability.\nVALUATION METHODOLOGIES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE\nIncorporation of Credit Risk in Fair Value Measurements\n•\nOur Own Credit Risk.\n  Fair value measurements for certain liabilities incorporate our own credit risk by determining the explicit cost for each counterparty to protect against its net credit exposure to us at the balance sheet date by reference to observable AIG credit default swaps (CDS) or cash bond spreads. We calculate the effect of credit spread changes using discounted cash flow techniques that incorporate current market interest rates. A derivative counterparty’s net credit exposure to us is determined based on master netting agreements, when applicable, which take into consideration all derivative positions with us, as well as collateral we post with the counterparty at the balance sheet date. \n•\nCounterparty Credit Risk.\n  Fair value measurements for freestanding derivatives incorporate counterparty credit by determining the explicit cost for us to protect against our net credit exposure to each counterparty at the balance sheet date by reference to observable counterparty CDS spreads, when available. When not available, other directly or indirectly observable credit spreads will be used to derive the best estimates of the counterparty spreads. Our net credit exposure to a counterparty is determined based on master netting agreements, which take into consideration all derivative positions with the counterparty, as well as collateral posted by the counterparty at the balance sheet date.\n110\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n5. Fair Value Measurements\nFair values for fixed maturity securities based on observable market prices for identical or similar instruments implicitly incorporate counterparty credit risk. Fair values for fixed maturity securities based on internal models incorporate counterparty credit risk by using discount rates that take into consideration cash issuance spreads for similar instruments or other observable information.\nFor fair values measured based on internal models, the cost of credit protection is determined under a discounted present value approach considering the market levels for single name CDS spreads for each specific counterparty, the mid-market value of the net exposure (reflecting the amount of protection required) and the weighted average life of the net exposure. CDS spreads are provided to us by an independent third party. We utilize an interest rate based on the appropriate benchmark curve to derive our discount rates.\nWhile this approach does not explicitly consider all potential future behavior of the derivative transactions or potential future changes in valuation inputs, we believe this approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the assets and liabilities, including consideration of the impact of non-performance risk.\nFixed Maturity Securities\nWhenever available, we obtain quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure fixed maturity securities at fair value. Market price data is generally obtained from dealer markets.\nWe employ independent third-party valuation service providers to gather, analyze, and interpret market information to derive fair value estimates for individual investments, based upon market-accepted methodologies and assumptions. The methodologies used by these independent third-party valuation service providers are reviewed and understood by management, through periodic discussion with and information provided by the independent third-party valuation service providers. In addition, as discussed further below, control processes designed to ensure the accuracy of these values are applied to the fair values received from independent third-party valuation service providers.\nValuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of market-accepted valuation methodologies, which may utilize matrix pricing, financial models, accompanying model inputs and various assumptions, provide a single fair value measurement for individual securities. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from completed transactions for identical securities and transactions for comparable securities, benchmark yields, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, prepayment rates, default rates, recovery assumptions, currency rates, quoted prices for similar securities and other market-observable information, as applicable. If fair value is determined using financial models, these models generally take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued, including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and when applicable, collateral quality and other security or issuer-specific information. When market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied in determining fair value is greatly increased.\nWe have control processes designed to ensure that the fair values received from independent third-party valuation service providers are accurately recorded, that their data inputs and valuation techniques are appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions used appear reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value. We assess the reasonableness of individual security values received from independent third-party valuation service providers through various analytical techniques, and have procedures to escalate related questions internally and to the independent third-party valuation service providers for resolution. To assess the degree of pricing consensus among various valuation service providers for specific asset types, we conduct comparisons of prices received from available sources. We use these comparisons to establish a hierarchy for the fair values received from independent third-party valuation service providers to be used for particular security classes. We also validate prices for selected securities through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investing transactions.\nWhen our independent third-party valuation service providers are unable to obtain sufficient market observable information upon which to estimate the fair value for a particular security, fair value is determined either by requesting brokers who are knowledgeable about these securities to provide a price quote, which is generally non-binding, or by employing market accepted valuation models internally or via our third party asset managers. Broker prices may be based on an income approach, which converts expected future cash flows to a single present value amount, with specific consideration of inputs relevant to particular security types. For structured securities, such inputs may include ratings, collateral types, geographic concentrations, underlying loan vintages, loan delinquencies and defaults, loss severity assumptions, prepayments, and weighted average coupons and maturities. When the volume or level of market activity for a security is limited, certain inputs used to determine fair value may not be observable in the market. Broker prices may also be based on a market approach that considers recent transactions involving identical or similar securities. Fair values provided by brokers are subject to similar control processes to those noted above for fair values from independent third-party valuation service providers, including management reviews. For those corporate debt instruments (for example, private placements) that are not traded in active markets or that are subject to transfer restrictions, valuations reflect illiquidity and non-transferability, based on available market evidence. When observable price quotations are not available, fair value is determined based on discounted cash flow models using discount rates based on credit spreads, yields or price levels of comparable securities, adjusted \nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n111\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n5. Fair Value Measurements\nfor illiquidity and structure. Fair values determined internally or via our third party asset managers are also subject to management review to ensure that valuation models and related inputs are reasonable.\nThe methodology above is relevant for all fixed maturity securities including residential mortgage backed securities (RMBS), commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLO), other asset‑backed securities (ABS) and fixed maturity securities issued by government sponsored entities and corporate entities.\nEquity Securities Traded in Active Markets\nWhenever available, we obtain quoted prices in active markets for identical assets at the balance sheet date to measure equity securities at fair value. Market price data is generally obtained from exchange or dealer markets.\nMortgage and Other Loans Receivable\nWe estimate the fair value of mortgage and other loans receivable that are measured at fair value by using dealer quotations, discounted cash flow analyses and/or internal valuation models. The determination of fair value considers inputs such as interest rate, maturity, the borrower’s creditworthiness, collateral, subordination, guarantees, past-due status, yield curves, credit curves, prepayment rates, market pricing for comparable loans and other relevant factors.\nOther Invested Assets\nWe initially estimate the fair value of investments in certain hedge funds, private equity funds and other investment partnerships by reference to the transaction price. Subsequently, we generally obtain the fair value of these investments from net asset value information provided by the general partner or manager of the investments, the financial statements of which are generally audited annually. We consider observable market data and perform certain control procedures to validate the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement. The fair values of other investments carried at fair value, such as direct private equity holdings, are initially determined based on transaction price and are subsequently estimated based on available evidence such as market transactions in similar instruments, other financing transactions of the issuer and other available financial information for the issuer, with adjustments made to reflect illiquidity as appropriate. AIG's retained investments in Corebridge, for which we have elected the fair value option, is determined using Corebridge's stock price as its fair value. \nShort-term Investments\nFor short-term investments that are measured at amortized cost, the carrying amounts of these assets approximate fair values because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization, and their limited exposure to credit risk. Securities purchased under agreements to resell (reverse repurchase agreements) are generally treated as collateralized receivables. We report certain receivables arising from securities purchased under agreements to resell as Short-term investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When these receivables are measured at fair value, we use market-observable interest rates to determine fair value.\nFreestanding Derivatives\nDerivative assets and liabilities can be exchange-traded or traded over-the-counter (OTC). We generally value exchange-traded derivatives such as futures and options using quoted prices in active markets for identical derivatives at the balance sheet date.\nOTC derivatives are valued using market transactions and other market evidence whenever possible, including market-based inputs to models, model calibration to market clearing transactions, broker or dealer quotations or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. When models are used, the selection of a particular model to value an OTC derivative depends on the contractual terms of, and specific risks inherent in the instrument, as well as the availability of pricing information in the market. We generally use similar models to value similar instruments. Valuation models require a variety of inputs, including contractual terms, market prices and rates, yield curves, credit curves, measures of volatility, prepayment rates and correlations of such inputs. For OTC derivatives that trade in liquid markets, such as generic forwards, swaps and options, model inputs can generally be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means, and model selection does not involve significant management judgment.\nFor certain OTC derivatives that trade in less liquid markets, where we generally do not have corroborating market evidence to support significant model inputs and cannot verify the model to market transactions, the transaction price may provide the best estimate of fair value. Accordingly, when a pricing model is used to value such an instrument, the model is adjusted so the model value at inception equals the transaction price. We will update valuation inputs in these models only when corroborated by evidence such as similar market transactions, independent third-party valuation service providers and/or broker or dealer quotations, or other empirical market data. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management’s best estimate is used.\n112\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n5. Fair Value Measurements\nWe value our super senior credit default swap portfolio using prices obtained from vendors and/or counterparties. The valuation of the super senior credit derivatives is complex because of the limited availability of market observable information due to the lack of trading and price transparency in certain structured finance markets. Our valuation methodologies for the super senior CDS portfolio have evolved over time in response to market conditions and the availability of market observable information. We have sought to calibrate the methodologies to available market information and to review the assumptions of the methodologies on a regular basis.\nFortitude Re funds withheld payable\nThe reinsurance transactions between AIG and Fortitude Re were structured as modco and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld (funds withheld). AIG has established a funds withheld payable to Fortitude Re while simultaneously establishing a reinsurance asset representing reserves for the insurance coverage that Fortitude Re has assumed. The funds withheld payable contains an embedded derivative and changes in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the funds withheld payable are recognized in earnings through realized gains (losses). This embedded derivative is considered a total return swap with contractual returns that are attributable to various assets and liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements.\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities measured at fair value include certain securities sold under agreements to repurchase and certain securities sold but not yet purchased. Liabilities arising from securities sold under agreements to repurchase are generally treated as collateralized borrowings. We estimate the fair value of liabilities arising under these agreements by using market-observable interest rates. This methodology considers such factors as the coupon rate, yield curves and other relevant factors. Fair values for securities sold but not yet purchased are based on current market prices.  \nASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS\nThe following table presents information about assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and indicates the level of the fair value measurement based on the observability of the inputs used:\nDecember 31, 2024\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nCounterparty\nNetting\n(a)\nCash\nCollateral\nTotal\n(in millions)\nAssets:\nBonds available for sale:\nU.S. government and government sponsored entities\n$\n36\n \n$\n3,231\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,267\n \nObligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions\n—\n \n3,140\n \n3\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3,143\n \nNon-U.S. governments\n161\n \n7,939\n \n7\n \n—\n \n—\n \n8,107\n \nCorporate debt\n—\n \n31,586\n \n240\n \n—\n \n—\n \n31,826\n \nRMBS\n—\n \n6,710\n \n1,894\n \n—\n \n—\n \n8,604\n \nCMBS\n—\n \n3,900\n \n26\n \n—\n \n—\n \n3,926\n \nCLO/ABS\n—\n \n4,293\n \n840\n \n—\n \n—\n \n5,133\n \nTotal bonds available for sale\n197\n \n60,799\n \n3,010\n \n—\n \n—\n \n64,006\n \nOther bond securities:\nObligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions\n—\n \n50\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n50\n \nNon-U.S. governments\n—\n \n24\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n24\n \nCorporate debt\n—\n \n281\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n282\n \nRMBS\n—\n \n50\n \n50\n \n—\n \n—\n \n100\n \nCMBS\n—\n \n43\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n43\n \nCLO/ABS\n—\n \n133\n \n113\n \n—\n \n—\n \n246\n \nTotal other bond securities\n—\n \n581\n \n164\n \n—\n \n—\n \n745\n \nEquity securities\n689\n \n—\n \n15\n \n—\n \n—\n \n704\n \nOther invested assets\n(b)\n3,810\n \n119\n \n163\n \n—\n \n—\n \n4,092\n \nDerivative assets\n(c)\n:\nInterest rate contracts\n—\n \n277\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n277\n \nForeign exchange contracts\n—\n \n296\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n296\n \nEquity contracts\n—\n \n—\n \n20\n \n—\n \n—\n \n20\n \nCredit contracts\n—\n \n—\n \n31\n \n—\n \n—\n \n31\n \nCounterparty netting and cash collateral\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n270\n)\n(\n304\n)\n(\n574\n)\nTotal derivative assets\n—\n \n573\n \n51\n \n(\n270\n)\n(\n304\n)\n50\n \nShort-term investments\n7,942\n \n1,847\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n9,789\n \nOther assets\n(c)\n—\n \n—\n \n129\n \n—\n \n—\n \n129\n \nTotal\n(d)\n$\n12,638\n \n$\n63,919\n \n$\n3,532\n \n$\n(\n270\n)\n$\n(\n304\n)\n$\n79,515\n \nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n113\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n5.

As a result, the unrealized gains (losses) on instruments held at December 31, 2024 and 2023 may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable (e.g., changes in market interest rates) and unobservable inputs (e.g., changes in unobservable long-dated volatilities).\nTransfers of Level 3 Assets and Liabilities\nThe Net realized and unrealized gains (losses) included in income (loss) or Other comprehensive income (loss) (OCI) as shown in the table above excludes $(\n35\n) million and $\n2\n million of net gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities transferred into Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, and includes $(\n13\n) million and $(\n11\n) million of net gains (losses) related to assets and liabilities transferred out of Level 3 during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nTransfers of Level 3 Assets\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, transfers into Level 3 assets primarily included certain investments in private placement corporate debt, commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLO)/asset-backed securities (ABS) and equity securities. Transfers of private placement corporate debt and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were primarily the result of limited market pricing information that required us to determine fair value for these securities based on inputs that are adjusted to better reflect our own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or associated market liquidity. The transfers of investments in CMBS, RMBS, CLO and certain ABS into Level 3 assets were due to diminished market transparency and liquidity for individual security types.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, transfers out of Level 3 assets primarily included certain investments in private placement corporate debt, CMBS, RMBS, CLO/ABS, municipal bonds and equity securities. Transfers of private placement corporate debt out of Level 3 assets were based on consideration of market liquidity as well as related transparency of pricing and associated observable inputs for these investments. Transfers of certain investments in private placement corporate debt out of Level 3 assets were primarily the result of using observable pricing information that reflects the fair value of those securities without the need for adjustment based on our own assumptions regarding the characteristics of a specific security or the current liquidity in the market.\nTransfers of Level 3 Liabilities\nThere were no significant transfers of derivative or other liabilities into or out of Level 3 for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. \nQUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe table below presents information about the significant unobservable inputs used for recurring fair value measurements for certain Level 3 instruments, and includes only those instruments for which information about the inputs is reasonably available to us, such as data from independent third-party valuation service providers. Because input information from third-parties with respect to certain Level 3 instruments (primarily CLO/ABS) may not be reasonably available to us, balances shown below may not equal total amounts reported for such Level 3 assets and liabilities:\n(in millions)\nFair Value at\nDecember 31, 2024\nValuation\n Technique\nUnobservable Input\n(b)\nRange\n(Weighted Average)\n(c)\nAssets:\nObligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions\n$\n3\n \nDiscounted cash flow\nYield\n5.09\n% - \n5.57\n% (\n5.33\n%)\nCorporate debt\n177\n \nDiscounted cash flow\nYield\n6.83\n% - \n11.61\n% (\n9.22\n%)\nRMBS\n(a)\n1,321\n \nDiscounted cash flow\nConstant prepayment rate\n4.10\n% - \n9.26\n% (\n6.68\n%)\nLoss severity\n40.81\n% - \n76.72\n% (\n58.76\n%)\n118\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n5.

The ranges of the unobservable inputs for constant prepayment rate, loss severity and constant default rate relate to each of the individual underlying mortgage loans that comprise the entire portfolio of securities in the RMBS and CLO securitization vehicles and not necessarily to the securitization vehicle bonds (tranches) purchased by us. The ranges of these inputs do not directly correlate to changes in the fair values of the tranches purchased by us, because there are other factors relevant to the fair values of specific tranches owned by us including, but not limited to, purchase price, position in the waterfall, senior versus subordinated position and attachment points.\n(b)\nRepresents discount rates, estimates and assumptions that we believe would be used by market participants when valuing these assets and liabilities.\n(c)\nThe weighted averaging for fixed maturity securities is based on the estimated fair value of the securities.\n \nThe ranges of reported inputs for Obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions, Corporate debt, RMBS, CLO/ABS, and CMBS valued using a discounted cash flow technique consist of one standard deviation in either direction from the value‑weighted average. The preceding table does not give effect to our risk management practices that might offset risks inherent in these Level 3 assets and liabilities.\nInterrelationships Between Unobservable Inputs\nWe consider unobservable inputs to be those for which market data is not available and that are developed using the best information available to us about the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Relevant inputs vary depending on the nature of the instrument being measured at fair value. The following paragraphs provide a general description of significant unobservable inputs along with interrelationships between and among the significant unobservable inputs and their impact on the fair value measurements. In practice, simultaneous changes in assumptions may not always have a linear effect on the inputs discussed below. Interrelationships may also exist between observable and unobservable inputs. Such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. For each of the individual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply.\nFixed Maturity Securities\nThe significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of fixed maturity securities is yield. The yield is affected by the market movements in credit spreads and U.S. Treasury yields. The yield may be affected by other factors including constant prepayment rates, loss severity, and constant default rates. In general, increases in the yield would decrease the fair value of investments, and conversely, decreases in the yield would increase the fair value of investments. \nEmbedded Derivatives within Reinsurance Contracts\nThe fair value of embedded derivatives associated with funds withheld reinsurance contracts is determined based upon a total return swap technique with reference to the fair value of the investments held by AIG related to AIG’s funds withheld payable. The fair value of the underlying assets is generally based on market observable inputs using industry standard valuation techniques. The valuation also requires certain significant inputs, which are generally not observable, and accordingly, the valuation is considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  \nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n119\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n5.

Subsequent changes in fair value for designated items are reported in earnings. We elect the fair value option for certain hybrid securities given the complexity of bifurcating the economic components associated with the embedded derivatives. \nFor additional information related to embedded derivatives, see Note 11.\nAdditionally, we elect the fair value option for certain alternative investments when such investments are eligible for this election. We believe this measurement basis is consistent with the applicable accounting guidance used by the respective investment company funds themselves.\nFor additional information on securities and other invested assets for which we have elected the fair value option, see Note 6.\n120\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n5.

For certain loans, our current incremental lending rates for similar types of loans are used as the discount rates, because we believe this rate approximates the rates market participants would use. Fair values of residential mortgage loans are generally determined based on market prices, using market based adjustments for credit and servicing as appropriate. The fair values of policy loans are generally estimated based on unpaid principal amount as of each reporting date. No consideration is given to credit risk because policy loans are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policies.\n•\nOther invested assets: \nThe majority of the Other invested assets that are not measured at fair value represent time deposits with the original maturity at purchase greater than one year. The fair value of long-term time deposits is determined using the expected discounted future cash flow. \n•\nCash and short-term investments:\n The carrying amounts of these assets approximate fair values because of the relatively short period of time between origination and expected realization, and their limited exposure to credit risk.\n•\nOther liabilities:\n The majority of Other liabilities that are financial instruments not measured at fair value represent secured financing arrangements, including repurchase agreements. The carrying amounts of these liabilities approximate fair value, because the financing arrangements are short-term and are secured by cash or other liquid collateral.\n•\nFortitude Re funds withheld payable:\n The funds withheld payable contains an embedded derivative and the changes in its fair value are recognized in earnings each period. The difference between the total Fortitude Re funds withheld payable and the embedded derivative represents the host contract. \n•\nLong-term debt and Debt of consolidated investment entities:\n Fair values of these obligations were determined by reference to quoted market prices, when available and appropriate, or discounted cash flow calculations based upon our current market‑observable implicit‑credit‑spread rates for similar types of borrowings with maturities consistent with those remaining for the debt being valued.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n121\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n5.

Investments\nFIXED MATURITY SECURITIES\nBonds held to maturity are carried at amortized cost when we have the ability and positive intent to hold these securities until maturity. When we do not have the ability or positive intent to hold bonds until maturity, these securities are classified as available for sale or the fair value option has been elected. None of our fixed maturity securities met the criteria for held to maturity classification at December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nUnrealized gains and losses from available for sale investments in fixed maturity securities carried at fair value were reported as a separate component of AOCI, net of deferred income taxes, in shareholders’ equity. Realized and unrealized gains and losses from fixed maturity securities for which the fair value option has been elected are reflected in Net investment income. Investments in fixed maturity securities are recorded on a trade-date basis. \nInterest income is recognized using the effective yield method and reflects amortization of premium and accretion of discount. Premiums and discounts arising from the purchase of bonds classified as available for sale are treated as yield adjustments over their estimated holding periods, until maturity, or call date, if applicable. For investments in certain structured securities, recognized yields are updated based on current information regarding the timing and amount of expected undiscounted future cash flows. For high credit quality structured securities, effective yields are recalculated based on actual payments received and updated prepayment expectations, and the amortized cost is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since acquisition with a corresponding charge or credit to net investment income. For structured securities that are not high credit quality, the structured securities yields are based on expected cash flows which take into account both expected credit losses and prepayments. \n122\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n6. Investments\nAn allowance for credit losses is not established upon initial recognition of the asset (unless the security is determined to be a purchased credit deteriorated (PCD) asset which is discussed in more detail below). Subsequently, differences between actual and expected cash flows and changes in expected cash flows are recognized as adjustments to the allowance for credit losses. Changes that cannot be reflected as adjustments to the allowance for credit losses are accounted for as prospective adjustments to yield. \nSECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE\nThe following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of our available for sale securities:\n(in millions)\nAmortized\nCost\nAllowance\nfor Credit\nLosses\n(a)\nGross\nUnrealized\nGains\nGross\nUnrealized\nLosses\nFair\nValue\nDecember 31, 2024\nBonds available for sale:\nU.S. government and government sponsored entities\n$\n3,346\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n20\n \n$\n(\n99\n)\n$\n3,267\n \nObligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions\n3,223\n \n—\n \n32\n \n(\n112\n)\n3,143\n \nNon-U.S. governments\n8,644\n \n(\n1\n)\n54\n \n(\n590\n)\n8,107\n \nCorporate debt\n33,031\n \n(\n28\n)\n581\n \n(\n1,758\n)\n31,826\n \nMortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized:\nRMBS\n8,820\n \n(\n6\n)\n209\n \n(\n419\n)\n8,604\n \nCMBS\n3,988\n \n(\n3\n)\n32\n \n(\n91\n)\n3,926\n \nCLO/ABS\n5,143\n \n—\n \n34\n \n(\n44\n)\n5,133\n \nTotal mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized\n17,951\n \n(\n9\n)\n275\n \n(\n554\n)\n17,663\n \nTotal bonds available for sale\n(b)\n$\n66,195\n \n$\n(\n38\n)\n$\n962\n \n$\n(\n3,113\n)\n$\n64,006\n \nDecember 31, 2023\nBonds available for sale:\nU.S. government and government sponsored entities\n$\n4,444\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n40\n \n$\n(\n89\n)\n$\n4,395\n \nObligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions\n4,930\n \n—\n \n60\n \n(\n157\n)\n4,833\n \nNon-U.S. governments\n8,973\n \n(\n1\n)\n94\n \n(\n670\n)\n8,396\n \nCorporate debt\n34,013\n \n(\n20\n)\n606\n \n(\n2,253\n)\n32,346\n \nMortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized:\nRMBS\n6,423\n \n(\n9\n)\n219\n \n(\n426\n)\n6,207\n \nCMBS\n4,326\n \n(\n4\n)\n23\n \n(\n198\n)\n4,147\n \nCLO/ABS\n5,010\n \n—\n \n31\n \n(\n123\n)\n4,918\n \nTotal mortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized\n15,759\n \n(\n13\n)\n273\n \n(\n747\n)\n15,272\n \nTotal bonds available for sale\n(b)\n$\n68,119\n \n$\n(\n34\n)\n$\n1,073\n \n$\n(\n3,916\n)\n$\n65,242\n \n(a)\nRepresents the allowance for credit losses that has been recognized.

Additionally, we neither intend to sell the securities nor do we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis. For fixed maturity securities with significant declines, we performed fundamental credit analyses on a security-by-security basis, which\n included\n consideration of credit enhancements, liquidity position, expected defaults, industry and sector analysis, forecasts and available market data. \nContractual Maturities of Fixed Maturity Securities Available for Sale\nThe following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity securities available for sale by contractual maturity:\nDecember 31, 2024\nTotal Fixed Maturity Securities\nAvailable for Sale\n(in millions)\nAmortized Cost,\nNet of Allowance\nFair Value\nDue in one year or less\n$\n4,070\n \n$\n3,980\n \nDue after one year through five years\n22,194\n \n22,163\n \nDue after five years through ten years\n15,712\n \n15,010\n \nDue after ten years\n6,239\n \n5,190\n \nMortgage-backed, asset-backed and collateralized\n17,942\n \n17,663\n \nTotal\n$\n66,157\n \n$\n64,006\n \nActual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay certain obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\nThe following table presents the gross realized gains and gross realized losses from sales or maturities of our available for sale securities:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nGross\nRealized\nGains\nGross\nRealized\nLosses\nGross\nRealized\nGains\nGross\nRealized\nLosses\nGross\nRealized\nGains\nGross\nRealized\nLosses\nFixed maturity securities\n$\n81\n$\n700\n$\n130\n$\n865\n$\n281\n$\n929\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate fair value of available for sale securities sold was $\n13.7\n billion, $\n15.7\n billion and $\n10.5\n billion, respectively, which resulted in net realized gains (losses) of $(\n619\n) million, $(\n735\n) million and $(\n648\n) million, respectively.

No allowance is established in these situations and any previously recorded allowance is reversed. The new cost basis is not adjusted for subsequent increases in estimated fair value. When assessing our intent to sell a fixed maturity security, or whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, management evaluates relevant facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, decisions to reposition our investment portfolio, sales of securities to meet cash flow needs and sales of securities to take advantage of favorable pricing.\nFor fixed maturity securities for which a decline in the fair value below the amortized cost is due to credit related factors, an allowance is established for the difference between the estimated recoverable value and amortized cost with a corresponding charge to Net realized gains (losses). The allowance for credit losses is limited to the difference between amortized cost and fair value. The estimated recoverable value is the present value of cash flows expected to be collected, as determined by management. The difference between fair value and amortized cost that is not associated with credit related factors is presented in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) of fixed maturity securities on which an allowance for credit losses was previously recognized (a separate component of AOCI). Accrued interest is excluded from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses. \nWhen estimating future cash flows for structured fixed maturity securities (e.g., RMBS, CMBS, CLO, ABS) management considers the historical performance of underlying assets and available market information as well as bond-specific structural considerations, such as credit enhancement and the priority of payment structure of the security. In addition, the process of estimating future cash flows includes, but is not limited to, the following critical inputs, which vary by asset class:\n•\nCurrent delinquency rates;\n•\nExpected default rates and the timing of such defaults;\n•\nLoss severity and the timing of any recovery; and\n•\nExpected prepayment speeds.\nWhen estimating future cash flows for corporate, municipal and sovereign fixed maturity securities determined to be credit impaired, management considers: \n•\nExpected default rates and the timing of such defaults;\n•\nLoss severity and the timing of any recovery; and\n•\nScenarios specific to the issuer and the security, which may also include estimates of outcomes of corporate restructurings, political and macroeconomic factors, stability and financial strength of the issuer, the value of any secondary sources of repayment and the disposition of assets.\nWe consider severe price declines in our assessment of potential credit impairments. We may also modify our model inputs when we determine that price movements in certain sectors are indicative of factors not captured by the cash flow models.\nUnder the current expected credit loss (CECL) model, credit losses are reassessed each period. The allowance for credit losses and the corresponding charge to Net realized gains (losses) can be reversed if conditions change, however, the allowance for credit losses will never be reduced below zero. When we determine that all or a portion of a fixed maturity security is uncollectable, the uncollectable amortized cost amount is written off with a corresponding reduction to the allowance for credit losses. If we collect cash flows that were previously written off, the recovery is recognized by recording a gain in Net realized gains (losses).\n128\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n6.

These are referred to as PCD assets. At the time of purchase an allowance is recognized for these PCD assets by adding it to the purchase price to arrive at the initial amortized cost. There is no credit loss expense recognized upon acquisition of a PCD asset. When determining the initial allowance for credit losses, management considers the historical performance of underlying assets and available market information as well as bond-specific structural considerations, such as credit enhancement and the priority of payment structure of the security. In addition, the process of estimating future cash flows includes, but is not limited to, the following critical inputs:\n•\nCurrent delinquency rates;\n•\nExpected default rates and the timing of such defaults;\n•\nLoss severity and the timing of any recovery; and\n•\nExpected prepayment speeds.\nSubsequent to the acquisition date, the PCD assets follow the same accounting as other structured securities that are not high credit quality.\nWe did not purchase securities with more than insignificant credit deterioration since their origination during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nOther Invested Assets\nOur equity method investments in private equity funds, hedge funds and other entities are evaluated for impairment each reporting period. Such evaluation considers market conditions, events and volatility that may impact the recoverability of the underlying investments within these private equity funds and hedge funds and is based on the nature of the underlying investments and specific inherent risks. Such risks may evolve based on the nature of the underlying investments.\nOur investments in real estate are periodically evaluated for recoverability whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may be impaired. When impairment indicators are present, we compare expected investment cash flows to carrying amount. When the expected cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the investments are written down to fair value with a corresponding charge to earnings. \nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n129\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n6. Investments\nPLEDGED INVESTMENTS\nSecured Financing and Similar Arrangements\nWe enter into secured financing transactions whereby certain securities are sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements), in which we transfer securities in exchange for cash, with an agreement by us to repurchase the same or substantially similar securities. Our secured financing transactions also include those that involve the transfer of securities to financial institutions in exchange for cash (securities lending agreements). In all of these secured financing transactions, the securities transferred by us (pledged collateral) may be sold or repledged by the counterparties. These agreements are recorded at their contracted amounts plus accrued interest, other than those that are accounted for at fair value.\nPledged collateral levels are monitored daily and are generally maintained at an agreed-upon percentage of the fair value of the amounts borrowed during the life of the transactions. In the event of a decline in the fair value of the pledged collateral under these secured financing transactions, we may be required to transfer cash or additional securities as pledged collateral under these agreements.

Lending Activities\nMortgage and other loans receivable include commercial mortgages, life insurance policy loans, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable. Commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable are carried at unpaid principal balances less allowance for credit losses and plus or minus adjustments for the accretion or amortization of discount or premium. Interest income on such loans is accrued as earned.\nDirect costs of originating commercial mortgages, commercial loans, and other loans and notes receivable, net of nonrefundable points and fees, are deferred and included in the carrying amount of the related receivables. The amount deferred is amortized to income as an adjustment to earnings using the interest method. \nLife insurance policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. There is no allowance for policy loans because these loans serve to reduce the death benefit paid when the death claim is made and the balances are effectively collateralized by the cash surrender value of the policy.\nThe following table presents the composition of Mortgage and other loans receivable, net:\n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nCommercial mortgages\n(a)\n$\n3,305\n \n$\n3,836\n \nLife insurance policy loans\n6\n \n7\n \nCommercial loans, other loans and notes receivable\n(b)\n721\n \n738\n \nTotal mortgage and other loans receivable\n(c)\n4,032\n \n4,581\n \nAllowance for credit losses\n(c)\n(d)\n(\n164\n)\n(\n140\n)\nMortgage and other loans receivable, net\n(c)\n$\n3,868\n \n$\n4,441\n \n(a)\nCommercial mortgages primarily represent loans for apartments, offices and retail properties, with exposures in California and New York representing the largest geographic concentrations (aggregating approximately \n14\n percent and \n12\n percent, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and \n13\n percent and \n10\n percent, respectively, at December 31, 2023).\n(b)\nThere were no loans that were held-for-sale carried at lower of cost or market as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n(c)\nExcludes $\n37.6\n billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023 of loans receivable from AIGFP, which has a full allowance for credit losses, recognized upon the deconsolidation of AIGFP. \nFor additional information, see Note 1.\n(d)\nDoes not include allowance for credit losses of $\n8\n million and $\n9\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024 and 2023, in relation to off-balance-sheet commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans, which is recorded in Other liabilities.\nInterest income is not accrued when payment of contractual principal and interest is not expected. Any cash received on impaired loans is generally recorded as a reduction of the current carrying amount of the loan. Accrual of interest income is generally resumed when delinquent contractual principal and interest is repaid or when a portion of the delinquent contractual payments are made and the ongoing required contractual payments have been made for an appropriate period.\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $\n252\n million and $\n73\n million, respectively, of commercial mortgage loans were placed on nonaccrual status.\nAccrued interest is presented separately and is included in Accrued investment income on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, accrued interest receivable was $\n15\n million and $\n21\n million, respectively, associated with commercial mortgage loans.\nA significant majority of commercial mortgages in the portfolio are non-recourse loans and, accordingly, the only guarantees are for specific items that are exceptions to the non-recourse provisions. It is therefore extremely rare for us to have cause to enforce the provisions of a guarantee on a commercial real estate or mortgage loan.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n131\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n| 7.

Changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded in realized losses. This allowance reflects the risk of loss, even when that risk is remote, that is expected over the remaining contractual life of the loan. The allowance for credit losses considers available relevant information about the collectability of cash flows, including information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. We revert to historical information when we determine that we can no longer reliably forecast future economic assumptions. \nThe allowances for the commercial mortgage loans are estimated utilizing a probability of default and loss given default model. Loss rate factors are determined based on historical data and adjusted for current and forecasted information. The loss rates are applied based on individual loan attributes and considering such data points as loan-to-value ratios, Fair Isaac Corporation scores, and debt service coverage.\nThe estimate of credit losses also reflects management’s assumptions on certain macroeconomic factors that include, but are not limited to, gross domestic product growth, employment, inflation, housing price index, interest rates and credit spreads.  \nAccrued interest is excluded from the measurement of the allowance for credit losses and accrued interest is reversed through interest income once a loan is placed on nonaccrual. \nWhen all or a portion of a loan is deemed uncollectible, the uncollectible portion of the carrying amount of the loan is charged off against the allowance. \nWe also have off-balance sheet commitments related to our commercial mortgage loans. The liability for expected credit losses related to these commercial mortgage loan commitments is reported in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. When a commitment is funded, we record a loan receivable and reclassify the liability for expected credit losses related to the commitment into loan allowance for expected credit losses. Other changes in the liability for expected credit losses on loan commitments are recorded in Net realized gains (losses) in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\n \n \nThe following table presents a rollforward of the changes in the allowance for credit losses on Mortgage and other loans receivable\n(a)(b)\n:\nYears Ended December 31,\n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions)\nCommercial\nMortgages\nOther\nLoans\nTotal\nCommercial\nMortgages\nOther\nLoans\nTotal\nCommercial\nMortgages\nOther\nLoans\nTotal\nAllowance, beginning of year\n$\n138\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n140\n \n$\n109\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n117\n \n$\n123\n \n$\n11\n \n$\n134\n \nLoans charged off\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n4\n)\n—\n \n(\n4\n)\nNet charge-offs\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n4\n)\n—\n \n(\n4\n)\nAddition to (release of) allowance for loan losses\n25\n \n(\n1\n)\n24\n \n31\n \n(\n6\n)\n25\n \n(\n10\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n13\n)\nAllowance, end of year\n$\n163\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n164\n \n$\n138\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n140\n \n$\n109\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n117\n \n(a)\nD\noes not include allowance for credit losses of $\n8\n million, $\n9\n million and $\n9\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 in relation to off-balance-sheet commitments to fund commercial mortgage loans, which is recorded in Other liabilities.\n(b)\nExcludes $\n37.6\n billion\n \nof loan receivable from AIGFP, which has a full allowance for credit losses, recognized upon the deconsolidation of AIGFP. \nFor additional information, see Note 1.\n \nOur expectations and models used to estimate the allowance for losses on commercial mortgage loans are regularly updated to reflect the current economic environment.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n133\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n \n| 7. Lending Activities\nLOAN MODIFICATIONS\nThe allowance for credit losses incorporates an estimate of lifetime expected credit losses and is recorded on each asset upon asset origination or acquisition. The starting point for the estimate of the allowance for credit losses is historical loss information, which includes losses from modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. We use a probability of default/loss given default model to determine the allowance for credit losses for our commercial mortgage loans.  An assessment of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty is made on the date of a modification. \nBecause the effect of most modifications made to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty is already included in the allowance for credit losses utilizing the measurement methodologies used to estimate the allowance, a change to the allowance for credit losses is generally not recorded upon modification. \nWhen modifications are executed, they often will be in the form of principal forgiveness, term extensions, interest rate reductions, or some combination of any of these concessions. When principal is forgiven, the amortized cost basis of the asset is written off against the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the principal forgiveness is deemed to be uncollectible; therefore, that portion of the loan is written off, resulting in a reduction of the amortized cost basis and a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for credit losses. \nWe assess whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty based on a variety of factors, including the borrower’s current default on any of its outstanding debt, the probability of a default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without the modification, the insufficiency of the borrower’s forecasted cash flows to service any of its outstanding debt (including both principal and interest), and the borrower’s inability to access alternative third party financing at an interest rate that would be reflective of current market conditions for a non-troubled debtor.  \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, commercial mortgage loans with an amortized cost of $\n5\n million supporting the funds withheld arrangements with Fortitude Re were granted term extensions.  \nThere were no loans that had defaulted during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, that had been previously modified with borrowers experiencing financial difficulties.\nAIG closely monitors the performance of the loans modified to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty to understand the effectiveness of its modification efforts. All loans with borrowers experiencing financial difficulty that were modified in the 12 months prior to December 31, 2024 are current and performing in conjunction with their modified terms.\n \n8. Reinsurance\nIn the ordinary course of business, our insurance companies purchase both treaty and facultative reinsurance to limit potential losses, provide additional capacity for growth, minimize exposure to significant risks or to facilitate greater diversification of our businesses. In addition, certain of our General Insurance subsidiaries sell reinsurance to other insurance companies. \nWe determine the portion of our ultimate net loss that will be recoverable under our reinsurance contracts by reference to the terms of the reinsurance protection purchased. This determination involves an estimate of incurred but not reported (IBNR) loss. Reinsurance recoverables for contracts which are accounted for as deposits are subject to similar judgments and uncertainties and reported in Deposit accounting assets. \nReinsurance assets include the balances due for paid losses and expenses, reserves for losses and expenses reported and outstanding, reserves for IBNR, ceded unearned premiums and ceded future policy benefits for life and accident and health insurance contracts and benefits paid and unpaid. Amounts related to paid and reserved losses and expenses and benefits with respect to these reinsurance agreements are sometimes collateralized. We remain liable to our policyholders regardless of whether our reinsurers meet their obligations under the reinsurance contracts, and as such, we regularly evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentration of our credit risk. The estimation of the allowance for unrecoverable reinsurance from reinsurers who are unwilling and/or unable to pay amounts due to us requires judgment for which key inputs typically include historical collection rates when amounts due are in dispute or where the reinsurer has suffered a credit event as well as specific reviews of balances in dispute or subject to credit impairment. The allowance for credit losses and disputes on reinsurance assets was $\n220\n million and $\n206\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Changes in the allowance for credit losses and disputes on reinsurance assets are reflected in Losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred within the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\n134\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n8.

Certain of these reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss contracts that protect us against losses above stipulated amounts. Ceded premiums are considered prepaid reinsurance premiums and are recognized as a reduction of premiums earned over the contract period in proportion to the protection received. Amounts recoverable from reinsurers on short-duration contracts are estimated in a manner consistent with the claims liabilities associated with the reinsurance and presented as a component of Reinsurance assets. Reinsurance premiums for assumed business are estimated based on information received from brokers, ceding companies and reinsurers. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the periods in which they are determined. Assumed reinsurance premiums are earned primarily on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the reinsurance contracts and the portion of premiums relating to the unexpired terms of coverage is included in the reserve for unearned premiums. Reinsurance premiums for assumed business are estimated based on information received from brokers, ceding companies and reinsureds. Any subsequent differences arising on such estimates are recorded in the periods in which they are determined. For both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met for reinsurance accounting to apply. If risk transfer requirements are not met, the contract is accounted for as a deposit, resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of both underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. Similar risk transfer criteria are used to determine whether directly written insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or as a deposit.\nThe following table presents short-duration insurance premiums written and earned:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n \n2023 \n2022 \nPremiums written:\nDirect\n$\n31,743\n \n$\n31,445\n \n$\n32,025\n \nAssumed\n3,950\n \n7,951\n \n7,385\n \nCeded\n(\n11,791\n)\n(\n12,190\n)\n(\n12,650\n)\nNet\n$\n23,902\n \n$\n27,206\n \n$\n26,760\n \nPremiums earned:\nDirect\n$\n31,208\n \n$\n30,781\n \n$\n32,053\n \nAssumed\n3,947\n \n7,050\n \n7,137\n \nCeded\n(\n11,618\n)\n(\n12,267\n)\n(\n12,425\n)\nNet\n$\n23,537\n \n$\n25,564\n \n$\n26,765\n \nPercent of amount assumed to net\n16.8\n \n%\n27.6\n \n%\n26.7\n \n%\nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, reinsurance recoveries, which reduced losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, amounted to $\n5.2\n billion, $\n8.1\n billion and $\n7.1\n billion, respectively.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n135\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n8. Reinsurance\nRetroactive reinsurance agreements are reinsurance agreements under which our reinsurer agrees to reimburse us as a result of past insurable events. For these agreements, the excess of the amounts ultimately collectible under the agreement over the consideration paid is recognized as a deferred gain liability and amortized into income over the settlement period of the ceded reserves. The amount of the deferral is recalculated each period based on loss payments and updated estimates. If the consideration paid exceeds the ultimate losses collectible under the agreement, the net loss on the agreement is recognized in income immediately. Ceded loss reserves under retroactive agreements were $\n11.5\n billion and $\n12.4\n billion, and the deferred gain liability was $\n725\n million and $\n585\n million, as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The effect on income from amortization of the deferred gain was $\n406\n million, $\n82\n million and $\n252\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we entered into an adverse development reinsurance agreement with National Indemnity Company (NICO), a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., under which we transferred to NICO \n80\n percent of the reserve risk on substantially all of our U.S. Commercial long-tail exposures for accident years 2015 and prior. Under this agreement, we ceded to NICO \n80\n percent of the losses on subject business paid on or after January 1, 2016 in excess of $\n25\n billion of net paid losses, up to an aggregate limit of $\n25\n billion. We account for this transaction as retroactive reinsurance. This transaction resulted in a gain, which under U.S. GAAP retroactive reinsurance accounting is deferred and amortized into income over the settlement period. NICO created a collateral trust account as security for their claim payment obligations to us, into which they deposited the consideration paid under the agreement, and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. has provided a parental guarantee to secure NICO’s obligations under the agreement.\nFORTITUDE RE\nFortitude Re is the reinsurer of the majority of AIG’s run-off operations. The reinsurance transactions are structured as modco and loss portfolio transfer arrangements with funds withheld (funds withheld). In modco and funds withheld arrangements, the investments supporting the reinsurance agreements, and which reflect the majority of the consideration that would be paid to the reinsurer for entering into the transaction, are withheld by, and therefore continue to reside on the balance sheet of, the ceding company (i.e., AIG) thereby creating an obligation for the ceding company to pay the reinsurer (i.e., Fortitude Re) at a later date. Additionally, as AIG maintains ownership of these investments, AIG will maintain its existing accounting for these assets (e.g., the changes in fair value of available for sale securities will be recognized within OCI). AIG has established a funds withheld payable to Fortitude Re while simultaneously establishing a reinsurance asset representing reserves for the insurance coverage that Fortitude Re has assumed. The funds withheld payable contains an embedded derivative and changes in fair value of the embedded derivative related to the funds withheld payable are recognized in earnings through Net realized gains (losses). This embedded derivative is considered a total return swap with contractual returns that are attributable to various assets and liabilities associated with these reinsurance agreements.\nAs of December 31, 2024, $\n3.4\n billion\n \nof reserves related to business written by multiple wholly-owned AIG subsidiaries, had been ceded to Fortitude Re under these reinsurance transactions.\nThere is a diverse pool of assets supporting the funds withheld arrangements with Fortitude Re.

However, changes in the fair value of these assets are included in the embedded derivative in the Fortitude Re funds withheld arrangement and the appreciation (depreciation) of the asset is the primary driver of the comprehensive income (loss) reflected above.\nReinsurance Security\nOur third-party reinsurance arrangements do not relieve us from our direct obligations to our beneficiaries. Thus, a credit exposure exists with respect to both short-duration and long-duration reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer fails to meet the obligations assumed under any reinsurance agreement. We hold substantial collateral as security under related reinsurance agreements in the form of funds, securities, and/or letters of credit. A provision has been recorded for estimated unrecoverable reinsurance. In light of collateral held, we believe that no exposure to a single reinsurer represents an inappropriate concentration of credit risk to AIG. Gross reinsurance assets due from reinsurers exceeding \n5\n percent of our total reinsurance assets were approximately $\n15.2\n billion and $\n16.5\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which approximately $\n2.1\n billion and $\n2.3\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was not secured by collateral.\nREINSURANCE – CREDIT LOSSES\nThe estimation of reinsurance recoverables involves a significant amount of judgment, particularly for latent exposures, such as asbestos, due to their long-tail nature. We assess the collectability of reinsurance recoverable balances in each reporting period, through either historical trends of disputes and credit events or financial analysis of the credit quality of the reinsurer. We record adjustments to reflect the results of these assessments through an allowance for credit losses and disputes on uncollectible reinsurance that reduces the carrying amount of reinsurance and deposit accounting assets on the consolidated balance sheets (collectively, reinsurance recoverables). This estimate requires significant judgment for which key considerations include:\n•\npaid and unpaid amounts recoverable;\n•\nwhether the balance is in dispute or subject to legal collection;\n•\nthe relative financial health of the reinsurer as classified by the Obligor Risk Ratings (ORRs) we assign to each reinsurer based upon our financial reviews; reinsurers that are financially troubled (i.e., in run-off, have voluntarily or involuntarily been placed in receivership, are insolvent, are in the process of liquidation or otherwise subject to formal or informal regulatory restriction) are assigned ORRs that will generate a significant allowance; and\n•\nwhether collateral and collateral arrangements exist.\nAn estimate of the reinsurance recoverable's lifetime expected credit losses is established utilizing a probability of default and loss given default method, which reflects the reinsurer’s ORR. The allowance for credit losses excludes disputed amounts. An allowance for disputes is established for a reinsurance recoverable using the losses incurred model for contingencies.\nThe total reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2024 were $\n40.5\n billion. As of that date, utilizing AIG’s ORRs, (i) approximately \n83\n percent of the reinsurance recoverables were investment grade; (ii) approximately \n15\n percent of the reinsurance recoverables were non-investment grade and (iii) approximately \n2\n percent of the reinsurance recoverables related to entities that were not rated by AIG.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n137\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n8. Reinsurance\nThe total reinsurance recoverables as of December 31, 2023 were $\n41.4\n billion. As of that date, utilizing AIG’s ORRs, (i) approximately \n83\n percent of the reinsurance recoverables were investment grade; (ii) approximately \n15\n percent of the reinsurance recoverables were non-investment grade; (iii) approximately \n2\n percent of the reinsurance recoverables related to entities that were not rated by AIG.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately \n81\n percent and \n85\n percent, respectively, of our non-investment grade reinsurance exposure related to captive insurers. These arrangements are typically collateralized by letters of credit, funds withheld or trust agreements.\nReinsurance Recoverable Allowance\nThe following table presents a rollforward of the reinsurance recoverable allowance:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nBalance, beginning of period\n$\n255\n \n$\n260\n \n$\n281\n \nAddition to (release of) allowance for expected credit losses and disputes, net\n11\n \n(\n5\n)\n(\n22\n)\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance for credit losses and disputes\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(\n5\n)\nRecoveries of amounts previously written off\n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \nOther changes\n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \nBalance, end of year\n$\n269\n \n$\n255\n \n$\n260\n \nPast-Due Status\nWe consider a reinsurance asset to be past due when it is 90 days past due. The allowance for credit losses is estimated excluding disputed amounts. An allowance for disputes is established using the losses incurred method for contingencies. Past due balances on claims that are not in dispute were not material for any of the periods presented.\n9. Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs (DAC) represent those costs that are incremental and directly related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal of existing insurance contracts. We defer incremental costs that result directly from, and are essential to, the acquisition or renewal of an insurance contract. Such DAC generally include agent or broker commissions and bonuses, premium taxes, and medical and inspection fees that would not have been incurred if the insurance contract had not been acquired or renewed. Each cost is analyzed to assess whether it is fully deferrable. We partially defer costs, including certain commissions, when we do not believe that the entire cost is directly related to the acquisition or renewal of insurance contracts. Commissions that are not deferred to DAC are recorded in General operating and other expenses\n \nin the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss).\nWe also defer a portion of employee total compensation and payroll-related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing specific acquisition or renewal activities, including costs associated with the time spent on underwriting, policy issuance and processing, and sales force contract selling. The amounts deferred are derived based on successful efforts for each distribution channel and/or cost center from which the cost originates.\nPolicy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums written are earned, generally 12 months. DAC is grouped consistent with the manner in which the insurance contracts are acquired, serviced and measured for profitability and is reviewed for recoverability based on the profitability of the underlying insurance contracts. Investment income is anticipated in assessing the recoverability of DAC. We assess the recoverability of DAC on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. This assessment is performed by comparing recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income on in-force business to the sum of expected losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred, unamortized DAC and maintenance costs. If the sum of these costs exceeds the amount of recorded net unearned premiums and anticipated investment income, the excess is recognized as an offset against the asset established for DAC. This offset is referred to as a premium deficiency charge. Increases in expected losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred can have a significant impact on the likelihood and amount of a premium deficiency charge.\n \n138\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n9.

Variable Interest Entities\nA variable interest entity (VIE) is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights or do not substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity. Consolidation of a VIE by its primary beneficiary is not based on majority voting interest, but is based on other criteria discussed below.\nWe enter into various arrangements with VIEs in the normal course of business and consolidate the VIEs when we determine we are the primary beneficiary. This analysis includes a review of the VIE’s capital structure, related contractual relationships and terms, nature of the VIE’s operations and purpose, nature of the VIE’s interests issued and our involvement with the entity. When assessing the need to consolidate a VIE, we evaluate the design of the VIE as well as the related risks to which the entity was designed to expose the variable interest holders.\nThe primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect the entity’s economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. While also considering these factors, the consolidation conclusion depends on the breadth of our decision-making ability and our ability to influence activities that significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE.\nBALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION AND EXPOSURE TO LOSS\nCreditors or beneficial interest holders of VIEs for which AIG is the primary beneficiary generally have recourse only to the assets and cash flows of the VIEs and do not have recourse to AIG, except in limited circumstances when AIG has provided a guarantee to the VIE’s interest holders. \nThe following table presents the total assets and total liabilities associated with our variable interests in consolidated VIEs, as classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nAt December 31, 2024, there were \nno\n assets and liabilities associated with our variable interests in consolidated VIEs. \n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2023\nAssets:\nBonds available for sale\n$\n72\n \nMortgage and other loans receivable\n122\n \nShort-term investments\n5\n \nAccrued investment income\n2\n \nOther assets\n1\n \nTotal*\n$\n202\n \nLiabilities:\nDebt of consolidated investment entities\n$\n38\n \nTotal\n$\n38\n \n*\nThe assets of each VIE can be used only to settle specific obligations of that VIE.  \nWe calculate our maximum exposure to loss to be (i) the amount invested in the debt or equity of the VIE, (ii) the notional amount of VIE assets or liabilities where we have also provided credit protection to the VIE with the VIE as the referenced obligation, and (iii) other commitments and guarantees to the VIE.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n139\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n10.

Our insurance policies cover defined risks and our estimate of liability is included in our insurance reserves on the balance sheet.\n \nREAL ESTATE AND INVESTMENT ENTITIES\nThrough our insurance operations and AIG Global Real Estate Investment Corp., we are an investor in various real estate investment entities, some of which are VIEs. These investments are typically with unaffiliated third-party developers via a partnership or limited liability company structure. The VIEs’ activities consist of the development or redevelopment of commercial, industrial and residential real estate. Our involvement varies from being a passive equity investor or finance provider to actively managing the activities of the VIEs.\nOur insurance operations participate as passive investors in the equity issued by certain third-party-managed hedge and private equity funds that are VIEs. Our insurance operations typically are not involved in the design or establishment of these VIEs, nor do they actively participate in the management of the VIEs.\nRMBS, CMBS, OTHER ABS AND CLOS\nPrimarily through our insurance operations, we are a passive investor in RMBS, CMBS, other ABS and CLOs, the majority of which are issued by domestic special purpose entities. We generally do not sponsor or transfer assets to, or act as the servicer to these asset-backed structures, and were not involved in the design of these entities. Our maximum exposure in these types of structures is limited to our investment in securities issued by these entities and, where applicable, any unfunded commitments to these entities.\n \n11. Derivatives and Hedge Accounting\nWe use derivatives and other financial instruments as part of our financial risk management programs and as part of our investment operations. Interest rate derivatives (such as interest rate swaps) are used to manage interest rate risk associated with embedded derivatives contained in insurance contract liabilities, fixed maturity securities, outstanding medium- and long-term notes as well as other interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities. Foreign exchange derivatives (principally foreign exchange forwards and swaps) are used to economically mitigate risk associated with non-U.S. dollar denominated debt, net capital exposures, foreign currency transactions, and foreign denominated investments. Equity derivatives are used to economically mitigate financial risk associated with embedded derivatives. We use credit derivatives to manage our credit exposures. The derivatives are effective economic hedges of the exposures that they are meant to offset. In addition to hedging activities, we also enter into derivative contracts with respect to investment operations, which may include, among other things, CDSs, total return swaps and purchases of investments with embedded derivatives, such as equity-linked notes and convertible bonds.\n140\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n11. Derivatives and Hedge Accounting\nInterest rate, currency, equity swaps, credit contracts, swaptions, options and forward transactions are accounted for as derivatives, recorded on a trade-date basis and carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are reflected in income, when appropriate. Aggregate asset or liability positions are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets only to the extent permitted by qualifying master netting arrangements in place with each respective counterparty. Cash collateral posted with counterparties in conjunction with transactions supported by qualifying master netting arrangements is reported as a reduction of the corresponding net derivative liability, while cash collateral received in conjunction with transactions supported by qualifying master netting arrangements is reported as a reduction of the corresponding net derivative asset.\nDerivatives, with the exception of embedded derivatives, are reported at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other assets and Other liabilities. Embedded derivatives are generally presented with the host contract in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A bifurcated embedded derivative is measured at fair value and accounted for in the same manner as a free standing derivative contract. The corresponding host contract is accounted for according to the accounting guidance applicable for that instrument. \nFor additional information on embedded derivatives, see Notes 5 and 13.\n \nThe following table presents the notional amounts of our derivatives and the fair value of derivative assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nGross Derivative Assets\nGross Derivative Liabilities\nGross Derivative Assets\nGross Derivative Liabilities\n(in millions)\nNotional\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nNotional\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nNotional\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nNotional\nAmount\nFair\nValue\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\n(a)\nForeign exchange contracts\n$\n879\n \n$\n66\n \n$\n906\n \n$\n109\n \n$\n933\n \n$\n58\n \n$\n1,296\n \n$\n164\n \nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\n(a)\nInterest rate contracts\n841\n \n277\n \n913\n \n304\n \n14,657\n \n741\n \n1,165\n \n352\n \nForeign exchange contracts\n3,095\n \n230\n \n1,707\n \n158\n \n4,019\n \n393\n \n8,008\n \n400\n \nEquity contracts\n29\n \n20\n \n29\n \n20\n \n36,045\n \n66\n \n—\n \n—\n \nCredit contracts\n(b)\n52\n \n31\n \n147\n \n31\n \n1,804\n \n33\n \n504\n \n36\n \nOther contracts\n(c)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n2,131\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \nTotal derivatives, gross\n$\n4,896\n \n$\n624\n \n$\n3,702\n \n$\n622\n \n$\n59,589\n \n$\n1,292\n \n$\n10,973\n \n$\n952\n \nCounterparty netting\n(d)\n(\n270\n)\n(\n270\n)\n(\n450\n)\n(\n450\n)\nCash collateral\n(e)\n(\n304\n)\n(\n201\n)\n(\n711\n)\n(\n249\n)\nTotal derivatives on Consolidated Balance Sheets\n(f)\n$\n50\n \n$\n151\n \n$\n131\n \n$\n253\n \n(a)\nFair value amounts are shown before the effects of counterparty netting adjustments and offsetting cash collateral.\n(b)\nAs of December 31, 2024 and 2023, included CDSs on super senior multi-sector CLO with a net notional amount of $\n48\n million and $\n50\n million (fair value liability of $\n30\n million and $\n32\n million, respectively).

Fair value of liabilities related to bifurcated embedded derivatives was \nzero\n at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. A bifurcated embedded derivative is generally presented with the host contract in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Embedded derivatives are primarily related to the funds withheld arrangement with Fortitude Re. \nFor additional information, see Note 8.\nCOLLATERAL\nWe engage in derivative transactions that are not subject to a clearing requirement directly with unaffiliated third parties, in most cases, under International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) Master Agreements. Many of the ISDA Master Agreements also include Credit Support Annex provisions, which provide for collateral postings that may vary at various ratings and threshold levels. We attempt to reduce our risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable collateral to be obtained from a counterparty on an upfront or contingent basis. We minimize the risk that counterparties might be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral value and generally requiring additional collateral to be posted upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances. In addition, certain derivative transactions have provisions that require collateral to be posted by us upon a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings or give the counterparty the right to terminate the transaction. In the case of some of the derivative transactions, upon a downgrade of our long-term debt ratings, as an alternative to posting collateral and subject to certain conditions, we may assign the transaction to an obligor with higher debt ratings or arrange for a substitute guarantee of our obligations by an obligor with higher debt ratings or take other similar action. The actual amount of \nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n141\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n11. Derivatives and Hedge Accounting\ncollateral required to be posted to counterparties in the event of such downgrades, or the aggregate amount of payments that we could be required to make, depends on market conditions, the fair value of outstanding affected transactions and other factors prevailing at and after the time of the downgrade.\nCollateral posted by us to third parties for derivative transactions was $\n601\n million and $\n593\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the case of collateral posted under derivative transactions that are not subject to clearing, this collateral can generally be repledged or resold by the counterparties. Collateral provided to us from third parties for derivative transactions was $\n595\n million and $\n856\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. In the case\n of collateral provided to us under derivative transactions that are not subject to clearing, we generally can repledge or resell collateral.\nOFFSETTING\nWe have elected to present all derivative receivables and derivative payables, and the related cash collateral received and paid, on a net basis on our Consolidated Balance Sheets when a legally enforceable ISDA Master Agreement exists between us and our derivative counterparty.\n An ISDA Master Agreement is an agreement governing multiple derivative transactions between two counterparties. The ISDA Master Agreement generally provides for the net settlement of all, or a specified group, of these derivative transactions, as well as transferred collateral, through a single payment, and in a single currency, as applicable. The net settlement provisions apply in the event of a default on, or affecting any, one derivative transaction or a termination event affecting all, or a specified group of, derivative transactions governed by the ISDA Master Agreement.\nHEDGE ACCOUNTING\nWe designated certain derivatives entered into with third parties as fair value hedges of available for sale investment securities held by our insurance subsidiaries. The fair value hedges include foreign currency forwards and cross currency swaps designated as hedges of the change in fair value of foreign currency denominated available for sale securities attributable to changes in foreign exchange rates. \nWe use foreign currency denominated debt and cross-currency swaps as hedging instruments in net investment hedge relationships to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with our non-U.S. dollar functional currency foreign subsidiaries. For net investment hedge relationships where issued debt is used as a hedging instrument, we assess the hedge effectiveness and measure the amount of ineffectiveness based on changes in spot rates. For net investment hedge relationships that use derivatives as hedging instruments, we assess hedge effectiveness and measure hedge ineffectiveness using changes in forward rates. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized gains (losses) of $\n86\n million, $(\n42\n) million and $\n305\n million, respectively, included in Change in foreign currency translation adjustments in OCI related to the net investment hedge relationships.\nA qualitative methodology is utilized to assess hedge effectiveness.\nThe following table presents the gain (loss) recognized in income on our derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships in the Consolidated Statements of Income (Loss):\nGains/(Losses) Recognized in Income for:\n(in millions)\nHedging\nDerivatives\n(a)\nExcluded\nComponents\n(b)\nHedged\nItems\nNet Impact\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nForeign exchange contracts:\nNet realized gains/(losses)\n$\n(\n85\n)\n$\n(\n19\n)\n$\n85\n \n$\n(\n19\n)\nYear Ended December 31, 2023\nForeign exchange contracts:\nNet realized gains/(losses)\n$\n(\n177\n)\n$\n(\n25\n)\n$\n177\n \n$\n(\n25\n)\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nForeign exchange contracts:\nNet realized gains/(losses)\n(\n78\n)\n73\n \n78\n \n73\n \n(a)\nGains and losses on derivative instruments designated and qualifying in fair value hedges that are included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\n(b)\nGains and losses on derivative instruments designated and qualifying in fair value hedges that are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in income on a mark-to-market basis.\n142\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n11.

The aggregate fair value of our derivatives that were in a net liability position and that contain such credit risk-related contingencies which can be triggered below our long-term senior debt ratings of BBB+ or Baa1 was approximately $\n30\n million and $\n32\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The aggregate fair value of assets posted as collateral under these contracts at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was approximately $\n30\n million and $\n34\n million, respectively.\n \n12. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the future economic benefits arising from assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as a segment or one level below, and the test is performed annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. At December 31, 2024, goodwill is reported within North America Commercial, International Commercial and Global Personal segments, and within Other Operations. When a business is transferred from one reporting unit to another, goodwill from the original reporting unit is allocated among reporting units based on the fair value of business transferred, relative to business retained by a reporting unit.\nThe impairment assessment involves an option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether events or circumstances exist that lead to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not performed, or after assessing the totality of the events or circumstances, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, a quantitative assessment for potential impairment is performed.\nIf the qualitative test is not performed or if the test indicates a potential impairment is present, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare the estimated fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including allocated goodwill. The estimate of a reporting unit’s fair value involves management judgment and is based on one or a combination of approaches including discounted expected future cash flows, market-based earnings multiples of the unit’s peer companies, external appraisals or, in the case of reporting units being considered for sale, third-party indications of fair value, if available. We consider one or more of these estimates when determining the fair value of a reporting unit to be used in the impairment test.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n143\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n12. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nIf the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, goodwill associated with that reporting unit potentially is impaired. The amount of impairment, if any, is measured as the excess of a reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit and recognized in income.\nThe following table presents the changes in goodwill:\nGeneral Insurance\n(in millions)\nNorth America\nCommercial\nInternational\nCommercial\nGlobal\nPersonal\nOther\nOperations\nTotal\nBalance at January 1, 2023:\nGoodwill - gross\n$\n4,654\n \n$\n1,989\n \n$\n499\n \n$\n19\n \n$\n7,161\n \nAccumulated impairments\n(\n2,216\n)\n(\n947\n)\n(\n237\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n3,410\n)\nNet goodwill\n2,438\n \n1,042\n \n262\n \n9\n \n3,751\n \nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nDispositions*\n(\n369\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n369\n)\nOther\n—\n \n39\n \n3\n \n(\n2\n)\n40\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023:\nGoodwill - gross\n4,285\n \n2,028\n \n502\n \n17\n \n6,832\n \nAccumulated impairments\n(\n2,216\n)\n(\n947\n)\n(\n237\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n3,410\n)\nNet goodwill\n2,069\n \n1,081\n \n265\n \n7\n \n3,422\n \nIncrease (decrease) due to:\nDispositions\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n22\n)\n—\n \n(\n22\n)\nOther\n—\n \n(\n25\n)\n(\n2\n)\n—\n \n(\n27\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024:\nGoodwill - gross\n4,285\n \n2,003\n \n478\n \n17\n \n6,783\n \nAccumulated impairments\n(\n2,216\n)\n(\n947\n)\n(\n237\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n3,410\n)\nNet goodwill\n$\n2,069\n \n$\n1,056\n \n$\n241\n \n$\n7\n \n$\n3,373\n \n*\nPrimarily represents amounts related to the sale of Validus Re through the date of disposition.\n \nIndefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. Indefinite lived intangible assets primarily include Lloyd’s syndicate capacity and brand names. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. Finite lived intangible assets primarily include distribution networks and are recorded net of accumulated amortization. The Company tests indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an intangible asset may exceed the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. If this condition exists and the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment and is recorded as a charge against net income (loss).\nThe Other intangible assets and Value of distribution network acquired (VODA) were $\n370\n million and $\n394\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \n13. Insurance Liabilities\nLIABILITY FOR UNPAID LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES (LOSS RESERVES)\nLoss reserves represent the accumulation of estimates of unpaid claims, including estimates for claims incurred but not reported and loss adjustment expenses, less applicable discount. We regularly review and update the methods used to determine loss reserve estimates. Any adjustments resulting from this review are reflected currently in pre-tax income, except to the extent such adjustment impacts a deferred gain under a retroactive reinsurance agreement, in which case the ceded portion would be amortized into pre-tax income in subsequent periods. Because these estimates are subject to the outcome of future events, changes in estimates are common given that loss trends vary and time is often required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed. Reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening. Reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development or reserve releases.\nOur gross loss reserves before reinsurance and discount are net of contractual deductible recoverable amounts due from policyholders of approximately $\n12.1\n billion\n \nat both December 31, 2024 and 2023. These recoverable amounts are related to certain policies with high deductibles (in excess of high dollar amounts retained by the insured through self-insured retentions, deductibles, retrospective programs, or captive arrangements, each referred to generically as “deductibles”), primarily for U.S. Commercial casualty business. With respect to the deductible portion of the claim, we manage and pay the entire claim on behalf of the insured \n144\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n13. Insurance Liabilities\nand are reimbursed by the insured for the deductible portion of the claim. Thus, these recoverable amounts represent a credit exposure to us. At December 31, 2024 and 2023 we held collateral of approximately $\n8.6\n billion and $\n8.7\n billion, respectively, for these deductible recoverable amounts, consisting primarily of letters of credit and funded trust agreements. Allowance for credit losses for the unsecured portion of these recoverable amounts was $\n14\n million at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe following table presents the rollforward of activity in loss reserves:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nLiability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, beginning of year\n$\n70,393\n \n$\n75,167\n \n$\n79,026\n \nReinsurance recoverable\n(\n30,289\n)\n(\n32,102\n)\n(\n35,213\n)\nNet Liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, beginning of year\n40,104\n \n43,065\n \n43,813\n \nLosses and loss adjustment expenses incurred:\nCurrent year\n14,363\n \n15,100\n \n16,434\n \nPrior years, excluding discount and amortization of deferred gain\n254\n \n(\n392\n)\n(\n530\n)\nPrior years, discount charge (benefit)\n354\n \n307\n \n(\n605\n)\nPrior years, amortization of deferred gain on retroactive reinsurance\n(a)\n(\n404\n)\n(\n81\n)\n(\n252\n)\nTotal losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred\n14,567\n \n14,934\n \n15,047\n \nLosses and loss adjustment expenses paid:\nCurrent year\n(\n3,694\n)\n(\n3,836\n)\n(\n4,011\n)\nPrior years\n(\n9,849\n)\n(\n11,868\n)\n(\n11,066\n)\nTotal losses and loss adjustment expenses paid\n(\n13,543\n)\n(\n15,704\n)\n(\n15,077\n)\nOther changes:\nForeign exchange effect\n(\n996\n)\n606\n \n(\n1,463\n)\nLosses and loss adjustment expenses recognized within gain on divestitures\n—\n \n569\n \n—\n \nRetroactive reinsurance adjustment (net of discount)\n(b)\n15\n \n158\n \n745\n \nDispositions\n(c)\n(\n5\n)\n(\n3,505\n)\n—\n \nReclassified to held for sale, net of reinsurance recoverables\n—\n \n(\n19\n)\n—\n \nTotal other changes\n(\n986\n)\n(\n2,191\n)\n(\n718\n)\nLiability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses, end of year:\nNet liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses\n40,142\n \n40,104\n \n43,065\n \nReinsurance recoverable\n29,026\n \n30,289\n \n32,102\n \nTotal\n$\n69,168\n \n$\n70,393\n \n$\n75,167\n \n(a)\nIncludes $\n82\n million, $\n33\n million and $\n63\n million for the retroactive reinsurance agreement with NICO covering U.S. asbestos exposures for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(b)\nIncludes benefit (charge) from change in discount on retroactive reinsurance in the amount of $\n168\n million, $\n150\n million and $(\n301\n) million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n(c)\nIncludes amounts related to the sale of Validus Re through the date of disposition.\n \nThe following table presents the reconciliation of the net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses in the following tables to Loss Reserves in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the year ended December 31, 2024:\n(in millions)\nNet liability for unpaid\nlosses and loss adjustment\nexpenses as presented in the\ndisaggregated tables below\nReinsurance recoverable on\nunpaid losses and loss\nadjustment expenses included in\nthe disaggregated tables below\nGross liability\nfor unpaid\nlosses and loss\nadjustment expenses\nU.S. Workers' Compensation (before discount)\n$\n3,468\n$\n4,852\n$\n8,320\nU.S. Excess Casualty\n3,208\n3,139\n6,347\nU.S. Other Casualty\n4,387\n3,416\n7,803\nU.S. Financial Lines\n5,422\n1,614\n7,036\nU.S. Property and Special Risks\n4,297\n1,233\n5,530\nU.S. Personal Insurance\n836\n2,048\n2,884\nUK/Europe Casualty and Financial lines\n7,280\n1,952\n9,232\nUK/Europe Property and Special Risks\n2,355\n1,761\n4,116\nUK/Europe and Japan Personal Insurance\n1,269\n670\n1,939\nTotal\n$\n32,522\n$\n20,685\n$\n53,207\nReconciling Items\nDiscount on workers' compensation lines\n(\n2,111\n)\nOther product lines*\n15,384\nUnallocated loss adjustment expenses\n2,688\nTotal Loss Reserves\n$\n69,168\n*\nReinsurance recoverable for other product lines of $\n8.4\n billion resulted in a net liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of $\n7.0\n billion for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n145\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n13.

The first table below shows prior year development by coverage group, the first two columns of which will again be presented in the coverage group sections that follow. After this table we describe historical drivers of prior year development as well as actuarial methods and relevant terminology.

The cumulative number of reported claims, the total of IBNR liabilities and expected development on reported loss included within the net incurred loss amounts are presented in the following section.\nReserving Methodology\nWe use a combination of methods to project ultimate losses for both long-tail and short-tail exposures, which include:\n•\nPaid Development method: \nThe Paid Development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and selecting paid ultimate loss development factors. These factors are then applied to paid losses by applying them to accident years, with further expected changes in paid loss. Since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves.\n•\nIncurred Development method: \nThe Incurred Development method is similar to the Paid Development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. Since this method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the Paid Development method, the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid development patterns.\n•\nExpected Loss Ratio method: \nThe Expected Loss Ratio method multiplies premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident year. This method may be useful if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly, or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. Expected loss ratio methods for business written in excess of a deductible may be given significant weight in the most recent five accident years. The expected loss ratios used for recent accident years are based on the projected ultimate loss ratios for older years adjusted for rate changes, loss trend including inflation, and where appropriate, changing market conditions.\n•\nBornhuetter-Ferguson method: \nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using premiums and paid losses is a combination of the Paid Development method and the Expected Loss Ratio method where the weight given to each method is the reciprocal of the loss development factor. This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the method used for the Expected Loss Ratio method. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using premiums and incurred losses is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using premiums and paid losses except that it uses case-incurred losses.\n•\nCape Cod method: \nThe Cape Cod method is mechanically similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method with the difference being that the Expected Loss Ratio estimates are determined based on a weighting of the loss estimates that come from the Paid/Incurred Development Methods. This method may be more responsive to recent loss trends than the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method.\n•\nAverage Loss method: \nThe Average Loss method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate severity average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimates. Since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for reserve categories where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively.\nIn updating our loss reserve estimates, we consider and evaluate inputs from many sources, including actual claims data, the performance of prior reserve estimates, observed industry trends, our internal peer review processes, including challenges and recommendations from our Enterprise Risk Management group, as well as the views of third-party actuarial firms. We use these inputs to improve our evaluation techniques, and to analyze and assess the change in estimated ultimate loss for each accident year by product line. Our analyses produce a range of indications from various methods, from which we select our best estimate.\n148\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n13. Insurance Liabilities\nIn determining the actual carried loss reserves, we consider both the internal actuarial best estimate and numerous other internal and external factors, including:\n•\nan assessment of economic conditions, including real GDP growth, inflation, employment rates or unemployment duration, stock market volatility and changes in corporate bond spreads;\n•\nchanges in the legal, regulatory, judicial and social environment, including changes in road safety, public health and cleanup standards;\n•\nchanges in medical cost trends (inflation, intensity and utilization of medical services) and wage inflation trends;\n•\nunderlying policy pricing, terms and conditions including attachment points and policy limits;\n•\nchange in claims handling philosophy, operating model, processes, and related ongoing enhancements;\n•\nthird-party claims reviews that are periodically performed for key classes of claims such as toxic tort, environmental and other complex casualty claims;\n•\nthird-party actuarial reviews that are periodically performed for key classes of business;\n•\ninput from underwriters on pricing, terms, and conditions and market trends; and\n•\nchanges in our reinsurance program, pricing and commutations.\nWhere appropriate and identifiable, adjustments have been made to standard projection techniques. Changes in Claims organization management, differing referral and review criteria and other factors may also be expected to alter loss emergence.\nThe following factors are relevant to the loss development information included in the tables below:\n•\nTable organization: \nThe tables are organized by accident year and include policies written on an occurrence and claims- made basis. We note that for certain categories of claims (e.g., construction defect claims and environmental claims) and for reinsurance recoverable, losses may sometimes be reclassified to an earlier or later accident year as more information about the date of occurrence becomes available to us. These reclassifications are shown as development in the respective years in the tables below. Financial Lines business is primarily written on a claims-made basis, while the majority of the workers’ compensation, excess casualty, other casualty, and run-off property and casualty lines of business are written on an occurrence basis. Primarily, all short-tail lines in Property and Special Risks and Personal Insurance are written on an occurrence basis.\n•\nGroupings: \nWe believe our groupings have homogenous risk characteristics with similar development patterns and would generally be subject to similar trends and reflect our reportable segments. The incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses and paid losses in the following tables for the current reporting year are allocated to the line of business and accident years based on how the business is coded by profit center and line of business.\n•\nReinsurance: \nOur reinsurance program varies by exposure type. Historically we have leveraged facultative and treaty reinsurance, both on a pro-rata and excess of loss basis. Our reinsurance program may change from year to year, which may affect the comparability of the data presented in our tables.\n•\nAdverse development reinsurance agreement: \nWe have provided the impact of the ADC in an additional table below our Incurred Losses and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses tables. The impact of the ADC is shown beginning in \n2016\n given the retroactive date of the contract and coincides with the effective date of the contract. For the lines of business covered by the agreement (U.S. Workers' Compensation, U.S. Excess Casualty, U.S. Other Casualty, U.S. Financial Lines, U.S. Property and Special Risks and U.S. Personal Insurance or collectively, the Covered Lines), an attribution of the loss recoveries to the line of business by calendar year and accident year is performed based on the underlying distribution of the losses subject to the agreement. Specifically, the future claim payments for all subject incurred losses were projected into future years based on the same actuarial assumptions underlying the related reserves. The additional table presented after discussion of prior year development by line of business reconciles the changes in net ultimates to our overall prior year development and provides the reattribution of loss recoveries for the Covered Lines. The reinsurance terms of the ADC were then used to identify the future claims payments for which \n80\n% will be reimbursed by NICO. At each reporting period, the attribution of the ADC recoveries is performed. The factors that could cause the attribution to lines of business and accident year to change include changes in underlying actuarial assumptions as to timing and amount of future claim payments.\n•\nIncurred but not reported liabilities (IBNR):\n \nWe include development from past reported losses in IBNR.\n•\nData excluded from tables: \nInformation with respect to accident years older than ten years is excluded from the development tables. Unallocated loss adjustment expenses are also excluded.\n•\nForeign exchange: \nThe loss development for operations outside of the U.S. is presented for all accident years using the current exchange rate at December 31, 2024. Although this approach requires restating all prior accident year information, the changes in exchange rates do not impact incurred and paid loss development trends.\n•\nAcquisitions: \nWe include acquisitions from all accident years presented in the tables. For purposes of this disclosure, we have applied the retrospective method for the acquired reserves, including incurred and paid claim development histories throughout the relevant tables. It should be noted that historical reserves for the acquired businesses were established by the acquired companies \nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n149\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n13. Insurance Liabilities\nusing methods, assumptions and procedures then in effect which may differ from our current reserving bases. Accordingly, it may not be appropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based on the aggregated historical results shown in the triangles.\n•\nDispositions: \nWe exclude dispositions from all accident years presented in the tables.\n•\nClaim counts: \nWe consider a reported claim to be one claim for each claimant or feature for each loss occurrence. Claims relating to losses that are 100 percent reinsured are excluded from the reported claims in the tables below. Reported claims for losses from assumed reinsurance contracts are not available and hence not included in the reported claims.\nThere are limitations that should be considered on the reported claim count data in the tables below, including:\n–\nClaim counts are presented only on a reported (not an ultimate) basis;\n–\nThe tables below include lines of business and geographies at a certain aggregated level which may indicate different frequency and severity trends and characteristics, and may not be as meaningful as the claim count information related to the individual products within those lines of business and geographies;\n–\nCertain lines of business are more likely to be subject to occurrences involving multiple claimants and features, which can distort measures based on the reported claim counts in the table below; and\n–\nReported claim counts are not adjusted for ceded reinsurance, which may distort the measure of frequency or severity.\nSupplemental Information: \nThe information about incurred and paid loss development for all periods preceding the year ended December 31, 2024 and the related historical claims payout percentage disclosure is unaudited and is presented as supplementary information.\nThe following tables present undiscounted, incurred and paid losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses by accident year, on a net basis after reinsurance, with a separate presentation of the ADC excluding the related amortization of the deferred gain:\nU.S. Workers' Compensation\nU.S. Workers’ Compensation is an extremely long-tail line of business, with loss emergence extending for decades. We generally use a combination of loss development, frequency/severity and expected loss ratio methods for workers’ compensation. \nMany of our workers compensation policies contain risk-sharing features, including high deductibles, self-insured retentions or retrospective rating features, in addition to a traditional insurance component. These risk-sharing programs generally are large and complex, comprising multiple products, years and structures, and are subject to amendment over time. We group guaranteed cost and excess of deductible business separately and then further by state and industry subset to the extent that meaningful differences are determined to exist. We also separately analyze certain subsets of the portfolio that have unique characteristics (e.g., U.S. government sub-contractor accounts and construction wrap-up business). For excess of deductible business, we also segment by size of deductible and whether the claim is handled by AIG or an outside third-party administrator.

Insurance Liabilities\nU.S. Excess Casualty\nU.S. Excess Casualty policies tend to attach at a high layer above underlying policies, which causes the loss development pattern to lag significantly. Many of the claims notified to the excess layers are closed without payment because the claims never reach our layer as a result of high deductibles and other underlying coverages, while the claims that reach our layer can have large case reserves or settlements and be highly variable in terms of reported timing and amount. For a portion of this business, the underlying primary policies are issued by other insurance companies, which can limit our access to relevant information to help inform our judgments as the loss events evolve and mature. Furthermore, this coverage is often significantly impacted by the underwriting cycle and external judicial trends.\nRecent accident years reflect a strategy towards having higher attachment points on the portfolio through changing participations in various layers within an insured’s program.\nIncurred Losses and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, Undiscounted and Net of Reinsurance\nYears Ended December 31, \n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nAccident\nYear\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2024\nPrior Year\nDevelopment\nExcluding\nthe Impact\nof ADC\nTotal of IBNR\nLiabilities\nPlus Expected\nDevelopment\non Reported\nLosses\nCumulative\nNumber of\nReported\nClaims\nIncurred\nImpact\nof ADC\nIBNR\nImpact\nof ADC\n2024\n(Net of\nImpact\nof ADC)\nTotal of\nIBNR\nLiabilities\nNet of \nImpact\nof ADC\nUnaudited\n2015\n$\n989\n \n$\n1,463\n \n$\n1,440\n \n$\n1,603\n \n$\n1,656\n \n$\n1,694\n \n$\n1,721\n \n$\n1,686\n \n$\n1,658\n \n$\n1,723\n \n$\n65\n \n$\n258\n \n3,269\n \n$\n(\n534\n)\n$\n(\n131\n)\n$\n1,189\n \n$\n127\n \n2016\n898\n \n1,146\n \n1,162\n \n1,171\n \n1,274\n \n1,250\n \n1,263\n \n1,276\n \n1,317\n \n41\n \n343\n \n2,970\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,317\n \n343\n \n2017\n856\n \n1,002\n \n1,097\n \n1,153\n \n1,157\n \n1,200\n \n1,182\n \n1,228\n \n46\n \n227\n \n2,252\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,228\n \n227\n \n2018\n648\n \n646\n \n721\n \n769\n \n769\n \n779\n \n779\n \n—\n \n149\n \n1,613\n \n—\n \n—\n \n779\n \n149\n \n2019\n577\n \n583\n \n597\n \n612\n \n600\n \n604\n \n4\n \n279\n \n1,469\n \n—\n \n—\n \n604\n \n279\n \n2020\n406\n \n413\n \n410\n \n420\n \n404\n \n(\n16\n)\n194\n \n1,438\n \n—\n \n—\n \n404\n \n194\n \n2021\n278\n \n277\n \n274\n \n358\n \n84\n \n154\n \n1,039\n \n—\n \n—\n \n358\n \n154\n \n2022\n305\n \n305\n \n333\n \n28\n \n156\n \n690\n \n—\n \n—\n \n333\n \n156\n \n2023\n345\n \n348\n \n3\n \n210\n \n567\n \n—\n \n—\n \n348\n \n210\n \n2024\n315\n \n302\n \n235\n \n—\n \n—\n \n315\n \n302\n \nTotal\n$\n7,409\n \n$\n255\n \n$\n(\n534\n)\n$\n6,875\n \nCumulative Paid Losses and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance from the table below\n(\n4,350\n)\n—\n \n197\n \n(\n4,153\n)\nLiabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses and prior year development before accident year 2015, net of reinsurance\n2,104\n \n217\n \n(\n1,618\n)\n486\n \nUnallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development\n73\n \nLiabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses and prior year loss development, net of reinsurance\n$\n5,163\n \n$\n545\n \n$\n(\n1,955\n)\n$\n3,208\n \nIncurred Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, Undiscounted, Net of Reinsurance (including impact of ADC)\nCalendar Years Ended December 31, \n(in millions)\nAccident\nYear\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nPrior Year\nDevelopment\nUnaudited\n2015\n$\n1,027\n$\n1,015\n$\n1,139\n$\n1,163\n$\n1,211\n$\n1,231\n$\n1,174\n$\n1,196\n$\n1,189\n \n$\n(\n7\n)\n2016\n898\n1,146\n1,162\n1,171\n1,274\n1,250\n1,263\n1,276\n1,317\n \n41\n \n2017\n856\n1,002\n1,097\n1,153\n1,157\n1,200\n1,182\n1,228\n \n46\n \n2018\n648\n646\n721\n769\n769\n779\n779\n \n—\n \n2019\n577\n583\n597\n612\n600\n604\n \n4\n \n2020\n406\n413\n410\n420\n404\n \n(\n16\n)\n2021\n278\n277\n274\n358\n \n84\n \n2022\n305\n305\n333\n \n28\n \n2023\n345\n348\n \n3\n \n2024\n315\n \nTotal\n$\n1,925\n \n$\n3,017\n \n$\n3,951\n \n$\n4,654\n \n$\n5,348\n \n$\n5,695\n \n$\n6,010\n \n$\n6,377\n \n$\n6,875\n \n$\n183\n \nCumulative Paid Losses and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance from the table below\n(\n4,153\n)\nLiabilities for losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses and prior year development before 2015, net of reinsurance\n486\n \n39\n \nUnallocated loss adjustment expense prior year adjustment\n16\n \nLiabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses and prior year loss development, net of reinsurance\n$\n3,208\n \n$\n238\n \n152\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n13.

Insurance Liabilities\nU.S. Other Casualty\nU.S. Other Casualty includes general liability, automobile liability, environmental, medical malpractice, and other casualty lines of business. These lines of business are all long-tail in nature and while somewhat diverse in terms of exposures, these lines are often subject to similar trends. These lines are often significantly impacted by the underwriting cycle and external judicial trends. Many of our policies contain risk-sharing features, including high deductibles, self-insured retentions or retrospective rating features, in addition to a traditional insurance component. These risk-sharing programs generally are large and complex, comprising multiple products, years and structures, and are subject to amendment over time.\nIncurred Losses and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, Undiscounted and Net of Reinsurance\nYears Ended December 31, \n(in millions)\nDecember 31, 2024\nAccident\nYear\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2024\nPrior Year\nDevelopment\nExcluding\nthe Impact\nof ADC\nTotal of IBNR\nLiabilities\nPlus Expected\nDevelopment\non Reported\nLosses\nCumulative\nNumber of\nReported\nClaims\nIncurred\nImpact\nof ADC\nIBNR\nImpact\nof ADC\n2024\n(Net of\nImpact\nof ADC)\nTotal of\nIBNR\nLiabilities\nNet of \nImpact\nof ADC\nUnaudited\n2015\n$\n1,329\n \n$\n1,762\n \n$\n1,829\n \n$\n1,736\n \n$\n1,794\n \n$\n1,834\n \n$\n1,824\n \n$\n1,815\n \n$\n1,796\n \n$\n1,770\n \n$\n(\n26\n)\n$\n6\n \n35,881\n \n$\n(\n273\n)\n$\n(\n3\n)\n$\n1,497\n \n$\n3\n \n2016\n1,339\n \n1,343\n \n1,321\n \n1,391\n \n1,340\n \n1,323\n \n1,293\n \n1,297\n \n1,264\n \n(\n33\n)\n69\n \n29,391\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,264\n \n69\n \n2017\n602\n \n629\n \n738\n \n674\n \n668\n \n643\n \n654\n \n662\n \n8\n \n14\n \n21,382\n \n—\n \n—\n \n662\n \n14\n \n2018\n802\n \n845\n \n837\n \n870\n \n824\n \n810\n \n841\n \n31\n \n154\n \n17,096\n \n—\n \n—\n \n841\n \n154\n \n2019\n1,059\n \n1,058\n \n1,053\n \n1,062\n \n1,039\n \n1,024\n \n(\n15\n)\n469\n \n21,383\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,024\n \n469\n \n2020\n524\n \n576\n \n538\n \n540\n \n519\n \n(\n21\n)\n223\n \n11,622\n \n—\n \n—\n \n519\n \n223\n \n2021\n795\n \n793\n \n790\n \n818\n \n28\n \n470\n \n11,249\n \n—\n \n—\n \n818\n \n470\n \n2022\n793\n \n819\n \n827\n \n8\n \n530\n \n13,636\n \n—\n \n—\n \n827\n \n530\n \n2023\n933\n \n955\n \n22\n \n781\n \n13,687\n \n—\n \n—\n \n955\n \n781\n \n2024\n840\n \n754\n \n9,070\n \n—\n \n—\n \n840\n \n754\n \nTotal\n$\n9,520\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n(\n273\n)\n$\n9,247\n \nCumulative Paid Losses and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance from the table below\n(\n5,435\n)\n—\n \n194\n \n(\n5,241\n)\nLiabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses and prior year development before accident year 2015, net of reinsurance\n1,300\n \n(\n14\n)\n(\n919\n)\n381\n \nUnallocated loss adjustment expense prior year development\n24\n \nLiabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses and prior year loss development, net of reinsurance\n$\n5,385\n \n$\n12\n \n$\n(\n998\n)\n$\n4,387\n \nIncurred Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses, Undiscounted, Net of Reinsurance (including impact of ADC)\nCalendar Years Ended December 31, \n(in millions)\nAccident\nYear\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\nPrior Year\nDevelopment\nUnaudited\n2015\n$\n1,361\n$\n1,373\n$\n1,423\n$\n1,493\n$\n1,553\n$\n1,562\n$\n1,563\n$\n1,514\n$\n1,497\n \n$\n(\n17\n)\n2016\n1,339\n1,343\n1,321\n1,391\n1,340\n1,323\n1,293\n1,297\n1,264\n \n(\n33\n)\n2017\n602\n629\n738\n674\n668\n643\n654\n662\n \n8\n \n2018\n802\n845\n837\n870\n824\n810\n841\n \n31\n \n2019\n1,059\n1,058\n1,053\n1,062\n1,039\n1,024\n \n(\n15\n)\n2020\n524\n576\n538\n540\n519\n \n(\n21\n)\n2021\n795\n793\n790\n818\n \n28\n \n2022\n793\n819\n827\n \n8\n \n2023\n933\n955\n \n22\n \n2024\n840\n \nTotal\n$\n2,700\n \n$\n3,318\n \n$\n4,175\n \n$\n5,526\n \n$\n5,986\n \n$\n6,847\n \n$\n7,509\n \n$\n8,396\n \n$\n9,247\n \n$\n11\n \nCumulative Paid Losses and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses, Net of Reinsurance from the table below\n(\n5,241\n)\nLiabilities for losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses and prior year development before 2015, net of reinsurance\n381\n \n37\n \nUnallocated loss adjustment expense prior year adjustment\n(\n4\n)\nLiabilities for losses and loss adjustment expenses and prior year loss development, net of reinsurance\n$\n4,387\n \n$\n44\n \n154\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n13.

These product lines are predominantly claims-made in nature, losses are characterized by low frequency and high severity, and results are often significantly impacted by external economic conditions.\nOur analysis is segmented by major coverages, such as D&O, E&O, etc. and then further segmented by major industry groups (e.g. corporate accounts, national accounts, financial institutions, private/not-for-profit, etc.).

Insurance Liabilities\nUK/Europe Casualty and Financial Lines\nUK/Europe is our largest non-U.S. region for Liability and Financial Lines. UK/Europe Casualty and Financial Lines is composed of third-party coverages including general liability, auto liability, D&O, professional liability and various other coverages throughout both the UK and Continental Europe. These areas are all long-tail in nature and while somewhat diverse in terms of exposures, these lines are often subject to similar trends. These lines are impacted by the underwriting cycle and external judicial trends.

Insurance Liabilities\nDISCOUNTING OF LOSS RESERVES\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the loss reserves reflect a net loss reserve discount of $\n1.2\n billion and $\n1.2\n billion, respectively, including tabular and non-tabular calculations based upon the following assumptions:\n•\nThe non-tabular workers’ compensation discount is calculated separately for companies domiciled in New York, Pennsylvania and Delaware, and follows the statutory regulations (prescribed or historically permitted) for each state.\n–\nFor New York companies, the discount is based on a \n5\n percent interest rate and the companies’ own payout patterns.\n–\nThe Pennsylvania and Delaware regulators have historically approved use of a consistent benchmark discount rate and spread (U.S. Treasury rate plus a liquidity premium) to all of our workers’ compensation reserves in our Pennsylvania domiciled and Delaware domiciled companies, as well as our use of updated payout patterns specific to our primary and excess workers compensation portfolios. Delaware stipulates that the maximum allowable rate is \n4.5\n percent. We have sought approval to apply a discount rate of \n4.5\n percent for National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pa. and Lexington Insurance Company. In 2020, the regulators also approved that the discount rate will be updated on an annual basis.\n•\nThe tabular workers’ compensation discount is calculated based on the mortality rate used in the 2007 U.S. Life table and interest rates prescribed or permitted by each state (i.e. New York is based on \n5\n percent interest rate and Pennsylvania and Delaware are based on U.S. Treasury rate plus a liquidity premium). In the case that applying this tabular discount factor to our nominal reserves produces a tabular discount that is greater than the indemnity portion of our case reserves, the tabular discount is capped at our estimate of the indemnity portion of our cases reserves (\n45\n percent).\nThe discount for asbestos reserves has been fully accreted.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the discount consists of $\n107\n million and $\n294\n million of tabular discount, respectively, and $\n1.1\n billion and $\n939\n million of non-tabular discount for workers’ compensation, respectively.

The Amended Credit Agreement provides for a \nfive-year\n total commitment of $\n3.0\n billion, consisting of standby letters of credit and/or revolving credit borrowings. Under circumstances described in the Amended Credit Agreement, the aggregate commitments may be increased by up to $\n1.5\n billion, for a total commitment of up to $\n4.5\n billion. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, the applicable rate, commitment fee and letter of credit fee are determined by reference to the credit ratings of AIG’s senior long-term unsecured debt. The Amended Credit Agreement is scheduled to expire in September 2029. \nAs of December 31, 2024, there were no borrowings or letters of credit outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement, so that a total of approximately $\n3.0\n billion remains available under the Amended Credit Agreement.\n \n168\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n15. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees\n15. Contingencies, Commitments and Guarantees\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various contingent liabilities and commitments. In addition, AIG Parent guarantees various obligations of certain subsidiaries.\nAlthough we cannot currently quantify our ultimate liability for unresolved litigation and investigation matters, including those referred to below, it is possible that such liability could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows for an individual reporting period.\nLEGAL CONTINGENCIES\nIn the normal course of business, we are subject to regulatory and government investigations and actions, and litigation and other forms of dispute resolution in a large number of proceedings pending in various domestic and foreign jurisdictions. Certain of these matters involve potentially significant risk of loss due to potential for significant jury awards and settlements, punitive damages or other penalties. Many of these matters are also highly complex and may seek recovery on behalf of a class or similarly large number of plaintiffs. It is therefore inherently difficult to predict the size or scope of potential future losses arising from these matters. In our insurance and reinsurance operations, litigation and arbitration concerning the scope of coverage under insurance and reinsurance contracts, and litigation and arbitration in which our subsidiaries defend or indemnify their insureds under insurance contracts, are generally considered in the establishment of our loss reserves. Separate and apart from the foregoing matters involving insurance and reinsurance coverage, AIG Parent, our subsidiaries and their respective officers and directors are subject to a variety of additional types of legal proceedings brought by holders of AIG securities, customers, employees and others, alleging, among other things, breach of contractual or fiduciary duties, bad faith, indemnification and violations of federal and state statutes and regulations. With respect to these other categories of matters not arising out of claims for insurance or reinsurance coverage, we establish reserves for loss contingencies when it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In many instances, we are unable to determine whether a loss is probable or to reasonably estimate the amount of such a loss and, therefore, the potential future losses arising from legal proceedings may exceed the amount of liabilities that we have recorded in our financial statements covering these matters. While such potential future charges could be material, based on information currently known to management, management does not believe that any such charges are likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operation.\nAdditionally, from time to time, various regulatory and governmental agencies review our transactions and practices in connection with industry-wide and other inquiries or examinations into, among other matters, the business practices of current and former operating insurance subsidiaries. Such investigations, inquiries or examinations could develop into administrative, civil or criminal proceedings or enforcement actions, in which remedies could include fines, penalties, restitution or alterations in our business practices, and could result in additional expenses, limitations on certain business activities and reputational damage.\nLEASE COMMITMENTS\nWe lease office space and equipment in various locations across jurisdictions in which the Company operates. The majority of the resulting obligation arising from these contracts is generated by our real estate portfolio, which only includes contracts classified as operating leases. The lease liability and corresponding right of use asset reflected in \nOther liabilities\n and \nOther assets\n were $\n868\n million and $\n696\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2024, and $\n894\n million and $\n744\n million, respectively, at December 31, 2023. We made cash payments of $\n177\n million and $\n179\n million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with these leases. The liability includes non-lease components, such as property taxes and insurance for our gross leases. Some of these leases contain options to renew after a specified period of time at the prevailing market rate; however, renewal options that have not been exercised as of December 31, 2024 are excluded until management attains a reasonable level of certainty. Some leases also include termination options at specified times and term; however, termination options are not reflected in the lease asset and liability balances until they have been exercised.\nThe weighted average discount rate and lease term assumptions used in determining the liability are \n3.36\n percent and \n10.1\n years, respectively. The primary assumption used to determine the discount rate is the cost of funding for the Company, which is based on the secured borrowing rate for terms similar to the lease term, and for the major financial markets in which AIG operates.\nRent expense was $\n164\n million, $\n162\n million and $\n174\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n169\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n15.

These commitments totaled $\n1.8\n billion and $\n1.7\n billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nGUARANTEES\nSubsidiaries\nWe have issued unconditional guarantees with respect to the prompt payment, when due, of all present and future payment obligations and liabilities of AIGFP and certain of its subsidiaries. We have also issued guarantees of all present and future payment obligations and liabilities of AIG Markets, Inc.\nDue to the deconsolidation of AIGFP and its subsidiaries, as of December 31, 2024, a $\n100\n million guarantee related to the obligations of AIGFP and certain of its subsidiaries was recognized, and is reported in Other liabilities.\nWe continue to guarantee certain policyholder contracts issued by Corebridge subsidiaries as well as certain debt issued by Corebridge Life Holdings, Inc. (CRBGLH). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement entered in by AIG and Corebridge on September 14, 2022, Corebridge must indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against any liability related to these guarantees. Also, under  a collateral agreement, in the event of: (i) a ratings downgrade of Corebridge or the guaranteed debt below specified levels or (ii) the failure by CRBGLH to pay principal and interest on the guaranteed debt when due, Corebridge must collateralize an amount equal to the sum of: (i) \n100\n percent of the principal amount outstanding, (ii) accrued and unpaid interest and (iii) \n100\n percent of the net present value of scheduled interest payments through the maturity dates of the debt.\nBusiness and Asset Dispositions\nWe are subject to financial guarantees and indemnity arrangements in connection with the completed sales of businesses and assets. The various arrangements may be triggered by, among other things, declines in asset values, the occurrence of specified business contingencies, the realization of contingent liabilities, developments in litigation or breaches of representations, warranties or covenants provided by us. These arrangements are typically subject to various time limitations, defined by the contract or by operation of law, such as statutes of limitation. In some cases, the maximum potential obligation is subject to contractual limitations, while in other cases such limitations are not specified or are not applicable. \nWe are unable to develop a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential payout under certain of these arrangements. Overall, we believe the likelihood that we will have to make any material payments related to completed sales under these arrangements is remote, and no material liabilities related to these arrangements have been recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther\n•\nFor additional information on commitments and guarantees associated with VIEs, see Note 10. \n•\nFor additional information on derivatives, see Note 11.\n \n170\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n16.

Certain of our share repurchases have been and may from time to time be effected through the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act) Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plans. \nOn April 30, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of \n$\n10.0\n billion\n of AIG Common Stock (inclusive of the approximately \n$\n3.9\n billion\n remaining under the Board's prior share repurchase authorization). \nThe timing of any future repurchases will depend on market conditions, our business and strategic plans, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and other factors. \nPursuant to an Exchange Act Rule 10b5-1 repurchase plan, from January 1, 2025 to February 7, 2025, we repurchased approximately \n13\n million shares of AIG Common Stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $\n952\n million.\nDIVIDENDS DECLARED\nOn February 11, 2025, our Board of Directors declared a cash dividend on AIG Common Stock of $\n0.40\n per share, payable on March 31, 2025 to shareholders of record on March 17, 2025. \nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n171\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n16.

The principal differences between statutory financial statements and financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for domestic companies are that statutory financial statements do not reflect DAC, some bond portfolios may be carried at amortized cost, investment impairments are determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices, assets and liabilities are presented net of reinsurance, policyholder liabilities are generally valued using more conservative assumptions and certain assets are non-admitted.\nFor domestic insurance subsidiaries, aggregate minimum required statutory capital and surplus is based on the greater of the Risk-Based Capital (RBC) level that would trigger regulatory action or minimum requirements per state insurance regulation. Capital and surplus requirements of our foreign subsidiaries differ from those prescribed in the U.S., and can vary significantly by jurisdiction. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, all domestic and foreign insurance subsidiaries individually exceeded the minimum required statutory capital and surplus requirements and all domestic insurance subsidiaries individually exceeded RBC minimum required levels.\nFor foreign insurance companies, financial statements are prepared in accordance with local regulatory requirements. These accounting practices differ from U.S. GAAP primarily by different rules on deferral of policy acquisition costs, amortization of deferred acquisition costs, and establishing future policy benefit liabilities using different actuarial assumptions, as well as valuing for deferred taxes on a different basis.\nSUBSIDIARY DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\nPayments of dividends to us by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain restrictions imposed by regulatory authorities. With respect to our domestic insurance subsidiaries, the payment of any dividend requires formal notice to the insurance department in which the particular insurance subsidiary is domiciled. For example, unless permitted by the Superintendent of Financial Services, property casualty companies domiciled in New York generally may not pay dividends to shareholders that, in any 12-month period, exceed the lesser of \n10\n percent of such company’s statutory policyholders’ surplus or \n100\n percent of its “adjusted net investment income,” for the previous year, as defined. Generally, less severe restrictions applicable to property casualty companies exist in most of the other states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled. Under state insurance laws, an insurer may pay a dividend without prior approval of the insurance regulator when the amount of the dividend is below certain regulatory thresholds. Other foreign jurisdictions may restrict the ability of our foreign insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends. Various other regulatory restrictions also limit cash loans and advances to us by our subsidiaries.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n175\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n18. Statutory Financial Data and Restrictions\nThe amount of dividends available to be paid in 2025 from our insurance subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval was $\n2.5\n billion at December 31, 2024.\nTo our knowledge, no AIG insurance company is currently on any regulatory or similar “watch list” with regard to solvency.\nPARENT COMPANY DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS\nAt December 31, 2024, our ability to pay dividends is not subject to any significant contractual restrictions, but remains subject to regulatory restrictions.\nFor additional information about our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders, see Note 16.\n19. Share-Based Compensation Plans\nThe following table presents our total share-based compensation expense:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nShare-based compensation expense - pre-tax\n(a)\n$\n211\n \n$\n199\n \n$\n288\n \nShare-based compensation expense - after tax\n(b)\n167\n \n157\n \n228\n \n(a)\nAs a result of accelerated vesting events, such as retirement eligibility in the year of grant and involuntary terminations, we recognized $\n52\n million, $\n58\n million and $\n67\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, prior to the end of the specified vesting periods. It is our policy to reverse compensation expense for forfeited awards when they occur. \n(b)\nWe also recognized $\n16\n million of tax benefit due to share settlements occurring in 2024.\nEMPLOYEE PLANS\nThe Company sponsors several stock compensation programs under the AIG Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) (as amended) and its predecessor plan from which performance share units (PSUs), restricted stock units (RSUs), stock options and deferred stock units (DSUs) (collectively units) are issued. In addition, off-cycle grants are made from time to time during the year generally as sign-on awards to new hires or as a result of a change in employee status. The LTIP is governed by the AIG 2021 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2021 Omnibus Plan), which was adopted at the annual shareholders’ meeting in May 2021, replacing the AIG 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (2013 Plan).\nOur share-settled awards are settled with previously acquired shares held in AIG’s treasury.\nAIG Omnibus Incentive Plan\nThe 2021 Omnibus Plan provided for the grants of share-based awards to our employees and non-employee directors. The total number of shares granted under the 2021 Plan (the reserve) was the sum of 1) \n8.1\n million shares of AIG Common Stock, plus 2) the number of authorized shares that remained available for issuance under the 2013 Plan when the 2021 Omnibus Plan became effective, plus 3) the number of shares of AIG Common Stock relating to outstanding awards under the 2013 Plan at the time the 2021 Omnibus Plan became effective that subsequently were forfeited, expired, terminated or otherwise lapse or are settled in cash. Each share-based unit granted under the Omnibus Plan reduces the number of shares available for future grants by \none\n share. However, shares with respect to awards that are forfeited, expired or settled for cash are returned to the reserve. As of December 31, 2024, \n23,168,953\n shares are available for future grants.\nAIG Long Term Incentive Plan\nLong-Term Incentive (LTI) Awards\nThe LTIP provides for an annual award to certain employees, including our senior executive officers and other highly compensated employees that may be comprised of a combination of one or more of the following units: PSUs, RSUs or stock options.\nThe number of PSUs issued on the grant date (the target) provides the opportunity for LTIP participants (usually senior management) to receive shares of AIG Common Stock based on AIG achieving specified performance goals at the end of a \nthree-year\n performance period. These performance goals are pre-established by AIG’s Compensation and Management Resources Committee (CMRC) for each annual grant and may differ from year to year. The actual number of PSUs earned can vary from \nzero\n to \n200\n percent of the target for the 2024, 2023 and 2022 LTI awards, depending on AIG’s performance relative to a specified peer group and/or the outcome of pre-established financial goals, as applicable.\n176\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n19. Share-Based Compensation Plans\nRSUs and stock options are earned based solely on continued service by the participant. In addition, PSUs and RSUs accrue dividend equivalent rights (DERs) during the specified service period as AIG’s dividends are declared. These DERs are settled in cash only if the underlying units’ vesting conditions are met.\nVesting occurs on January 1 of the year immediately following the end of the \nthree-year\n performance and service period. Beginning in 2022, vesting for RSUs and stock options awarded occurs in three equal installments on the first, second and third anniversary of the grant date. Recipients must be employed at each vesting date to be entitled to share delivery, except upon the occurrence of an accelerated vesting event, such as an involuntary termination without cause, disability, retirement eligibility or death during the vesting period. However, for involuntarily terminated employees hired after April 1, 2022 unvested RSUs and options are forfeited on the termination date, while PSUs are pro-rated based on the number of completed years in the performance period.\nUnit Valuation\nThe fair value of time-vesting RSUs as well as PSUs that are earned based on certain company-specific metrics was based on the closing price of AIG Common Stock on the grant date; while the fair value of PSUs that are earned based on AIG’s relative total shareholder return (TSR) was determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation.\nThe following table presents the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of PSUs that vest based on AIG’s TSR:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nExpected dividend yield\n(a)\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nExpected volatility\n(b)\n28.72\n \n%\n37.98\n \n%\n47.60\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n(c)\n4.36\n \n%\n4.42\n \n%\n1.71\n \n%\n(a)\nThe award agreement provides that TSR for AIG and each member of the Peer Group will be calculated assuming dividends distributed are reinvested on the ex‑dividend date.\n(b)\nWe used the historical volatility over the most recent \n2.86\n-year period for AIG and the members of the Peer Group, commensurate with the remaining Performance Period as of the valuation date.\n(c)\nWe converted the semi-annual zero-coupon U.S. Treasury rates as of the valuation date to continuously compounded rates.

Option awards are generally granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the company’s stock on the grant date and are exercisable up to \n10\n years from the date of grant, or \n3\n years from the date of an involuntary termination or the option's expiration date, if earlier. The fair value of the options was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes model for the time-vesting options, and a Monte Carlo simulation for the hurdle-vesting options.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n177\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n19.

Employee Benefits\n20. Employee Benefits\nPENSION PLANS\nWe offer various defined benefit plans to eligible employees. Effective January 1, 2016, the U.S. defined benefit pension plans were frozen. Consequently, these plans are closed to new participants and current participants no longer earn benefits.\nThe U.S. AIG Retirement Plan (the qualified plan) is a noncontributory defined benefit plan subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA). In 2012, the qualified plan was converted to a cash balance formula comprised of pay credits based on \n6\n% of a plan participant’s annual compensation (subject to IRS limitations) and annual interest credits. Although benefits are frozen, these interest credits continue to accrue on the cash balance accounts of active participants, who also accrue years of service for purposes of early retirement eligibility and subsidies. Employees can take their vested benefits as a lump sum or an annuity option when they leave AIG or are terminated from the plan.\nEmployees satisfying certain age and service requirements (i.e., grandfathered employees) remain covered under the average pay formula that was in effect prior to the conversion. The final average pay formula is based upon a percentage of final average compensation multiplied by years of credited service, up to \n44\n years. Grandfathered employees will receive the higher of the benefit under the cash balance formula or the final average pay formula at retirement.\nIn the U.S. we also sponsor non-qualified unfunded defined benefit plans, such as the AIG Non-Qualified Retirement Income Plan (AIG NQRIP) for certain employees, including key executives, designed to supplement pension benefits provided by the qualified plan. The AIG NQRIP provides a benefit equal to the reduction in benefits under the qualified plan as a result of federal tax limitations on compensation and benefits payable.\nNon-U.S. defined benefit plans generally are either based on the employee’s years of credited service and compensation in the years preceding retirement or on points accumulated based on the employee’s job grade and other factors during each year of service.\nPOSTRETIREMENT PLANS\nU.S. postretirement medical and life insurance benefits are based upon the employee attaining the age of \n55\n and having a minimum of \nten years\n of service, which was reduced to \n5\n years in 2019 for medical coverage only. Eligible employees who have medical coverage can enroll in retiree medical upon termination of employment. Medical benefits are contributory, while the life insurance benefits, which are closed to new employees, are generally non-contributory. Retiree medical contributions vary from none for pre-1989 retirees to actual premium payments reduced by certain subsidies for post-1992 retirees.

This method provides a more precise measurement of interest cost by aligning the timing of the plans’ discounted cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve. For certain non-U.S. plans, interest cost is measured utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the benefit obligations.\nA 100 basis point increase in the expected long-term rate of return would decrease the 2025 pension expense by approximately $\n35\n million with all other items remaining the same. A 100 basis point increase in the discount rate would increase the 2025 pension expense by approximately $\n2\n million. Conversely, a 100 basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease the 2024 pension expense by approximately $\n3\n million while a 100 basis point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return would increase the 2025 pension expense by approximately $\n35\n million, with all other items remaining the same.\nASSUMPTIONS\nThe following table summarizes the weighted average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations:\nPension\nPostretirement\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\n(a)\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\n(a)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDiscount rate\n5.57\n \n%\n2.87\n \n%\n5.53\n \n%\n4.97\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate\n4.37\n \n%\n1.36\n \n%\n(b)\nN/A\nN/A\nRate of compensation increase\nN/A\n(c)\n2.43\n \n%\nN/A\nN/A\nDecember 31, 2023\nDiscount rate\n4.98\n \n%\n2.85\n \n%\n4.97\n \n%\n5.37\n \n%\nInterest crediting rate\n4.94\n \n%\n1.40\n \n%\n(b)\nN/A\nN/A\nRate of compensation increase\nN/A\n(c)\n2.42\n \n%\nN/A\nN/A\n(a)\nThe non-U.S. plans reflect those assumptions that were most appropriate for the local economic environments of each of the subsidiaries providing such benefits.\n(b)\nRepresents the weighted average interest crediting rate of non-U.S. cash balance plans primarily in Japan and Switzerland.\n(c)\nCompensation increases are no longer applicable as the plan is frozen effective January 1, 2016.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n181\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n20.

The discount rates were \n5.57\n percent at December 31, 2024 and \n4.98\n percent at December 31, 2023.\n \nThe methodology was consistently applied for the respective years in determining the discount rates for the other U.S. pension plans.\nIn general, the discount rates for the non-U.S. plans were developed using a similar methodology to the U.S. AIG Retirement Plan, by using country-specific Mercer Yield Curves.\nThe projected benefit obligation for AIG’s Japan pension plans represents approximately \n50\n percent and \n54\n percent of the total projected benefit obligations for our non-U.S. pension plans at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The weighted average discount rate of \n1.81\n percent and \n1.48\n percent at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was selected by reference to the Mercer Yield Curve for Japan.\nPlan Assets\nThe investment strategy with respect to assets relating to our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans is designed to achieve investment returns that will provide for the benefit obligations of the plans over the long term, limit the risk of short-term funding shortfalls and maintain liquidity sufficient to address cash needs. Accordingly, the asset allocation strategy is designed to maximize the investment rate of return while managing various risk factors, including, but not limited to, volatility relative to the benefit obligations, liquidity, and concentration, and incorporates the risk/return profile applicable to each asset class.\nThere were \nno\n shares of AIG Common Stock included in the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets at December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n182\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n | \n20. Employee Benefits\nU.S. Pension Plan\nThe assets of the qualified plan are monitored by the AIG U.S. Investment Committee and actively managed by the investment managers, which involves allocating the plan’s assets among approved asset classes within ranges as permitted by the strategic allocation. The long-term strategic asset allocation historically has been reviewed and revised approximately every \nthree years\n. The investment strategy is focused on de-risking the qualified plan via regular monitoring through liability driven investing and the glide path approach, where the glide path defines the target allocation for the “Return-Seeking” portion of the portfolio (i.e., growth assets) based on the funded ratio and level of interest rates. Under this approach, the allocation to growth assets is reduced and the allocation to liability-hedging assets is increased as the plan’s funded ratio increases in accordance with the defined glide path.\nThe following table presents the asset allocation percentage by major asset class for the U.S. qualified plan and the target allocation for 2025 based on the plan’s funded status at December 31, 2024:\nAt December 31,\nTarget 2025\nActual 2024\nActual 2023\nAsset class:\nEquity securities\n9\n \n%\n13\n \n%\n8\n \n%\nFixed maturity securities\n80\n \n72\n \n77\n \nOther investments\n11\n \n15\n \n15\n \nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\nThe expected weighted average long-term rate of return for the plan was \n6.50\n percent and \n6.25\n percent for 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nThe expected weighted average rate of return is an aggregation of expected returns within each asset class category, weighted for the investment mix of the assets. The combination of the expected asset return and any contributions made by us are expected to maintain the plan’s ability to meet all required benefit obligations. The expected asset return for each asset class was developed based on an approach that considers key fundamental drivers of the asset class returns in addition to historical returns, current market conditions, asset volatility and the expectations for future market returns.\nNon-U.S. Pension Plans\nThe assets of the non-U.S. pension plans are held in various trusts in multiple countries and are invested primarily in equities and fixed maturity securities to maximize the long-term return on assets for a given level of risk.\nThe following table presents the asset allocation percentage by major asset class for non-U.S. pension plans and the target allocation:\nAt December 31,\nTarget 2025\nActual 2024\nActual 2023\nAsset class:\nEquity securities\n20\n \n%\n20\n \n%\n19\n \n%\nFixed maturity securities\n58\n \n47\n \n45\n \nOther investments\n18\n \n24\n \n21\n \nCash and cash equivalents\n4\n \n9\n \n15\n \nTotal\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\n100\n \n%\nThe assets of AIG’s Japan pension plans represent approximately \n66\n percent and \n67\n percent of total non-U.S. pension plan assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The expected long-term rate of return was \n1.85\n percent for both 2024 and 2023, and is evaluated by the Japanese Pension Investment Committee on a quarterly and annual basis along with various investment managers and is revised to achieve the optimal allocation to meet targeted funding levels if necessary.

The non-qualified and postretireme\nnt plans’ benefit payments are deductible when paid to participants.\nOur annual pension contribution in 2025 is expected to be approximately $\n53\n million for our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans. \nThis estimate is subject to change, since contribution decisions are affected by various factors including our liquidity, market performance and management’s discretion.\nThe expected future benefit payments, net of participants’ contributions, with respect to the defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans, are as follows:\nPension\nPostretirement\n(in millions)\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\n2025\n$\n261\n \n$\n39\n \n$\n8\n \n$\n1\n \n2026\n254\n \n43\n \n7\n \n1\n \n2027\n262\n \n44\n \n7\n \n2\n \n2028\n255\n \n49\n \n7\n \n2\n \n2029\n259\n \n47\n \n7\n \n2\n \n2030-2034\n1,138\n \n235\n \n32\n \n9\n \nDEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS\nAIG Parent sponsors several defined contribution plans for U.S. employees that provide for pre-tax salary reduction contributions by employees. The most significant plan is the AIG Incentive Savings Plan (ISP), for which the matching contribution is \n100\n percent of the first \n6\n% of a participant’s contributions, subject to the IRS-imposed limitations. Participants in the AIG ISP receive an additional fully vested, non-elective, non-discretionary contribution equal to \n3\n% of the participant’s eligible compensation for the plan year, paid each pay period regardless of whether the participant currently contributes to the plan, and subject to the IRS-imposed limitations. \nOur pre-tax expenses associated with these plans were $\n87\n million,$\n95\n million and $\n100\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n185\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n |\n \n21. Income Taxes\n21. Income Taxes\nU.S. TAX LAW CHANGES\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (H.R. 5376) includes a 15 percent corporate alternative minimum tax (CAMT) on adjusted financial statement income for corporations with average profits over $1 billion over a three-year period. While the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued proposed regulations for CAMT during the third quarter of 2024, there are still certain details and specifics of application of the CAMT that remain unclear and we continue to evaluate the impact of the proposed regulations along with prior guidance. \nBASIS OF PRESENTATION\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return with our eligible U.S. subsidiaries. Income earned by subsidiaries operating outside the U.S. is taxed, and income tax expense is recorded, based on applicable U.S. and foreign laws.\nTAX ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nWe consider our foreign earnings with respect to certain operations in Canada, South Africa, Japan, Latin America, Bermuda as well as the European, Asia Pacific and Middle East regions to be indefinitely reinvested. These earnings relate to ongoing operations and have been reinvested in active business operations. A deferred tax liability has not been recorded for those foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested. If recorded, such deferred tax liability would not be material to our consolidated financial condition. Deferred taxes, if necessary, have been provided on earnings of non-U.S. affiliates whose earnings are not indefinitely reinvested. \nGlobal Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) imposes U.S. taxes on the excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of certain foreign subsidiaries. Consistent with accounting guidance, we have made an accounting policy election to treat GILTI taxes as a period tax charge in the period the tax is incurred.\nEFFECTIVE TAX RATE\nThe following table presents income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit) by U.S. and foreign location in which such pre-tax income (loss) was earned or incurred:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nU.S.\n$\n1,818\n \n$\n900\n \n$\n1,950\n \nForeign\n2,052\n \n1,967\n \n1,822\n \nTotal\n$\n3,870\n \n$\n2,867\n \n$\n3,772\n \nThe following table presents the income tax expense (benefit) attributable to pre-tax income (loss) from continuing operations: \nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nForeign and U.S. components of actual income tax expense (benefit):\nU.S.:\nCurrent\n$\n283\n \n$\n(\n246\n)\n$\n(\n713\n)\nDeferred\n416\n \n(\n110\n)\n1,173\n \nForeign:\nCurrent\n374\n \n422\n \n261\n \nDeferred\n97\n \n60\n \n161\n \nTotal\n$\n1,170\n \n$\n126\n \n$\n882\n \n186\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n |\n \n21.

Expiration periods are based on the year the carryforward was generated\n.\nASSESSMENT OF DEFERRED TAX ASSET VALUATION ALLOWANCE\nThe evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the need for a valuation allowance requires us to weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The weight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. The more negative evidence that exists, the more positive evidence is necessary and the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed.\nDuring the fourth quarter, taxable income projections were updated to reflect the latest projections of income for our insurance and non-insurance companies, 2024 transactions, and projections of taxable income generated from prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Given there is a shorter carryforward period to utilize remaining net operating losses, we continue to consider multiple data points and stresses. Additionally, significant market volatility continues to impact actual and projected results of our business operations as well as our views on potential effectiveness of certain prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In order to demonstrate the predictability and sufficiency of future taxable income necessary to support the realizability of the net operating losses and foreign tax credit carryforwards, we have considered forecasts of future income for each of our businesses, including assumptions about future macroeconomic and AIG-specific conditions and events, and any impact these conditions and events may have on our prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. We also subjected the forecasts to a variety of stresses of key assumptions and evaluated the effect on tax attribute utilization.\nAfter factoring in multiple data points and assessing the relative weight of all positive and negative evidence, we concluded that a valuation allowance of $\n300\n million should remain on a portion of AIG's U.S. federal consolidated income tax group tax attribute carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be realized. Accordingly, during the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded no change in valuation allowance. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, recent changes in market conditions, including changes in interest rates, impacted the unrealized tax gains and losses in the available for sale securities portfolios of our general insurance and non-insurance companies, resulting in a decrease to deferred tax assets related to net unrealized tax capital losses. The deferred tax assets relate to the unrealized tax capital losses for which the carryforward period has not yet begun. As of December 31, 2024, based on all available evidence, we concluded that a valuation allowance of $\n509\n million is necessary on deferred tax assets related to unrealized tax capital losses that are not more-likely-than-not to be realized. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded a decrease in valuation allowance of $\n41\n million associated with the unrealized tax capital losses in AIG's available for sale securities portfolio. The valuation allowance decrease was allocated to other comprehensive income. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, we recognized a net $\n31\n million decrease in deferred tax asset valuation allowance associated with certain foreign and state jurisdictions.\nThe following table presents the net deferred tax assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2024 and 2023 on a U.S. GAAP basis:\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\nNet U.S. deferred tax assets\n$\n4,922\n \n$\n5,992\n \nNet deferred tax assets (liabilities) in AOCI\n421\n \n509\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n798\n)\n(\n840\n)\nSubtotal\n4,545\n \n5,661\n \nNet foreign, state and local deferred tax assets\n1,263\n \n1,431\n \nValuation allowance\n(\n852\n)\n(\n906\n)\nSubtotal\n411\n \n525\n \nSubtotal - Net U.S., foreign, state and local deferred tax assets\n4,956\n \n6,186\n \nNet foreign, state and local deferred tax liabilities\n(\n426\n)\n(\n347\n)\nTotal AIG net deferred tax assets (liabilities)\n$\n4,530\n \n$\n5,839\n \n188\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n |\n \n21. Income Taxes\nTAX EXAMINATIONS\nWe are currently under examination by the IRS for the tax years 2011 through 2019. \nWe continue to engage in the IRS Appeals process for certain disagreed issues related to tax years 2007-2010. These tax years are still subject to ongoing computational review by IRS Appeals.\nListed below are the tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions:\nAt December 31, 2024\nOpen Tax Years\nMajor Tax Jurisdiction\nUnited States\n2007\n-\n2023\nAustralia\n2020\n-\n2023\nCanada\n2020\n-\n2023\nFrance\n2022\n-\n2023\nJapan\n2018\n-\n2023\nKorea\n2019\n-\n2023\nSingapore\n2020\n-\n2023\nUnited Kingdom\n2022\n-\n2023\nACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties:\nYears Ended December 31,\n(in millions)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year\n$\n1,387\n \n$\n1,191\n \n$\n1,157\n \nIncreases in tax positions for prior years\n3\n \n200\n \n29\n \nDecreases in tax positions for prior years\n(\n20\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n33\n)\nIncreases in tax positions for current year\n15\n \n—\n \n59\n \nLapse in statute of limitations\n(\n1\n)\n—\n \n(\n21\n)\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year\n$\n1,384\n \n$\n1,387\n \n$\n1,191\n \nThe activity in unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2023 is primarily attributable to the potential resolution of an IRS audit matter. There was no significant activity in unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2022. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023 and 2022, the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate were $\n1.4\n billion, $\n1.4\n billion and $\n1.2\n billion, respectively. Unrecognized tax benefits that would not affect the effective tax rate generally relate to such factors as the timing, rather than the permissibility of the deduction.\nInterest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in income tax expense. At December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, we had accrued liabilities of $\n53\n million, $\n52\n million and $\n63\n million, respectively for the payment of interest (net of the federal benefit) and penalties. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we accrued expense (benefit) of $\n1\n million, $(\n11\n) million, and $(\n2\n) million, respectively, for the payment of interest and penalties. There was no significant activity in interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefit for the years 2024, 2023 or 2022.  \nAlthough it is reasonably possible that a change in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12 months, based on the information currently available, we do not expect any change to be material to our consolidated financial condition.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n189\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 8\n | \nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n |\n \n22.

In connection with the preparation of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, an evaluation was carried out by AIG management, with the participation of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of December 31, 2024. Based on this evaluation, AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of AIG is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. AIG’s internal control over financial reporting is a process, under the supervision of AIG’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of AIG’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAIG management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on the criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). \nAIG management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2024, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on the criteria articulated in the 2013 Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the COSO. The effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)) that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n191\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 9B | \nOther Information\nOur officers and directors (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may, with our Board of Directors' approval, enter into plans for the purchase or sale of our Common Stock that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5-1(c) under the Exchange Act.

The accompanying condensed financial statements of the Registrant should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of American International Group, Inc. and subsidiaries included in the Registrant’s 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (Annual Report on Form 10-K) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 13, 2025.\nThe Registrant includes in its Statement of Income dividends from its subsidiaries and equity in undistributed income (loss) of consolidated subsidiaries, which represents the net income (loss) of each of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThe five-year debt maturity schedule is incorporated by reference from Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn December 14, 2022, AIG announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, AIG Financial Products Corp. (AIGFP), filed a voluntary petition to reorganize under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware and filed a proposed plan of reorganization. The reorganization will not have a material impact on the consolidated balance sheets of AIG or our respective businesses. AIGFP has no material operations or businesses and no employees. In conjunction with the bankruptcy filing, AIGFP and its consolidated subsidiaries were deconsolidated from the results of AIG, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $\n114\n million reported in Net gain (loss) on divestitures and other. The AIGFP loan receivable of $\n37.6\n billion was reclassified to a third party asset, which has a full allowance for credit losses. In addition, AIGFP and its subsidiaries were determined to be an unconsolidated variable interest entity.\nThe Registrant files a consolidated federal income tax return with certain subsidiaries and acts as an agent for the consolidated tax group when making payments to the Internal Revenue Service. The Registrant and its subsidiaries have adopted, pursuant to a written agreement, a method of allocating consolidated Federal income taxes. Amounts allocated to the subsidiaries under the written agreement are included in Due from affiliates in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets.\nUnder the U.S. federal tax laws, AIGFP will continue to join in filing of AIG’s consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and AIGFP’s net operating losses continue to be available to offset taxable income of AIG’s consolidated U.S. federal income tax group. Accordingly, deferred tax assets related to AIGFP’s net operating losses remain part of AIG’s deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2024. No additional valuation allowance is required in connection with AIGFP’s reorganization.\nIncome taxes in the accompanying Condensed Balance Sheets are composed of the Registrant’s current and deferred tax assets, the consolidated group’s current income tax receivable and deferred taxes related to tax attribute carryforwards of AIG’s U.S. consolidated federal income tax group.\nThe consolidated U.S. deferred tax asset for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards are recorded by the Parent Company, which files the consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return, and are not allocated to its subsidiaries. Generally, as, and if, the consolidated net operating losses and other tax attribute carryforwards are utilized, the intercompany tax balance will be settled with the subsidiaries.\nFor additional information, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n203\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nSupplementary Insurance Information\nSchedule III\nAt December 31, 2024, 2023\nSegment \n(in millions)\nDeferred Policy\nAcquisition Costs\nLiability for Unpaid\nLosses and Loss\nAdjustment Expenses,\nFuture Policy Benefits\nUnearned\nPremiums\nPolicy and\nContract Claims\n2024\nNorth America Commercial\n$\n379\n \n$\n39,619\n \n$\n5,936\n \n$\n—\n \nInternational Commercial\n718\n \n16,208\n \n5,773\n \n—\n \nGlobal Personal\n1,063\n \n7,899\n \n5,340\n \n—\n \nOther Operations\n(a)\n(\n95\n)\n6,759\n \n183\n \n31\n \n$\n2,065\n \n$\n70,485\n \n$\n17,232\n \n$\n31\n \n2023\nNorth America Commercial\n$\n317\n \n$\n39,758\n \n$\n5,660\n \n$\n—\n \nInternational Commercial\n691\n \n17,354\n \n5,789\n \n—\n \nGlobal Personal\n1,170\n \n8,339\n \n5,650\n \n—\n \nOther Operations\n(a)\n(\n61\n)\n6,409\n \n276\n \n23\n \n$\n2,117\n \n$\n71,860\n \n$\n17,375\n \n$\n23\n \nFor the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022\nSegment\n \n(in millions)\nPremiums\nNet\nInvestment\nIncome\nLosses and\nLoss Expenses\nIncurred\nAmortization of\nDeferred Policy\nAcquisition Costs\nOther\nOperating\nExpenses\nNet\nPremiums\nWritten\n2024\nNorth America Commercial\n$\n8,172\n \n$\n(b)\n$\n5,713\n \n$\n824\n \n$\n1,087\n \n$\n8,452\n \nInternational Commercial\n8,145\n \n(b)\n4,463\n \n1,018\n \n1,437\n \n8,364\n \nGlobal Personal\n7,140\n \n(b)\n3,862\n \n1,571\n \n1,565\n \n7,086\n \nOther Operations\n(a)\n80\n \n1,195\n \n529\n \n12\n \n1,440\n \n—\n \n$\n23,537\n \n$\n4,255\n \n$\n14,567\n \n$\n3,425\n \n$\n5,529\n \n$\n23,902\n \n2023\nNorth America Commercial\n$\n10,233\n \n$\n(b)\n$\n6,323\n \n$\n1,371\n \n$\n1,184\n \n$\n11,432\n \nInternational Commercial\n7,964\n \n(b)\n4,641\n \n943\n \n1,378\n \n8,168\n \nGlobal Personal\n6,894\n \n(b)\n3,811\n \n1,309\n \n1,782\n \n7,119\n \nOther Operations\n(a)\n473\n \n424\n \n618\n \n148\n \n1,055\n \n487\n \n$\n25,564\n \n$\n3,446\n \n$\n15,393\n \n$\n3,771\n \n$\n5,399\n \n$\n27,206\n \n2022\nNorth America Commercial\n$\n10,444\n \n$\n(b)\n$\n7,218\n \n$\n1,381\n \n$\n1,101\n \n$\n10,899\n \nInternational Commercial\n7,701\n \n(b)\n4,301\n \n938\n \n1,323\n \n7,877\n \nGlobal Personal\n7,195\n \n(b)\n3,888\n \n1,214\n \n1,928\n \n6,736\n \nOther Operations\n(a)\n1,425\n \n(\n12\n)\n54\n \n12\n \n1,807\n \n1,248\n \n$\n26,765\n \n$\n2,370\n \n$\n15,461\n \n$\n3,545\n \n$\n6,159\n \n$\n26,760\n \n(a)\nIncludes consolidation and elimination entries and reconciling items from adjusted pre-tax income to pre-tax income.\n See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n(b)\nNorth America Commercial, International Commercial and Global Personal does not include Net investment income as the investment portfolio results are managed at the General Insurance level.

Cybersecurity.\nBUSINESS AND STRATEGY RISKS\nBusiness and strategy risk encompasses those risks that stem from strategy risk, risk of legal and regulatory actions, risk of rating agency actions, reputational risk and intercompany dependencies. The major AIG strategy risks capture risk of losses due to the inability to implement appropriate business plans and strategies, make decisions, allocate resources or adapt to changes in the business environment. These risks include, but are not limited to pricing, distribution channels, acquisitions, and dispositions. The risk of legal and regulatory actions is defined as the risk that legal action or a change in regulation in the regions in which AIG does business will materially impact business operations, financial performance, and/or capital requirements. Risk drivers include, but are not limited to, adverse actions in legal or regulatory environment, and adverse actions or added complexity of accounting/tax standards. A downgrade by one or more of the rating agencies in the Insurer Financial Strength ratings of AIG’s insurance companies could limit their ability to write or prevent them from writing new business and impair their retention of customers and in-force business, and a downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Reputational risk events are typically linked to risk incidents, whether internal (e.g., data privacy breaches, fraud, etc.) or external (e.g., non-AIG insurance losses). The reputational impact may magnify the financial consequences of the original risk event (e.g., reduced sales in addition to fines).\n84\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 7 | \nEnterprise Risk Management\nAIG generates multiple connections and dependencies among its affiliates and legal entities. Financial interconnections are utilized by AIG to support the funding requirements of the business units, optimize group capital deployment within the organization, offer comfort to policyholders, regulators, and rating agencies, provide credit support for higher financial strength ratings, manage exposures, distribute risk appropriately, and meet client or regulatory requirements. To conduct its businesses, AIG relies on operational capabilities of several AIG affiliates and corporate functions. The operational interconnections can be categorized as employees, management information systems, real estate, shared services, and intellectual property.\nAIG monitors and reports on the above-mentioned risks through ongoing risk reporting to various committees, monitoring of capital positions, regular interaction with AIG businesses and functions, regulators, and rating agencies. AIG reputational risk protocols are incorporated into the overall risk management framework. On a regular basis, ERM performs Second Line Review and Challenge on many of these processes and approaches, including, but not limited to, budget and expense assumptions, pricing and reserving models, assumptions, and results. The Internal Audit Group performs audits on key processes and provides continuous monitoring on remediation of audit findings. Processes and controls are designed to respond proactively and in some cases, reactively, in an effective and consistent way.\nINSURANCE RISKS\nInsurance risk is defined as the risk of actual claims experience and/or policyholder behavior being materially different than initially expected at the inception of an insurance contract. Uncertainties related to insurance risk can lead to deviations in magnitude and/or timing of prospective cash flows associated with our liabilities compared to what we expected.\nWe manage our business risk oversight activities through our insurance operations. A primary goal in managing our insurance operations is to achieve an acceptable risk-adjusted return on equity. To achieve this goal, we must be disciplined in risk selection, premium adequacy, and appropriate terms and conditions to cover the risk accepted.\nWe operate our insurance businesses on a global basis, and we are exposed to a wide variety of risks with different time horizons. We manage these risks throughout the organization, both centrally and locally, through a number of processes and procedures, including but not limited to, pricing and risk selection models, pricing approval processes, pre-launch approval of product design, development, and distribution, underwriting approval processes and authorities, modeling and reporting of aggregations and limit concentrations at multiple levels, model risk management framework and validation processes, risk transfer tools, review and challenge of reserves, actuarial profitability and reserve reviews, management of the relationship between assets and liabilities, and experience monitoring and assumption updates. \nRisks primarily include loss reserves, underwriting, catastrophe exposure, single risk loss exposure, and reinsurance. The potential inadequacy of the liabilities we establish for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is a key risk faced by the General Insurance companies, which we manage through internal controls and oversight of the loss reserve setting process, as well as reviews by external experts. \nFor further information, see Critical Accounting Estimates – Loss Reserves.\nThe potential inadequacy of premiums charged for future risk periods on risks underwritten in our portfolios can impact the General Insurance companies’ ability to achieve an underwriting profit. We develop pricing based on our estimates of losses and expenses, but factors such as market pressures and the inherent uncertainty and complexity in estimating losses may result in premiums that are inadequate to generate underwriting profit. \nOur business is exposed to various catastrophic events, including natural disasters, man-made catastrophes, or pandemic disease, in which multiple losses can occur and affect multiple lines of business in any calendar year, adversely affecting our business and operating results. Concentration of exposure in certain industries or geographies may cause us to suffer disproportionate losses. \nOur business is exposed to loss events, such as fires or explosions, that have the potential to generate losses from a single insured client. The net risk to us is managed to acceptable limits established by the Chief Underwriting Officer through a combination of internal underwriting standards and external reinsurance. \nSince we use reinsurance to limit our losses, we are exposed to risks associated with reinsurance including the recoverability of expected payments from reinsurers due to either an inability or unwillingness to pay, contracts that do not respond properly to the event or actual reinsurance coverage that is different than anticipated, which is monitored through our credit risk management framework.\nWe closely manage insurance risk by monitoring and controlling the nature and geographic location of the risks in each underwritten line of business, concentrations in industries, the terms and conditions of the underwriting and the premiums we charge for taking on the risk. We analyze concentrations of risks using various modeling techniques, including both probability distributions (stochastic) and/or single-point estimates (deterministic) approaches.\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\n85\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 7 | \nEnterprise Risk Management\nRisk Measurement, Monitoring and Limits\nWe use several approaches to measure our insurance risk exposure including sensitivity and scenario analyses, stochastic methods, and experience studies. Additionally, there are risk-specific assessment tools in place to appropriately manage the variety of insurance risks to which we are exposed.\nFor additional information on our three-tiered hierarchy of limits, see – Risk Appetite, Limits, Identification and Measurement – Risk Limits.\nNatural Catastrophe Risk\nWe manage catastrophe exposure with multiple approaches such as setting risk limits based on aggregate Probable Maximum Loss (PML) modeling, monitoring overall exposures and risk accumulations, modifying our gross underwriting standards, and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance through both the traditional reinsurance and capital markets in addition to other reinsurance protections.\nWe use third-party catastrophe risk models and other tools to evaluate and simulate frequency and severity of catastrophic events and associated losses to our portfolios of exposures with adjustments applied to modeled losses to account for loss adjustment expenses, model biases, data quality and non-modeled risks.\nWe recognize that climate change has implications for insurance industry exposure to natural catastrophe risk. With multiple levels of risk management processes in place, we actively analyze the latest climate science and policies to anticipate potential changes to our risk profile, pricing models and strategic planning and will continue to adapt to and evolve with the developing risk exposures attributed to climate change. In addition, we provide insurance products and services to help our clients be proactive against the threat of climate change. \nThe table below details our modeled estimates of PML, net of reinsurance, on an annual aggregate basis. The 1-in-100 and 1-in-250 PMLs are the annual aggregate probable maximum losses with probability of 1 percent and 0.4 percent in a year, respectively. Estimates as of December 31, 2024 reflect our in-force portfolio for exposures as of July 1, 2024, and all inuring reinsurance covers as of December 31, 2024, except for the catastrophe reinsurance programs, which are as of January 1, 2025 and reflected as of such date.\nThe following table presents an overview of annual aggregate modeled losses for world-wide all perils and exposures arising from our largest primarily modeled perils:\nAt December 31, 2024\nNet of\nReinsurance\nNet of Reinsurance,\nAfter Tax\n(f)\nPercent of Total\nShareholders' Equity\nPercent of Total\nShareholders' Equity\nExcluding AOCI\n(in millions)\nExposures:\nWorld-wide all peril (1-in-250)\n(a)\n$\n2,535\n \n$\n2,002\n \n4.7\n \n%\n4.0\n \n%\nU.S. Hurricane (1-in-100)\n(b)\n932\n \n736\n \n1.7\n \n1.5\n \nU.S. Earthquake (1-in-250)\n(c)\n830\n \n655\n \n1.5\n \n1.3\n \nJapanese Typhoon (1-in-100)\n(d)\n278\n \n220\n \n0.5\n \n0.4\n \nJapanese Earthquake (1-in-250)\n(e)\n242\n \n191\n \n0.4\n \n0.4\n \n(a)\nThe world-wide all peril loss estimate includes wildfire exposure.\n(b)\nThe U.S. hurricane loss estimate includes losses to Commercial and Personal Property from hurricane hazards of wind and storm surge.\n(c)\nThe U.S. earthquake loss estimates represent exposure to Commercial and Personal Property, U.S. Workers’ Compensation and A&H lines of business.\n(d)\nJapan Typhoon loss estimate represents exposure to Commercial and Personal Property.\n(e)\nJapan Earthquake loss estimate represents exposure to Commercial and Personal Property and A&H lines of business.\n(f)\nTaxed at the statutory tax rate of 21 percent for both the U.S. and Japanese modeled losses. The majority of Japan exposures are ceded to our U.S. Pool.\nAIG, along with other property casualty insurance and reinsurance companies, uses industry-recognized catastrophe models and applies proprietary modeling processes and assumptions to arrive at loss estimates. The use of different methodologies and assumptions could materially change the projected losses, and our modeled losses may not be comparable to estimates made by other companies.\nAlso, the modeled results are based on the assumption that all reinsurers fulfill their obligations to us under the terms of the reinsurance arrangements. These estimates are inherently uncertain and may not accurately reflect our net exposure, inclusive of credit risk, to these events.\nOur 2025 property catastrophe reinsurance program is a worldwide program providing both aggregate and per occurrence protection, with differing per occurrence and aggregate retentions for North America, Japan, and rest of world. In 2025, for North America Commercial portfolio, we maintained the $500 million retention and increased the vertical limit purchased by $500 million. For the North America Personal Lines portfolio, as a consequence of increasing the US personal lines portfolio’s contribution to the aggregate cover, we increased the retention to $200 million. We also increased vertical limit purchased and achieved several coverage \n86\nAIG | 2024 Form 10-K\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nITEM 7 | \nEnterprise Risk Management\nenhancements. For the International portfolio, we retained our core attachment points for Japan of $200 million and $125 million for rest of world.\nWe have also purchased property per risk covers that provide protection against large losses globally, which include those emanating from non-critical catastrophe events (all events except for named windstorm and earthquake) globally as well as critical catastrophe events (named windstorm and earthquake) outside North America.\nActual results in any period are likely to vary, perhaps materially, from the modeled scenarios. The occurrence of one or more severe events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. \nFor additional information, see also Part 1,"
