  "item1_text": "Item 1. \nWe have grown our business through increased premium volume, expansion of product offerings and geographic reach, and acquisitions of other companies. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for our most recent acquisitions.\nOur product and geographic diversification differentiate us from the vast majority of our competitors and has been a source of stability during periods of industry volatility. Our long-term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income. By doing so, we provide value to our clients and shareholders through use of our substantial capital base in the insurance and reinsurance markets. \nWe are organized along a profit center structure by line of business and territory that does not necessarily correspond to corporate legal entities. Profit centers can access various legal entities subject to licensing and other regulatory rules. Profit centers are expected to generate P&C underwriting income, life segment income, and appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Our corporate structure has facilitated the development of management talent by giving each profit center's senior management team the necessary autonomy within underwriting authorities to make operating decisions and create products and coverages needed by its target customer base. We are focused on delivering P&C underwriting profit and life segment income by only writing policies which we believe adequately compensate us for the risk we accept.\nWe generate gross revenues from three principal sources: P&C income, Life income, and investment income. Cash flow is generated from premiums collected and investment income received less paid losses and loss expenses, policy acquisition costs, and administrative expenses. Invested assets are substantially held in liquid, investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration. Claims payments in any short-term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements. The value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates, stock market volatility, and credit events such as corporate defaults. The actual cost of claims is also volatile based on loss trends, inflation rates, court awards, and catastrophes. We believe that our cash balance, our highly liquid investments, credit facilities, and reinsurance protection provide sufficient liquidity to meet unforeseen claim demands that might occur in the year ahead. Refer to “Liquidity” and “Capital Resources” for additional information.\n41\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements include amounts that, either by their nature or due to requirements of generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (U.S. GAAP), are determined using best estimates and assumptions. While we believe that the amounts included in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflect our best judgment, actual amounts could ultimately materially differ from those currently presented. We believe the items that require the most subjective and complex estimates are:\n•\nunpaid loss and loss expense reserves, including long-tail asbestos and environmental (A&E) reserves and non-A&E casualty exposures;\n•\nfuture policy benefits reserves;\n•\nthe valuation of value of business acquired (VOBA);\n•\nthe assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts;\n•\nreinsurance reco\nverable, including a valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance;\n•\nthe valuation of our investment portfolio and assessment of valuation allowance for expected credit losses;\n•\nthe valuation of deferred income taxes; and\n•\nthe assessment of goodwill for impairment.\nWe believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts and should be read in conjunction with the sections entitled: Prior Period Development, Asbestos and Environmental (A&E), Reinsurance Recoverable on Ceded Reinsur\nance, Investments, and Net Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses).\nUnpaid losses and loss expenses\nAs an insurance and reinsurance company, we are required by applicable laws and regulations and U.S. GAAP to establish loss and loss expense reserves for the estimated unpaid portion of the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses under the terms of our policies and agreements with our insured and reinsured customers. With the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. The net undiscounted reserves related to structured settlements and certain reserves for unsettled claims are immaterial.\nThe following table presents a roll-forward of our unpaid losses and loss expenses:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nGross Losses\nReinsurance Recoverable \n(1)\nNet Losses\nGross Losses\nReinsurance Recoverable \n(1)\nNet Losses\nBalance, beginning of year\n$\n80,122\n \n$\n17,884\n \n$\n62,238\n \n$\n75,747 \n$\n17,086 \n$\n58,661 \nLosses and loss expenses incurred\n32,534\n \n6,512\n \n26,022\n \n31,346 \n7,246 \n24,100 \nLosses and loss expenses paid\n(27,970)\n(6,467)\n(21,503)\n(27,802)\n(6,791)\n(21,011)\nOther (including foreign exchange translation)\n(682)\n(195)\n(487)\n— \n(83)\n83 \nConsolidation of Huatai\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n831 \n426 \n405 \nBalance, end of year\n$\n84,004\n \n$\n17,734\n \n$\n66,270\n \n$\n80,122 \n$\n17,884 \n$\n62,238 \n(1)\nNet of valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance.\nThe estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date (case reserves) and for obligations on claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR) at the balance sheet date. IBNR may also include provisions to account for the possibility that reported claims may settle for amounts that differ from the established case reserves. Loss reserves also include an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling unpaid claims (loss expenses). Our loss reserves comprise approximately 77 percent casualty-related business, which typically encompasses long-tail risks, and\n other risks where a high degree of judgment is required.\nThe process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments based on circumstances underlying the insured losses \n42\nTable of Contents\nknown at the date of accrual. For example, the reserves established for high excess casualty claims, asbestos and environmental claims, claims from major catastrophic events, or for our various product lines each require different assumptions and judgments to be made. The effects of inflation create additional uncertainty, while climate change could, over time, add new uncertainties to the loss reserving process.\nNecessary judgments are based on numerous factors and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methods are developed, or as laws change. Hence, ultimate loss payments may differ from the estimate of the ultimate liabilities made at the balance sheet date. Changes to our previous estimates of prior period loss reserves impact the reported calendar year underwriting results adversely if our estimates increase or favorably if our estimates decrease. The potential for variation in loss reserve estimates is impacted by numerous factors. Reserve estimates for casualty lines are particularly uncertain given the lengthy reporting patterns and corresponding need for IBNR.\nCase reserves for those claims reported by insureds or ceding companies to us prior to the balance sheet date and where we have sufficient information are determined by our claims personnel as appropriate based on the circumstances of the claim(s), standard claim handling practices, and professional judgment. Furthermore, for our Brandywine run-off operations and our assumed reinsurance operation, Global Reinsurance, we may adjust the case reserves as notified by the ceding company if the judgment of our respective claims department differs from that of the cedant.\nWith respect to IBNR reserves and those claims that have been incurred but not reported prior to the balance sheet date, there is, by definition, limited actual information to form the case reserve estimate and reliance is placed upon historical loss experience and actuarial methods to estimate the ultimate loss obligations and the corresponding amount of IBNR. IBNR reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate amount of losses for a product line and subtracting paid losses and case reserves for reported claims. The judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses may pertain to the use and interpretation of various standard actuarial reserving methods that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, lo\nss development patterns, industry data, and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the required IBNR reserve also requires judgment by actuaries and management to reflect the impact of more contemporary and subjective factors, both qualitative and quantitative. Among some of these factors that might be considered are changes in business mix or volume, changes in ceded reinsurance structures, changes in claims handling practices, reported and projected loss trends, inflation, the legal environment, and the terms and conditions of the contracts sold to our insured parties.\nDetermining management's best estimate\nOur recorded reserves represent management's best estimate of the provision for unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date, and establishing them involves a process that includes collaboration with various relevant parties in the company. For information on our reserving process, refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSensitivity to underlying assumptions\nWhile we believe that our reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses at December 31, 2024, is adequate, new information or emerging trends that differ from our assumptions may lead to future development of losses and loss expenses that is significantly greater or less than the recorded reserve, which could have a material effect on future operating results. As noted previously, our best estimate of required loss reserves for most portfolios is judgmentally selected for each origin year after considering the results from a number of reserving methods and is not a purely mechanical process. Therefore, it is difficult to convey, in a simple and quantitative manner, the impact that a change to a single assumption will have on our best estimate. In the examples below, we attempt to give an indication of the potential impact by isolating a single change for a specific reserving method that would be pertinent in establishing the best estimate for the product line described. We consider each of the following sensitivity analyses to represent a reasonably likely deviation in the underlying assumption.\nNorth America Commercial P&C Insurance - Workers' Compensation\nGiven the long reporting and paid development patterns for workers' compensation business, the development factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for our current exposure require considerable judgment that could be material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves. Specifically, adjusting ground up ultimate losses by a one percentage point change in the tail factor (i.e., 1.04 changed to either 1.05 or 1.03) would cause a change of approximately $1.1 billion, either positive or negative, for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves. This represents an impact of about 10.9 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $10.2 billion.\nNorth America Commercial P&C Insurance – Liability\nAs is the case for Workers’ Compensation above, given the long reporting and paid development patterns, the development factors used to project actual current losses to ultimate losses for our current exposure require considerable judgment that could \n43\nTable of Contents\nbe material to consolidated loss and loss expense reserves. Specifically, for our main U.S. Excess/Umbrella portfolios, a five percentage point change in the tail factor (e.g., 1.10 changed to either 1.15 or 1.05) would cause a change of approximately $0.8 billion, either positive or negative, for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves. This represents an impact of about 18 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $4.3 billion for these portfolios.\nThe reserve portfolio for our Chubb Bermuda operations contains exposure to high excess liability, D&O and other professional liability coverage (typically with attachment points in excess of $100 million and gross limits of up to $150 million). Due to the layer of exposure covered, the expected frequency for this book is very low. As a result of the low frequency/high severity nature of the book, a small difference in the actual vs. expected claim frequency, either positive or negative, could result in a material change to the projected ultimate loss if such change in claim frequency was related to a policy where significant limits were deployed.\nNorth America Personal P&C Insurance\nDue to the relatively short-tailed nature of many of the coverages involved (e.g., homeowners property damage), most of the incurred losses in Personal Lines are resolved within a few years of occurrence. As shown in our loss triangle disclosure, the vast majority (over 90 percent) of Personal Lines net ultimate losses and allocated loss adjustment expenses are typically paid within five years of the accident date and almost 80 percent within two years. Even though there are significant reserves associated with some liability exposures such as personal excess/umbrella liability, our incurred loss triangle also shows a roughly consistent pattern of only relatively minor movements in incurred estimates over time by accident year especially after twenty-four months of maturity. While the liability exposures are subject to additional uncertainties from more protracted resolution times, the main drivers of volatility in the Personal Lines business are relatively short-term in nature and relate to things like natural catastrophes, non-catastrophe weather events, man-made risks, and individual large loss volatility from other fortuitous claim events.\nNorth America Agricultural Insurance\nApproximately 58 percent of the reserves for this segment are from the crop related lines, which all have short payout patterns, with the majority of the liabilities expected to be resolved in the ensuing twelve months. Claim reserves for our Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI) product are set on a case-by-case basis and our aggregate exposure is subject to state level risk sharing formulae as well as third-party reinsurance. The majority of the development risk arises out of the accuracy of case reserve estimates and the time needed for final crop conditions to be assessed. We do not view our Agriculture reserves as substantially influenced by the general assumptions and risks underlying more typical P&C reserve estimates.\nOverseas General Insurance \nCertain long-tail lines, such as casualty and financial lines, are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation. Heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world can increase the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty in the reserving estimates. Our reserving methods rely on loss development patterns estimated from historical data and while we attempt to adjust such factors for known changes in the current tort environment, it is possible that such factors may not entirely reflect all recent trends in tort environments. For example, when applying the reported loss development method, the lengthening of our selected loss development patterns by six months would increase reserve estimates on long-tail casualty and financial lines for accident years 2022 and prior by approximately $500 million. This represents an impact of 10.1 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $4.9 billion.\nGlobal Reinsurance\nAt December 31, 2024, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the Global Reinsurance segment aggregated to $1.9 billion, consisting of $756 million of case reserves and $1,112 million of IBNR. In comparison, at December 31, 2023, net unpaid losses and loss expenses for the Global Reinsurance segment aggregated to $1.7 billion, consisting of $744 million of case reserves and $909 million of IBNR.\nFor our catastrophe business, we principally estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses on an event basis by considering various sources of information, including specific loss estimates reported by our cedants, ceding company and overall industry loss estimates reported by our brokers, and our internal data regarding reinsured exposures related to the geographical location of the event. Our internal data analysis enables us to establish catastrophe reserves for known events with more certainty at an earlier date than would be the case if we solely relied on reports from third parties to determine carried reserves.\n44\nTable of Contents\nFor our casualty reinsurance business, we generally rely on ceding companies to report claims and then use that data as a key input to estimate unpaid losses and loss expenses. Due to the reliance on claims information reported by ceding companies, as well as other factors, the estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business. These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n•\nThe reported claims information could be inaccurate;\n•\nTypically, a lag exists between the reporting of a loss event to a ceding company and its reporting to us as a reinsurance claim. The use of a broker to transmit financial information from a ceding company to us increases the reporting lag. Because most of our reinsurance business is produced by brokers, ceding companies generally first submit claim and other financial information to brokers, who then report the proportionate share of such information to each reinsurer of a particular treaty. The reporting lag generally results in a longer period of time between the date a claim is incurred and the date a claim is reported compared with direct insurance operations. Therefore, the risk of delayed recognition of loss reserve development is higher for assumed reinsurance than for direct insurance lines; and\n•\nThe historical claims data for a particular reinsurance contract can be limited relative to our insurance business in that there may be less historical information available. Further, for certain coverages or products, such as excess of loss contracts, there may be relatively few expected claims in a particular year so the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability. In such cases, the actuary often relies on industry data from several recognized sources.\nWe mitigate the above risks in several ways. In addition to routine analytical reviews of ceding company reports to ensure reported claims information appears reasonable, we perform regular underwriting and claims audits of ceding companies to ensure reported claims information is accurate, complete, and timely. As appropriate, audit findings are used to adjust claims in the reserving process. We also use our knowledge of the historical development of losses from individual ceding companies to adjust the level of adequacy we believe exists in the reported ceded losses. If pricing a renewal contract, we compare data in the renewal submission to our financial data and investigate any discrepancies. \nOn occasion, there will be differences between our carried loss reserves and unearned premium reserves and the amount of loss reserves and unearned premium reserves reported by the ceding companies. This is due to the fact that we receive consistent and timely information from ceding companies only with respect to case reserves. For IBNR, we use historical experience and other statistical information, depending on the type of business, to estimate the ultimate loss. We estimate our unearned premium reserve by applying estimated earning patterns to net premiums written for each treaty based upon that treaty's coverage basis (i.e., risks attaching or losses occurring). At December 31, 2024, the case reserves, net of retrocessions, reported to us by our ceding companies approximated our recorded case reserves. Our policy is to post additional case reserves in addition to the amounts reported by our cedants when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than the evaluation of that claim by our cedant.\nTypically, there is inherent uncertainty around the length of paid and reported development patterns, especially for certain casualty lines such as excess workers' compensation or general liability, which may take decades to fully develop. This uncertainty is accentuated by the need to supplement client development patterns with industry development patterns due to the sometimes low statistical credibility of the data. The underlying source and selection of the final development patterns can thus have a significant impact on the selected ultimate net losses and loss expenses. For example, a 20 percent shortening or lengthening of the development patterns used for U.S. long-tail lines would cause the loss reserve estimate derived by the reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson method for these lines to change by approximately $184 million. This represents an impact of 20 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $935 million.\nCorporate\nWithin Corporate, we have exposure to certain liability insurance and reinsurance lines that have been in run-off, generally, since 1994. Unpaid losses and loss expenses relating to this run-off business reside within the Brandywine Division. Most of the remaining unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for the run-off business relate to A&E as well as molestation claims. \nThe A&E liabilities principally relate to claims arising from bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites. The estimation of our A&E liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal, social, and economic environment. We have not assumed any such future changes in setting the value of our A&E liabilities, which include provisions for both reported and IBNR claims.\n45\nTable of Contents\nThere are many complex variables that we consider when estimating the reserves for our inventory of asbestos accounts and these variables may directly impact the predicted outcome. We believe the most significant variables relating to our asbestos liabilities include the current legal environment; specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims; assumptions regarding trends with respect to claim severity and the frequency of higher severity claims; assumptions regarding the ability to allocate liability among defendants (including bankruptcy trusts) and other insurers; the ability of a claimant to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure; the ability of a policyholder to claim the right to unaggregated coverage; whether high-level excess policies have the potential to be accessed given the policyholder's claim trends and liability situation; payments to unimpaired claimants; and the potential liability of peripheral defendants. Based on the policies, the facts, the law, and a careful analysis of the impact that these factors will likely have on any given account, we estimate the potential liability for indemnity, policyholder defense costs, and coverage litigation expense. \nThe results in asbestos cases announced by other carriers or defendants may well have little or no relevance to us because coverage exposures are highly dependent upon the specific facts of individual coverage and resolution status of disputes among carriers, policyholders, and claimants.\nChubb's exposure to molestation claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when it purchased CIGNA's P&C business in 1999 and Chubb Corp in 2016. The vast majority of the current liability relates to exposure from recently enacted \"reviver\" legislation in certain states that allow civil claims relating to molestation to be asserted against policyholders that would otherwise be barred by statutes of limitations.\nFor additional information refer to the “Asbestos and Environmental (A&E)” section and to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFuture policy benefits\nChubb issues contracts that are classified as long-duration, which generally cover accident and supplemental health (A&H) products; term, credit, and whole life products (both participating and non-participating); endowment products; and annuities. Accordingly, Chubb establishes a liability for future policy benefits (FPBL) which comprises the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid along with certain related expenses, less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected. For traditional and limited-payment life insurance contracts, the FPBL is established using a net premium valuation methodology, such that expected policyholder benefit payments are accrued in proportion to premium revenue recognized. Under the net premium methodology, a net premium ratio (NPR) is calculated which requires assumptions on the future cash flow impact of numerous factors including mortality, morbidity, persistency, policyholder behavior, discount rates, and unpaid loss adjustment expenses. We have elected to use unpaid loss adjustment expense assumptions that are locked in at contract inception and are not subsequently reviewed or updated. Except for these expenses, assumptions are regularly reviewed. \nDetermining management’s best estimates\nFor traditional and limited-payment long-duration contracts, actuarial assumptions on mortality, morbidity, persistency, and policyholder behavior represent management’s long-term best estimates. These best estimate assumptions are generally based on our experience, industry experience, or other factors if there is not sufficient credibility. In establishing best estimate assumptions, we take into consideration the prospective impact of experience deterioration, product changes, distribution changes, and other relevant environmental changes which could result in differences from historically observed experience. Generally, we do not expect trends to change significantly in the short term and, to the extent trends may change, we expect the change to be gradual over the long term. Best estimate assumptions are reviewed and updated at least annually, and may be updated in interim periods if we observe a material change indicative of a long-term trend. Changes to best estimate assumptions impact expected future cash flows and result in a remeasurement of the FPBL. The FPBL is also remeasured to account for differences between expected and actual experience on mortality, morbidity, and persistency. All such remeasurements are reflected in Policy benefits in the Consolidated statements of operations in the period in which best estimate assumptions were updated.\nThe discount rates used to calculate the net premium ratio are locked in at policy inception, and serve as the basis to recognize interest expense for the life of the policy. Discount rates used to measure the carrying value of the FPBL are updated quarterly, and the differences between the liability balances calculated using the locked-in discount rates and the updated discount rates are recognized in Other comprehensive income (OCI). The discount rate methodology is designed to prioritize observable inputs based on market data available in the local debt markets where the respective policies were issued in the currency in which the policies are denominated. For the discount rates applicable to tenors for which the single-A debt market is not liquid or there is little or no observable market data, we use various estimation techniques, which include, but are not limited to: (i) for tenors \n46\nTable of Contents\nwhere there is less observable market data and/or the observable market data is available for similar instruments, estimating tenor-specific single-A credit spreads and applying them to risk-free government rates; (ii) for tenors where there is very limited or no observable single-A or similar market data, interpolation and extrapolation techniques. \nDeferred profit liabilities\nReserves for limited-payment contracts, under which benefits extend beyond the period of premium collection, also include a deferred profit liability (DPL) that represents gross premiums received in excess of expected net premiums. The amortization of DPL is included in Policy benefits on the Consolidated statements of operations, and is in relation to either the discounted amount of insurance in force for life insurance, or expected benefit payments for annuity contracts. The DPL is subject to the same best estimate assumptions used to determine future policy benefits reserves, however, there is no remeasurement of the DPL using then-current discount rates. \nSensitivities to underlying assumptions\nWhile we believe that our future policy benefits reserves of $16.1 billion are appropriate at December 31, 2024, new information or emerging trends that impact best estimate assumptions may have a material effect on the FPBL and future operating results.\nIn the table below, we give an indication of the potential impact on operating results from a hypothetical change in a single assumption; we do not consider a simultaneous change in a combination of assumptions. Additionally, the table assumes a parallel global shift in best estimate assumptions; however, these may be non-parallel in practice. While we consider each of the following assumption changes to represent a reasonably likely deviation, actual development may be materially different. Further, changes in best estimate assumptions could result in impacts to the Consolidated Financial Statements that are in excess of the amounts illustrated.\nThe following table shows the increase or (decrease) of the FPBL as a result of changes in various best estimate assumptions:\nLiability for Future Policy Benefits\nLife Insurance\n (in millions of U.S. dollars)\nTerm Life\nWhole Life\nA&H\nOther\nTotal\nDiscount rate\n +100 basis points\n(increase)/decrease in OCI\n$\n(33)\n$\n(2,030)\n$\n(345)\n$\n(82)\n$\n(2,490)\n - 100 basis points\n(increase)/decrease in OCI\n33 \n2,030 \n345 \n82 \n2,490 \nMortality\n+10%\n(increase)/decrease in net income\n23 \n46 \n— \n— \n69 \n   - 10%\n(increase)/decrease in net income\n(22)\n(49)\n1 \n— \n(70)\nMorbidity\n+10%\n(increase)/decrease in net income\n3 \n28 \n261 \n— \n292 \n   - 10%\n(increase)/decrease in net income\n(3)\n(29)\n(255)\n— \n(287)\nPersistency\n+10%\n(increase)/decrease in net income\n(7)\n(16)\n(21)\n(2)\n(46)\n   - 10%\n(increase)/decrease in net income\n7 \n17 \n21 \n2 \n47 \nValuation of value of business acquired (VOBA) and amortization of VOBA\nAs part of the acquisition of businesses that sell long-duration contracts, such as life products, we established an intangible asset related to VOBA, which represents the estimated fair value of the future profits of in-force long duration contracts. The valuation of VOBA at the time of acquisition is derived from similar assumptions to those used to establish the associated future policy benefits reserves, including mortality, morbidity, persistency, investment yields, expenses, and the discount rate. The most significant input in this calculation is the discount rate used to arrive at the present value of the net cash flows. We amortize VOBA as a component of Policy acquisition costs in the Consolidated statements of operations in relation to the profit emergence of the underlying contracts, which is generally in proportion to premium revenue recognized based upon the same assumptions used at the time of the acquisition. \nAt least annually, we perform a VOBA asset recoverability review using a premium deficiency test to ensure that the unamortized portion does not exceed the expected recoverable amounts. If we determine that the premium margins or gross \n47\nTable of Contents\nprofits are less than the unamortized balance, then the asset will be adjusted downward with the adjustment recorded as an expense in the current period. Unrecoverable costs are expensed in the period identified.\nRisk transfer \nIn the ordinary course of business, we both purchase (or cede) and sell (or assume) reinsurance protection. We discontinued the purchase of all finite risk reinsurance contracts, as a matter of policy, in 2002. For both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met in order to use reinsurance accounting, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses. If risk transfer requirements are not met, deposit accounting applies, typically resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract through a deposit asset or liability and not as revenue or expense. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include both insurance risk, consisting of underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. We also apply similar risk transfer requirements to determine whether certain commercial insurance contracts should be accounted for as insurance or a deposit. Contracts that include fixed premium (i.e., premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract) for fixed coverage generally transfer risk and do not require judgment.\nReinsurance and insurance contracts that include both significant risk sharing provisions, such as adjustments to premiums or loss coverage based on loss experience, and relatively low policy limits, as evidenced by a high proportion of maximum premium assessments to loss limits, can require considerable judgment to determine whether or not risk transfer requirements are met. For such contracts, often referred to as structured products, we require that risk transfer be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception. To support risk transfer, the cash flow analyses must demonstrate that a significant loss is reasonably possible. We use various tests to accomplish this, one of which is the ratio of the net present value of losses and commissions divided by the net present value of premiums equals or exceeds 110 percent with at least a 10 percent probability. For purposes of cash flow analyses, we generally use a risk-free rate of return consistent with the expected average duration of loss payments. In addition, to support insurance risk, we must prove the reinsurer's risk of loss varies with that of the reinsured and/or support various scenarios under which the assuming entity can recognize a significant loss.\nTo ensure risk transfer requirements are routinely assessed, qualitative and quantitative risk transfer analyses and memoranda supporting risk transfer are developed by underwriters for all structured products. We have established protocols for all products that include criteria triggering a risk transfer review of the contract prior to binding. If any criterion is triggered, a contract must be reviewed by a committee established by each of our segments with reporting oversight, including peer review, from our global Structured Transaction Review Committee.\nWith respect to ceded reinsurance, we entered into a few multi-year excess of loss retrospectively-rated contracts, principally in 2002. These contracts primarily provided severity protection for specific product divisions. Because traditional one-year reinsurance coverage had become relatively costly, these contracts were generally entered into in order to secure a more cost-effective reinsurance program. All of these contracts transferred risk and were accounted for as reinsurance. In addition, we maintain a few aggregate excess of loss reinsurance contracts that were principally entered into prior to 2003, such as the National Indemnity Company (NICO) contracts referred to in the section entitled, “Asbestos and Environmental (A&E)”. We have not purchased any other retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts since 1999.\nWith respect to assumed reinsurance and insurance contracts, products giving rise to judgments regarding risk transfer were primarily sold by our financial solutions business. Although we have significantly curtailed writing financial solutions business, several contracts remain in-force and principally include multi-year retrospectively-rated contracts and loss portfolio transfers. Because transfer of insurance risk is generally a primary client motivation for purchasing these products, relatively few insurance and reinsurance contracts have historically been written for which we concluded that risk transfer criteria had not been met. For certain insurance contracts that have been reported as deposits, the insured desired to self-insure a risk but was required, legally or otherwise, to purchase insurance so that claimants would be protected by a licensed insurance company in the event of non-payment from the insured.\nReinsurance recoverable \nReinsurance recoverable includes balances due to us from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses and is presented net of a valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. The valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is determined based upon a review of the financial condition of the reinsurers and other factors. Ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders. Consequently, an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts. We determine the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses using actuarial estimates as well as a determination of our ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under existing reinsurance contracts.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe recognition of a reinsurance recoverable asset requires two key judgments. The first judgment involves our estimation based on the amount of gross reserves and the percentage of that amount which may be ceded to reinsurers. Ceded IBNR, which is a major component of the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses, is generally developed as part of our loss reserving process and, consequently, its estimation is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as the estimation of gross IBNR (refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates – Unpaid losses and loss expenses”). The second judgment involves our estimate of the amount of the reinsurance recoverable balance that we may ultimately be unable to recover from reinsurers due to insolvency, contractual dispute, or for other reasons. Estimated uncollectible amounts are reflected in a valuation allowance that reduces the reinsurance recoverable asset and, in turn, shareholders' equity. Changes in the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reflected in net income. \nAlthough the obligation of individual reinsurers to pay their reinsurance obligations is based on specific contract provisions, the collectability of such amounts requires estimation by management. The majority of the recoverable balance will not be due for collection until sometime in the future, and the duration of our recoverables may be longer than the duration of our direct exposures. Over this period of time, economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations and while they may continue to acknowledge their contractual obligation to do so, they may not have the financial resources or willingness to fully meet their obligation to us.\nTo estimate the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, the reinsurance recoverable must first be determined for each reinsurer. This determination is based on a process rather than an estimate, although an element of judgment must be applied. As part of the process, ceded IBNR is allocated to reinsurance contracts because ceded IBNR is not generally calculated on a contract by contract basis. The allocations are generally based on premiums ceded under reinsurance contracts, adjusted for actual loss experience and historical relationships between gross and ceded losses. If actual premium and loss experience vary materially from historical experience, the allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will be reviewed and may change. While such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, it could, nevertheless, have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded. \nGenerally, we use a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. The primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, and forward looking default factors used to estimate the probability that the reinsurer may be unable to meet its future obligations in full. The definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in a Chubb-only beneficiary trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held by us with the same legal entity for which we believe there is a right of offset. We do not currently include multi-beneficiary trusts. However, we have several reinsurers that have established multi-beneficiary trusts for which certain of our companies are beneficiaries. The determination of the default factor is principally based on the financial strength rating of the reinsurer and a corresponding default factor applicable to the financial strength rating. Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current financial strength rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. Significant considerations and assumptions include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n•\nFor reinsurers that maintain a financial strength rating from a major rating agency, and for which recoverable balances are considered representative of the larger population (i.e., default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages), the judgment exercised by management to determine the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance of each reinsurer is typically limited because the financial rating is based on a published source and the default factor we apply is based on a historical default factor of a major rating agency applicable to the particular rating class. In 2024, the published historical default factors by rating class were updated and at December 31, 2024, default factors applied for financial ratings of AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, and CCC, are 0.4 percent, 1.1 percent, 1.5 percent, 3.1 percent, 7.3 percent, 11.2 percent, and 52.8 percent, respectively. Because our model is predicated on the historical default factors of a major rating agency, we do not generally consider alternative factors. However, when a recoverable is expected to be paid in a brief period of time by a highly-rated reinsurer, such as certain property catastrophe claims, a default factor may not be applied;\n•\nFor balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent or affiliated company, we may determine a rating equivalent based on our analysis of the reinsurer that considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity, industry benchmarks, or other factors as considered appropriate. We then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class. For balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which our ceded reserve is below a certain threshold, we generally apply a default factor of 11.2 percent;\n•\nFor balances recoverable from reinsurers that are either insolvent or under regulatory supervision, we establish a default factor and resulting valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance based on specific facts and circumstances surrounding \n49\nTable of Contents\neach company. Upon initial notification of an insolvency, we generally recognize expense for a substantial portion of all balances outstanding, net of collateral, through a combination of write-offs of recoverable balances and increases to the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. When regulatory action is taken on a reinsurer, we generally recognize a default factor by estimating an expected recovery on all balances outstanding, net of collateral. When sufficient credible information becomes available, we adjust the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance by establishing a default factor pursuant to information received; and\n•\nFor captives and other recoverables, management determines the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance based on the specific facts and circumstances.\nThe following table summarizes reinsurance recoverables and the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance for each type of recoverable balance at December 31, 2024:\nGross Reinsurance Recoverable on Losses and Loss Expenses\nRecoverables        (net of Usable Collateral)\nValuation allowance for Uncollectible Reinsurance \n(1)\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nType\nReinsurers with credit ratings\n$\n15,944\n \n$\n14,117\n \n$\n179\n \nReinsurers not rated\n332\n \n279\n \n31\n \nReinsurers under supervision and insolvent reinsurers\n107\n \n106\n \n44\n \nCaptives\n2,704\n \n557\n \n13\n \nOther, including structured settlements and pools\n1,000\n \n990\n \n43\n \nTotal\n$\n20,087\n \n$\n16,049\n \n$\n310\n \n(1)\n     \nThe valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based on a default analysis applied to gross reinsurance recoverables, net of approximately $4.0 billion of collateral at December 31, 2024.\nAt December 31, 2024, the use of different assumptions within our approach could have a material effect on the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. To the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers was to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, actual uncollectible amounts could be significantly greater than our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and our liquidity. Given the various considerations used to estimate our uncollectible valuation allowance, we cannot precisely quantify the effect a specific industry event may have on the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. However, based on the composition (particularly the average credit quality) of the reinsurance recoverable balance at December 31, 2024, we estimate that a ratings downgrade of one notch for all rated reinsurers (e.g., from A to A- or A- to BBB+) could increase our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance by approximately $54 million or approximately 0.3 percent of the gross reinsurance recoverable balance, assuming no other changes relevant to the calculation. While a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in our valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance and a charge to earnings in that period, a downgrade in and of itself does not imply that we will be unable to collect all of the ceded reinsurance recoverable from the reinsurers in question. Refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under item 8, for additional information.\nFair value measurements\nAccounting guidance defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable data (Level 3 inputs). Level 2 includes inputs, other than quoted prices within Level 1, that are observable for assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly. Refer to Note 4 and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under item 8, for information on our fair value measurements.\nAssessment of investment portfolio credit losses\nEach quarter, we evaluate expected credit losses (ECL) for fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale. Because our investment portfolio is the largest component of consolidated assets, ECL could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. Refer to Notes 1 f) and 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under item 8, for more information.\nDeferred income taxes\nAt December 31, 2024, the Consolidated balance sheet reflects a deferred tax asset of $1.60 billion and a deferred tax liability of $1.58 billion. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts \n50\nTable of Contents\nrecorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities separately for each tax-paying component (an individual entity or group of entities that is consolidated for tax purposes) in each tax jurisdiction. The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction. There may be changes in tax laws in a number of countries where we transact business that impact our deferred tax assets and liabilities. At each balance sheet date, management assesses the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the need for a valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future taxable income, principally derived from business plans and where there are appropriate available tax planning strategies. Projections of future taxable income incorporate assumptions of future business and operations that are apt to differ from actual experience. If our assumptions and estimates that resulted in our forecast of future taxable income prove to be incorrect, an additional valuation allowance could become necessary, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. At December 31, 2024, the valuation allowance of $1.08 billion reflects management's assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability of certain subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income.\nGoodwill impairment assessment\nGoodwill, which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired, was $19.6 billion and $19.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Goodwill is assigned to applicable reporting units of acquired entities at the time of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to a periodic evaluation for impairment at least annually, or earlier if there are any indications of possible impairment. Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is the same as, or one level below, an operating segment. The impairment evaluation first uses a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than a 50 percent probability) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. If a reporting unit fails this qualitative assessment, a single quantitative analysis is used to measure and record the amount of the impairment. In assessing the fair value of a reporting unit, we make assumptions and estimates about the profitability attributable to our reporting units, including: \n•\nshort-term and long-term growth rates; and\n•\nestimated cost of equity and changes in long-term risk-free interest rates.\nIf our assumptions and estimates made in assessing the fair value of acquired entities change, we could be required to write-down the carrying value of Goodwill which could be material to our results of operations in the period the charge is taken. Based on our impairment testing for 2024, we determined no impairment was required and none of our reporting units were at risk for impairment. For Goodwill balances, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under item 8. \n51\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Operating Results – Years Ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 \n \n% Change\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nNet premiums written\n$\n51,468\n \n$\n47,361 \n$\n41,720 \n8.7 \n%\n13.5 \n%\nNet premiums written - constant dollars \n(1)\n9.2 \n%\n13.5 \n%\nNet premiums earned\n49,846\n \n45,712 \n40,360 \n9.0 \n%\n13.3 \n%\nNet investment income\n5,930\n \n4,937 \n3,742 \n20.1 \n%\n31.9 \n%\nNet realized gains (losses)\n117\n \n(607)\n(1,085)\nNM\n(44.0)\n%\nMarket risk benefits gains (losses)\n(140)\n(307)\n80 \n(54.3)\n%\nNM\nTotal revenues\n55,753\n \n49,735 \n43,097 \n12.1 \n%\n15.4 \n%\nLosses and loss expenses\n26,022\n \n24,100 \n22,572 \n8.0 \n%\n6.8 \n%\nPolicy benefits\n4,714\n \n3,628 \n2,314 \n29.9 \n%\n56.8 \n%\nPolicy acquisition costs\n9,102\n \n8,259 \n7,339 \n10.2 \n%\n12.5 \n%\nAdministrative expenses\n4,380\n \n4,007 \n3,395 \n9.3 \n%\n18.0 \n%\nInterest expense\n741\n \n672 \n570 \n10.0 \n%\n18.0 \n%\nOther (income) expense\n(1,023)\n(836)\n89 \n22.4 \n%\nNM\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n323\n \n310 \n285 \n4.3 \n%\n8.7 \n%\nIntegration expenses\n39\n \n69 \n48 \n(43.4)\n%\n43.5 \n%\nTotal expenses\n44,298\n \n40,209 \n36,612 \n10.2 \n%\n9.8 \n%\nIncome before income tax\n11,455\n \n9,526 \n6,485 \n20.2 \n%\n46.9 \n%\nIncome tax expense\n1,815\n \n511 \n1,239 \nNM\n(58.8)\n%\nNet income\n9,640\n \n9,015 \n5,246 \n6.9 \n%\n71.9 \n%\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\n368\n \n(13)\n— \nNM\nNM\nNet income attributable to Chubb\n$\n9,272\n \n$\n9,028 \n$\n5,246 \n2.7 \n%\n72.1 \n%\nNM - not meaningful\n(1)     \nOn a constant-dollar basis.

Net income in 2024 was driven by record underwriting results and net investment income. Net income in 2023 includes the one-time deferred tax benefit of $1.14 billion, reflecting the transition provisions related to the enactment of Bermuda’s new income tax law.\n•\nConsolidated net premiums written were $51.47 billion, up 8.7 percent, or 9.2 percent in constant dollars. P&C net premiums written increased 7.7 percent, or 8.0 percent in constant dollars, with commercial insurance up 6.3 percent and consumer insurance up 12.9 percent. \n•\nThe P&C combined ratio was 86.6 percent compared with 86.5 percent in 2023. The P&C current accident year (CAY) combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was 83.1 percent compared with 83.9 percent in 2023. \n•\nTotal pre-tax catastrophe losses were $2.39 billion compared with $1.83 billion in 2023. \n•\nLife Insurance segment net premiums written increased 15.7 percent, or 18.5 percent in constant dollars, and segment income was a record $1.10 billion, up 4.6 percent, or 7.3 percent in constant dollars. Life insurance deposits collected increased $981 million, up 61.8 percent, or 65.5 percent in constant dollars. \n•\nPre-tax net investment income was a record $5.93 billion compared with $4.94 billion in 2023, primarily due to strong operating cash flow at higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities. \n52\nTable of Contents\nOutlook\n2024 was a simply outstanding year, as our results, top and bottom line, continue to demonstrate the broad and diversified nature of our company and the consistency of contributions from our businesses around the world: North America, Asia, Europe, Latin America, both commercial and consumer. As we look forward to 2025, we have good momentum and are optimistic about the year ahead. \nThe recent California wildfire disaster, which is a first quarter 2025 event, has an estimated net pre-tax cost of $1.5 billion and highlights our commitment to supporting our policyholders in times of need. Despite this, we expect continued strong performance across all business segments. Global P&C market conditions remain favorable, with significant growth opportunities across our operations, including commercial and consumer lines. We anticipate robust growth in operating earnings and earnings per share, driven by our key sources of income: P&C underwriting, investment income, and life insurance. \nWhile we acknowledge the challenges posed by natural disasters, we are well-positioned to continue delivering outstanding results in 2025. Our resilient business model and unwavering support for our policyholders will guide us as we move forward in the year ahead. \nNet Premiums Written\n% Change\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\n2024\n \n2023 \n2022 \n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nC$ 2024 vs. 2023\nProperty and other short-tail lines\n$\n9,543\n \n$\n8,414 \n$\n7,195 \n13.4 \n%\n16.9 \n%\n13.6 \n%\nCommercial casualty\n9,166\n \n8,291 \n7,715 \n10.5 \n%\n7.5 \n%\n10.5 \n%\nFinancial lines\n4,907\n \n5,069 \n5,070 \n(3.2)\n%\n— \n(3.2)\n%\nWorkers' compensation\n2,238\n \n2,239 \n2,164 \n— \n3.5 \n%\n— \nCommercial multiple peril \n(1)\n1,631\n \n1,492 \n1,311 \n9.3 \n%\n13.7 \n%\n9.3 \n%\nSurety\n785\n \n691 \n622 \n13.8 \n%\n11.0 \n%\n14.6 \n%\nTotal Commercial P&C lines\n28,270\n \n26,196 \n24,077 \n7.9 \n%\n8.8 \n%\n8.0 \n%\nAgriculture\n2,703\n \n3,188 \n2,907 \n(15.2)\n%\n9.7 \n%\n(15.2)\n%\nPersonal homeowners\n4,971\n \n4,429 \n3,901 \n12.2 \n%\n13.6 \n%\n12.6 \n%\nPersonal automobile\n2,491\n \n1,991 \n1,631 \n25.1 \n%\n22.1 \n%\n25.6 \n%\nPersonal other\n2,076\n \n1,929 \n1,817 \n7.6 \n%\n6.1 \n%\n8.3 \n%\nTotal Personal lines\n9,538\n \n8,349 \n7,349 \n14.2 \n%\n13.6 \n%\n14.7 \n%\nGlobal A&H - P&C \n3,285\n \n3,145 \n2,836 \n4.5 \n%\n10.9 \n%\n5.9 \n%\nReinsurance lines\n1,346\n \n1,018 \n943 \n32.2 \n%\n8.0 \n%\n32.2 \n%\nTotal Property and Casualty lines\n45,142\n \n41,896 \n38,112 \n7.7 \n%\n9.9 \n%\n8.0 \n%\nLife Insurance\n6,326\n \n5,465 \n3,608 \n15.7 \n%\n51.5 \n%\n18.5 \n%\nTotal consolidated\n$\n51,468\n \n$\n47,361 \n$\n41,720 \n8.7 \n%\n13.5 \n%\n9.2 \n%\n(1)\nCommercial multiple peril represents retail package business (property and general liability).\nThe increase in consolidated net premiums written in 2024 principally reflects growth across most product lines driven by strong premium retention, including rate and exposure increases, and strong new business.\n•\nProperty and other short-tail lines grew globally due to strong new business and retention, including rate increases.\n•\nCommercial casualty grew globally due to strong retention, including both rate and exposure increases, and strong new business.\n•\nFinancial lines declined due to lower renewal retention, including lower rates, due to a competitive market environment where pricing does not provide an adequate return.\n•\nWorkers’ compensation was flat.\n•\nCommercial multiple peril grew due to strong new business and retention, including higher rates and exposure, in North America.\n53\nTable of Contents\n•\nSurety grew due to strong new business.\n•\nAgriculture declined primarily due to lower commodity prices in the current year, and higher year-over-year premium cessions to the U.S. government.\n•\nPersonal lines grew globally due to new business and renewal retention, as well as increases in both rate and exposure, in homeowners and excess lines, in addition to growth in auto lines in certain international markets.

Net premiums earned increased $4.1 billion, up 9.0 percent, or 9.6 percent in constant dollars in 2024. P&C net premiums earned increased 8.1 percent, or 8.4 percent in constant dollars, comprising growth in commercial and consumer lines of 7.2 percent and 11.7 percent, respectively.\nCatastrophe Losses and Prior Period Development\nWe generally define catastrophe loss events consistent with the definition of the Property Claims Service (PCS) for events in the U.S. and Canada. PCS defines a catastrophe as an event that causes damage of $25 million or more in insured losses and affects a significant number of insureds. For events outside of the U.S. and Canada, we generally use a similar definition. Catastrophe losses are net of reinsurance and include reinstatement premiums, which are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. The reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted. \nPrior period development (PPD) arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss events that occurred in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premium from previous accident years. PPD includes adjustments relating to either profit commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. The expense adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies.\nRefer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation section for further information on reinstatement premiums on catastrophe losses and adjustments to prior period development.\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet catastrophe losses\n$\n2,387\n \n$\n1,828 \n$\n2,182 \nFavorable prior period development\n$\n856\n \n$\n773 \n$\n876 \nCatastrophe losses were primarily from the following events:\n• 2024: Severe weather-related events in the U.S. and internationally, including Hurricane Helene of $390 million and Hurricane Milton of $309 million.\n•\n2023: Severe weather-related events in the U.S. and internationally, Hawaii wildfires, and New Zealand storms.\n• 2022: Hurricane Ian losses of $975 million, winter storm Elliott losses of $400 million, severe weather-related events in the U.S. and internationally, Australia storms, and Colorado wildfires.\nPre-tax net favorable PPD for 2024 was $1,152 million in our active companies, including favorable development of $1,144 million in short-tail lines, mainly in property, marine, and U.S. homeowners, and favorable development of $8 million in long-tail lines, comprising favorable development in workers’ compensation mostly offset by adverse development in casualty lines, \n54\nTable of Contents\npredominantly commercial excess and umbrella and commercial auto liability.

Our corporate run-off portfolio had adverse development of $277 million, with $149 million related to legacy asbestos and environmental exposures and $49 million related to molestation claims.\nRefer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on prior period development.\nP&C Combined Ratio\nIn evaluating our segments excluding Life Insurance financial performance, we use the P&C combined ratio, the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. We calculate these ratios by dividing the respective expense amounts by net premiums earned. We do not calculate these ratios for the Life Insurance segment as we do not use these measures to monitor or manage the business in that segment. The P&C combined ratio is determined by adding the loss and loss expense ratio, the policy acquisition cost ratio, and the administrative expense ratio. A P&C combined ratio under 100 percent indicates underwriting income, and a combined ratio exceeding 100 percent indicates underwriting loss.\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\nCombined ratio:\nLoss and loss expense ratio\n60.4\n \n%\n60.6 \n%\n62.0 \n%\nPolicy acquisition cost ratio\n18.1\n \n%\n17.8 \n%\n17.8 \n%\nAdministrative expense ratio\n8.1\n \n%\n8.1 \n%\n7.8 \n%\nP&C Combined ratio\n86.6\n \n%\n86.5 \n%\n87.6 \n%\nCatastrophe losses\n(5.5)\n%\n(4.5)\n%\n(5.9)\n%\nPrior period development\n2.0\n \n%\n1.9 \n%\n2.5 \n%\nP&C CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses\n83.1\n \n%\n83.9 \n%\n84.2 \n%\nThe P&C CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased in 2024, reflecting a higher percentage of net premiums earned from property lines, and the contemplation of a higher underwriting gain in MPCI for the current crop year. These factors were offset by price changes not keeping pace with loss trends in financial lines, a change in mix of business away from products that have a lower policy acquisition cost ratio, and increased spending to support growth.\nThe P&C combined ratio was relatively flat, reflecting higher catastrophe losses in addition to the factors mentioned above.\nPolicy benefits\nPolicy benefits represent losses on contracts classified as long-duration and generally include accident and supplemental health products, term and whole life products, endowment products, and annuities. Policy benefits include (gains) losses from fair value changes in separate account liabilities that do not qualify for separate account treatment under U.S. GAAP. The offsetting movements of these liabilities are recorded in Other (income) expense in the Consolidated statements of operations. In addition, Policy benefits include the impact on the liabilities from (gains) losses on investment portfolios supporting certain participating policies. The offsetting movements of these liabilities are recorded in Realized gains (losses) in the Consolidated statements of operations.

The increase in premiums reflects growth of 7.4 percent in the North America Major Accounts and Specialty Insurance division and 6.5 percent in the North America Commercial Insurance division, and was across most lines of business, most notably in property and casualty lines. This growth was partially offset by declines in financial lines, reflecting a competitive market environment and lower retention, and planned corrective underwriting actions in Major Accounts primary and excess casualty that adversely impacted growth. \nNet premiums earned increased $1,592 million, or 8.6 percent, in 2024, reflecting the growth in net premiums written described above.\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio increased in 2024, reflecting higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable prior period development.\nThe CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was relatively flat in 2024, reflecting price changes not keeping pace with loss trends in financial lines, offset by a higher percentage of net premiums earned from property lines.\nNorth America Personal P&C Insurance\nThe North America Personal P&C Insurance segment comprises operations that provide high net worth personal lines products, including homeowners and complementary products such as valuable articles, excess liability, automobile, and recreational marine insurance and services in the U.S. and Canada.\n \n% Change\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\n2024\n \n2023 \n2022 \n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nNet premiums written\n$\n6,532\n \n$\n5,878 \n$\n5,313 \n11.1 \n%\n10.6 \n%\nNet premiums earned\n6,188\n \n5,536 \n5,180 \n11.8 \n%\n6.9 \n%\nLosses and loss expenses\n3,584\n \n3,511 \n3,186 \n2.1 \n%\n10.2 \n%\nPolicy acquisition costs\n1,239\n \n1,128 \n1,057 \n9.9 \n%\n6.7 \n%\nAdministrative expenses\n351\n \n329 \n291 \n6.7 \n%\n12.9 \n%\nUnderwriting income\n1,014\n \n568 \n646 \n78.5 \n%\n(12.2)\n%\nNet investment income\n433\n \n358 \n283 \n20.9 \n%\n27.0 \n%\nOther (income) expense\n1\n \n3 \n4 \n(59.3)\n%\n(35.2)\n%\nAmortization of purchased intangibles\n9\n \n9 \n10 \n— \n(5.3)\n%\nSegment income\n$\n1,437\n \n$\n914 \n$\n915 \n57.2 \n%\n(0.1)\n%\nCombined ratio:\nLoss and loss expense ratio\n57.9\n \n%\n63.4 \n%\n61.5 \n%\n(5.5)\npts\n1.9 \npts\nPolicy acquisition cost ratio\n20.0\n \n%\n20.4 \n%\n20.4 \n%\n(0.4)\npts\n— \npts\nAdministrative expense ratio\n5.7\n \n%\n5.9 \n%\n5.6 \n%\n(0.2)\npts\n0.3 \npts\nCombined ratio\n83.6\n \n%\n89.7 \n%\n87.5 \n%\n(6.1)\npts\n2.2 \npts\nCatastrophe losses\n(10.0)\n%\n(12.1)\n%\n(12.2)\n%\n2.1 \npts\n0.1 \npts\nPrior period development\n4.9\n \n%\n2.5 \n%\n3.6 \n%\n2.4 \npts\n(1.1)\npts\nCAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses\n78.5\n \n%\n80.1 \n%\n78.9 \n%\n(1.6)\npts\n1.2 \npts\nNet Catastrophe Losses and Prior Period Development\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet catastrophe losses\n$\n622\n \n$\n669 \n$\n631 \nFavorable prior period development \n$\n305\n \n$\n134 \n$\n186 \n57\nTable of Contents\nCatastrophe losses were primarily from the following events:\n•2024: Flooding in the U.S., hail, tornadoes, wind events, winter storm losses, Hurricane Helene, and Hurricane Milton.\n•2023: Flooding in the U.S., hail, tornadoes, wind events, winter storm losses, and Hawaii wildfires.\n•2022: Hurricane Ian losses, winter storm Elliott losses, and other severe weather-related events in the U.S., including Colorado wildfires.\nRefer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on prior period development.\nPremiums\nNet premiums written increased $654 million, or 11.1 percent, in 2024, driven by strong new business and retention, including positive rate and exposure increases in all lines. \nNet premiums earned increased $652 million, or 11.8 percent, in 2024, reflecting the growth in net premiums written described above. \nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio decreased in 2024, reflecting higher favorable prior period development and lower catastrophe losses.\nThe CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased in 2024, primarily reflecting an improvement from earned rate and exposure growth. Additionally, the improvement includes lower acquisition expenses due to commission reductions in our auto and excess lines. The improvement was partly offset by an increase in excess liability loss trends.\nNorth America Agricultural Insurance\nThe North America Agricultural Insurance segment comprises our North American based businesses that provide a variety of coverages in the U.S. and Canada including crop insurance, primarily Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI) and crop-hail through Rain and Hail Insurance Service, Inc.

Under the profit-sharing agreement, we retained more premium in 2023 given the below average crop year and higher losses experienced in certain states that year.\nNet premiums earned decreased $464 million, or 14.6 percent, in 2024, reflecting the factors described above.\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio decreased in 2024, reflecting higher favorable prior period development, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.\nThe CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased in 2024, which contemplates a higher underwriting gain for the current crop year. This was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of lower net premiums earned, and a change in the mix of business away from products that have a lower policy acquisition cost ratio.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOverseas General Insurance\nOverseas General Insurance segment comprises Chubb International and Chubb Global Markets (CGM).

Growth was most notably in property and casualty lines, partially offset by a decrease in financial and specialty lines. Net premiums written in 2024 also benefited from a large one-off structured transaction in the second quarter and from catastrophe reinstatement premiums.\nNet premiums earned increased $310 million, or 32.2 percent, in 2024, primarily reflecting the increase in net premiums written described above including the large one-off structured transaction and catastrophe reinstatement premiums, which were fully earned when written. \n62\nTable of Contents\nCombined Ratio\nThe combined ratio increased in 2024, primarily reflecting the impact of higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable prior period development. \n \nThe CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased in 2024, primarily due to favorable market conditions in property lines.

These expenses are one-time in nature and are not related to the on-going business activities of the segments. The Chief Executive Officer does not manage segment results or allocate resources to segments when considering these costs and they are therefore excluded from our definition of segment income.\nRefer to the respective sections that follow for a discussion of Net realized gains (losses), Net investment income (loss), Amortization of purchased intangibles, and Income tax expense (benefit). Refer to Notes 11 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on Market risk benefits gains (losses) and Other (income) expense, respectively.\nEffective Income Tax Rate\nOur effective tax rate (ETR) was 15.8 percent, 5.4 percent, and 19.1 percent in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Our ETR reflects a mix of income or losses in jurisdictions with a wide range of tax rates, permanent differences between U.S. GAAP and local tax laws, and the impact of discrete items. A change in the geographic mix of earnings could impact our ETR. The increase in the ETR from 2023 to 2024 was primarily due to a one-time deferred tax benefit recorded in 2023 of $1.14 billion related to the enactment of Bermuda’s new income tax law, and our mix of earnings among various jurisdictions, partially offset by discrete tax items.\n64\nTable of Contents\nNet Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses)\nWe take a long-term view with our investment strategy, and our investment managers manage our investment portfolio to maximize total return within specific guidelines designed to minimize risk. The majority of our investment portfolio is available-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nThe effect of market movements on our fixed maturities available-for-sale portfolio impacts Net income (through Net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold, when we write down an asset, or when we record a change to the valuation allowance for expected credit losses. For a further discussion related to how we assess the valuation allowance for expected credit losses and the related impact on Net income, refer to Note 1 f) \nto the Consolidated Financial Statements. The effect of market movements on fixed maturities related to consolidated investment products and investments supporting certain participating products in the Huatai portfolio impact Net realized gains (losses). Additionally, Net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of public and private equity securities and derivatives, \nincluding financial futures, options, and swaps. Changes in unrealized appreciation and depreciation on available-for-sale securities, resulting from the revaluation of securities held, changes in cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment, changes in current discount rate on future policy benefits, changes in instrument-specific credit risk on market risk benefits, unrealized postretirement benefit obligations liability adjustment, and cross-currency swaps designated as hedges for accounting purposes are reported as separate components of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in Shareholders’ equity in the Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents our net realized and unrealized gains (losses):\n \nYear Ended December 31\n \n2024\n2023\n2022\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nNet\nRealized\nGains\n(Losses)\n \nNet\nUnrealized\nGains\n(Losses)\nNet\nImpact\nNet\nRealized\nGains\n(Losses) \nNet\nUnrealized\nGains\n(Losses)\nNet\nImpact\nNet\nRealized\nGains\n(Losses) \nFixed maturities \n(1)\n$\n191\n \n$\n(251)\n$\n(60)\n$\n(481)\n$\n3,438 \n$\n2,957 \n$\n(1,049)\nInvestment and embedded derivative instruments\n(189)\n—\n \n(189)\n(53)\n— \n(53)\n(43)\nPublic equity\nSales\n25\n \n—\n \n25\n \n(68)\n— \n(68)\n409 \nMark-to-market\n169\n \n—\n \n169\n \n30 \n— \n30 \n(639)\nPrivate equity (less than 3 percent ownership)\nMark-to-market\n124\n \n—\n \n124\n \n70 \n— \n70 \n(31)\nTotal investment portfolio\n \n320\n \n(251)\n69\n \n(502)\n3,438 \n2,936 \n(1,353)\nOther derivative instruments\n(4)\n—\n \n(4)\n(10)\n— \n(10)\n(11)\nForeign exchange\n(223)\n(1,177)\n(1,400)\n(183)\n(13)\n(196)\n397 \nCurrent discount rate on future policy benefits\n—\n \n(701)\n(701)\n— \n84 \n84 \n— \nInstrument-specific credit risk on market risk benefits\n—\n \n7\n \n7\n \n— \n2 \n2 \n— \nOther \n(2)\n24\n \n257\n \n281\n \n88 \n167 \n255 \n(118)\nNet gains (losses), pre-tax\n$\n117\n \n$\n(1,865)\n$\n(1,748)\n$\n(607)\n$\n3,678 \n$\n3,071 \n$\n(1,085)\n(1)\n    2024 includes a net decrease of the valuation allowance of expected credit losses of $86 million on fixed maturities and impairments of $94 million on fixed maturities.\n(2)    \n2023 includes a one-time realized gain of $135 million as a result of the consolidation of Huatai Group.\nPre-tax net unrealized losses of $251 million in 2024 in our investment portfolio reflected the mark-to-market impact in the fixed income portfolio.\nPre-tax net realized gains of $117 million in 2024 mainly comprised mark-to-market gains on fixed maturities, public equities, and private equities, partially offset by net losses on sales of fixed maturities, and foreign exchange and derivative losses.\n \n65\nTable of Contents\nNon-GAAP Reconciliation\nIn presenting our results, we included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition. However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nWe provide financial measures, including net premiums written, net premiums earned, segment income, and underwriting income on a constant-dollar basis. We believe it is useful to evaluate the trends in our results exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in which our international business is transacted, as these exchange rates could fluctuate significantly between periods and distort the analysis of trends. The impact is determined by assuming constant foreign exchange rates between periods by translating prior period results using the same local currency exchange rates as the comparable current period.\nP&C performance metrics comprise consolidated operating results (including Corporate) and exclude the operating results of the Life Insurance segment. We believe that these measures are useful and meaningful to investors as they are used by management to assess the company’s P&C operations which are the most economically similar. We exclude the Life Insurance segment because the results of this business do not always correlate with the results of our P&C operations.\nP&C combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss expense ratio, policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio excluding the life business and including the realized gains and losses on the crop derivatives. These derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. We view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations.\nCAY P&C combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses (CATs) excludes CATs and prior period development (PPD) from the P&C combined ratio. We exclude CATs as they are not predictable as to timing and amount and PPD as these unexpected loss developments on historical reserves are not indicative of our current underwriting performance. The combined ratio numerator is adjusted to exclude CATs, PPD, and expense adjustments on PPD, and the denomi\nnator is adjusted to exclude net premiums earned adjustments on PPD and reinstatement premiums on CATs and PPD. In periods where there are adjustments on loss sensitive policies, these adjustments are excluded from PPD and net premiums earned when calculating the ratios. We believe this measure provides a better evaluation of our underwriting performance and enhances the understanding of the trends in our P&C business that may be obscured by these items. This measure is commonly reported among our peer companies and allows for a better comparison.\nReinstatement premiums are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences. The reinstatement premium amount is typically a pro rata portion of the original ceded premium paid based on how much of the reinsurance limit had been exhausted.\nNet premiums earned adjustments within PPD are adjustments to the initial premium earned on retrospectively rated policies based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends. The premium adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies and are fully earned in the period the adjustments are recorded.\nPrior period expense adjustments typically relate to adjustable commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends.

Excludes investment income from our private equities where we own more than 3 percent interest.\nNet investment income is influenced by a number of factors including the amounts and timing of inward and outward cash flows, the level of interest rates, and changes in overall asset allocation. Net investment income increased 20.1 percent in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to higher reinvestment rates on fixed maturities and the consolidation of Huatai Group. Refer to Note 1 f) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nFor private equities where we own less than three percent, investment income is included within Net investment income in the table above. For private equities where we own more than three percent, investment income is included within Other (income) expense in the Consolidated statements of operations. Excluded from Net investment income is the mark-to-market movement for private equities, which is recorded within either Other (income) expense or Net realized gains (losses) based on our percentage of ownership. The total mark-to-market movement for private equities excluded from Net investment income was as follows:\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal mark-to-market gain (loss) on private equity, pre-tax\n$\n661\n \n$\n504 \n$\n(250)\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $741 million, $672 million, and $570 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n Interest expense increased in 2024 primarily due to newly issued debt, including the $1.0 billion of 5.00 percent senior notes issued on March 7, 2024, the $700 million of 4.65 percent senior notes issued on July 31, 2024, and the $600 million of 5.00 percent senior notes issued on July 31, 2024, partially offset by the maturity of $700 million senior notes in May 2024. The increase in interest expense also reflects the impact of higher interest rates on held collateral and funds. Pre-tax interest expense is expected to total \n$779 million for \n2025, based on projected variable expenses and existing debt obligations as of \nDecember 31, 2024\n, at current foreign exchange rates.

The portfolio is primarily managed externally by independent, professional investment managers and is broadly diversified across geographies, sectors, and issuers. We hold no collateralized debt obligations in our investment portfolio, and we provide no credit default protection. We have long-standing global credit limits for our entire portfolio across the organization. Exposures are aggregated, monitored, and actively managed by our Global Credit Committee, comprising senior executives, including our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Risk Officer, our Chief Investment Officer, and our Treasurer. We also have well-established, strict contractual investment rules requiring managers to maintain highly diversified exposures to individual issuers and closely monitor investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines. \nThe average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of futures, options, and swaps, was 5.1 years and 4.8 years at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We estimate that a 100 basis point (bps) increase in interest rates would reduce the valuation of our fixed income portfolio by approximately $6.2 billion at December 31, 2024.

We apply the same investment selection process described previously to our Municipal investments. The portfolio is highly diversified primarily in state general obligation bonds and essential service revenue bonds including education and utilities (water, power, and sewers).\nNon-U.S.\nChubb’s local currency investment portfolios have strict contractual investment guidelines requiring managers to maintain a high quality and diversified portfolio to both sector and individual issuers. Investment portfolios are monitored daily to ensure investment manager compliance with portfolio guidelines.\nOur non-U.S. investment grade fixed income portfolios are currency-matched with the insurance liabilities of our non-U.S. operations. The average credit quality of our non-U.S. fixed income securities is A/A and 39 percent of our holdings are rated AAA or guaranteed by governments or quasi-government agencies. Within the context of these investment portfolios, our government and corporate bond holdings are highly diversified across industries and geographies. Issuer limits are based on credit rating (AA—two percent, A—one percent, BBB—0.5 percent of the total portfolio) and are monitored daily via an internal compliance system. We manage our indirect exposure using the same credit rating-based investment approach. Accordingly, we do not believe our indirect exposure is material.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value and amortized cost, net of valuation allowance, of our non-U.S. fixed income portfolio by country/sovereign for non-U.S. government securities at December 31, 2024:\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nFair Value\nAmortized Cost, Net\nPeople's Republic of China\n$\n1,899\n \n$\n1,832\n \nRepublic of Korea\n1,844\n \n1,717\n \nCanada\n843\n \n863\n \nTaiwan\n782\n \n781\n \nKingdom of Thailand\n718\n \n652\n \nUnited Mexican States\n628\n \n655\n \nCommonwealth of Australia\n547\n \n623\n \nProvince of Ontario\n519\n \n529\n \nFederative Republic of Brazil\n495\n \n518\n \nUnited Kingdom\n434\n \n467\n \nOther Non-U.S. Government Securities\n7,053\n \n7,127\n \nTotal\n$\n15,762\n \n$\n15,764\n \n74\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the fair value and amortized cost, net of valuation allowance, of our non-U.S. fixed income portfolio by country/sovereign for non-U.S. corporate securities at December 31, 2024:\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nFair Value\nAmortized Cost, Net\nChina\n$\n7,046\n \n$\n7,023\n \nUnited Kingdom\n2,477\n \n2,569\n \nCanada\n2,389\n \n2,423\n \nUnited States \n(1)\n1,782\n \n1,826\n \nSouth Korea\n1,532\n \n1,478\n \nFrance\n1,509\n \n1,533\n \nAustralia\n1,088\n \n1,132\n \nJapan\n757\n \n782\n \nGermany\n645\n \n668\n \nChile\n515\n \n544\n \nOther Non-U.S. Corporate Securities\n6,601\n \n6,811\n \nTotal\n$\n26,341\n \n$\n26,789\n \n(1)     \nThe countries that are listed in the non-U.S. corporate fixed income portfolio above represent the ultimate parent company's country of risk. Non-U.S. corporate securities could be issued by foreign subsidiaries of U.S. corporations.\nBelow-investment grade corporate fixed income portfolio\nBelow-investment grade securities have different characteristics than investment grade corporate debt securities. Risk of loss from default by the borrower is greater with below-investment grade securities. Below-investment grade securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer. Also, issuers of below-investment grade securities usually have higher levels of debt and are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions, such as recession or increasing interest rates, than investment grade issuers. At December 31, 2024, our corporate fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately 14 percent of our fixed income portfolio. Our below-investment grade and non-rated portfolio includes over 1,600 issuers, with the greatest single exposure being $178 million.\nWe manage high-yield bonds as a distinct and separate asset class from investment grade bonds. The allocation to high-yield bonds is explicitly set by internal management and is targeted to securities in the upper tier of credit quality (BB/B). Our minimum rating for initial purchase is BB/B. Fourteen external investment managers are responsible for high-yield security selection and portfolio construction. Our high-yield managers have a conservative approach to credit selection and very low historical default experience. Holdings are highly diversified across industries and generally subject to a 1.5 percent issuer limit as a percentage of high-yield allocation. We monitor position limits daily through an internal compliance system. Derivative and structured securities (e.g., credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations) are not permitted in the high-yield portfolio.\n75\nTable of Contents\nAsbestos and Environmental (A&E)\nAsbestos and environmental (A&E) reserving considerations\nFor asbestos, Chubb faces claims relating to policies issued to manufacturers, distributors, installers, and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos. Claimants will generally allege damages across an extended time period which may coincide with multiple policies covering a wide range of time periods for a single insured.\nEnvironmental claims present exposure for remediation and defense costs associated with the contamination of property or bodily injury as a result of pollution.\nThe following table presents count information for asbestos claims and environmental claims by account, for direct policies only:\nAsbestos \nEnvironmental\n2024\n2023 \n2024\n \n2023 \nOpen at beginning of year\n1,784\n \n1,795 \n1,109\n \n1,195 \nNewly reported/reopened\n252\n \n230 \n135\n \n116 \nClosed or otherwise disposed\n362\n \n241 \n192\n \n202 \nOpen at end of year\n1,674\n \n1,784 \n1,052\n \n1,109 \nSurvival ratios are calculated by dividing the asbestos or environmental loss and allocated loss adjustment expense (ALAE) reserves by the average asbestos or environmental loss and ALAE payments for the three most recent calendar years (3-year survival ratio).\nThe following table presents the gross and net 3-year survival ratios for Asbestos and Environmental loss and ALAE reserves:\n(in years)\nGross loss and ALAE reserves\nNet loss and\n ALAE reserves\nAsbestos\n4.1\n \n4.0\n \nEnvironmental\n3.7\n \n4.3\n \nThe survival ratios provide only a very rough depiction of reserves and are significantly impacted by a number of factors such as aggressive settlement practices, variations in gross to ceded relationships within the asbestos or environmental claims, and levels of coverage provided. Therefore, we urge caution in using these very simplistic ratios to gauge reserve adequacy.\n76\nTable of Contents\nCatastrophe Management\nWe activel\ny monitor and manage our catastrophe risk accumulation around the world from natural perils, which includes setting risk limits based on probable maximum loss (PML) and purchasing catastrophe reinsurance to ensure sufficient liquidity and capital to meet the expectations of regulators, rating agencies, and policyholders, and to provide shareholders with an appropriate risk-adjusted return. Chubb uses internal and external data together with sophisticated, analytical catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk, including diversification and correlation effects, across different product lines and territories. The table below presents our modeled pre-tax estimates of natural catastrophe PML, net of reinsurance, at December 31, 2024, and does not represent our expected catastrophe losses for any one year.\nModeled Net Probable Maximum Loss (PML) Pre-tax\nWorldwide \n(1)\nU.S. Hurricane \n(2)\nCalifornia Earthquake \n(3)\nAnnual Aggregate\nAnnual Aggregate\nSingle Occurrence\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\nChubb\n% of Total Chubb Shareholders’\nEquity\nChubb\n% of Total Chubb Shareholders’\nEquity\nChubb\n% of Total Chubb Shareholders’\nEquity\n1-in-10\n$\n2,882\n \n4.5\n \n%\n$\n1,644\n \n2.6\n \n%\n$\n169\n \n0.3\n \n%\n1-in-100\n$\n5,543\n \n8.7\n \n%\n$\n3,831\n \n6.0\n \n%\n$\n1,894\n \n3.0\n \n%\n1-in-250\n$\n8,697\n \n13.6\n \n%\n$\n6,207\n \n9.7\n \n%\n$\n2,173\n \n3.4\n \n%\n(1)\n     Worldwide aggregate includes modeled losses arising from tropical cyclones, convective storms, earthquakes, wildfires, and inland floods \na\nnd excludes\n \"non-modeled\" perils such as man-made and other catastrophe risks including pandemic.\n(2)\n     U.S. hurricane modeled losses include losses from wind, storm-surge, and related precipitation-induced flooding.\n(3)\n    California earthquake modeled losses include the fire-following sub-peril.\nThe PML for worldwide and key U.S. peril regions are based on our in-force portfolio at October 1, 2024, and reflect the September 1, 2024, reinsurance program as well as inuring reinsurance protection coverage. As of April 1, 2024, we increased retention in North America by $500 million and increased limits by $1.7 billion. On August 31, 2024, a $500 million catastrophe treaty covering named windstorms and earthquakes within Northeast States expired and was not renewed. Refer to the Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance section for more information. These estimates assume that reinsurance recoverable is fully collectible.\nAccording to the model, for the 1-in-100 return period scenario, there is a one percent chance that our pre-tax annual aggregate losses incurred in any year from U.S. hurricane events could be in excess of $3,831 million (or 6.0 percent of total Chubb shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2024). Effective March 31, 2024, our worldwide and U.S. Hurricane PMLs reflect the latest North Atlantic hurricane vulnerability model.\nThe above estimates of Chubb’s loss profile are inherently uncertain for many reasons, including the following:\n•\nWhile the use of third-party modeling packages to simulate potential catastrophe losses is prevalent within the insurance industry, the models are reliant upon significant meteorology, seismology, and engineering assumptions to estimate catastrophe losses. In particular, modeled catastrophe events are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential;\n•\nThere is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models, the running of the modeling software, and interpretation of loss output. These loss estimates do not represent our potential maximum exposures and it is highly likely that our actual incurred losses would vary materially from the modeled estimates;\n•\nThe potential effects of climate change add to modeling complexity; and\n•\nChanging climate conditions could impact our exposure to natural catastrophe risks. Published studies by leading government, academic, and professional organizations combined with extensive research by Chubb climate scientists reveal the potential for increases in the frequency and severity of key natural perils such as tropical cyclones, inland flood, and wildfire. To understand the potential impacts on the Chubb portfolio, we have conducted stress tests on our peak exposure zone, namely in the U.S., using parameters outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Climate Change 2021 report. These parameters consider the impacts of climate change and the resulting climate peril impacts over a timescale relevant to our business. The tests are conducted by adjusting our baseline view of risk for the perils of hurricane, inland flood, and wildfire in the U.S. to reflect increases in frequency and severity across the modeled domains for each of these perils. Based on these tests against the Chubb portfolio we do not expect material impacts to our baseline \n77\nTable of Contents\nPMLs from climate change through December 31, 2025. These tests reflect current exposures only and exclude potentially mitigating factors such as changes to building codes, public or private risk mitigation, regulation, and public policy.\nMan-made and other catastrophes\nWe have substantial exposure to losses resulting from man-made catastrophes including terrorism, cyber-attack, financial events, and other catastrophe events, including pandemics. These events are inherently unpredictable and could impact a variety of our businesses, including commercial and personal lines, life insurance, A&H, and reinsurance products. Our losses from these events could be substantial.\nTerrorism\nWe offer terrorism coverage in the U.S. and in many other countries through various insurance products. We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures through set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios, the purchase of reinsurance, and the reliance on government-sponsored terrorism reinsurance programs. In the U.S., certain protections of our terrorism exposure are provided through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2019 (TRIPRA). In 2024, TRIPRA covers 81 percent of insured losses above a deductible, estimated to be approximately $3.2 billion. Refer to “Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Program” for information on our reinsurance protection purchased. At our largest exposure location in the U.S., our maximum modeled losses from a 10-ton truck-bomb explosion are estimated to be $2.4 billion pre-tax based on the exposures, net of reinsurance and TRIPRA, as of December 31, 2024.\nCyber Insurance\nWhile frequency and severity trends are being managed through long-standing underwriting strategies, the potential catastrophe risk that aggregation of cyber exposures presents to insurers is unique and unprecedented. In contrast with natural catastrophe risks, catastrophic cyber event scenarios are not bound by time or geography. Further, catastrophic cyber perils do not have well-established definitions or fundamental physical properties. For these reasons, catastrophic cyber events have the inherent potential for significant economic loss. Although cyber risk does not represent a material component of our net premiums written and we engage in significant risk mitigation through our underwriting and use of reinsurance, we are exposed to material losses in the event of a systemic cyber-attack.\nFinancial Risk\nThe consequences of adverse global or regional market and economic conditions may affect our investment portfolio. Our investment portfolio is subject to credit or default risk and may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions. Our investments are subject to market risks and risks inherent in individual securities. Our investment performance is highly sensitive to many factors, including interest rates, inflation, monetary and fiscal policies, and domestic and international political conditions. The volatility of our losses may force us to liquidate securities, which may cause us to incur capital losses. Realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio would reduce our book value, and if significant, can affect our ability to conduct business.\nMoreover, we have substantial exposure to insurance products which are sensitive to certain system-wide financial conditions, such as our financial lines, surety, political risk, involuntary loss of employment (outside U.S.), and trade credit products. These products tend to be characterized by infrequent but potentially high severity losses. The majority of our exposure in these products may be impacted by an adverse economic climate such as an economic recession or depression. If the financial condition of these insureds were adversely affected by the economy or otherwise, we may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We monitor credit exposures to single counterparties and to sectors of interest from sources across our operations (e.g. investments, insurance products, reinsurance recoverable, bank deposits, letters of credit) and establish guidelines for credit risk exposure at the counterparty level. Our net income may be volatile because certain variable annuity reinsurance products sold expose us to fair value liability changes that are directly affected by market and other factors and assumptions.\nPandemic\nAn outbreak of pandemic disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. The vast majority of our property and liability coverages do not provide coverage for pandemic claims. However, we are subject to the potential of aggregation of loss from coverages provided in our life, A&H, and workers' compensation portfolios. We assess our direct pandemic exposure using stress scenarios that consider mortality, morbidity, and other causes of insured loss such as trip cancellation. Our assessment also incorporates the impact of a severe economic downturn which, as stated above under Financial Risk, includes an adverse impact to our investment portfolio and to our insurance products sensitive to certain system-wide financial conditions.\n78\nTable of Contents\nGlobal Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Program\nChubb’s core property catastrophe reinsurance program provides protection against natural catastrophes impacting its primary property operations (i.e., excluding our Global Reinsurance and Life Insurance segments).\nWe regularly review our reinsurance protection and corresponding property catastrophe exposures. This may or may not lead to the purchase of additional reinsurance prior to a program’s renewal date. In addition, prior to each renewal date, we consider how much, if any, coverage we intend to buy and we may make material changes to the current structure in light of various factors, including modeled PML assessment at various return periods, reinsurance pricing, our risk tolerance and exposures, and various other structuring considerations.\nChubb renewed its Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Program for our North American and International operations effective April 1, 2024, through March 31, 2025. The program consists of three layers in excess of losses retained by Chubb on a per occurrence basis. Chubb renewed its terrorism coverage (excluding nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation coverage, with an inclusion of coverage for biological and chemical coverage for personal lines) for the United States from April 1, 2024, through March 31, 2025, with the same limits and retention and percentage placed except that the majority of terrorism coverage is on an aggregate basis above our retentions without a reinstatement.\nLoss Location\nLayer of Loss\nComments\nNotes\nUnited States \n(excluding Alaska and Hawaii)\n$0 million \n–\n \n$1.75 billion\nLosses retained by Chubb\n(a)\nUnited States \n(excluding Alaska and Hawaii)\n$1.75 billion \n–\n$2.85 billion \nAll natural perils and terrorism \n(b)\nUnited States \n(excluding Alaska and Hawaii)\n$2.85 billion \n–\n$4.0 billion\nAll natural perils and terrorism \n(c)\nUnited States \n(excluding Alaska and Hawaii)\n$4.0 billion \n–\n$5.7 billion\nNamed windstorm and earthquake\nInternational \n(including Alaska and Hawaii)\n$0 million \n–\n$225 million\nLosses retained by Chubb\n(a)\nInternational \n(including Alaska and Hawaii)\n$225 million \n–\n$1.325 billion\nAll natural perils and terrorism \n(b)\nAlaska, Hawaii, and Canada\n$1.325 billion \n– \n$2.475 billion\nAll natural perils and terrorism\n(c)\n(a)     \nUltimate retention will depend upon the nature of the loss and the interplay between the underlying per risk programs and certain other catastrophe programs purchased by individual business units.

We participate in this market through our Bermuda based wholly-owned subsidiary Sovereign Risk Insurance Ltd. (Sovereign), and through a unit of our London-based CGM operation. Chubb is one of the world's leading underwriters of political risk and credit insurance, has a global portfolio spread across more than 150 countries and is also a member of The Berne Union. Our clients include financial institutions, national export credit agencies, leading multilateral agencies, private equity firms and multinational corporations. CGM writes political risk and credit insurance business out of underwriting offices in London, United Kingdom; Hamburg, Germany; Sao Paulo, Brazil; Singapore; Tokyo, Japan; and in the U.S. in the following locations: Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C.\nOur political risk insurance products provide protection to commercial lenders against defaults on cross border loans, cover investors against equity losses, and protect exporters against defaults on contracts. Commercial lenders, our largest client segment, are covered for missed scheduled loan repayments due to acts of confiscation, expropriation or nationalization by the host government, currency inconvertibility or exchange transfer restrictions, or war or other acts of political violence. In addition, in the case of loans to government-owned entities or loans that have a government guarantee, political risk policies cover \n79\nTable of Contents\nscheduled payments against risks of non-payment or non-honoring of government guarantees. Private equity investors and corporations cover their equity investments against financial losses, such as expropriatory events, inability to repatriate dividends, and physical damage to their operations caused by covered political risk events. Our export contracts product provides coverage for both exporters and their financing banks against the risk of contract frustration due to government actions, including non-payment by governmental entities.\nCGM's credit insurance businesses cover losses due to insolvency, protracted default, and political risk perils including export and license cancellation. Our credit insurance product provides coverage to larger companies that have sophisticated credit risk management systems, with exposure to multiple customers and that have the ability to self-insure losses up to a certain level through excess of loss coverage. It also provides coverage to trade finance banks, exporters, and trading companies, with exposure to trade-related financing instruments. CGM also has limited capacity for Specialist Credit insurance products which provide coverage for project finance and working capital loans for large corporations and banks.\nWe have implemented structural features in our policies in order to control potential losses within the political risk and credit insurance businesses. These include basic loss sharing features such as co-insurance and deductibles and, in the case of trade credit, the use of non-qualifying losses that drop smaller exposures deemed too difficult to assess. Ultimate loss severity is also limited by using waiting periods to enable the insurer and insured to mitigate losses and to agree on recovery strategies if a claim does materialize. We have the option to pay claims over the original loan repayment schedule, rather than in a lump sum, in order to provide insureds and the insurer additional time to remedy problems and work towards full recoveries. It is important to note that political risk and credit policies are named peril conditional insurance contracts, not financial guarantees, and claims are only paid after conditions and warranties are fulfilled. Political risk and credit insurance policies do not cover currency devaluations, bond defaults, movements in overseas equity markets, transactions deemed illegal, situations where corruption or misrepresentation has occurred, or debt that is not legally enforceable. In addition to assessing and mitigating potential exposure on a policy-by-policy basis, we also have specific risk management measures in place to manage overall exposure and risk. These measures include placing country, credit, and individual transaction limits based on country risk and credit ratings, combined single loss limits on multi-country policies, the use of quota share and excess of loss reinsurance protection as well as quarterly modeling and stress-testing of the portfolio. We have a dedicated Country and Credit Risk management team that is responsible for the portfolio.\nCrop Insurance\nWe are, and have been since the 1980s, one of the leading writers of crop insurance in the U.S. and have conducted that business through a managing general agent subsidiary of Rain and Hail. We provide protection throughout the U.S. on a variety of crops and are therefore geographically diversified, which reduces the risk of exposure to a single event or a heavy accumulation of losses in\n any one region. Given its concentration of risk exposed to temperature, moisture, drought, hail, and the more frequent and severe storms associated with climate change, crop insurance is a business with catastrophe-like features. Our crop insurance business comprises two components - Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (\nMPCI) and crop-hail insurance.\nThe MPCI program, offered in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Risk Management Agency (RMA), is a federal subsidized insurance program that covers revenue shortfalls or production losses due to natural causes such as drought, excessive moisture, hail, wind, freeze, insects, and disease. These revenue products are defined as providing both commodity price and yield coverages. Policies are available for various crops in different areas of the U.S. and generally have deductibles ranging from 10 percent to 50 percent of the insured's risk. The USDA's Risk Management Agency (RMA) sets the policy terms and conditions, rates and forms, and is also responsible for setting compliance standards. As a participant in the MPCI program, we report all details of policies to the RMA and are party to a Standard Reinsurance Agreement (SRA). The SRA sets out the relationship between private insurance companies and the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation (FCIC) concerning the terms and conditions regarding the risks each will bear including the pro-rata and state stop-loss provisions, which allows companies to limit the exposure of any one state or group of states on their underwriting results. In addition to the pro-rata and excess of loss reinsurance protections inherent in the SRA, we purchase third-party proportional and stop-loss reinsurance for our MPCI business to reduce our exposure. We may also enter into crop derivative contracts to further manage our risk exposure.\nEach year the RMA issues a final SRA for the subsequent reinsurance year (i.e., the 2025 SRA covers the 2025 reinsurance year from July 1, 2024, through June 30, 2025). There were no significant changes in the terms and conditions from the 2024 SRA and, therefore, the new SRA does not impact Chubb's outlook on the crop program relative to 2025.\n80\nTable of Contents\nWe recognize net premiums written as soon as estimable on our MPCI business, which is generally when we receive acreage reports from the policyholders on the various crops throughout the U.S. This allows us to best determine the premium associated with the liability that is being planted. The MPCI program has specific timeframes as to when producers must report acreage to us, and in certain cases the reporting occurs after the close of the respective reinsurance year. Once the net premium written has been recorded, the premium is then earned over the growing season for the crops. A majority of the crops that are covered in the program are typically subject to the SRA in effect at the beginning of the year. Given the major crops covered in the program, we typically see a substantial written and earned premium impact in the second and third quarters.\nThe pricing of MPCI premium is determined using a number of factors including commodity prices and related volatility (i.e., both impact the amount of premium we can charge to the policyholder). For example, in most states, the pricing for the MPCI revenue product for corn (i.e., insurance coverage for lower than expected crop revenue in a given season) includes a factor based on the average commodity price in February. If corn commodity prices are higher in February, compared to the February price in the prior year, and all other factors are the same, the increase in price will increase the corn premium year-over-year. Pricing is also impacted by volatility factors, which measure the likelihood commodity prices will fluctuate over the crop year. For example, if volatility is set at a higher rate compared to the prior year, and all other factors are the same, the premium charged to the policyholder will be higher year-over-year for the same level of coverage.  \nLosses incurred on the MPCI business are determined using both commodity price and crop yield. With respect to commodity price, there are two important periods on a large portion of the business: the month of February when the initial premium base is set, and the month of October when the final harvest price is set. If the price declines from February to October, with yield remaining at normal levels, the policyholder may be eligible to recover on the policy. However, in most cases there are deductibles on these policies, therefore, the impact of a decline in price would have to exceed the deductible before a policyholder would be eligible to recover. \nWe evaluate our MPCI business at an aggregate level and the combination of all of our insured crops (both winter and summer) go into our underwriting gain or loss estimate in any given year. Typically, we do not have enough information on the harvest prices or crop yield outputs to quantify the preliminary estimated impact to our underwriting results until the fourth quarter. \nOur crop-hail program is a private offering. Premium is earned on the crop-hail program over the coverage period of the policy. Given the very short nature of the growing season, most crop-hail business is typically written in the second and third quarters and the recognition of earned premium is also more heavily concentrated during this timeframe. We use industry data to develop our own rates and forms for the coverage offered. The policy primarily protects farmers against yield reduction caused by hail and/or fire, and related costs such as transit to storage. We offer various deductibles to allow the grower to partially self-insure for a reduced premium cost. We limit our crop-hail exposures through the use of township liability limits and third-party reinsurance on our net retained hail business.\n \nLiquidity\nLiquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate cash flows sufficient to meet short-term and long-term cash requirements. As a holding company, Chubb Limited possesses assets that consist primarily of the stock of its subsidiaries and other investments. In addition to net investment income, Chubb Limited's cash flows depend primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments. Historically, dividends and other statutorily permitted payments have come primarily from Chubb's Bermuda-based operating subsidiaries, which we refer to as our Bermuda subsidiaries. During 2024, in accordance with a plan of liquidation and conversion of Chubb INA Holdings Inc. (Chubb INA) to a limited liability company, Chubb Limited received $2.0 billion for the redemption of a portion of its ownership interest in Chubb INA. Chubb INA is expected to fully redeem, by the end of 2027, Chubb Limited's 20 percent ownership interest in Chubb INA. Our consolidated sources of funds consist primarily of net premiums written, fees, net investment income, and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. Funds are used at our various companies primarily to pay claims, operating expenses, and dividends; to service debt; to purchase investments; and to fund acquisitions.\nWe anticipate that positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) should be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios for the near term. Should the need arise, we generally have access to capital markets and available credit facilities.\n \nRefer to “Credit Facilities” below for additional information. Our access to funds under the existing credit facility is dependent on the ability of the bank that is a party to the facility to meet its funding commitments. Should our existing credit provider experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. If we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our \n81\nTable of Contents\nbusiness, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facility or establishing additional facilities when needed\n.\nTo further ensure the sufficiency of funds to settle unforeseen claims, we hold certain invested assets in cash and short-term investments. In addition, for certain insurance, reinsurance, or deposit contracts that tend to have relatively large and reasonably predictable cash outflows, we attempt to establish dedicated portfolios of assets that are duration-matched with the related liabilities. With respect to the duration of our overall investment portfolio, we manage asset durations to both maximize return given current market conditions and provide sufficient liquidity to cover future loss payments. At December 31, 2024, the average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of futures, options, and swaps, is 5.1 years, while the average expected duration of our insurance liabilities is 6.9 years.\nDespite our safeguards, if paid losses accelerate beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, we might need to either liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing. Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could include several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time, large uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses (as a result of coverage disputes, reinsurers' credit problems, or decreases in the value of collateral supporting reinsurance recoverables) or increases in collateral postings under our variable annuity reinsurance business. Because each subsidiary focuses on a more limited number of specific product lines than is collectively available from the Chubb Group of Companies, the mix of business tends to be less diverse at the subsidiary level. As a result, the probability of a liquidity strain, as described above, may be greater for individual subsidiaries than when liquidity is assessed on a consolidated basis. If such a liquidity strain were to occur in a subsidiary, we could be required to liquidate a portion of our investments, potentially at distressed prices, as well as be required to contribute capital to the particular subsidiary and/or curtail dividends from the subsidiary to support holding company operations.\nThe payment of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction, as well as the need to maintain capital levels adequate to support the insurance and reinsurance operations, including financial strength ratings issued by independent rating agencies. During 2024, we were able to meet all our obligations, including the payments of dividends on our Common Shares, with our net cash flows.\nWe assess which subsidiaries to draw dividends from based on a number of factors. Considerations such as regulatory and legal restrictions as well as the subsidiary's financial condition are paramount to the dividend decision. Chubb Limited received dividends of $1.7 billion and $3.3 billion from its Bermuda subsidiaries in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Chubb Limited received cash dividends of $3 million and $28 million and non-cash dividends of $142 million and $291 million from Swiss subsidiaries in 2024 and 2023, respectively. Chubb Limited also received dividends of $91 million from its other international subsidiary in 2024.\nThe U.S. insurance subsidiaries of Chubb INA may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, subject to restrictions set out in state law of the subsidiary's domicile (or, if applicable, commercial domicile). Chubb INA's international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate. These laws and regulations sometimes include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends payable without prior approval of regulatory insurance authorities. Chubb Limited received no dividends from Chubb INA in 2024 and 2023. Debt issued by Chubb INA is serviced by statutorily permissible distributions by Chubb INA's insurance subsidiaries to Chubb INA as well as other group resources. Chubb INA received cash dividends of $3.5 billion and $2.4 billion and non-cash dividends of $997 million and $170 million from its subsidiaries in 2024 and 2023, respectively. In addition, Chubb INA recognized dividends of $27 million in 2024 from an international subsidiary. At December 31, 2024, the amount of dividends available to be paid to Chubb INA in 2025 from its subsidiaries without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities totals $3.8 billion.\nCash Flows\nOur insurance and reinsurance operations provide liquidity in that premiums are received in advance, sometimes substantially in advance, of the time claims are paid. Generally, cash flows are affected by claim payments that, due to the nature of our operations, may comprise large loss payments on a limited number of claims and which can fluctuate significantly from period to period. The irregular timing of these loss payments can create significant variations in cash flows from operations between periods. For additional information regarding estimates of future claim payments over the next twelve months, refer to our discussion of Cash Requirements within \"Capital Resources\". Sources of liquidity include cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements. The following is a discussion of our cash flows for 2024 and 2023.\n82\nTable of Contents\nOperating cash flows reflect Net income for each period, adjusted for non-cash items and changes in working capital. Operating cash flows were $16.2 billion in 2024, compared to $12.6 billion in 2023. The increase of $3.6 billion is primarily due to higher net investment income and net premiums collected. The increase was partially offset by higher net losses paid, income taxes paid, and lower net proceeds from sales of consolidated investment products (CIP) from Huatai's asset management companies.\nCash used for investing was $13.9 billion in 2024, compared to $7.6 billion in 2023. The increase of $6.3 billion is primarily due to higher net purchases of fixed maturities, short-term investments, and equity securities of $6.5 billion and an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $504 million, reflecting the acquisition of Healthy Paws and additional equity purchases of Huatai Group. These amounts were partially offset by an increase in private equity distributions (net of contributions), of $1.2 billion.\nCash used for financing was $2.2 billion in 2024, compared to $4.5 billion in 2023. The decrease of $2.3 billion is primarily from higher proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt (net of repayments) of $1.4 billion, lower common shares repurchased of $610 million, and lower net CIP-related distributions to third-parties of $612 million. These CIPs are related to Huatai's asset management companies. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on share repurchases.\nBoth internal and external forces influence our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Claim settlements, premium levels, and investment returns may be impacted by changing rates of inflation and other economic conditions. In many cases, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may lapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the reporting of the loss to us, and the settlement of the liability for that loss.\nWe use repurchase agreements as a low-cost funding alternative. At December 31, 2024, there were $2.7 billion, including variable interest entities balances of $815 million, in repurchase agreements outstanding with various maturities over the next five months.\nIn addition to cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements, we have agreements with a third-party bank provider which implemented two international multi-currency notional cash pooling programs to enhance cash management efficiency during periods of short-term timing mismatches between expected inflows and outflows of cash by currency. The programs allow us to optimize investment income by avoiding portfolio disruption. In each program, participating Chubb entities establish deposit accounts in different currencies with the bank provider. Each day the credit or debit balances in every account are notionally translated into a single currency (U.S. dollars) and then notionally pooled. The bank extends overdraft credit to all participating Chubb entities as needed, provided that the overall notionally pooled balance of all accounts in each pool at the end of each day is at least zero. Chubb entities may incur overdraft balances as a means to address short-term liquidity needs. Any overdraft balances incurred under this program by a Chubb entity would be guaranteed by Chubb Limited (up to $300 million in the aggregate). Our syndicated letter of credit facility allows for same day drawings to fund a net pool overdraft should participating Chubb entities withdraw contributed funds from the pool.\n83\nTable of Contents\nCapital Resources\nCapital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations.\n(in millions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nShort-term debt\n$\n800\n \n$\n1,460 \nLong-term debt\n14,379\n \n13,035 \nTotal financial debt\n15,179\n \n14,495 \nTrust preferred securities\n309\n \n308 \nSubordinated debt \n(1)\n110\n \n— \nTotal hybrid debt\n419\n \n308 \nTotal Chubb shareholders’ equity\n64,021\n \n59,507 \nTotal capitalization\n$\n79,619\n \n$\n74,310\n \nRatio of financial debt to total capitalization\n (2)\n19.1\n \n%\n19.5 \n%\nRatio of financial debt and hybrid debt to total capitalization\n (2)\n19.6\n \n%\n19.9 \n%\n(1)    \nCapital Supplementary Bonds issued by Huatai Life.\n(2)    \nFor purposes of calculating leverage ratios, Huatai debt is based on Chubb's share (excluding noncontrolling interest).\nThe ratios of financial debt to total capitalization in the table above are lower at December 31, 2024, compared to December 31, 2023, from the increase in shareholders' equity, principally reflecting strong net income.\nIn March 2024, Chubb INA issued $1.0 billion of 5.00 percent senior notes due March 2034. Chubb INA's $700 million of 3.35 percent senior notes due May 2024 was paid upon maturity. In July 2024, Chubb INA issued $700 million of 4.65 percent senior notes due August 2029 and $600 million of 5.00 percent senior notes due March 2034. In November 2024, Huatai Life issued 800 million Chinese yuan renminbi ($111 million based on the foreign exchange rate at the date of issuance) of 2.90 percent senior notes due November 2034. These notes are classified as regulatory capital for local statutory purposes. Chubb INA's €700 million of 0.3 percent Euro denominated senior notes due December 2024 was paid upon maturity. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details about debt issued and debt redeemed.\nRepurchase agreements are excluded from the table above and are disclosed separately from short-term debt in the Consolidated balance sheets. The repurchase agreements are collateralized borrowings where we maintain the right and ability to redeem the collateral on short notice, unlike short-term debt which comprises the current maturities of our long-term debt instruments.\nWe believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain available funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis. Our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and our perceived financial strength. We have accessed both the debt and equity markets from time to time. We generally maintain the ability to issue certain classes of debt and equity securities via an unlimited Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shelf registration which is renewed every three years. This allows us capital market access for refinancing as well as for unforeseen or opportunistic capital needs. We also have a shelf registration statement which allows us to issue an unlimited amount of certain classes of debt and equity from time to time. This shelf registration statement expires in October 2027.\nSecurities Repurchases\nFrom time to time, we repurchase shares as part of our capital management program. On July 19, 2021, the Board of Directors (Board) authorized a one-time incremental share repurchase program of up to $5.0 billion of Chubb Common Shares effective through June 30, 2022. In May 2022, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of Chubb Common Shares effective through June 30, 2023. In June 2023, the Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of Chubb's Common Shares effective July 1, 2023, with no expiration date.\n84\nTable of Contents\nShare repurchases may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated repurchases and/or through option or other forward transactions. In 2024, 2023, and 2022 we repurchased $2.0 billion, $2.5 billion, and $3.0 billion, respectively, of Common Shares in a series of open market transactions under the Board share repurchase authorizations at an average per share price of $269.23, $209.52, and $201.96, respectively. For the period January 1, 2025, through February 26, 2025, we repurchased 543,782 Common Shares for a total of $148 million in a series of open market transactions under the share repurchase program authorization. At February 26, 2025, $1.5 billion in share repurchase authorization remained.\nCommon Shares\nOur Common Shares had a par value of CHF 0.50 each at December 31, 2024.\nAs of December 31, 2024, there were 18,922,323 Common Shares in treasury with a weighted-average cost of $186.22 per share.\nUnder Swiss law, dividends must be stated in Swiss francs though dividend payments are made by Chubb in U.S. dollars.\nAt our May 2024 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $3.64 per share, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of $0.91 per share after the annual general meeting by way of distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. The Board will determine the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid until the date of the 2025 annual general meeting, and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at its discretion. The first three quarterly installments each of $0.91 per share, have been distributed by the Board as expected.\nAt our May 2023 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $3.44 per share, which was paid in four quarterly installments of $0.86 per share at dates determined by the Board after the annual general meeting by way of distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment.\nDividend distributions on Common Shares amounted to CHF 3.15 ($3.59) per share for the year ended December 31, 2024. Refer to Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our dividends.\nCash Requirements\nOur cash requirements within the next twelve months include claims payable to claimants and other routine obligations typical to our business, as well as commitments related to our limited partnerships. We expect the cash required to meet these obligations to be primarily generated through a combination of cash on hand, cash from operations, routine sales of investments, and financing arrangements. We believe these sources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months, while maintaining sufficient liquidity for normal operating purposes. We believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain available funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis, if necessary. At \nDecember 31, 2024\n, our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n•\nGross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts \n- We are obligated to pay claims under insurance and reinsurance contracts for specified covered loss events. Total cash requirements are not determinable from underlying contracts and must be estimated. Gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are estimated at $84.1 billion with $23.8 billion estimated due over the next twelve months. These estimated gross loss payments are inherently uncertain and the amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material. Given the numerous factors and assumptions involved in both estimates of loss reserves and related estimates as to the timing of future loss payments, differences between actual and estimated loss payments will not necessarily indicate a commensurate change in ultimate loss estimates. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nEstimated payments for future policy benefits and market risk benefits\n - Total estimated payments for future policy benefits and market risk benefits are estimated at $77.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, with $3.0 billion and $0.2 billion estimated due over the next twelve months, respectively. The total estimated payments are gross of fees or premiums due, while the liabilities presented on our Consolidated balance sheets are discounted and net of fees and premiums due. The timing and amount of actual payments may vary from the estimates. Refer to Note 1 \nl)\n and Note 9 for additional information on future policy benefits, and Note 1 \nm) and Note 11\n \nfor additional information on market risk benefits\n.\n85\nTable of Contents\n•\nShort-term, Long-term, and Hybrid debt, and related interest payments - \nTotal obligations for short-term, long-term, and hybrid debt maturities are $15.4 billion with $0.8 billion due over the next twelve months. Interest payments related to these obligations total $6.6 billion with $0.5 billion due over the next twelve months. These estimates are based on current exchange rates. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nCommitments on invested assets\n - Total obligations for commitments related to our invested assets are $7.7 billion with $2.2 billion due over the next twelve months. Refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nDeposit liabilities\n - Total obligations for deposit liabilities, including contract holder deposit funds, are $14.5 billion with $0.8 billion due over the next twelve months. Refer to Note 1 \no)\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nRepurchase agreements -\n We use repurchase agreements as a low-cost funding alternative. At \nDecember 31, 2024\n, there were $2.7 billion in repurchase agreements outstanding with various maturities over the next five months. Refer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n•\nOperating leases\n - Total obligations for operating leases are $1.4 billion with $0.2 billion estimated due over the next twelve months. Refer to Note 14 \nj)\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional informat\nion. As of December 31, 2024, we have a lease commitment for office space that is not yet recorded on our Consolidated balance sheet and is not included in the total obligations referenced above. The lease is expected to commence in 2025 with an initial term of approximately 23 years. Total cash requirements are estimated at approximately $400 million over the term of the lease.\nRatings\nChubb Limited and its subsidiaries are assigned credit and financial strength (insurance) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies, including S&P, AM Best, Moody's, and Fitch. The ratings issued on our companies by these agencies are announced publicly and are available directly from the agencies. Our Internet site (investors.chubb.com, under Financials/Financial Strength Ratings) also contains some information about our ratings, but such information on our website is not incorporated by reference into this report.\nFinancial strength ratings reflect the rating agencies' opinions of a company's claims paying ability. Independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets. The rating agencies consider many factors in determining the financial strength rating of an insurance company, including the relative level of statutory surplus necessary to support the business operations of the company. These ratings are based upon factors relevant to policyholders, agents, and intermediaries and are not directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold securities.\nCredit ratings assess a company's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest on its debt. It is possible that, in the future, one or more of the rating agencies may reduce our existing ratings. If one or more of our ratings were downgraded, we could incur higher borrowing costs, and our ability to access the capital markets could be impacted. In addition, our insurance and reinsurance operations could be adversely impacted by a downgrade in our financial strength ratings, including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets. Also, we have insurance and reinsurance contracts which contain rating triggers. In the event the S&P or AM Best financial strength ratings of Chubb fall, we may be faced with the cancellation of premium or be required to post collateral on our underlying obligation associated with this premium.\n86\nTable of Contents\nInformation provided in connection with outstanding debt of subsidiaries\nChubb INA Holdings LLC (Subsidiary Issuer)\n is an indirect 100 percent-owned and consolidated subsidiary of Chubb Limited (Parent Guarantor).

LOCs may also be used for general corporate purposes.\nShould the need arise, we generally have access to capital markets and to credit facilities. Our group syndicated credit facility has capacity of $3.0 billion and expires in October 2027. Our total letter of credit capacity is $4.1 billion, $3.0 billion of which can be used for revolving credit. At December 31, 2024, our usage under these facilities was $978 million in LOCs. Our access to credit under these facilities is dependent on the ability of the bank counterparties\n to meet their funding commitments. Should the existing credit providers on these facilities experience financial difficulty, we may be required to replace credit sources, possibly in a difficult market. If we cannot obtain adequate capital or sources of credit on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be adversely affected. To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facilities or establishing additional facilities when needed.\nIn the event we are required to provide alternative security to clients, the security could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by our investment portfolio or funds withheld using our cash resources. The value of LOCs required is driven by, among other things, statutory liabilities reported by variable annuity guarantee reinsurance clients, loss development of existing reserves, the payment pattern of such reserves, the expansion of business, and loss experience of such business.\nThe facilities noted above require that we maintain certain financial covenants, all of which have been met at December 31, 2024. These covenants are shown below including our actual values at \nDecember 31, 2024\n:\n(i)\na minimum consolidated net worth required by the group syndicated and other credit facilities, excluding noncontrolling interest, of not less than $41.959 billion and a minimum consolidated net worth required by one remaining credit facility, excluding noncontrolling interest, of not less than $52.819 billion (Actual is $72.7 billion); and\n(ii)\na ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization of not greater than 0.35 to 1 (Actual is 0.19 to 1)\n1\n.\n1.\nAs calculated under the covenant, the ratio excludes the fair value adjustment of debt acquired through the Chubb Corp acquisition and noncontrolling interest. \nOur failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would, subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants, result in an event of default. This could require us to repay any outstanding borrowings or to cash collateralize LOCs under such facility. Our failure to repay material financial obligations, as well as our failure with respect to certain other events expressly identified, would result in an event of default under the facility.\n \nITEM 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nMarket Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management\nMarket risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We are exposed to potential losses from various market risks including changes in interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates. Further, through writing guaranteed living benefits (GLB) and guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB) products, collectively referred to as market risk benefits (MRB), we are exposed to volatility in the equity and credit markets, as well as interest rates. Our investment portfolio consists primarily of fixed income securities, denominated in both U.S. dollars and foreign currencies, which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The majority of our fixed income portfolio is classified as available-for-sale. The effect of market movements on our fixed maturities available-for-sale portfolio impacts Net income (through Net realized gains (losses)) when securities are sold, when we write down an asset, or when we record a \nchange to the allowance for expected credit losses.\n Changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates will have an immediate effect on Shareholders' equity and Comprehensive income and, in certain instances, Net income. The effect of market movements on fixed maturities related to consolidated investment products in the Huatai portfolio (Fixed maturities - CIP) impacts Net income (through Net realized gains (losses)). From time to time, we also use derivative instruments such as futures, options, swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts to manage the duration of our investment portfolio and foreign currency exposures, and also to obtain exposure to a particular financial market. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our notional exposure to derivative instruments was $10.2 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively. These instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements and are sensitive to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity security prices. As part of our investing activities, from time to time we purchase to be announced \n88\nTable of Contents\nmortgage-backed securities (TBAs). Changes in the fair value of TBAs are included in Net realized gains (losses) and, therefore, have an immediate effect on both our Net income and Shareholders' equity.\nWe seek to mitigate market risk using a number of techniques, including maintaining and managing the assets and liabilities of our international operations consistent with the foreign currencies of the underlying insurance and reinsurance businesses, thereby limiting exchange rate risk to net assets denominated in foreign currencies. From time to time, we use derivatives to hedge planned cross-border transactions, and designate certain derivatives to hedge foreign currency risk on our euro denominated debt and exposure in the net investments of certain foreign subsidiaries.\nThe following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures at December 31, 2024. Our policies to address these risks in 2024 were not materially different from 2023. We do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods.\nInterest rate risk – fixed income portfolio and debt obligations\nOur fixed income portfolio and debt obligations have exposure to interest rate risk. Changes in investment values attributable to interest rate changes are mitigated by corresponding and partially offsetting changes in the economic value of our insurance reserves and debt obligations. We monitor this exposure through periodic reviews of our asset and liability positions.\nThe following table presents the impact at December 31, 2024 and 2023, on the fair value of our fixed income portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 bps applied instantly across the U.S. yield curve (an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario):\n(in billions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\n2024\n \n2023 \nFair value of fixed income portfolio\n$\n121.8\n \n$\n114.9 \nPre-tax impact of 100 bps increase in interest rates:\nDecrease in dollars\n$\n6.2\n \n$\n5.5 \nAs a percentage of total fixed income portfolio at fair value\n5.1\n \n%\n4.8 \n%\nChanges in interest rates will have an immediate effect on Comprehensive income and Shareholders' equity for our available-for- sale portfolio but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on Net income. Variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of prepayments due to available prepayment options. For these reasons, actual results could differ from those reflected in the tables. Changes in interest rates for our fixed income – consolidated investment products will have an immediate impact on Net income (through Net realized gains (losses)).\nAlthough our debt and hybrid debt (collectively referred to as debt obligations) are reported at amortized cost and not adjusted for fair value changes, changes in interest rates could have a material impact on their fair value, albeit there would be no impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe following table presents the impact at December 31, 2024 and 2023, on the fair value of our debt obligations of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 bps applied instantly across the U.S. yield curve (an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario):\n(in billions of U.S. dollars, except for percentages)\n2024\n \n2023 \nFair value of debt obligations, including repurchase agreements\n$\n17.0\n \n$\n16.6 \nPre-tax impact of 100 bps decrease in interest rates:\nIncrease in dollars\n$\n1.1\n \n$\n1.1 \nAs a percentage of total debt obligations at fair value\n6.2\n \n%\n6.6 \n%\n89\nTable of Contents\nForeign currency management\nAs a global company\n, Chubb entities transact business in multiple currencies.

These cross-currency swaps are agreements under which two counterparties exchange principal and interest payments in different currencies at a future date.\nThe objective of the fair value cross-currency swaps is to hedge euro 1.5 billion of the foreign currency risk on our euro denominated debt by converting cash flows back into the U.S dollar. The objective of the net investment cross-currency swaps is to hedge the foreign currency exposure in the net investments of certain foreign subsidiaries by converting cash flows from U.S. dollar to the British pound sterling (GBP 957 million), Japanese yen (JPY 43.0 billion), Swiss franc (CHF 96 million), and Chinese yuan renminbi (CNY 9.3 billion). The hedged risk is designated as the foreign currency exposure arising between the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary and the functional currency of its parent entity. For additional information refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n90\nTable of Contents\nReinsurance of market risk benefits\nMarket risk benefits (MRB) are measured at fair value using a valuation model based on current net exposures, market data, our experience, and other factors. Changes in fair value are recorded to Market risk benefits gains (losses) in the Consolidated statements of operations, except for the change in fair value due to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk which is recognized in Other comprehensive income. For additional information refer to Note 1 m) and Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.\nChubb views its MRB reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance, with the probability of long-term economic loss relatively small at the time of pricing. Adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both MRB gains (losses) and net income. When evaluating these risks, we expect to be compensated for taking both the risk of a cumulative long-term economic net loss, as well as the short-term accounting variations caused by these market movements. Therefore, we evaluate this business in terms of its long-term economic risk and reward.\nThe tables below are estimates of the sensitivities to instantaneous changes in economic inputs (e.g., equity shock, interest rate shock, etc.) at December 31, 2024, for both the fair value of the MRB liability (FVL) and the fair value of specific derivative instruments held (hedge value) to partially offset the risk in the MRB reinsurance portfolio. The following assumptions should be considered when using the below tables:\n•\nEquity shocks impact all global equity markets equally \n•\nOur liabilities are sensitive to global equity markets in the following proportions: 80 percent—90 percent U.S. equity, and 10 percent—20 percent international equity.\n•\nOur current hedge portfolio is sensitive only to U.S. equity markets.\n•\nWe would suggest using the S&P 500 index as a proxy for U.S. equity, and the MSCI EAFE index as a proxy for international equity.\n•\nInterest rate shocks assume a parallel shift in the U.S. yield curve\n•\nOur liabilities are also sensitive to global interest rates at various points on the yield curve, mainly the U.S. Treasury curve in the following proportions: up to 15 percent short-term rates (maturing in less than 5 years), 15 percent—30 percent medium-term rates (maturing between 5 years and 10 years, inclusive), and 65 percent—80 percent long-term rates (maturing beyond 10 years).\n•\nA change in AA-rated credit spreads impacts the rate used to discount cash flows in the fair value model. AA-rated credit spreads are a proxy for both our own credit spreads and the credit spreads of the ceding insurers.\n•\nThe hedge sensitivity is from December 31, 2024, market levels and only applicable to the equity and interest rate sensitivities table below.\n•\nThe sensitivities do not scale linearly and may be proportionally greater for larger movements in the market factors. Actual sensitivity of our net income may differ from those disclosed in the tables below due to fluctuations in short-term market movements.\n91\nTable of Contents\nSensitivities to equity and interest rate movements\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nWorldwide Equity Shock\nInterest Rate Shock\n+10 \n%\nFlat\n-10 \n%\n-20 \n%\n-30 \n%\n-40 \n%\n+100 bps\n(Increase)/decrease in FVL\n$\n244 \n$\n164 \n$\n64 \n$\n(61)\n$\n(218)\n$\n(427)\nIncrease/(decrease) in hedge value\n(101)\n— \n101 \n202 \n304 \n405 \nIncrease/(decrease) in net income\n$\n143 \n$\n164 \n$\n165 \n$\n141 \n$\n86 \n$\n(22)\nFlat\n(Increase)/decrease in FVL\n$\n99 \n$\n— \n$\n(120)\n$\n(266)\n$\n(452)\n$\n(690)\nIncrease/(decrease) in hedge value\n(101)\n— \n101 \n202 \n304 \n405 \nIncrease/(decrease) in net income\n$\n(2)\n$\n— \n$\n(19)\n$\n(64)\n$\n(148)\n$\n(285)\n-100 bps\n(Increase)/decrease in FVL\n$\n(84)\n$\n(202)\n$\n(342)\n$\n(511)\n$\n(728)\n$\n(992)\nIncrease/(decrease) in hedge value\n(101)\n— \n101 \n202 \n304 \n405 \nIncrease/(decrease) in net income\n$\n(185)\n$\n(202)\n$\n(241)\n$\n(309)\n$\n(424)\n$\n(587)\nSensitivities to Other Economic Variables\nAA-rated Credit Spreads\n Interest Rate Volatility\n Equity Volatility\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n+100 bps\n-100 bps\n+2 \n%\n-2 \n%\n+2 \n%\n-2 \n%\n(Increase)/decrease in FVL\n$\n42 \n$\n(47)\n$\n(1)\n$\n1 \n$\n(15)\n$\n14 \nIncrease/(decrease) in net income\n$\n42 \n$\n(47)\n$\n(1)\n$\n1 \n$\n(15)\n$\n14 \nMarket Risk Benefits Net Amount at Risk\nAll our MRB reinsurance treaties include annual or aggregate claim limits and many include an aggregate deductible which limit the net amount at risk under these programs.

Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure\nNone.\nITEM 9A.  Controls and Procedures\nChubb’s management, with the participation of Chubb’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of Chubb’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as of December 31, 2024. Based upon that evaluation, Chubb’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Chubb’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in allowing information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to be recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Chubb’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThere have been no changes in Chubb's internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2024,\n that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Chubb's internal controls over financial reporting. Chubb's management report on internal control over financial reporting is included on page F-3 and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's audit report is included on pages F-4 and F-5.\nITEM 9B.  Other Information\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2024, no director or officer of Chubb (as defined in Rule 16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) informed us of the \nadoption\n or \ntermination\n of a \"Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement\" or \"non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement,\" as those terms are defined in Item 408 of SEC Regulation S-K.\nOn February 27, 2025, the Board of Directors (Board) amended Section 2.2.1(d) of the Organizational Regulations of Chubb Limited. The amendment reflects that the Board’s Compensation Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board the aggregate amount of director compensation to be submitted for shareholder vote at Chubb’s annual general meeting of shareholders. This role had previously been the responsibility of the Board’s Nominating & Governance Committee.

CCAP Excess Benefit Plan (CCAP Excess Benefit Plan) and the Chubb Corp. Deferred Compensation Plan for Directors, under which no Common Shares are available for future issuance other than with respect to outstanding rewards. The CCAP Excess Benefit Plan is a nonqualified, defined contribution plan and covers those participants in the Capital Accumulation Plan of The Chubb Corporation (CCAP) (Chubb Corp.’s legacy 401(k) plan) and Chubb Corp.’s legacy employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) whose total benefits under those plans are limited by certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. A participant in the CCAP Excess Benefit Plan is entitled to a benefit equaling the difference between the participant’s benefits under the CCAP and the ESOP, without considering the applicable limitations of the Code, and the participant’s actual benefits under such plans. A participant’s excess ESOP benefit is expressed as Common Shares. Payments under the CCAP Excess Benefit Plan are generally made: (i) for excess benefits related to the CCAP, in cash annually as soon as practical after the amount of excess benefit can be determined; and (ii) for excess benefits related to the ESOP, in Common Shares as soon as practicable after the participant’s termination of employment. Allocations under the ESOP ceased in 2004. Accordingly, other than dividends, no new contributions are made to the ESOP or the CCAP Excess Benefit Plan with respect to excess ESOP benefits.\n(3)  \nWeighted-average exercise price excludes shares issuable under performance unit awards and restricted stock unit awards.\nAdditional information is incorporated by reference to the section entitled \"Information About Our Share Ownership\" of the definitive proxy statement for the 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders which will be filed with the SEC not later than 120 days after the close of the fiscal year pursuant to Regulation 14A.\nITEM 13.

The statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and, as such, include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management. Financial information elsewhere in this annual report is consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Board of Directors (Board), operating through its Audit Committee, which is composed entirely of directors who are not officers or employees of Chubb, provides oversight of the financial reporting process and safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition. The Audit Committee annually recommends the appointment of an independent registered public accounting firm and submits its recommendation to the Board for approval.\nThe Audit Committee meets with management, the independent registered public accountants and the internal auditor; approves the overall scope of audit work and related fee arrangements; and reviews audit reports and findings. In addition, the independent registered public accountants and the internal auditor meet separately with the Audit Committee, without management representatives present, to discuss the results of their audits; the adequacy of Chubb's internal control; the quality of its financial reporting; and the safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which has been given access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of the Board and committees of the Board. Chubb believes that all representations made to our independent registered public accountants during their audits were valid and appropriate.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Chubb is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nAs of December 31, 2024, management has evaluated the effectiveness of Chubb's internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria for effective-internal control over financial reporting established in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework,” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in 2013. Based on this e\nvalua\ntion, management has concluded that Chubb's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audite\nd the consolidated financial statements of Chubb included in this Annual Report, has issued a report on the effectiveness of Chubb's internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The report, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of Chubb's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, is included in this Item under “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm” and follows this statement.\n/s/ Evan G. Greenberg\n/s/ Peter C. Enns\nEvan G. Greenberg\nPeter C. Enns\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\n                                            \nF-3\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Chubb Limited\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Chubb Limited and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, of shareholders' equity and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, including the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nF-4\nTable of Contents\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses, Net of Reinsurance\nAs described in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2024, the Company’s liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses, net of reinsurance, was $66.3 billion. The majority of the Company’s net unpaid losses and loss expenses arise from the Company’s long-tail casualty business (such as general liability and professional liability), U.S. sourced workers’ compensation, asbestos-related, environmental pollution and other exposures with high estimation uncertainty. The process of establishing loss and loss expense reserves requires the use of estimates and judgments based on circumstances underlying the insured loss at the date of accrual. The judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses include the use and interpretation of various standard actuarial reserving methods that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data, and other benchmarks as appropriate. The reserves for the various product lines each require different qualitative and quantitative assumptions and judgments, including changes in business mix or volume, changes in ceded reinsurance structures, changes in claims handling practices, reported and projected loss trends, inflation, the legal environment, and the terms and conditions of the contracts sold to the Company’s insured parties.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of unpaid losses and loss expenses, net of reinsurance, from the long-tail and other exposures as described above, is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management in determining the reserve liability, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment in performing procedures relating to the valuation; (ii) the significant audit effort and judgment in evaluating the audit evidence relating to the actuarial reserving methods and assumptions related to extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data, other benchmarks, and the impact of qualitative and quantitative subjective assumptions and judgments; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the Company’s valuation of unpaid losses and loss expenses, net of reinsurance, including controls over the selection of actuarial reserving methods and development of significant assumptions. These procedures also included, among others, the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing one or a combination of procedures, including (i) independently estimating reserves on a sample basis using actual historical data and loss development patterns, as well as industry data and other benchmarks, to develop an independent estimate and comparing the independent estimate to management’s actuarially determined reserves and (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of management’s actuarial reserving methods and the reasonableness of the aforementioned assumptions, as well as assessing qualitative adjustments to carried reserves and the consistency of management’s approach period-over-period. Performing these procedures involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania\nFebruary 27, 2025\nWe have

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS \nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\n1. \nSummary of significant accounting policies\na) \nBasis of presentation\nChubb Limited is a holding company incorporated in Zurich, Switzerland. Chubb Limited, through its subsidiaries, provides a broad range of insurance and reinsurance products to insureds worldwide. Our results are reported through the following business segments: North America Commercial P&C Insurance, North America Personal P&C Insurance, North America Agricultural Insurance, Overseas General Insurance, Global Reinsurance, and Life Insurance. Refer to Note 19 for additional information.\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, which include the accounts of Chubb Limited and its subsidiaries (collectively, Chubb, we, us, or our), over which Chubb exercises control, including Huatai Group, our majority-owned subsidiary, and minority-owned entities such as variable interest entities (VIEs) in which Chubb is considered the primary beneficiary. Noncontrolling interests on the Consolidated Financial Statements represent the portion of majority-owned subsidiaries and VIEs in which we do not have direct equity ownership. These Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results and financial position for such periods. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions, including internal reinsurance transactions, have been eliminated.\nOn July 1, 2023, Chubb discontinued equity method accounting for its investment in Huatai Group upon obtaining a controlling interest and applied consolidation accounting. Therefore, effective July 1, 2023, business activity for, and the financial position of, Huatai Group is reported at 100 percent on the Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, our aggregate ownership interest in Huatai Group was approximately \n85.5\n percent and \n76.5\n percent, respectively. The relevant amounts attributable to shareholders other than Chubb are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements under the captions Noncontrolling interests, Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests, and Comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests. Refer to Note 2 for additional information on the acquisition of Huatai Group.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Amounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect our best estimates and assumptions; actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates. Chubb's principal estimates include:\n•\nunpaid loss and loss expense reserves, including long-tail asbestos and environmental (A&E) reserves and non-A&E casualty exposures;\n•\nfuture policy benefits reserves;\n•\nthe valuation of value of business acquired (VOBA);\n•\nthe assessment of risk transfer for certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts;\n•\nreinsurance recoverable, including a valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance;\n•\nthe valuation of the investment portfolio and assessment of valuation allowance for expected credit losses;\n•\nthe valuation of deferred income taxes;\n•\nthe valuation and amortization of purchased intangibles; and\n•\nthe assessment of goodwill for impairment.\nb) \nPremiums\nPremiums are generally recorded as written upon inception of the policy. For multi-year policies for which premiums written are payable in annual installments, only the current annual premium is included as written at policy inception due to the ability of the insured/reinsured to commute or cancel coverage within the policy term. The remaining annual premiums are recorded as written at each successive anniversary date within the multi-year term.\nF-10\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nFor property and casualty (P&C) insurance and reinsurance products, premiums written are primarily earned on a pro-rata basis over the policy terms to which they relate. Unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired portion of the policies in force. For retrospectively-rated policies, written premiums are adjusted to reflect expected ultimate premiums consistent with changes to incurred losses, or other measures of exposure as stated in the policy, and earned over the policy coverage period.\nMandatory reinstatement premiums assessed on reinsurance policies are earned in the period of the loss event that gave rise to the reinstatement premiums. All remaining unearned premiums are recognized over the remaining coverage period.\nPremiums from long-duration contracts such as certain traditional term life, whole life, endowment, and long-duration personal accident and health (A&H) policies are generally recognized as revenue when due from policyholders. Traditional life policies include those contracts with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits. Benefits and expenses are recognized in relation to insurance in force resulting in the recognition of profit over the life of the contracts.\nRetroactive loss portfolio transfer (LPT) contracts in which the insured loss events occurred prior to contract inception are evaluated to determine whether they meet criteria for reinsurance accounting. If reinsurance accounting is appropriate, written premiums are fully earned and corresponding losses and loss expenses recognized at contract inception. These contracts can cause significant variances in gross premiums written, net premiums written, net premiums earned, and net incurred losses in the years in which they are written. Reinsurance contracts sold not meeting the criteria for reinsurance accounting are recorded using the deposit method.\nReinsurance premiums assumed are based on information provided by ceding companies supplemented by our own estimates of premium when we have not received ceding company reports. Estimates are reviewed and adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are determined. Premiums are earned over the coverage terms of the related reinsurance contracts and range from \none year\n to \nthree years\n.\nc) \nDeferred policy acquisition costs (DAC)\nDeferred policy acquisition costs consist of commissions (direct and ceded), premium taxes, and certain underwriting costs related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts. Amortization is recorded in Policy acquisition costs in the Consolidated statements of operations.\nShort-duration contracts\nPolicy acquisition costs are amortized ratably over the period the related premiums are earned. Policy acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they are recoverable from future income including investment income. Unrecoverable policy acquisition costs are expensed in the period identified.\nLong-duration contracts\nPolicy acquisition costs are grouped by contract type and issue year into cohorts consistent with the groupings used in estimating the associated liability and are expensed on a constant level basis over the expected term of the related contracts to approximate straight-line amortization at the contract level. The constant level basis used for amortization is the insurance in-force and is projected using the same assumptions used in estimating the liability for future policy benefits. If those projected assumptions change in future periods, they will be reflected in the cohort level amortization basis at that time. Unexpected changes in the in-force portfolio, due to variances in mortality and lapse experience, are recognized over the contract term. Changes in future mortality and lapse assumptions are also recognized prospectively over the remaining expected contract term.\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred except for direct-response campaigns that qualify for cost deferral. Qualified expenses include individual direct-response marketing campaigns where we can demonstrate the campaigns have specifically resulted in incremental sales to customers and such sales have probable future economic benefits. Any costs directly related to the marketing campaigns are deferred, included with other policy acquisition costs, and expensed as a component of Policy acquisition costs using the same amortization basis.\nd)\n \nValue of business acquired (VOBA)\nAs part of business combination accounting, a VOBA intangible asset is established upon the acquisition of blocks of long-duration contracts. This intangible represents the present value of estimated net cash flows for the in-force contracts as of the acquisition date. VOBA is amortized as a component of Policy acquisition costs in the Consolidated statements of operations in relation to the profit emergence of the underlying acquired contracts. The valuation of VOBA is based on many factors including \nF-11\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nmortality, morbidity, persistency, investment yields, expenses, and discount rate. The VOBA intangible is tested for recoverability at least annually using a premium deficiency test. Unrecoverable VOBA is expensed in the period identified.\ne)\n \nReinsurance\nChubb assumes and cedes reinsurance with other insurance companies to provide greater diversification of business and minimize the net loss potential arising from large risks. Ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve Chubb of its primary obligation to policyholders.\nFor both ceded and assumed reinsurance, risk transfer requirements must be met in order to account for a contract as reinsurance, principally resulting in the recognition of cash flows under the contract as premiums and losses. To meet risk transfer requirements, a reinsurance contract must include insurance risk, consisting of both underwriting and timing risk, and a reasonable possibility of a significant loss for the assuming entity. To assess risk transfer for certain contracts, Chubb generally develops expected discounted cash flow analyses at contract inception. Deposit accounting is used for contracts that do not meet risk transfer requirements.\nReinsurance recoverable includes balances due from reinsurance companies for paid and unpaid losses and loss expenses and future policy benefits that will be recovered from reinsurers, based on contracts in force. The method for determining the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses incurred but not reported (IBNR) involves actuarial estimates consistent with those used to establish the associated liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses as well as a determination of Chubb's ability to cede unpaid losses and loss expenses under the terms of the reinsurance agreement.\nReinsurance recoverable is presented net of a valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance determined based upon a review of the financial condition of reinsurers and other factors. The valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based on an estimate of the reinsurance recoverable balance that will ultimately be unrecoverable due to reinsurer insolvency, a contractual dispute, or any other reason. The valuation of this allowance includes several judgments including certain aspects of the allocation of reinsurance recoverable on IBNR claims by reinsurer and a default analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance. The primary components of the default analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer, net of collateral, and default factors used to determine the portion of a reinsurer's balance deemed uncollectible. The definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in a Chubb-only beneficiary trust, letters of credit, and liabilities held with the same legal entity for which Chubb believes there is a contractual right of offset. The determination of the default factor is principally based on the financial strength rating of the reinsurer. Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current financial strength rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions. Changes in the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables are recorded in Losses and loss expenses in the Consolidated statements of operations. The more significant considerations to calculate the valuation allowance include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following:\n•\nFor reinsurers that maintain a financial strength rating from a major rating agency, and for which recoverable balances are considered representative of the larger population (i.e., default probabilities are consistent with similarly rated reinsurers and payment durations conform to averages), the financial rating is based on a published source and the default factor is based on published default statistics of a major rating agency applicable to the reinsurer's particular rating class. When a recoverable is expected to be paid in a brief period of time by a highly rated reinsurer, such as certain property catastrophe claims, a default factor may not be applied;\n•\nFor balances recoverable from reinsurers that are both unrated by a major rating agency and for which management is unable to determine a credible rating equivalent based on a parent, affiliate, or peer company, we determine a rating equivalent based on an analysis of the reinsurer that considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity, industry benchmarks, or other factors as considered appropriate. We then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class. For balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which the ceded reserve is below a certain threshold, we generally apply a default factor of \n11.2\n percent, consistent with published statistics of a major rating agency;\n•\nFor balances recoverable from reinsurers that are either insolvent or under regulatory supervision, we establish a default factor and resulting valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance based on reinsurer-specific facts and circumstances. Upon initial notification of an insolvency, we generally recognize an expense for a substantial portion of all balances outstanding, net of collateral, through a combination of write-offs of recoverable balances and increases to the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance. When regulatory action is taken on a reinsurer, we generally recognize a default factor by estimating an expected recovery on all balances outstanding, net of collateral. When sufficient credible information becomes available, we adjust the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance by establishing a default factor pursuant to information received; and\nF-12\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\n•\nFor other recoverables, management determines the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance based on the specific facts and circumstances.\nThe methods used to determine the reinsurance recoverable balance and related valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are regularly reviewed and updated, and any resulting adjustments are reflected in earnings in the period identified.\nThe methods used to determine the valuation allowance for uncollectible high deductible recoverable amounts and valuation allowance for insurance and reinsurance balances receivable are similar to the processes used to determine the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable. For information on high deductible policies, refer to section k) Unpaid losses and loss expenses, below.\nPrepaid reinsurance premiums represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired coverage terms of the reinsurance contracts in-force.\nf) \nInvestments\nFixed maturities, equity securities, and short-term investments\nFixed maturities are primarily classified as available-for-sale (AFS) and are reported at fair value, net of a valuation allowance for credit losses, with changes in fair value recorded as a separate component of AOCI in Shareholders' equity. \nEquity securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Net realized gains (losses) on the Consolidated statements of operations.\nShort-term investments comprise securities due to mature within one year of the date of purchase and are recorded at fair value which typically approximates cost.\nInterest, dividend income, and amortization of fixed maturity market premiums and discounts, related to these securities are recorded in Net investment income, net of investment management and custody fees, in the Consolidated statements of operations. Realized gains or losses on sales of investments are determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\nFor mortgage-backed securities and any other holdings for which there is a prepayment risk, prepayment assumptions are evaluated and revised, as necessary. Any adjustments required due to the resultant change in effective yields and maturities are recognized prospectively. Prepayment fees or call premiums that are only payable when a security is called prior to its maturity are earned when received and reflected in Net investment income.\nValuation allowance for fixed income securities\nManagement evaluates expected credit losses (ECL) for AFS securities when fair value is below amortized cost. AFS securities are evaluated for potential credit loss on an individual security level, but the evaluation may use assumptions consistent with expectations of credit losses for a group of similar securities. If management has the intent to sell or will be required to sell the security before recovery, the entire impairment loss will be recorded through income to Net realized gains and losses. If management does not have the intent to sell or will not be required to sell the security before recovery, an allowance for credit losses is established and is recorded through income to Net realized gains and losses, and the non-credit loss portion is recorded through other comprehensive income.\nExamples of criteria that are collectively evaluated to determine if a credit loss has occurred include the following:\n•\nThe extent to which the fair value is less than amortized cost;\n•\nAdverse conditions related to the security, industry, or geographic area;\n•\nDowngrades in the security's credit rating by a rating agency; and\n•\nFailure of the issuer to make scheduled principal or interest payments.\nAFS securities that meet any one of the criteria included above will be subject to a discounted cash flow analysis by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis. Projected cash flows are driven primarily by assumptions regarding probability of default and the timing and amount of recoveries associated with defaults. Chubb developed the projected cash flows using market data, issuer-specific information, and credit ratings. In combination with contractual cash flows and the use of historical default and recovery data by Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) rating category, we generate expected cash flows using the average cumulative issuer-weighted global default rates by letter rating.\nF-13\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nIf the present value of expected future cash flows is less than the amortized cost, a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses will be recognized. If the present value of expected future cash flows is equal to or greater than the amortized cost basis, management will conclude an expected credit loss does not exist.\nManagement reviews credit losses and the valuation allowance for expected credit losses each quarter. When all or a portion of a fixed maturity security is identified to be uncollectible and written off, the valuation allowance for expected credit losses is reduced. In general, a security is considered uncollectible no later than when all efforts to collect contractual cash flows have been exhausted. Below are considerations for when a security may be deemed uncollectible:\n•\nWe have sufficient information to determine that the issuer of the security is insolvent;\n•\nWe receive notice that the issuer of the security has filed for bankruptcy, and the collectability is expected to be adversely impacted by the bankruptcy;\n•\nThe issuer of a security has violated multiple debt covenants;\n•\nAmounts have been past due for a specified period of time with no response from the issuer;\n•\nA significant deterioration in the value of the collateral has occurred; and\n•\nWe have received correspondence from the issuer of the security indicating that it does not intend to pay the contractual principal and interest.\nPrior to the transfer of our entire held-to-maturity (HTM) portfolio to the AFS portfolio in 2023, HTM securities were evaluated for potential credit loss on a collective pool basis quarterly. Chubb pooled HTM securities and calculated the current expected credit loss for each pool using Moody's corporate bond default average, corporate bond recovery rate, and an economic cycle multiplier based on the leading economic index adjusted for a forward-looking economic outlook.\nWe elected to not measure an allowance for accrued investment income as uncollectible balances are written off in a timely manner, typically \n30\n to \n45\n days after uncollected balances are due.\nPrivate debt held-for-investment\nPrivate debt held-for-investment relates principally to investments in the funding of public and private projects that are mostly infrastructure related and were acquired as part of Huatai’s investment portfolio upon consolidation. They have stated interest rates and maturity dates with fixed or determinable payments. Private debt held-for-investment are carried at amortized cost, net of a valuation allowance for credit losses. Management evaluates current expected credit losses (CECL) for all Private debt held-for-investment each quarter on a collective pool basis using S&P's corporate bond default average, corporate bond recovery rate, and an economic cycle multiplier. Interest income is recorded when earned within Net investment income on the Consolidated statements of operations.\nPrivate equities\nPrivate equities principally consist of Investment funds, limited partnerships, and partially owned investment companies.\nInvestment funds and limited partnerships\nInvestment funds, limited partnerships, and all other investments over which Chubb cannot exercise significant influence, generally, when we own less than three percent of the investee's shares, are accounted for as follows:\n•\nIncome and expenses from these funds are reported within Net investment income.\n•\nThese funds are carried at net asset value, which approximates fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Net realized gains (losses) on the Consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion on net asset value.\n•\nAs a result of the timing of the receipt of valuation data from the investment managers, these investments are generally reported on a three-month lag.\n•\nSales of these investments are reported within Net realized gains (losses).\nF-14\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nPartially-owned investment companies\nPartially-owned investment companies are limited partnerships where our ownership interest is in excess of three percent and are accounted for under the equity method because Chubb exerts significant influence. These investments apply investment company accounting to determine operating results, and Chubb retains the investment company accounting in applying the equity method. \n•\nThis means that investment income, realized gains or losses, and unrealized gains or losses are included in the portion of equity earnings reflected in Other (income) expense.\n•\nAs a result of the timing of the receipt of valuation data from the investment managers, these investments are generally reported on a three-month lag.\n \nOther investments\n•\nHuatai’s asset management businesses create investment entities known as consolidated investment products which include mutual funds with primary holdings in fixed maturities. These securities are reported at fair value with changes in fair value reported through the Consolidated statements of operations within Net realized gains (losses) as required under investment company accounting standards.\n•\nFixed maturities supporting certain participating policy liabilities principally relate to the Huatai investment portfolio. These investments are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through Net realized gains (losses) on the Consolidated statements of operations. We have elected to account for these investments using the fair value option so that changes in fair value of the fixed maturities are recorded in Net realized gains (losses), as opposed to a component within AOCI, to offset corresponding changes in policyholder liabilities within Policy benefits.\n•\nPolicy loans are carried at outstanding balance and interest income is reflected in Net investment income.\n•\nLife insurance policies are carried at policy cash surrender value and income is reflected in Other (income) expense.\n•\nNon-qualified separate account assets are supported by assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under U.S. GAAP and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on non-qualified separate account assets are reflected in Other (income) expense.\nInvestments in partially-owned insurance companies\nInvestments in partially-owned insurance companies primarily represent direct investments in which Chubb has significant influence and as such, meet the requirements for equity method accounting. Generally, we own twenty percent or more of the investee’s shares. We report our share of the net income or loss of the partially-owned insurance companies in Other (income) expense.\nSecurities lending program\nChubb participates in a securities lending program operated by a third-party banking institution whereby certain assets are loaned to qualified borrowers and from which we earn an incremental return which is recorded within Net investment income in the Consolidated statements of operations.\nBorrowers provide collateral, in the form of either cash or approved securities, at a minimum of \n102\n percent of the fair value of the loaned securities. Each security loan is deemed to be an overnight transaction. Cash collateral is invested in a collateral pool which is managed by the banking institution. The collateral pool is subject to written investment guidelines with key objectives which include the safeguard of principal and adequate liquidity to meet anticipated redemptions. The fair value of the loaned securities is monitored on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as the fair value of the loaned securities changes. The fair value of the securities on loan is included in Fixed maturities available-for-sale and Equity securities in the Consolidated balance sheets. The collateral is held by the third-party banking institution, and the collateral can only be accessed in the event that the institution borrowing the securities is in default under the lending agreement. As a result of these restrictions, we consider our securities lending activities to be non-cash investing and financing activities. An indemnification agreement with the lending agent protects us in the event a borrower becomes insolvent or fails to return any of the securities on loan. The securities lending collateral is reported as a separate line in the Consolidated balance sheets with a related liability reflecting our obligation to return the collateral plus interest.\nF-15\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nRepurchase agreements\nSimilar to securities lending arrangements, securities sold under repurchase agreements, whereby Chubb sells securities and repurchases them at a future date for a predetermined price, are accounted for as collateralized investments and borrowings and are recorded at the contractual repurchase amounts plus accrued interest. Assets to be repurchased are the same or substantially the same as the assets transferred, and the transferor, through right of substitution, maintains the right and ability to redeem the collateral on short notice. The fair value of the underlying securities is included in fixed maturities. In contrast to securities lending programs, the use of cash received is not restricted. We report the obligation to return the cash as Repurchase agreements in the Consolidated balance sheets and record the fees under these repurchase agreements within Interest expense on the Consolidated statements of operations.\nRefer to Note 4 for a discussion on the determination of fair value for Chubb's various investment securities.\ng) \nConsolidation of Variable interest entities (VIEs)\nChubb consolidates entities in which it has a controlling interest or is a primary beneficiary of a VIE. Huatai's asset management businesses create investment entities known as consolidated investment products which include mutual funds with primary holdings in fixed maturities. While many investors may not be related parties, Huatai invests in these funds at various ownership percentages. We consolidate the VIEs if we are the primary beneficiary, which is generally when we hold an economic interest of 10 percent or more. The consolidation of VIEs requires us to record 100 percent of both the underlying assets and liabilities of the mutual funds within the Consolidated balance sheets as well as the profit and losses within the Consolidated statements of operations. The relevant amounts attributable to investors other than Chubb are reflected as Noncontrolling interests. Purchases and sales of investments by the consolidated VIEs are reported as operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Where Huatai's ownership in these consolidated investment products is less than 10 percent, we generally would not expect to be the primary beneficiary of these VIEs and would not consolidate. Our economic risk with respect to each investment in a consolidated investment product is limited to our equity ownership and any uncollected management and performance fees. Refer to Note 3 h) for additional information.\nh)\n \nDerivative instruments\nDerivative instruments are carried at fair value in the Consolidated balance sheets in either Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities or Other assets. We participate in these derivative instruments primarily to mitigate financial risks and manage certain investment portfolio risks and exposures, including assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. We use derivative instruments including futures, options, swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts. Refer to Note 14 for additional information.\nChanges in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are included in Net realized gains (losses) and changes in fair value of futures contracts on equities related to our variable annuity reinsurance business are included in Market risk benefits gains (losses) in the Consolidated statements of operations.\nWe also invest in certain derivative instruments that are designated as hedging instruments and qualify for hedge accounting. These derivatives designated as hedging instruments must be highly effective in mitigating the designated changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. We assess at the hedge's inception, and continue to qualitatively assess on a quarterly basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items. Derivatives designated as hedging instruments include cross-currency swaps designated as fair value hedges for foreign currency exposure associated with portions of our euro denominated debt and net investment hedges for foreign currency exposure in the net investments of certain foreign subsidiaries. Refer to Note 14 for additional information.\nChanges in fair value of net investment hedges are recorded in Cumulative translation adjustments (CTA) within OCI. Changes in fair value of fair value hedges that principally offset the foreign currency remeasurement on the hedged debt is recorded within Net realized gains (losses) on the Consolidated st\natement of operations with the remaining change in fair value recorded in Other, within OCI.\ni) \nCash\nWe have agreements with a third-party bank provider which implemented two international multi-currency notional cash pooling programs. In each program, participating Chubb entities establish deposit accounts in different currencies with the bank provider and each day the credit or debit balances in every account are notionally translated into a single currency (U.S. dollars) and then notionally pooled. The bank extends overdraft credit to any participating Chubb entity as needed, provided that the overall notionally-pooled balance of all accounts in each pool at the end of each day is at least zero. Any overdraft balances incurred under this program by a Chubb entity would be guaranteed by Chubb Limited (up to $\n300\n million in the aggregate). \nF-16\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nOur syndicated letter of credit facility allows for same day drawings to fund a net pool overdraft should participating Chubb entities overdraw contributed funds from the pool.\nRestricted cash\nIncluded in Cash is restricted cash of $\n261\n million and $\n172\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Restricted cash represents amounts held for the benefit of third parties and is legally or contractually restricted as to withdrawal or usage. Amounts include deposits with U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities, trust funds set up for the benefit of ceding companies, and amounts pledged as collateral to meet financing arrangements.\nj) \nGoodwill and Other intangible assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisitions over the fair value of net assets acquired and is not amortized. Goodwill is assigned at acquisition to the applicable reporting unit of the acquired entities giving rise to the goodwill. Goodwill impairment tests are performed annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment. For goodwill impairment testing, we use a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not (i.e., more than a \n50\n percent probability) that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount. If our assessment indicates it is more likely than not that carrying value exceeds fair value, we quantitatively estimate a reporting unit's fair value.\nIndefinite lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives, generally with an average original useful life of \n25\n years. Intangible assets are regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment. Impairment is recognized if the carrying amount is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value.\nk) \nUnpaid losses and loss expenses\nA liability is established for the estimated unpaid losses and loss expenses under the terms of Chubb's policies and agreements. Similar to premiums that are recognized as revenues over the coverage period of the policy, a liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses is recognized as expense when insured events occur over the coverage period of the policy. This liability includes a provision for both reported claims (case reserves) and incurred but not reported claims (IBNR reserves). IBNR reserve estimates are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all losses that have occurred (expected losses), and then subtracting paid losses, case reserves, and loss expenses. The methods of determining such estimates and establishing the resulting liability are reviewed regularly and any adjustments are reflected in income in the period in which they become known. Future developments may result in losses and loss expenses materially greater or less than recorded amounts.\nExcept for net unpaid loss and loss expense reserves for certain structured settlements for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable and certain reserves for unsettled claims, Chubb does not discount its P&C loss reserves. The net undiscounted reserves related to structured settlements and certain reserves for unsettled claims are immaterial.\nIncluded in Unpaid losses and loss expenses are liabilities for A&E claims and expenses. These unpaid losses and loss expenses are principally related to claims arising from remediation costs associated with hazardous waste sites and bodily-injury claims related to asbestos products and environmental hazards. The estimation of these liabilities is particularly sensitive to changes in the legal environment including specific settlements that may be used as precedents to settle future claims. However, Chubb does not anticipate future changes in laws and regulations in setting its A&E reserve levels.\nAlso included in Unpaid losses and loss expenses is the fair value adjustment of $\n60\n million and $\n62\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, principally related to Chubb Corp’s historical unpaid losses and loss expenses. The estimated fair value consists of the present value of the expected net unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense payments adjusted for an estimated risk margin. The estimated cash flows are discounted at a risk-free rate. The estimated risk margin varies based on the inherent risks associated with each type of reserve. The fair value is amortized through Amortization of purchased intangibles on the Consolidated statements of operations based on the estimated payout patterns of unpaid loss and loss expenses at the acquisition date.\nOur loss reserves are presented net of contractual deductible recoverable amounts due from policyholders. Under the terms of certain high deductible policies which we offer, such as workers’ compensation and general liability, our customers are responsible to reimburse us for an agreed-upon dollar amount per claim. In nearly all cases we are required under such policies to pay covered claims first, and then seek reimbursement for amounts within the applicable deductible from our customers. We generally seek to mitigate this risk through collateral agreements.\nF-17\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nPrior period development arises from changes to loss estimates recognized in the current year that relate to loss reserves first reported in previous calendar years and excludes the effect of losses from the development of earned premiums from previous accident years.\nFor purposes of analysis and disclosure, management views prior period development to be changes in the nominal value of loss estimates from period to period, net of premium and profit commission adjustments on loss sensitive contracts. Prior period development generally excludes changes in loss estimates that do not arise from the emergence of claims, such as those related to uncollectible reinsurance, interest, unallocated loss adjustment expenses, or foreign currency. Accordingly, specific items excluded from prior period development include the following: gains/losses related to foreign currency remeasurement; losses recognized from the early termination or commutation of reinsurance agreements that principally relate to the time value of money; changes in the value of reinsurance business assumed reflected in losses incurred but principally related to the time value of money; and losses that arise from changes in estimates of earned premiums from prior accident years. Except for foreign currency remeasurement, which is included in Net realized gains (losses), these items are included in current year losses within Losses and loss expenses on the Consolidated statements of operations.\nl) \nFuture policy benefits\nFor traditional and limited-payment contracts, contracts are grouped into cohorts by coverage type and issue year to determine a liability for future policy benefits. The future policy benefit liability (FPBL) is the present value of estimated future policy benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and certain related expenses less the present value of estimated future net premiums to be collected from policyholders and is accrued as premium revenue is recognized. The valuation of this liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding expenses, mortality, and persistency. Estimates are primarily based on historical experience. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nThe liability is adjusted for differences between actual and expected experience. With the exception of the expense assumption, we review our future cash flow assumptions at least annually to determine if the net premium ratio (NPR), the mechanism to record the liability as premium is earned, should be changed at that time. We have elected to use expense assumptions that are locked in at contract inception and are not subsequently reviewed or updated. Each quarter, we update the cash flows expected over the entire life of each cohort for actual historical experience and projected future cash flows. These updated cash flows are used to calculate the revised NPR, which is used to derive an updated FPBL as of the beginning of the current reporting period, discounted at the original contract issuance discount rate. This amount is then compared to the carrying amount of the liability as of that same date, but before the updating of cash flow assumptions, to determine the current period change in FPBL. This current period change in the liability is the remeasurement gain or loss and is recorded in Policy benefits in the Consolidated statements of operations. In subsequent periods, the revised NPR is used to record the FPBL until future revisions become required.\nFor traditional and limited-payment contracts, the discount rate assumption is based on an upper-medium grade fixed-income instrument yield. An equivalent rate is derived based on A-credit-rated fixed-income instruments with similar duration to the liability. The discount rate assumption is updated quarterly and used to remeasure the liability at each reporting date, with the resulting change reflected in Other comprehensive income. For liability cash flows that are projected beyond the duration of market-observable A-credit-rated fixed-income instruments, we use the last market-observable yield level, as the basis for a linear interpolation to determine yield assumptions for durations that do not have market-observable yields.\nDeferred profit liability\nFor limited-payment products, gross premiums received in excess of net premiums are deferred at initial recognition as a deferred profit liability (DPL) and recorded as a component of Future policy benefits in the Consolidated balance sheets. Net premiums are measured using actual cash flows and future cash flow assumptions consistent with those used in the measurement of the liability for future policy benefits and remeasured quarterly. The DPL is amortized in proportion to the discounted in-force policies. Interest is accreted on the balance of the DPL using the discount rate consistent with the interest accretion on the FPBL. The recalculated DPL, including adjusted amortization through the current period, is compared to the current carrying amount and the difference is recognized as an adjustment to Policy benefits in the Consolidated statements of operations as a remeasurement gain or loss.\nm) \nMarket Risk Benefits\nChubb reinsures various death and living benefit guarantees associated with variable annuities issued primarily in the United States, which meet the definition of Market risk benefits (MRB). These reinsurance contracts provide protection to the ceding entity from, and expose us to, other-than-nominal capital market risk. Market risk benefits are measured at fair value using a valuation model based on current net exposures, market data, our experience, and other factors. Changes in fair value are \nF-18\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nrecognized in Market risk benefits gains (losses) in the Consolidated statements of operations, except the change in fair value due to a change in the instrument-specific credit risk, which is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nWe generally receive a monthly premium during the accumulation phase of the covered annuities (in-force) based on a percentage of either the underlying accumulated account values or the underlying accumulated guaranteed values. Depending on an annuitant's age, the accumulation phase can last many years. To limit our exposure under these programs, all reinsurance treaties include annual or aggregate claim limits and many include an aggregate deductible.\nThe guarantees which are payable on death, referred to as guaranteed minimum death benefits (GMDB), principally cover shortfalls between accumulated account value at the time of an annuitant's death and either i) an annuitant's total deposits; ii) an annuitant's total deposits plus a minimum annual return; or iii) the highest accumulated account value attained at any policy anniversary date. In addition, a death benefit may be based on a formula specified in the variable annuity contract that uses a percentage of the growth of the underlying contract value.\nUnder reinsurance programs covering guaranteed living benefits (GLB), we assume the risk of guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB) associated with variable annuity contracts. The GMIB risk is triggered if, at the time the contract holder elects to convert the accumulated account value to a periodic payment stream (annuitize), the accumulated account value is not sufficient to provide a guaranteed minimum level of monthly income.\nn) \nSeparate accounts\nSeparate account assets represent segregated funds where investment risks are borne by the customers, except to the extent of certain guarantees made by Chubb. Separate account liabilities primarily represent the policyholders’ account balances in separate account assets and are equal and offsetting to total separate account assets. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of any Chubb’s business. Mortality, policy administration and surrender charges assessed against the accounts are included in Net premiums earned on the Consolidated statements of operations. The related investment performance of the separate account assets (including interest, dividends, realized gains and losses, and changes in unrealized gains and losses) generally accrue to the policyholders and are not included in our Consolidated statements of operations. Fees charged against the separate accounts are deferred and recorded as unearned revenue liabilities within Policyholders’ account balances on the Consolidated balance sheets until they are earned within Net premiums earned on the Consolidated statements of operations. Refer to section o) Policyholders’ account balances, below.\no) Policyholders' account balances\nPolicyholders' account balances represent a liability for investment contracts sold that do not meet the definition of an insurance contract, and certain of these contracts are sold with a guaranteed rate of return. Consideration received or paid is recorded as a deposit asset or liability in the balance sheet as opposed to recording premiums and losses in the statements of operations. The liability for policyholders' account balances equals accumulated policy account values, which consist of consideration received from the policyholder, plus any credited income, less any relevant charges. Also included within Policyholders' account balances is an unearned revenue liability which represents policy charges for services to be provided in future periods. The charges are deferred as incurred and are generally amortized over the expected life of the contract using the same methodology, factors, and assumptions used to amortize deferred acquisition costs.\nCertain of our long-duration contracts are supported by assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under U.S. GAAP. These assets are classified as non-qualified separate account assets and reported in Other investments and the offsetting liabilities are reported in Policyholders’ account balances in the Consolidated balance sheets. Changes in the fair value of separate account assets that do not qualify for separate account reporting under U.S. GAAP are reported in Other (income) expense, and the offsetting movements in the liabilities are included in Policy benefits in the Consolidated statements of operations.\np) \nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment used in operations are capitalized and carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are reported within Other assets in the Consolidated balance sheets. At December 31, 2024, property and equipment totaled $\n3.1\n billion, consisting principally of capitalized software costs of $\n1.9\n billion incurred to develop or obtain computer software for internal use and company-owned facilities of $\n431\n million. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. For capitalized software, the estimated useful life is generally \nthree years\n to \nfive years\n (for security and analytics systems), but can be as long as \n15\n years (for systems of record such as our general ledger and processing systems such as our policy administration systems). For company-owned facilities the estimated useful life is \n40\n years. At December 31, 2023, property and equipment totaled $\n2.9\n billion.\nF-19\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nq) \nForeign currency remeasurement and translation\nThe functional currency for each of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment. Transactions in currencies other than a foreign operation's functional currency are remeasured into the functional currency, and the resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in Net realized gains (losses) in the Consolidated statements of operations. Functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency, U.S. dollars, using period end exchange rates and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of AOCI in Shareholders' equity. Functional statement of operations amounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates.\nr) \nAdministrative expenses\nAdministrative expenses generally include all operating costs other than policy acquisition costs. The North America Commercial P&C Insurance segment manages and uses an in-house third-party claims administrator, ESIS Inc. (ESIS). ESIS performs claims management and risk control services for domestic and international organizations that self-insure P&C exposures as well as internal P&C exposures. The net operating income (loss) of ESIS is included within Administrative expenses in the Consolidated statements of operations and was $\n7\n million, $(\n2\n) million, and $\n12\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\ns) \nAsset management and performance fee revenue and expenses\nHuatai's asset management companies recognize revenue and expenses from the management of third-party assets which are unrelated to Chubb's core insurance operations. These revenues include management fees, which are recognized in the period in which the services are performed, and asset performance fees, which are recognized to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. These fees and expenses are included in Other (income) expense on the Consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Note 18 for additional information.\n \nt) \nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes have been recorded related to those operations subject to income tax. Deferred tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law or rates is recognized in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if it is more likely than not that all, or some portion, of the benefits related to these deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance assessment considers tax planning strategies, where appropriate.\nWe recognize uncertain tax positions that are determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.\nChubb's policy for releasing income tax effects from AOCI is to release them as investments are sold or mature and as pension and postretirement benefit liabilities are extinguished. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.\nu) \nEarnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is calculated using the weighted-average shares outstanding, including participating securities with non-forfeitable rights to dividends such as unvested restricted stock. All potentially dilutive securities, including stock options are excluded from the basic earnings per share calculation. In calculating diluted earnings per share, the weighted-average shares outstanding is increased to include all potentially dilutive securities. Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing Net income attributable to Chubb by the applicable weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the year.\nv) \nShare-based compensation\nChubb measures and records compensation cost for all share-based payment awards at grant-date fair value. Compensation costs are recognized for vesting of share-based payment awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award were, in substance, multiple awards. For retirement-eligible participants, compensation costs for certain share-based payment awards are recognized immediately at the date of grant. Refer to Note 16 for additional information.\nw)\n \nIntegration expenses\nDirect costs related to business combinations, principally Cigna's business in Asia, were expensed as incurred. Integration expenses were $\n39\n million, $\n69\n million, and $\n48\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and include all internal and external costs directly related to the integration activities. These expenses principally \nF-20\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nconsisted of third-party consulting fees, employee-related retention costs, and other professional and legal fees related to the acquisition.\nx)\n \nNew accounting pronouncements\nAccounting guidance adopted in 2024\nImprovements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that requires expanded reportable segment disclosures, primarily related to significant segment expenses which are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker. We retrospectively adopted this disclosure-only guidance for our annual 2024 reporting, and modified the presentation of our segment financial information disclosure. Refer to Note 19 for additional information.\nAccounting guidance not yet adopted\nImprovements to Income Tax Disclosures\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued guidance that requires expanded income tax disclosures, including the disaggregation of existing disclosures related to the tax rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. The guidance is effective for our 2025 annual reporting. Prospective application is required, with retrospective application permitted. We are evaluating the impact of this disclosure-only requirement.\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued guidance that requires disclosure of specified information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to the financial statements. The guidance is effective for our 2027 annual reporting, and interim reporting periods beginning in 2028. Prospective application is required, with retrospective application permitted. We are evaluating the impact of this disclosure-only requirement.\n \n2\n. \nAcquisitions\nHealthy Paws\nOn \nMay 31, 2024\n, we acquired the business of Healthy Paws Pet Insurance LLC, a managing general agent specializing in pet insurance, from Aon plc for approximately $\n300\n million in cash. We recognized goodwill of $\n256\n million and intangible assets of $\n44\n million from this acquisition. Chubb has been the exclusive underwriter of Healthy Paws since 2013. The transaction positions Chubb to expand in a niche market with substantial growth potential. This business is assigned to the North America Commercial Insurance segment.\nHuatai Group\nHuatai Insurance Group Co., Ltd. (Huatai Group) is a Chinese financial services holding company and the parent company of, among others, Huatai Property & Casualty Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai P&C), Huatai Life Insurance Co., Ltd. (Huatai Life), Huatai Asset Management Co., Ltd., and Huatai Baoxing Fund Management Co., Ltd., of which Huatai Group owns 100 percent, 80 percent, 91 percent, and 85 percent, respectively (collectively, Huatai).\nOn \nJuly 1, 2023\n, Chubb further advanced our goal of greater product, customer, and geographical diversification by obtaining a controlling interest in our investment in Huatai Group, as we increased ownership interest from approximately \n64.2\n percent to approximately \n69.6\n percent. At that time, Chubb discontinued the equity method of accounting and applied consolidation accounting. Accordingly, Chubb remeasured the \n64.2\n percent equity method investment to its fair value of $\n4.1\n billion as of July 1, 2023, resulting in a one-time realized gain of $\n763\n million after-tax, reflecting the remeasurement of the previously held equity interest's historical carrying value to fair value. There was also a net realized and unrealized loss of $\n17\n million after-tax reflecting the write-off of AOCI loss balances accumulated while under equity method accounting of $\n611\n million with an offset to realized loss of $\n628\n million.\nIn the first quarter of 2024, we closed on incremental ownership interests of approximately \n9.0\n percent for $\n555\n million, $\n319\n million of which was paid prior to 2024, and $\n236\n million of which was paid in 2024. Our aggregate ownership interest in Huatai Group was approximately \n85.5\n percent as of December 31, 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to purchase approximately \n1.0\n percent of incremental ownership interests. Chubb has total outstanding agreements for approximately \n1.6\n percent of incremental ownership interests, pending completion of certain closing conditions.\nF-21\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nThe acquisition of a controlling majority interest in Huatai Group on July 1, 2023, generated $\n3,458\n million of Goodwill, attributable to expected growth and profitability, and $\n1,655\n million of Other intangible assets. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Additionally, the acquisition generated $\n309\n million of Value of business acquired (VOBA). Chubb financed the transaction through available cash on hand. Direct costs related to the acquisition are immaterial, and were expensed as incurred. These include one-time costs that are directly attributable to third-party consulting fees and other professional and legal fees related to the acquisition.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on July 1, 2023. \nHuatai Group assets and liabilities consolidated\nJuly 1\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2023\nAssets\nInvestments and Cash\n$\n13,346\n \nAccrued investment income\n60\n \nInsurance and reinsurance balances receivable\n277\n \nReinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses\n581\n \nReinsurance recoverable on future policy benefits\n27\n \nValue of business acquired\n309\n \nGoodwill and intangible assets\n5,113\n \nOther assets\n748\n \nTotal assets\n$\n20,461\n \nLiabilities\nUnpaid losses and loss expenses\n$\n831\n \nUnearned premiums\n800\n \nFuture policy benefits\n2,351\n \nPolicyholders' account balances\n4,014\n \nInsurance and reinsurance balances payable\n644\n \nAccounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities\n682\n \nDeferred tax liabilities\n232\n \nRepurchase agreements\n1,269\n \nTotal liabilities\n$\n10,823\n \nNet acquired assets, including goodwill, attributable to Chubb\n4,428\n \nNet acquired assets, attributable to noncontrolling interests\n5,210\n \nNet acquired assets, including goodwill\n$\n9,638\n \nHuatai Group's life insurance and asset management businesses are included in the Life Insurance segment, and Huatai Group's P&C business is included in the Overseas General Insurance segment.

Depending on the terms of the various subscription agreements, investment fund investments may be redeemed monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. If Chubb wishes to redeem an investment fund investment, it must first determine if the investment fund is still in a lock-up period (a time when Chubb cannot redeem its investment so that the investment fund manager has time to build the portfolio). If the investment fund is no longer in its lock-up period, Chubb must then notify the investment fund manager of its intention to redeem by the notification date prescribed by the subscription agreement. Subsequent to notification, the investment fund can redeem Chubb’s investment within several months of the notification. Notice periods for redemption of the investment funds are up to 270 days. Chubb can redeem its investment funds without consent from the investment fund managers.\nF-28\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nf) Net investment income\nYear Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n \n2023 \n2022 \nFixed maturities \n(1)\n$\n5,535\n \n$\n4,619\n \n$\n3,594\n \nShort-term investments\n181\n \n199\n \n81\n \nOther interest income \n80\n \n69\n \n42\n \nEquity securities\n125\n \n119\n \n99\n \nPrivate equities (less than 3 percent ownership)\n112\n \n55\n \n63\n \nOther investments\n103\n \n71\n \n41\n \nGross investment income \n(1)\n6,136\n \n5,132\n \n3,920\n \nInvestment expenses\n(\n206\n)\n(\n195\n)\n(\n178\n)\nNet investment income \n(1)\n$\n5,930\n \n$\n4,937\n \n$\n3,742\n \n(1)  \nIncludes amortization expense related to fair value adjustment of acquired invested assets\n$\n(\n16\n)\n$\n(\n21\n)\n$\n(\n41\n)\ng) Restricted assets\nChubb\n is required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support its insurance and reinsurance operations.

Our total exposure to these consolidated investment products represents the value of our economic ownership interest.\nUnconsolidated VIEs\nIn December 2024, we contributed $\n5.0\n billion of fixed maturity securities and cash to a reserved alternative investment fund (Fund) sponsored and managed by a third-party investment fund manager. At the time of the contribution, the fixed maturities \nF-29\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nhad a fair value of $\n4.2\n billion, resulting in a realized loss of $\n149\n million, pre-tax. The contribution of fixed maturity securities represents a non-cash investing activity and does not impact the Consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe Fund is a variable interest entity; however, Chubb is not the primary beneficiary and does not consolidate the Fund because Chubb does not receive substantially all the risks and returns of the Fund. The carrying value of this investment at December 31, 2024, was $\n5.0\n billion, which approximates our maximum risk of loss. We have elected to account for this investment using the fair value option, classified as Equity securities on the Consolidated balance sheets. We elected the fair value option so that changes in fair value of the Fund are recorded in Net realized gains (losses) and dividends from the Fund are recorded as Net investment income when declared on the Consolidated statements of operations.\nWe also do not consolidate sponsored investment products where we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary. The carrying value of these investments at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was $\n97\n million and $\n153\n million, respectively, and our maximum risk of loss approximates the carrying amount. These investments are classified within Equity securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n4. \nFair value measurements \na) Fair value hierarchy\nFair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is estimated based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The guidance defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants and establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data.\n \nThe three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;\n•\nLevel 2 – Includes, among other items, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as\ninterest rates and yield curves, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; and\n•\nLevel 3 – Inputs that are unobservable and reflect management’s judgments about assumptions that market participants\nwould use in pricing an asset or liability.\nWe categorize financial instruments within the valuation hierarchy at the balance sheet date based upon the lowest level of inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement.\nWe use pricing services to obtain fair value measurements for the majority of our investment securities. Based on management’s understanding of the methodologies used, these pricing services only produce an estimate of fair value if there is observable market information that would allow them to make a fair value estimate. Based on our understanding of the market inputs used by the pricing services, all applicable investments have been valued in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We do not adjust prices obtained from pricing services. The following is a description of the valuation techniques and inputs used to determine fair values for financial instruments carried at fair value, as well as the general classification of such financial instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\nFixed maturities\nWe use pricing services to estimate fair value measurements for the majority of our fixed maturities. The pricing services use market quotations for fixed maturities that have quoted prices in active markets; such securities are classified within Level 1. For fixed maturities other than U.S. Treasury securities that generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing services prepare estimates of fair value measurements using their pricing applications or pricing models, which include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings, and matrix pricing. Additional valuation factors that can be considered are nominal spreads, dollar basis, and liquidity adjustments. The pricing services evaluate each asset class based on relevant market and credit information, perceived market movements, and sector news. The market inputs used in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. The extent of the use of each input is dependent on the asset class and the market conditions. Given the asset class, the priority of the use of inputs may change, or some market inputs may not be relevant. Additionally, fixed maturities valuation is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market-based inputs (i.e., stale pricing) and may require the use \nF-30\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nof models to be priced. The lack of market-based inputs may increase the potential that an investment's estimated fair value is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur. The overwhelming majority of fixed maturities are classified within Level 2 because the most significant inputs used in the pricing techniques are observable. For a small number of fixed maturities, we obtain a single broker quote (typically from a market maker). Due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that the price is indicative only, we include these fair value estimates in Level 3.\nEquity securities\nEquity securities with active markets are classified within Level 1 as fair values are based on quoted market prices. For equity securities in markets which are less active, fair values are based on market valuations and are classified within Level 2. Equity securities for which pricing is unobservable are classified within Level 3.\nShort-term investments\nShort-term investments, which comprise securities due to mature within one year of the date of purchase that are traded in active markets, are classified within Level 1 as fair values are based on quoted market prices. Securities such as commercial paper and discount notes are classified within Level 2 because these securities are typically not actively traded due to their approaching maturity, and as such, their cost approximates fair value. Short-term investments for which pricing is unobservable are classified within Level 3.\nPrivate equities\nFair values for Private equities including investments in partially-owned investment companies, investment funds, and limited partnerships are based on their respective NAV and are excluded from the fair value hierarchy table below.\nOther investments\nCertain of our long-duration contracts are supported by assets that do not qualify for separate account treatment under U.S. GAAP. These assets primarily comprise mutual funds, classified within Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy on the same basis as other equity securities traded in active markets. Other investments principally include fixed maturities carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through Net realized gains (losses) on the Consolidated statements of operations. These fixed maturities principally relate to the Huatai investment portfolio, including those portfolios supporting certain participating policies, and are classified within Level 2. Also included are life insurance policies collateralizing investments held in rabbi trusts maintained by Chubb for deferred compensation plans and supplemental retirement plans. These policies are carried at cash surrender value and are classified in the valuation hierarchy within Level 2.\nSecurities lending collateral\nThe underlying assets included in Securities lending collateral in the Consolidated balance sheets are fixed maturities which are cl\nassified in the valuation hierarchy on the same basis as other fixed maturities. Excluded from the valuation hierarchy is the corresponding liability related to Chubb’s obligation to return the collateral plus interest as it is reported at contract value and not fair value in the Consolidated balance sheets.\nInvestment derivatives\nActively traded investment derivative instruments, including futures, options, and forward contracts are classified within Level 1 as fair values are based on quoted market prices. These derivative instruments are recorded in either Other assets or Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\nCertain of our derivatives are cross-currency swaps designated as fair value and net investment hedging instruments. The fair value of cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps is based on market valuations and is classified within Level 2. These derivative instruments are recorded in either Other assets or Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheets.\nOther derivative instruments\nWe maintain positions in exchange-traded equity futures contracts designed to limit exposure to a severe equity market decline, which would cause an increase in expected market risk benefits (MRB) claims, and therefore an increase in MRB reserves. Our positions in exchange-traded equity futures contracts are classified within Level 1. The fair value of the majority of the remaining positions in other derivative instruments is based on significant observable inputs including equity security and interest rate indices. Accordingly, these are classified within Level 2. Other derivative instruments are recorded in either Other assets or Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities in the Consolidated balance sheets. Chubb also maintains positions in convertible securities that contain embedded derivatives. Convertible securities are recorded in either Fixed maturities available-\nF-31\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nfor-sale (FM AFS) or Equity securities (ES) and are classified as either Level 1 or Level 2 depending on the underlying investment.\nSeparate account assets\nSeparate account assets represent segregated funds where investment risks are borne by the customers, except to the extent of certain guarantees made by Chubb. Separate account assets principally comprise mutual funds classified within Level 1 in the valuation hierarchy on the same basis as other equity securities traded in active markets. Separate account assets also include fixed maturities classified within Level 2 because the most significant inputs used in the pricing techniques are observable. Excluded from the valuation hierarchy are the corresponding liabilities as they are reported at contract value and not fair value in the Consolidated balance sheets. \nFinancial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by valuation hierarchy \nDecember 31, 2024\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nAssets:\nFixed maturities available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury / Agency\n$\n1,765\n \n$\n576\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,341\n \nNon-U.S.\n—\n \n35,234\n \n604\n \n35,838\n \nCorporate and asset-backed securities\n—\n \n40,316\n \n2,891\n \n43,207\n \nMortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n27,245\n \n3\n \n27,248\n \nMunicipal\n—\n \n1,729\n \n—\n \n1,729\n \n1,765\n \n105,100\n \n3,498\n \n110,363\n \nEquity securities \n(1)\n4,053\n \n—\n \n120\n \n4,173\n \nShort-term investments\n3,156\n \n1,972\n \n14\n \n5,142\n \nOther investments \n(2)\n573\n \n6,783\n \n—\n \n7,356\n \nSecurities lending collateral\n—\n \n1,445\n \n—\n \n1,445\n \nInvestment derivatives\n41\n \n—\n \n—\n \n41\n \nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments \n—\n \n146\n \n—\n \n146\n \nOther derivative instruments\n35\n \n—\n \n—\n \n35\n \nSeparate account assets\n6,165\n \n66\n \n—\n \n6,231\n \nTotal assets measured at fair value \n(1) (2) (3)\n$\n15,788\n \n$\n115,512\n \n$\n3,632\n \n$\n134,932\n \nLiabilities:\nInvestment derivatives\n$\n303\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n303\n \nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\n—\n \n116\n \n—\n \n116\n \nOther derivative instruments\n—\n \n2\n \n—\n \n2\n \nMarket risk benefits \n(4)\n—\n \n—\n \n607\n \n607\n \nTotal liabilities measured at fair value\n$\n303\n \n$\n118\n \n$\n607\n \n$\n1,028\n \n(1)\nExcluded from the table above is a fund of $\n4,978\n million, measured using NAV as a practical expedient.\n(2)\nExcluded from the table above are other investments of $\n1,241\n million, principally policy loans measured using NAV as a practical expedient\n.\n(3)\nExcluded from the table above are private equities of $\n14,769\n million, measured using NAV as a practical expedient.\n(4)\nRefer to Note 11 for additional information on Market risk benefits.\n \nF-32\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2023\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nAssets:\nFixed maturities available-for-sale\nU.S. Treasury / Agency\n$\n2,911\n \n$\n679\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,590\n \nNon-U.S.\n—\n \n34,472\n \n692\n \n35,164\n \nCorporate and asset-backed securities\n—\n \n40,208\n \n2,622\n \n42,830\n \nMortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n22,051\n \n7\n \n22,058\n \nMunicipal\n—\n \n2,929\n \n—\n \n2,929\n \n2,911\n \n100,339\n \n3,321\n \n106,571\n \nEquity securities\n3,368\n \n—\n \n87\n \n3,455\n \nShort-term investments\n1,915\n \n2,633\n \n3\n \n4,551\n \nOther investments \n(1)\n589\n \n4,236\n \n—\n \n4,825\n \nSecurities lending collateral\n—\n \n1,299\n \n—\n \n1,299\n \nInvestment derivatives\n54\n \n—\n \n—\n \n54\n \nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\n—\n \n136\n \n—\n \n136\n \nSeparate account assets\n5,482\n \n91\n \n—\n \n5,573\n \nTotal assets measured at fair value \n(1) (2)\n$\n14,319\n \n$\n108,734\n \n$\n3,411\n \n$\n126,464\n \nLiabilities:\nInvestment derivatives\n$\n136\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n136\n \nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments\n—\n \n128\n \n—\n \n128\n \nOther derivative instruments\n37\n \n5\n \n—\n \n42\n \nMarket risk benefits \n(3)\n—\n \n—\n \n771\n \n771\n \nTotal liabilities measured at fair value\n$\n173\n \n$\n133\n \n$\n771\n \n$\n1,077\n \n(1)\nExcluded from the table above are other investments of $\n702\n million, principally policy loans measured using NAV as a practical expedient.\n(2)\nExcluded from the table above are private equities of $\n14,078\n million, measured using NAV as a practical expedient.\n(3)\nRefer to Note 11 for additional information on Market risk benefits.\nF-33\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nLevel 3 financial instruments\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of financial instruments measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).

Reserves are recorded in Unpaid losses and loss expenses in the Consolidated balance sheets.

The process of establishing loss and loss expense reserves can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of estimates and judgments based on circumstances underlying the insured loss at the date of accrual. The reserves for our various product lines each require different qualitative and quantitative assumptions and judgments to be made. Management's best estimate is developed after collaboration with actuarial, underwriting, claims, legal, and finance departments and culminates with the input of reserve committees. Each business unit reserve committee includes the participation of the relevant parties from actuarial, finance, claims, and unit senior management and has the responsibility for finalizing, recommending and approving the estimate to be used as management's best estimate. Reserves are further reviewed by Chubb's Chief Actuary and senior management. The objective of such a process is to determine a single estimate that we believe represents a better estimate than any other and which is viewed by management to be the best estimate of ultimate loss settlements. This estimate is based on a combination of exposure and experience-based actuarial methods (described below) and other considerations such as claims reviews, reinsurance recovery assumptions and/or input from other knowledgeable parties such as underwriting. Exposure-based methods are most commonly used on relatively immature origin years (i.e., the year in which the losses were incurred — “accident year” or “report year”), while experience-based methods provide a view based on the projection of loss experience that has emerged as of the valuation date. Greater reliance is placed upon experience-based methods as the pool of emerging loss experience grows and where it is deemed sufficiently credible and reliable as the basis for the estimate. In comparing the held reserve for any given origin year to the actuarial projections, judgment is required as to the credibility, uncertainty and inherent limitations of applying actuarial techniques to historical data to project future loss experience. Examples of factors that impact such judgments include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nnature and complexity of underlying coverage provided and net limits of exposure provided;\n•\nsegmentation of data to provide sufficient homogeneity and credibility for loss projection methods;\n•\nextent of credible internal historical loss data and reliance upon industry information as required;\n•\nhistorical variability of actual loss emergence compared with expected loss emergence;\n•\nreported and projected loss trends;\n•\nextent of emerged loss experience relative to the remaining expected period of loss emergence;\n•\nrate monitor information for new and renewal business;\n•\nchanges in claims han\ndling practice;\n•\ninflation;\n•\nthe legal environment;\n•\nfacts and circumstances of large claims;\n•\nterms and conditions of the contracts sold to our insured parties;\n•\nimpact of applicable reinsurance recoveries; and\n•\nnature and extent of underlying assumptions.\nF-44\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nActuarial staff within each of our business units analyze loss reserves (including loss expenses) and regularly project estimates of ultimate losses and the corresponding indications of the required IBNR reserve. Our reserving approach is a comprehensive ground-up process using data at a detailed level that reflects the specific types and coverages of the diverse products written by our various operations. The data presented in this disclosure was prepared on a more aggregated basis and with a focus on changes in incurred loss estimates over time as well as associated cash flows. We note that data prepared on this basis may not demonstrate the full spectrum of characteristics that are evident in the more detailed level studied internally.\nWe perform an actuarial reserve review for each product line at least once a year. For most product lines, one or more standard actuarial reserving methods may be used to determine estimates of ultimate losses and loss expenses, and from these estimates, a single actuarial central estimate is selected. The actuarial central estimate is an input to the reserve committee process described above. For the few product lines that do not lend themselves to standard actuarial reserving methods, appropriate techniques are applied to produce the actuarial central estimates. For example, run-off asbestos and environmental liability estimates are better suited to the application of account-specific exposure-based analyses to best evaluate their associated aggregate reserve levels.\nb) Standard actuarial reserving methods\nThe judgments involved in projecting the ultimate losses include the use and interpretation of various standard actuarial reserving methods that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industry data, and other benchmarks as appropriate. \nStandard actuarial reserving methods include, but are not limited to, expected loss ratio, paid and reported loss development, and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. A general description of these methods is provided below. In addition to these standard methods, depending upon the product line characteristics and available data, we may use other recognized actuarial methods and approaches. Implicit in the standard actuarial methods that we generally utilize is the need for two fundamental assumptions: first, the pattern by which losses are expected to emerge over time for each origin year, and second, the expected loss ratio for each origin year.\nThe expected loss ratio for any particular origin year is selected after consideration of a number of factors, including historical loss ratios adjusted for rate changes, premium and loss trends, industry benchmarks, the results of policy level loss modeling at the time of underwriting, and/or other more subjective considerations for the product line (e.g., terms and conditions) and external environment as noted above. The expected loss ratio for a given origin year is initially established at the start of the origin year as part of the planning process. This analysis is performed in conjunction with underwriters and management. The expected loss ratio method arrives at an ultimate loss estimate by multiplying the expected ultimate loss ratio by the corresponding premium base. This method is most commonly used as the basis for the actuarial central estimate for immature origin periods on product lines where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet deemed sufficiently credible to serve as the principal basis for the selection of ultimate losses. The expected loss ratio for a given origin year may be modified over time if the underlying assumptions differ from the original assumptions (e.g., the assessment of prior year loss ratios, loss trend, rate changes, actual claims, or other information).\nOur selected paid and reported development patterns provide a benchmark against which the actual emerging loss experience can be monitored. Where possible, development patterns are selected based on historical loss emergence by origin year. For product lines where the historical data is viewed to have low statistical credibility, the selected development patterns also reflect relevant industry benchmarks and/or experience from similar product lines written elsewhere within Chubb. This most commonly occurs for relatively new product lines that have limited historical data or for high severity/low frequency portfolios where our historical experience exhibits considerable volatility and/or lacks credibility. The paid and reported loss development methods convert the selected loss emergence pattern to a set of multiplicative factors which are then applied to actual paid or reported losses to arrive at an estimate of ultimate losses for each period. Due to their multiplicative nature, the paid and reported loss development methods will leverage differences between actual and expected loss emergence. These methods tend to be utilized for more mature origin periods and for those portfolios where the loss emergence has been relatively consistent over time.\nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is a combination of the expected loss ratio method and the loss development method, where the loss development method is given more weight as the origin year matures. This approach allows a logical transition between the expected loss ratio method which is generally utilized at earlier maturities and the loss development methods which are typically utilized at later maturities. We usually apply this method using reported loss data although paid data may also be used.\nF-45\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nShort-tail business\nShort-tail business generally describes product lines for which losses are typically known and paid shortly after the loss occurs. This would include, for example, most property, personal accident, and automobile physical damage policies that we write. Due to the short reporting and development pattern for these product lines, the uncertainty associated with our estimate of ultimate losses for any particular accident period diminishes relatively quickly as actual loss experience emerges. We typically assign credibility to methods that incorporate actual loss emergence, such as the paid and reported loss development and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods, sooner than would be the case for long-tail lines at a similar stage of development for a given origin year. The reserving process for short-tail losses arising from catastrophic events typically involves an assessment by the claims department, in conjunction with underwriters and actuaries, of our exposure and estimated losses immediately following an event and then subsequent revisions of the estimated losses as our insureds provide updated actual loss information.\nLong-tail business\nLong-tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known/reported for some period and for which claims can take signif\nicant time to settle/close. This includes most casualty lines such as general liability, D&O, and workers' compensation. There are various factors contributing to the uncertainty and volatility of long-tail business, including the indirect impact of COVID-19 that has changed loss reporting and development patterns. In addition, uncertain future inflationary trends, changes in future legal environments, and the potential impact of major claims, such as molestation claims including the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) agreement-in-principle, added to the uncertainty and volatility in the long-tail business. Other factors are\n:\n•\nThe nature and complexity of underlying coverage provided and net limits of exposure provided\n;\n•\nOur historical loss data and experience is sometimes too immature and lacking in credibility to rely upon for reserving purposes. Where this is the case, in our reserve analysis we may utilize industry loss ratios or industry benchmark development patterns that we believe reflect the nature and coverage of the underwritten business and its future development, where available. For such product lines, actual loss experience may differ from industry loss statistics as well as loss experience for previous underwriting years;\n•\nThe difficulty in estimating loss trends, claims inflation (e.g., medical and judicial) and underlying economic conditions;\n•\nThe need for professional judgment to estimate loss development patterns beyond that represented by historical data using supplemental internal or industry data, extrapolation, or a blend of both;\n•\nThe need to address shifts in business mix or volume over time when applying historical paid and reported loss development patterns from older origin years to more recent origin years. For example, changes over time in the processes and procedures for establishing case reserves can distort reported loss development patterns or changes in ceded reinsurance structures by origin year can alter the development of paid and reported losses;\n•\nLoss reserve analyses typically require loss or other data be grouped by common characteristics in some manner. If data from two combined lines of business exhibit different characteristics, such as loss payment patterns, the credibility of the reserve estimate could be affected. Additionally, since casualty lines of business can have significant intricacies in the terms and conditions afforded to the insured, there is an inherent risk as to the homogeneity of the underlying data used in performing reserve analyses; and\n•\nThe applicability of the price change data used to estimate ultimate loss ratios for most recent origin years.\nAs described above, various factors are considered when determining appropriate data, assumptions, and methods used to establish the loss reserve estimates for long-tail product lines. These factors may also vary by origin year for given product lines. The derivation of loss development patterns from data and the selection of a tail factor to project ultimate losses from actual loss emergence require considerable judgment, particularly with respect to the extent to which historical loss experience is relied upon to support changes in key reserving assumptions. \nF-46\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nc) Loss Development Tables \nThe tables were designed to present business with similar risk characteristics which exhibit like development patterns and generally similar trends, in order to provide insight into the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows related to our claims liabilities. \nEach table follows a similar format and reflects the following:  \n•\nThe incurred loss triangle includes both reported case reserves and IBNR liabilities.  \n•\nBoth the incurred and paid loss triangles include allocated loss adjustment expense (i.e., defense and investigative costs particular to individual claims) but exclude unallocated loss adjustment expense (i.e., the costs associated with internal claims staff and third-party administrators). \n•\nThe amounts in both triangles for the years ended December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2023, and average historical claim duration as of December 31, 2024, are presented as supplementary information.  \n•\nAll data presented in the triangles is net of reinsurance recoverables. \n•\nThe IBNR reserves shown to the right of each incurred loss development exhibit reflect the net IBNR recorded as of December 31, 2024.\n•\nThe tables are presented retrospectively with respect to acquisitions where these are material and doing so is practicable. Most notably, the Chubb Corp acquisition is presented retrospectively. The unaudited consolidated data is presented solely for informational purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated data that might have been observed had the transactions been completed prior to the date indicated.\nHistorical dollar amounts are presented in this footnote on a constant-dollar basis, which is achieved by assuming constant foreign exchange rates for all periods in the loss triangles, translating prior period amounts using the same local currency exchange rates as the current year end. The impact of this conversion is to show the change between periods exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates, which would otherwise distort the change in incurred loss and cash flow patterns shown. The change in incurred loss shown will differ from other U.S. GAAP disclosures of incurred prior period reserve development amounts, which include the effect of fluctuations in exchanges rates.\nWe provided guidance above on key assumptions that should be considered when reviewing this disclosure and information relating to how loss reserve estimates are developed. We believe the information provided in the “Loss Development Tables” section of the disclosure is of limited use for independent analysis or application of standard actuarial estimations.  \nCumulative Number of Reported Claims\nReported claim counts, on a cumulative basis, are provided to the far right of each incurred loss development table. In our North America segments, we generally consider a reported claim to be one claim per coverage per claimant. In our Overseas General Insurance segment, we generally consider a reported claim to be on a per occurrence basis. Global Reinsurance segment’s portfolio comprises a mix of proportional and non-proportional treaties. The proportional treaties are reported on a bulk basis and do not lend themselves to meaningful claim count data. As such, we do not provide claim count information for our Global Reinsurance segment.\nWe exclude claims closed without payment. Claims are counted on a direct basis without consideration of ceded reinsurance. Use of the presented claim counts in analysis of company experience has significant limitations, including:\n•\nClaims for certain events and/or product lines, such as portions of our A&H business, are not reported on an individual basis, but rather in bulk and thus not available for inclusion in this disclosure. \n•\nEach segment typically has a mixture of primary and excess experience which has shifted over time. \n•\nCaptive business, especially in Workers' Compensation and Liability, largely represents fronted business where our net exposure to loss is minimal; however, since the claim count is based on direct claims, there is a mismatch between direct claims and net loss dollars, the extent of which varies by accident year\n.\nReported claim counts include open claims which have case reserves but exclude claims that have been incurred but not reported. As such the reported claims are not consistent with the incurred losses in the triangle, which include incurred but not reported losses. One can calculate reported losses by subtracting incurred but not reported losses from incurred losses in the triangle. Reported claim counts are also inconsistent with losses in the paid loss triangle, since reported counts would include claims with case reserves but no payments to date.   \nF-47\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nNorth America Commercial P&C Insurance — Workers' Compensation — Long-tail \nThis product line has a broad mix of exposures across industries as well as a mix of policy coverages. Types of coverage include risk management business predominantly with high deductible policies, loss sensitive business (i.e., retrospectively-rated policies), business fronted for captives, as well as excess and primary guaranteed cost coverages.\nThe triangle below shows all loss and allocated expense development for the workers' compensation product line. In our prior period development disclosure, we exclude any loss development where there is a directly related premium adjustment. For workers' compensation, changes in the exposure base due to payroll audits will drive changes in ultimate losses. In addition, we record involuntary pool assumptions (premiums and losses) on a lagged basis. Both of these items will influence the development in the triangle, particularly the first prior accident year, and are included in the reconciliation table presented on page F-60.\n \nNet Incurred Loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses \nYears Ended December 31\n As of December 31 2024\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nUnaudited\nNet IBNR Reserves\nReported Claims \n(in thousands)\nAccident Year\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2015\n$\n1,282\n \n$\n1,259\n \n$\n1,276\n \n$\n1,279\n \n$\n1,217\n \n$\n1,154\n \n$\n1,128\n \n$\n1,092\n \n$\n1,057\n \n$\n1,032\n \n$\n257\n \n50\n \n2016\n1,366\n \n1,361\n \n1,383\n \n1,378\n \n1,269\n \n1,206\n \n1,177\n \n1,162\n \n1,117\n \n299\n \n51\n \n2017\n1,412\n \n1,380\n \n1,399\n \n1,393\n \n1,376\n \n1,176\n \n1,121\n \n1,069\n \n329\n \n50\n \n2018\n1,359\n \n1,361\n \n1,379\n \n1,384\n \n1,384\n \n1,221\n \n1,175\n \n381\n \n52\n \n2019\n1,390\n \n1,383\n \n1,400\n \n1,409\n \n1,406\n \n1,297\n \n447\n \n48\n \n2020\n1,367\n \n1,388\n \n1,409\n \n1,408\n \n1,395\n \n690\n \n32\n \n2021\n1,348\n \n1,330\n \n1,372\n \n1,370\n \n618\n \n36\n \n2022\n1,344\n \n1,407\n \n1,435\n \n769\n \n39\n \n2023\n1,371\n \n1,413\n \n798\n \n38\n \n2024\n1,380\n \n981\n \n33\n \nTotal\n$\n12,683\n \nNet Cumulative Paid Loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses\nYears Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nUnaudited\nAccident Year\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2015\n$\n116\n \n$\n301\n \n$\n418\n \n$\n501\n \n$\n564\n \n$\n606\n \n$\n628\n \n$\n645\n \n$\n665\n \n$\n679\n \n2016\n122\n \n326\n \n452\n \n529\n \n584\n \n621\n \n653\n \n683\n \n707\n \n2017\n120\n \n313\n \n437\n \n516\n \n564\n \n601\n \n626\n \n648\n \n2018\n130\n \n329\n \n451\n \n528\n \n597\n \n641\n \n681\n \n2019\n143\n \n341\n \n467\n \n575\n \n640\n \n692\n \n2020\n111\n \n282\n \n390\n \n466\n \n520\n \n2021\n120\n \n331\n \n458\n \n552\n \n2022\n131\n \n332\n \n472\n \n2023\n129\n \n358\n \n2024\n147\n \nTotal\n$\n5,456\n \nNet Liabilities for Loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nDecember 31, 2024\nAccident years prior to 2015\n$\n2,968\n \nAccident years 2015 - 2024 from tables above\n7,227\n \nAll Accident years\n$\n10,195\n \nF-48\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nNorth America Commercial P&C Insurance — Workers' Compensation —  Long-tail (continued)\nSupplementary Information: (Favorable)/ Adverse Prior Period Development\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nDecember 31, 2024\nAccident years prior to 2015\n$\n(\n151\n)\nAccident years 2015 - 2024 from tables above\n(\n222\n)\nAll Accident years\n$\n(\n373\n)\nSupplementary Information: Average Annual Percentage Payout of Net Incurred Claims by Age, as of December 31, 2024 (Unaudited)\nAge in Years\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \nPercentage\n10\n \n%\n16\n \n%\n10\n \n%\n7\n \n%\n5\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n3\n \n%\n2\n \n%\n2\n \n%\n1\n \n%\nNorth America Commercial P&C Insurance — Liability — Long-tail\nThis line consists of primary and excess general liability exposures, medical liability, and professional lines, including directors and officers (D&O) liability, errors and omissions (E&O) liability, employment practices liability (EPL), fidelity bonds, and fiduciary liability. \nThe primary and excess general liability business represents the largest part of these exposures.

Treaty year data was converted to an accident year basis for the purposes of this disclosure. Mix shifts are an important consideration in these product line groupings. As proportional business and excess of loss business have different earning and loss reporting and payment patterns, this change in mix will affect the cash flow patterns across the accident years. In addition, the shift from excess to proportional business over time will make the cash flow patterns of older and more recent years difficult to compare. In general, the proportional business will pay out more quickly than the excess of loss business, as such, using older years development patterns may overstate the ultimate loss estimates in more recent years.\nGlobal Reinsurance — Casualty — Long-tail\nThis product line includes proportional and excess coverages in general, automobile liability, professional liability, medical malpractice, and workers' compensation, with exposures located around the world. In general, reinsurance exhibits less stable development patterns than primary business. In particular, general casualty reinsurance and excess coverages are long-tailed and can be very volatile.\n \nF-57\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nGlobal Reinsurance — Casualty — Long-tail (continued)\nNet Incurred Loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses \nYears Ended December 31\nAs of December 31\n 2024\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nUnaudited\nNet \nIBNR \nReserves\nAccident Year\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2015\n$\n281\n \n$\n286\n \n$\n296\n \n$\n297\n \n$\n305\n \n$\n301\n \n$\n305\n \n$\n308\n \n$\n308\n \n$\n309\n \n$\n8\n \n2016\n219\n \n223\n \n231\n \n230\n \n239\n \n239\n \n244\n \n251\n \n252\n \n10\n \n2017\n210\n \n211\n \n216\n \n213\n \n214\n \n214\n \n221\n \n224\n \n7\n \n2018\n239\n \n242\n \n249\n \n246\n \n249\n \n256\n \n261\n \n12\n \n2019\n233\n \n242\n \n237\n \n237\n \n234\n \n241\n \n27\n \n2020\n242\n \n246\n \n237\n \n237\n \n232\n \n30\n \n2021\n278\n \n281\n \n286\n \n274\n \n75\n \n2022\n294\n \n296\n \n292\n \n116\n \n2023\n274\n \n286\n \n170\n \n2024\n337\n \n252\n \nTotal\n$\n2,708\n \nNet Cumulative Paid Loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses\nYears Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nUnaudited\nAccident Year\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2015\n$\n89\n \n$\n158\n \n$\n190\n \n$\n216\n \n$\n231\n \n$\n248\n \n$\n264\n \n$\n273\n \n$\n281\n \n$\n288\n \n2016\n57\n \n112\n \n141\n \n157\n \n173\n \n190\n \n207\n \n217\n \n228\n \n2017\n46\n \n99\n \n121\n \n138\n \n153\n \n173\n \n186\n \n196\n \n2018\n41\n \n95\n \n124\n \n147\n \n168\n \n195\n \n217\n \n2019\n39\n \n89\n \n115\n \n138\n \n162\n \n182\n \n2020\n41\n \n98\n \n124\n \n148\n \n168\n \n2021\n35\n \n87\n \n119\n \n147\n \n2022\n39\n \n86\n \n122\n \n2023\n30\n \n69\n \n2024\n30\n \nTotal\n$\n1,647\n \nNet Liabilities for Loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nDecember 31, 2024\nAccident years prior to 2015\n$\n267\n \nAccident years 2015 - 2024 from tables above\n1,061\n \nAll Accident years\n$\n1,328\n \nSupplementary Information: (Favorable)/ Adverse Prior Period Development\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nDecember 31, 2024\nAccident years prior to 2015\n$\n(\n7\n)\nAccident years 2015 - 2024 from tables above\n8\n \nAll Accident years\n$\n1\n \nSupplementary Information: Average Annual Percentage Payout of Net Incurred Claims by Age, as of December 31, 2024 (Unaudited)\nAge in Years\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \nPercentage\n17\n \n%\n20\n \n%\n11\n \n%\n9\n \n%\n7\n \n%\n8\n \n%\n7\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n3\n \n%\n2\n \n%\nF-58\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nGlobal Reinsurance — Non-Casualty — Short-tail\nThis product line includes property, property catastrophe, marine, credit/surety, mortgage, A&H and energy.

This percentage has increased over time with the proportion being approximately \n76\n percent for treaty years 2015-2017 growing to an average of \n94\n percent for treaty years 2018 to 2024, with the remainder being written on an excess of loss basis. \nNet Incurred Loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses\nAs of December 31\n 2024\nYears Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nUnaudited\nNet \nIBNR \nReserves\nAccident Year\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2015\n$\n144\n \n$\n152\n \n$\n158\n \n$\n158\n \n$\n151\n \n$\n156\n \n$\n154\n \n$\n154\n \n$\n154\n \n$\n153\n \n$\n—\n \n2016\n174\n \n179\n \n182\n \n184\n \n181\n \n178\n \n178\n \n178\n \n178\n \n1\n \n2017\n394\n \n420\n \n450\n \n448\n \n452\n \n455\n \n454\n \n453\n \n7\n \n2018\n276\n \n283\n \n285\n \n281\n \n286\n \n280\n \n277\n \n3\n \n2019\n128\n \n126\n \n124\n \n118\n \n114\n \n114\n \n(\n1\n)\n2020\n208\n \n252\n \n276\n \n278\n \n278\n \n17\n \n2021\n340\n \n350\n \n353\n \n356\n \n21\n \n2022\n345\n \n311\n \n290\n \n27\n \n2023\n180\n \n175\n \n45\n \n2024\n391\n \n193\n \nTotal\n$\n2,665\n \nNet Cumulative Paid Loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses\nYears Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nUnaudited\nAccident Year\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\n2020\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2015\n$\n56\n \n$\n102\n \n$\n130\n \n$\n140\n \n$\n144\n \n$\n148\n \n$\n149\n \n$\n150\n \n$\n150\n \n$\n150\n \n2016\n55\n \n127\n \n153\n \n164\n \n169\n \n173\n \n173\n \n174\n \n175\n \n2017\n191\n \n321\n \n399\n \n413\n \n426\n \n433\n \n439\n \n441\n \n2018\n94\n \n247\n \n262\n \n265\n \n269\n \n272\n \n272\n \n2019\n35\n \n79\n \n93\n \n101\n \n103\n \n107\n \n2020\n62\n \n176\n \n214\n \n231\n \n242\n \n2021\n157\n \n277\n \n307\n \n320\n \n2022\n73\n \n194\n \n233\n \n2023\n36\n \n92\n \n2024\n107\n \nTotal\n$\n2,139\n \nNet Liabilities for Loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nDecember 31, 2024\nAccident years prior to 2015\n$\n14\n \nAccident years 2015 - 2024 from tables above\n526\n \nAll Accident years\n$\n540\n \nSupplementary Information: (Favorable)/ Adverse Prior Period Development\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nDecember 31, 2024\nAccident years prior to 2015\n$\n—\n \nAccident years 2015 - 2024 from tables above\n(\n28\n)\nAll Accident years\n$\n(\n28\n)\nF-59\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nGlobal Reinsurance — Non-Casualty — Short-tail (continued)\nSupplementary Information: Average Annual Percentage Payout of Net Incurred Claims by Age, as of December 31, 2024 (Unaudited)\nAge in Years\n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \nPercentage\n32\n \n%\n38\n \n%\n13\n \n%\n4\n \n%\n3\n \n%\n2\n \n%\n1\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\n—\n \n%\nPrior Period Development — Supplementary Information\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the loss development triangles above to prior period development (PPD):\nComponents of PPD\nYear Ended December 31, 2024                                                  (in millions of U.S. dollars)\n(favorable)/unfavorable\n2015 - 2023 accident years (implied PPD per loss triangles)\nAccident years prior to 2015\nOther \n(1)\nPPD on loss reserves \nRIPs, Expense adjustments, and earned premiums\nTotal\nNorth America Commercial P&C Insurance\nLong-tail\n$\n227\n \n$\n(\n86\n)\n$\n(\n194\n)\n$\n(\n53\n)\n$\n71\n \n$\n18\n \nShort-tail\n(\n452\n)\n18\n \n(\n6\n)\n(\n440\n)\n(\n6\n)\n(\n446\n)\n(\n225\n)\n(\n68\n)\n(\n200\n)\n(2)\n(\n493\n)\n65\n \n(3)\n(\n428\n)\nNorth America Personal P&C Insurance (Short-tail)\n(\n290\n)\n(\n11\n)\n(\n4\n)\n(\n305\n)\n—\n \n(\n305\n)\nOverseas General Insurance\nLong-tail\n(\n102\n)\n75\n \n1\n \n(\n26\n)\n—\n \n(\n26\n)\nShort-tail\n(\n250\n)\n(\n11\n)\n(\n3\n)\n(\n264\n)\n—\n \n(\n264\n)\n(\n352\n)\n64\n \n(\n2\n)\n(\n290\n)\n—\n \n(\n290\n)\nGlobal Reinsurance\nLong-tail\n8\n \n(\n7\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n1\n)\n1\n \n—\n \nShort-tail\n(\n28\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n(\n28\n)\n3\n \n(\n25\n)\n(\n20\n)\n(\n7\n)\n(\n2\n)\n(\n29\n)\n4\n \n(\n25\n)\nSubtotal\n$\n(\n887\n)\n$\n(\n22\n)\n$\n(\n208\n)\n$\n(\n1,117\n)\n$\n69\n \n$\n(\n1,048\n)\nNorth America Agricultural Insurance (Short-tail)\n$\n(\n170\n)\n$\n66\n \n$\n(\n104\n)\nCorporate (Long-tail)\n296\n \n—\n \n296\n \nConsolidated PPD\n$\n(\n991\n)\n(4)\n$\n135\n \n$\n(\n856\n)\n(1)\n        \nOther includes the impact of foreign exchange.\n(2)     \nIncludes favorable development of $\n39\n million related to our Alternative Risk Solutions business (U.S. and Bermuda) and an adjustment to exclude $\n89\n million in unfavorable development in the workers' compensation line, associated with an increase in exposure for which additional premiums were collected;

Long-tail lines experienced adverse development, which was the net of adverse development in casualty lines, predominantly commercial excess and umbrella and commercial auto liability, due to higher-than-expected development, mainly offset by favorable development in workers' compensation due to lower-than-expected loss experience and our annual assessment of multi-claimant events, including industrial accidents. \nNet favorable development in \n2023 included $\n408\n million from short-tail lines, primarily commercial property and marine lines, and surety lines, all mainly driven by lower-than-expected loss emergence. Net favorable development in 2023 also included $\n86\n million from long-tail lines, primarily from workers' compensation lines due to lower-than-expected loss emergence, partially offset by adverse development in commercial excess and umbrella lines, and commercial auto liability, both driven by higher-than-expected loss emergence.  \nF-61\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nNorth America Personal P&C Insurance\n.\nNet favorable development in 2024 and 2023 was predominantly in homeowners lines, mainly due to lower-than-expected loss experience in the most recent accident years. \nNorth America Agricultural Insurance.\nNet favorable development in 2024 was driven by multi-peril crop insurance results for crop year 2023.\nOverseas General Insurance\n.\nNet favorable development in 2024 included $\n264\n million in short-tail lines, primarily in property and marine lines, mainly in accident years 2019 through 2023, driven by favorable loss development across all regions and specific case reductions.

Net favorable development also included $\n50\n million in long-tail lines, primarily in professional lines, including cyber, driven by favorable loss development in the U.K. and Europe regions.\nCorporate\n.\nNet adverse development in 2024, 2023, and 2022, included adverse development for asbestos, environmental, molestation claims and other exposures.  \nMolestation claims\nChubb's exposure to molestation claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when it purchased CIGNA's P&C business in 1999, and Chubb Corp in 2016. The vast majority of the current liability relates to exposure from \"reviver\" legislation in certain states that allow civil claims relating to molestation to be asserted against policyholders that would otherwise be barred by statutes of limitations. These exposures are predominantly included in our inactive run-off operations included in Corporate with an immaterial amount in the North America Commercial P&C segment.\nIn December 2021, Chubb reached an agreement-in-principle regarding the bankruptcy of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Under this agreement, which remains contingent upon final court approval following exhaustion of all appeals, our inactive run-off company, Century Indemnity Company, and certain active Chubb companies obtained a broad release for all Chubb companies from BSA-related abuse claims for $\n800\n million. This agreement was approved by the bankruptcy court in the third quarter of 2022. \nIn the first quarter of 2023, the District Court issued an order approving the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) bankruptcy plan in full; however, appeals were subsequently filed. We paid \n$\n800\n million\n per the agreement, with \n$\n300\n million\n paid in 2022, and the remaining \n$\n500\n million p\naid in 2023.\nF-62\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nAsbestos and environmental (A&E)\nChubb's exposure to A&E claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when it purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998, CIGNA's P&C business in 1999, and Chubb Corp in 2016. \nThe following table presents a roll-forward of consolidated A&E loss reserves including allocated loss expense reserves for A&E exposures, and the valuation allowance for uncollectible paid and unpaid reinsurance recoverables:\nAsbestos\nEnvironmental\nTotal\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nGross\nNet\nGross\nNet\nGross\nNet\nBalance at December 31, 2021\n$\n1,226\n \n$\n800\n \n$\n402\n \n$\n302\n \n$\n1,628\n \n$\n1,102\n \nIncurred activity\n87\n \n55\n \n125\n \n77\n \n212\n \n132\n \n(1)\nPaid activity\n(\n215\n)\n(\n152\n)\n(\n115\n)\n(\n69\n)\n(\n330\n)\n(\n221\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n1,098\n \n703\n \n412\n \n310\n \n1,510\n \n1,013\n \nIncurred activity\n180\n \n120\n \n88\n \n63\n \n268\n \n183\n \n(1)\nPaid activity\n(\n258\n)\n(\n169\n)\n(\n105\n)\n(\n82\n)\n(\n363\n)\n(\n251\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2023\n1,020\n \n654\n \n395\n \n291\n \n1,415\n \n945\n \nIncurred activity\n176\n \n126\n \n74\n \n47\n \n250\n \n173\n \n(1)\nPaid activity\n(\n232\n)\n(\n172\n)\n(\n90\n)\n(\n61\n)\n(\n322\n)\n(\n233\n)\nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n964\n \n$\n608\n \n$\n379\n \n$\n277\n \n$\n1,343\n \n$\n885\n \n(1)    \nExcludes unallocated loss expenses and the net activity reflects third-party reinsurance other than the aggregate excess of loss reinsurance provided by National Indemnity Company (NICO) to Westchester Specialty (see Westchester Specialty section below)\n.\nThe A&E net loss reserves including allocated loss expense reserves and valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance at December 31, 2024 and 2023, shown in the table above comprises:\nDecember 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\nBrandywine operations\n$\n502\n \n$\n570\n \nWestchester Specialty\n86\n \n89\n \nChubb Corp\n258\n \n241\n \nOther, mainly Overseas General Insurance\n39\n \n45\n \nTotal\n$\n885\n \n$\n945\n \nBrandywine Run-off entities \n–\n The Restructuring Plan and uncertainties relating to Chubb's ultimate Brandywine exposure\nIn 1996, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner approved a plan to restructure INA Financial Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Restructuring) which included the division of Insurance Company of North America (INA) into two separate corporations:\n(1) An active insurance company that retained the INA name and continued to write P&C business; and \n(2) An inactive run-off company, now called Century Indemnity Company (Century).\nAs a result of the division, predominantly all A&E and certain other liabilities of INA were ascribed to Century and extinguished, as a matter of Pennsylvania law, as liabilities of INA.\nAs part of the Restructuring, most A&E liabilities of various U.S. affiliates of INA were reinsured to Century. Century and certain other run-off companies having A&E and other liabilities were contributed to Brandywine Holdings.\nThe U.S.-based Chubb INA companies assumed two contractual obligations in respect of the Brandywine operations in connection with the Restructuring: a surplus maintenance obligation in the form of the excess of loss (XOL) agreement and a dividend retention fund obligation.\nF-63\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nXOL Agreement\nIn 1996, in connection with the Restructuring, a Chubb INA insurance subsidiary provided reinsurance coverage to Century in the amount of $\n800\n million under an Aggregate Excess of Loss Reinsurance Agreement (XOL Agreement), triggerable if the statutory capital and surplus of Century falls below $\n25\n million or if Century lacks liquid assets with which to pay claims as they become due.\nDividend Retention Fund\nINA Financial Corporation established and funded a dividend retention fund (the Dividend Retention Fund) consisting of $\n50\n million plus investment earnings. The full balance of the Dividend Retention Fund was contributed to Century as of December 31, 2002. Under the Restructuring Order, while any obligation to maintain the Dividend Retention Fund is in effect, to the extent dividends are paid by INA Holdings Corporation to its parent, INA Financial Corporation, and to the extent INA Financial Corporation then pays such dividends to INA Corporation, a portion of those dividends must be withheld to replenish the principal of the Dividend Retention Fund to $\n50\n million. In 2024 and 2023, $\n93\n million and $\n75\n million, respectively, was withheld from such dividends and deposited into the Dividend Retention Fund as a result of dividends paid up to the INA Corporation. Pursuant to a 2011 amendment to the Restructuring Order, capital contributions from the Dividend Retention Fund to Century are not required until the XOL Agreement has less than $\n200\n million of capacity remaining on an incurred basis for statutory reporting purposes. The amount of the required capital contribution shall be the lesser of the amount necessary to restore the XOL Agreement remaining capacity to $\n200\n million or the Dividend Retention Fund balance. In 2024 and 2023, capital contributions of $\n93\n million and $\n75\n million were made, respectively, from the Dividend Retention Fund to Century. The Dividend Retention Fund may not be terminated without prior written approval from the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner.\nIn 2004, Chubb INA contributed $\n100\n million to Century in exchange for a surplus note. After giving effect to the surplus note, contributions from the Dividend Retention Fund, results from operations and other items impacting statutory surplus, the statutory surplus of Century at December 31, 2024, was $\n25\n million and $\n764\n million in statutory-basis losses have been ceded to the XOL Agreement on an inception-to-date basis. The XOL Agreement statutory-basis remaining limit at December 31, 2024, is $\n36\n million. Century reports the amount ceded under the XOL Agreement in accordance with statutory accounting principles, which differ from U.S. GAAP by, among other things, allowing Century to discount its liabilities, including certain asbestos related and environmental pollution liabilities and Century's reinsurance payable to active companies. For U.S. GAAP reporting purposes, intercompany reinsurance recoverables related to the XOL are eliminated upon consolidation.\nWhile Chubb believes it has no legal obligation to fund Century losses above the XOL limit of coverage, Chubb's consolidated results would nevertheless continue to include any losses above the limit of coverage for so long as the Brandywine companies remain consolidated subsidiaries of Chubb.\nCertain active Chubb companies are primarily liable for asbestos, environmental, and other exposures that they have reinsured to Century. Accordingly, if Century were to become insolvent and placed into rehabilitation or liquidation, some or all of the recoverables due to these active Chubb companies from Century could become uncollectible. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate reinsurance recoverables owed by Century to certain active Chubb companies were approximately $\n1.9\n billion and $\n1.8\n billion, respectively, on an undiscounted basis. Chubb believes the active company intercompany reinsurance recoverables, which relate to d\nirect liabilities payable over many years, are not impaired. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Century's carried gross reserves (including reserves assumed from the active Chubb companies) were $\n1.6\n billion and $\n1.7\n billion, respectively. Changes in laws and regulations may have an adverse effect on Century's reserves; for example, the enactment of \"reviver\" statutes relating to claims of sexual molestation may give rise to additional claims that would have been barred by the statutes of limitations in effect at the time of the alleged molestation. Should Century's loss reserves experience adverse development, as a result of such changes or otherwise, in the future and should Century be placed into rehabilitation or liquidation, the reinsurance recoverables due from Century to certain active Chubb companies would be payable only after the payment in full of certain expenses and liabilities, including administrative expense\ns and direct policy liabilities. Thus, the intercompany reinsurance recoverables would be at risk to the extent of the shortage of assets remaining to pay these recoverables.\nWestchester Specialty \n–\n impact of NICO contracts on Chubb’s run-off entities \nAs part of the Westchester Specialty acquisition in 1998, NICO provided a \n75\n percent pro-rata share of $\n1.0\n billion of reinsurance protection on losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred on or before December 31, 1996, in excess of a retention of $\n721\n million. At December 31, 2024, the remaining unused incurred limit under the Westchester NICO agreement was $\n332\n million.\nF-64\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n

No withdrawals, lapses, and mortality improvements are assumed in the projection. GLB-related risks contain conservative mortality and annuitization assumptions.\n    \nExcluded from the table above are MRB gains (losses) of $(\n297\n) million and $(\n334\n) million for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, reported in the Consolidated statements of operations, relating to the market risk benefits' economic hedge and other net cash flows. There is no reinsurance recoverable associated with our liability for MRB.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we completed a review of policyholder behavior related to annuitizations, partial withdrawals, lapses, and mortality for our variable annuity reinsurance business. These refinements resulted in a net increase of approximately $\n87\n million to the MRB fair value, recognized as a Market risk benefits loss. \n•\nWe refreshed our partial withdrawal and annuitization assumptions to include an additional year of experience. The annuitization updates included treaty-based and age-based behavior. \n•\nWe updated the lapse assumptions to include an additional year of experience and refined the lapse rates for policies with guaranteed values far in excess of their account values.\n•\nWe updated the mortality assumptions to include an additional year of experience. \nFor MRB, Chubb estimates fair value using an internal valuation model which includes a number of factors including interest rates, equity markets, credit risk, current account value, market volatility, expected annuitization rates and other policyholder behavior, and changes in policyholder mortality. All reinsurance treaties contain claim limits, which are also factored into the valuation model.\nF-74\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nValuation Technique\nSignificant Unobservable Inputs\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nRanges\nWeighted Average\n(1)\nRanges\nWeighted Average\n(1)\nMRB \n(1)\nActuarial model\nLapse rate\n0.5\n% – \n27.3\n%\n3.4\n \n%\n0.5\n% – \n30.0\n%\n4.0\n \n%\nAnnuitization rate\n0\n% – \n100\n%\n4.5\n \n%\n0\n% – \n100\n%\n4.5\n \n%\n(1)\nThe weighted-average lapse and annuitization rates are determined by weighting each treaty's rates by the MRB contract's fair value.\nThe most significant policyholder behavior assumptions include lapse rates for MRBs, and GLB annuitization rates. Assumptions regarding lapse rates and GLB annuitization rates differ by treaty, but the underlying methodologies to determine rates applied to each treaty are comparable.\nA lapse rate is the percentage of in-force policies surrendered in a given calendar year. All else equal, as lapse rates increase, ultimate claim payments will decrease. In general, the base lapse function assumes low lapse rates during the surrender charge period, followed by a \"spike\" lapse rate in the year immediately following the surrender charge period, and then reverting to an ultimate lapse rate, typically over a 2-year period. This base rate is adjusted downward for policies with more valuable guarantees (policies with guaranteed values far in excess of their account values). Partial withdrawals and the impact of older policyholders with tax-qualified contracts (due to required minimum distributions) are also reflected in our modeling.\nThe GLB annuitization rate is the percentage of policies for which the policyholder will elect to annuitize using the guaranteed benefit provided under the GLB. All else equal, as GLB annuitization rates increase, ultimate claim payments will increase, subject to treaty claim limits. All GLB reinsurance treaties include claim limits to protect Chubb in the event that actual annuitization behavior is significantly higher than expected. In general, Chubb assumes that GLB annuitization rates will be higher for policies with more valuable guarantees (policies with guaranteed values far in excess of their account values). Chubb also assumes that GLB annuitization rates increase as policyholders get older. In addition, it is also assumed that GLB annuitization rates are higher in the first year immediately following the waiting period (the first year the policies are eligible to annuitize using the GLB) in comparison to all subsequent years. Chubb does not yet have fully credible annuitization experience for all clients.\nThe effect of changes in key market factors on assumed lapse and annuitization rates reflect emerging trends using data available from cedants. For treaties with limited experience, rates are established by blending the experience with data received from other ceding companies. The model and related assumptions are regularly re-evaluated by management and enhanced, as appropriate, based upon additional experience obtained related to policyholder behavior and availability of updated information such as market conditions, market participant assumptions, and demographics of in-force annuities.\n 12. \nTaxation\nUnder Swiss law through December 31, 2024, a resident company is subject to income tax at the federal, cantonal, and communal levels that is levied on net worldwide income. Income attributable to permanent establishments or real estate located abroad is excluded from the Swiss tax base. Furthermore, participation relief (i.e., tax relief) is granted to Chubb Limited at the federal, cantonal, and communal level for qualifying dividend income. Chubb Limited is subject to an annual cantonal and communal capital tax on the taxable equity of Chubb Limited in Switzerland.\nChubb has two Swiss operating subsidiaries, an insurance company, Chubb Insurance (Switzerland) Limited and a reinsurance company, Chubb Reinsurance (Switzerland) Limited. Both are subject to federal, cantonal, and communal income tax and to annual cantonal and communal capital tax.\nUnder Bermuda law, Chubb Limited and its Bermuda subsidiaries are not required to pay any taxes on income or capital gains. However, on December 27, 2023, the Government of Bermuda enacted the Corporate Income Tax Act of 2023 which established a 15 percent income tax on net taxable income of Bermuda entities effective January 1, 2025. Chubb's Bermuda subsidiaries will pay taxes on their income beginning in 2025.\nIncome from Chubb's operations at Lloyd's is subject to United Kingdom (U.K.) corporation income taxes. Lloyd's is required to pay U.S. income tax on U.S. connected income written by Lloyd's syndicates. Lloyd's has a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) whereby the amount of tax due on this business is calculated by Lloyd's and remitted directly to the IRS. These amounts are then charged to the accounts of Chubb's Corporate Members in proportion to their participation in the \nF-75\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nrelevant syndicates. Chubb's Corporate Members are subject to this arrangement but, as U.K. domiciled companies, will receive U.K. corporation tax credits for any U.S. income tax incurred up to the value of the equivalent U.K. corporation income tax charge on this income.\nChubb Group Holdings and its respective subsidiaries are subject to income taxes imposed by U.S. authorities and file a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return. Should Chubb Group Holdings pay a dividend to Chubb Limited, withholding taxes would apply. Currently, however, no withholding taxes are accrued with respect to such un-remitted earnings as management has no intention of remitting these earnings. Similarly, no taxes have been provided on the un-remitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries (Chubb Life Insurance Hong Kong and Chubb Life Insurance Korea Company Ltd.) as management has no intention of remitting these earnings. Finally, we have made a partial reinvestment assertion on historical earnings for LINA Life Insurance Company of Korea and Huatai Insurance Group Co., Ltd. The cumulative amount that would be subject to withholding tax, if distributed, as well as the determination of the associated tax liability are not practicable to compute; however, such amount would be material.\nCertain international operations of Chubb are also subject to income taxes imposed by the jurisdictions in which they operate. Chubb's domestic operations are in Switzerland, the jurisdiction where we are legally organized, incorporated, and registered.\nThe following table presents pre-tax income and the related provision for income taxes:\nYear Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nPre-tax income:\n      Switzerland\n$\n121\n \n$\n44\n \n$\n234\n \n      Outside Switzerland\n11,334\n \n9,482\n \n6,251\n \n      Total pre-tax income\n$\n11,455\n \n$\n9,526\n \n$\n6,485\n \nProvision for income taxes\nCurrent tax expense:\n      Switzerland\n$\n29\n \n$\n25\n \n$\n15\n \n      Outside Switzerland\n1,700\n \n1,570\n \n1,066\n \n      Total current tax expense\n1,729\n \n1,595\n \n1,081\n \nDeferred tax expense (benefit):\n      Switzerland\n14\n \n(\n63\n)\n34\n \n      Outside Switzerland\n72\n \n(\n1,021\n)\n124\n \n      Total deferred tax expense (benefit)\n86\n \n(\n1,084\n)\n158\n \nProvision for income taxes\n$\n1,815\n \n$\n511\n \n$\n1,239\n \nThe most significant jurisdictions contributing to the overall taxation of Chubb are calculated using the following rates in 2024: Switzerland \n19.7\n percent, U.S. \n21.0\n percent, U.K. \n25.0\n percent, and Bermuda \n0.0 percent\n.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the difference between the provision for income taxes and the expected tax provision at the Swiss statutory income tax rate:\nYear Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023 \n2022 \nExpected tax provision at Swiss statutory tax rate\n$\n2,251\n \n$\n1,872\n \n$\n1,274\n \nPermanent differences:\nTaxes on earnings subject to rate other than Swiss statutory rate\n(\n510\n)\n(\n389\n)\n(\n243\n)\nBermuda tax law enactment\n(\n55\n)\n(\n1,135\n)\n—\n \nNet withholding taxes\n145\n \n15\n \n75\n \nOther\n(\n16\n)\n148\n \n133\n \nProvision for income taxes\n$\n1,815\n \n$\n511\n \n$\n1,239\n \nF-76\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nCurrent income tax receivable of $\n246\n million and $\n266\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, was recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Adjustments to the valuation allowance are made when there is a change in management's assessment of the amount of deferred tax assets that are realizable.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the tax benefit on certain unrealized capital losses in our investment portfolio was reduced by a valuation allowance of $\n633\n million necessary due to limitations on the utilization of these losses for tax purposes. As part of evaluating whether it was more likely than not that we could record a tax benefit on these losses, we considered realized gains, carryback capacity and available tax planning strategies.\nAt December 31, 2024, Chubb has net operating loss carry-forwards of $\n500\n million which, if unused, will expire starting in 2025, and a U.S. life capital loss carry-forward of $\n26\n million which, if unused, will expire starting in 2028.\nF-77\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits:\nYear Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n \n2023 \nBalance, beginning of year\n$\n73\n \n$\n67\n \nAdditions based on tax positions related to the current year\n1\n \n—\n \nAdditions based on tax positions related to prior years\n57\n \n9\n \nReductions for settlements with taxing authorities\n(\n1\n)\n(\n3\n)\nBalance, end of year\n$\n130\n \n$\n73\n \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the gross unrecognized tax benefits of $\n130\n million and $\n73\n million, respectively, can be reduced by $\n18\n million and $\n19\n million, respectively, associated with foreign tax credits. The net amounts of $\n112\n million and $\n54\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that over the next twelve months, that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change further resulting from the re-evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits arising from examinations by taxing authorities and the lapses of statutes of limitations.\nChubb recognizes accruals for interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in Income tax expense in the Consolidated statements of operations. Tax-related interest expense and penalties reported in the Consolidated statements of operations were $\n6\n million, $\n7\n million, and $\n4\n million at December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Certain subsidiaries of Huatai Group are the investment manager of, and maintain investments in, consolidated investment products that are considered VIEs. Under the consolidation of VIEs, the underlying assets and liabilities of these sponsored investment products are recorded at 100 percent within the Consolidated balance sheets, with the relevant amounts attributable to investors other than Chubb reflected as Noncontrolling interests. At December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, approximately $\n815\n million and $\n1.0\n billion of repurchase agreements were from VIEs, respectively. Refer to Note 1 g) to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nb) Short-term debt\nShort-term debt comprises the current maturities of our long-term debt instruments described below. These short-term debt instruments were reclassified from long-term debt and are reflected in the table above.\nc) Long-term debt\nW\nith the exception of the $\n100\n million of \n8.875\n percent debentures due August 2029, which do not have an early redemption option, the senior notes in the table above are redeemable at any time at Chubb INA's option subject to a “make-whole” premium plus additional basis points as defined in the table above. A \"make-whole\" premium is the present value of the remaining principal and interest discounted at the applicable U.S. Treasury rate. These debt securities are also redeemable at par plus accrued and unpaid interest in the event of certain changes in tax law.\nThe senior notes and debentures do not have the benefit of any sinking fund, are guaranteed on a senior basis by Chubb Limited, and rank equally with all of Chubb's other senior obligations. They also contain customary limitations on lien provisions as well as customary events of default provisions which, if breached, could result in the accelerated maturity of such senior debt.\nd) Hybrid debt\nTrust preferred securities\nIn March 2000, ACE Capital Trust II, a Delaware statutory business trust, publicly issued $\n300\n million of \n9.7\n percent Capital Securities (the Capital Securities) due to mature in April 2030. At the same time, Chubb INA purchased $\n9.2\n million of common securities of ACE Capital Trust II. The sole assets of ACE Capital Trust II consist of $\n309\n million principal amount of \n9.7\n percent Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debentures (the Subordinated Debentures) issued by Chubb INA due to mature in April 2030.\nDistributions on the Capital Securities are payable semi-annually and may be deferred for up to ten consecutive semi-annual periods (but no later than April 1, 2030). Any deferred payments would accrue interest compounded semi-annually if Chubb INA defers interest on the Subordinated Debentures. Interest on the Subordinated Debentures is payable semi-annually. Chubb INA may defer such interest payments (but no later than April 1, 2030), with such deferred payments accruing interest compounded semi-annually. The Capital Securities and the ACE Capital Trust II Common Securities will be redeemed upon repayment of the Subordinated Debentures.\nChubb Limited has guaranteed, on a subordinated basis, Chubb INA's obligations under the Subordinated Debentures, and distributions and other payments due on the Capital Securities. These guarantees, when taken together with Chubb's obligations under expense agreements entered into with ACE Capital Trust II, provide a full and unconditional guarantee of amounts due on the Capital Securities.\nHuatai Life capital supplementary bonds\nIn November 2024, Huatai Life issued \n800\n million Chinese yuan renminbi ($\n111\n million based on the foreign exchange rate at the date of issuance) of \n2.90\n percent capital supplementary bonds (Bonds), due November 2034. The Bonds will be subordinated to Huatai Life’s policy and general liabilities, are redeemable in November 2029, if certain conditions are met, and are guaranteed by Huatai Group. Principal or interest payments on the Bonds may be deferred if such payments would reduce Huatai Life's solvency adequacy ratio below a required minimum.\n \nF-80\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\n14. \nCommitments, contingencies, and guarantees\na) Derivative instruments\nChubb maintains positions in derivative instruments such as futures, options, swaps, and foreign currency forward contracts for which the primary purposes are to manage duration and foreign currency exposure, yield enhancement, or to obtain an exposure to a particular financial market. Chubb also maintains positions in convertible securities that contain embedded derivatives, and exchange-traded equity futures contracts on equity market indices to limit equity exposure in the market risk benefit (MRB) book of business. Derivative instruments are principally recorded in either Other assets (OA) or Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities (AP) in the Consolidated balance sheets. Convertible securities are recorded in either Fixed maturities available-for-sale (FM AFS) or Equity securities (ES), depending on the underlying investment. These are the most numerous and frequent derivative transactions. In addition, Chubb, from time to time, purchases to be announced mortgage-backed securities (TBAs) as part of its investing activities.\nAs a global company, Chubb entities transact business in multiple currencies. Our policy is to generally match assets, liabilities, and required capital for each individual jurisdiction in local currency, which would include the use of derivatives discussed below. Some of Chubb's derivatives satisfy hedge accounting requirements, as discussed below. We also consider economic hedging for planned cross border transactions.\nThe following table presents the balance sheet location, fair value in an asset or (liability) position, and notional value/payment provision of our derivative instruments:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nConsolidated\nBalance Sheet\nLocation\nFair Value\nNotional\nValue/\nPayment\nProvision\nFair Value\nNotional\nValue/\nPayment\nProvision\nDerivative Asset   \nDerivative  (Liability) \nDerivative Asset   \nDerivative    (Liability) \n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nInvestment and embedded derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:\nForeign currency forward contracts\nOA / (AP)\n$\n41\n \n$\n(\n295\n)\n$\n3,959\n \n$\n27\n \n$\n(\n94\n)\n$\n3,662\n \nOptions/Futures contracts on notes and bonds\nOA / (AP)\n—\n \n(\n8\n)\n449\n \n27\n \n(\n42\n)\n2,062\n \nConvertible securities \n(1)\nFM AFS / ES\n12\n \n—\n \n12\n \n56\n \n—\n \n64\n \nTotal\n$\n53\n \n$\n(\n303\n)\n$\n4,420\n \n$\n110\n \n$\n(\n136\n)\n$\n5,788\n \nOther derivative instruments:\nFutures contracts on equities \n(2)\nOA / (AP)\n$\n35\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,047\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n37\n)\n$\n1,157\n \nOther\nOA / (AP)\n—\n \n(\n2\n)\n211\n \n—\n \n(\n5\n)\n217\n \nTotal\n$\n35\n \n$\n(\n2\n)\n$\n1,258\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n42\n)\n$\n1,374\n \nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:\nCross-currency swaps - fair value hedges\nOA / (AP)\n$\n103\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,579\n \n$\n126\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n1,631\n \nCross-currency swaps - net investment hedges\nOA / (AP)\n43\n \n(\n116\n)\n2,896\n \n10\n \n(\n128\n)\n1,619\n \nTotal\n$\n146\n \n$\n(\n116\n)\n$\n4,475\n \n$\n136\n \n$\n(\n128\n)\n$\n3,250\n \n(1)\nIncludes fair value of embedded derivatives.\n(2)\nRelated to MRB book of business.\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, net derivative liabilities of $\n199\n million and $\n115\n million, respectively, included in the table above were subject to a master netting agreement. The remaining derivatives included in the table above were not subject to a master netting agreement.\nF-81\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nb) Hedge accounting\nWe designate certain derivatives as fair value hedges and net investment hedges for accounting purposes to hedge foreign currency exposure associated with portions of our euro denominated debt and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries, respectively. These derivatives comprise cross-currency swaps, which are agreements under which two counterparties exchange interest payments and principal denominated in different currencies at a future date. These hedges have been and are expected to be highly effective.\n(i) Cross-currency swaps - fair value hedges\nChubb holds certain cross-currency swaps designated as fair value hedges. The objective of these cross-currency swaps is to hedge the foreign currency risk on €\n1.5\n billion, or approximately $\n1.6\n billion at December 31, 2024, of euro denominated debt by converting cash flows back into the U.S. dollar.\nThese hedges are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI). The gains or losses on the fair value hedges offsetting the foreign currency remeasurement on the hedged euro denominated senior notes are reclassified from OCI into Net realized gains (losses), and an additional portion is reclassified into Interest expense as follows:\nYear Ended December 31\n(pre-tax, in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\nGain (loss) recognized in OCI\n$\n(\n38\n)\n$\n101\n \nNet realized gain (loss) reclassified from OCI\n(\n103\n)\n50\n \nInterest expense reclassified from OCI\n(\n15\n)\n(\n16\n)\nOCI gain (loss) after reclassifications\n$\n80\n \n$\n67\n \n(ii) Cross-currency swaps - net investment hedges\nChubb holds certain cross-currency swaps designated as net investment hedges. The objective of these cross-currency swaps is to hedge the foreign currency exposure in the net investments of certain foreign subsidiaries by converting cash flows from U.S. dollar to the British pound sterling, Japanese yen, Swiss fr\nanc, and Chinese yuan renminbi. The hedge\nd risk is designated as the foreign currency exposure arising between the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary and the functional currency of its parent entity.\nThese net investment hedges are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in Cumulative translation adjustments (CTA) within OCI, and a portion reclassified to Interest expense. The mark-to-market adjustments for foreign currency changes will remain in CTA until the underlying hedge subsidiary is deconsolidated or hedge accounting is discontinued.\nYear Ended December 31\n(pre-tax, in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\nGain (loss) recognized in OCI\n$\n58\n \n$\n(\n58\n)\nInterest income reclassified from OCI\n19\n \n13\n \nOCI gain (loss) after reclassifications\n$\n39\n \n$\n(\n71\n)\nF-82\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nc) Derivative instruments not designated as hedges \nDerivative instruments which are not designated as hedges are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in \nNet realized gains (losses) or, for futures contracts on equities related to the MRB book of business, in Market risk benefits gains (losses)\n in the Consolidated statements of operations. \nThe following table presents net gains (losses) related to derivative instrument activity in the Consolidated statements of operations:\nYear Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nInvestment and embedded derivative instruments:\nForeign currency forward contracts\n$\n(\n213\n)\n$\n(\n50\n)\n$\n(\n339\n)\nOptions/Futures contracts on notes and bonds\n22\n \n(\n2\n)\n297\n \nConvertible securities \n(1)\n2\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n1\n)\nTotal investment and embedded derivative instruments\n$\n(\n189\n)\n$\n(\n53\n)\n$\n(\n43\n)\nOther derivative instruments:\nFutures contracts on equities \n(2)\n(\n165\n)\n(\n189\n)\n187\n \nOther\n(\n4\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n11\n)\nTotal other derivative instruments\n$\n(\n169\n)\n$\n(\n199\n)\n$\n176\n \nTotal\n$\n(\n358\n)\n$\n(\n252\n)\n$\n133\n \n(1)\nIncludes embedded derivatives.\n(2)\nRelated to MRB book of business.\n \n(i) Foreign currency exposure management\nA foreign currency forward contract (forward) is an agreement between participants to exchange specific currencies at a future date. \nChubb\n uses forwards to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies as discussed above.\n(ii) Duration management and market exposure\nFutures\nFutures contracts give the holder the right and obligation to participate in market movements, determined by the index or underlying security on which the futures contract is based. Settlement is made daily in cash by an amount equal to the change in value of the futures contract times a multiplier that scales the size of the contract. Exchange-traded futures contracts on money market instruments, notes, and bonds are used in fixed maturity portfolios to more efficiently manage duration, as substitutes for ownership of the money market instruments, bonds, and notes without significantly increasing the risk in the portfolio. Investments in futures contracts may be made only to the extent that there are assets under management not otherwise committed.\nExchange-traded equity futures contracts are used to limit exposure to a severe equity market decline, which would cause an increase in expected claims and, therefore, an increase in market risk benefit reserves.\nOptions\nAn option contract conveys to the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase or sell a specified amount or value of an underlying security at a fixed price. Option contracts are used in our investment portfolio as protection against unexpected shifts in interest rates, which would affect the duration of the fixed maturity portfolio. By using options in the portfolio, the overall interest rate sensitivity of the portfolio can be reduced. Option contracts may also be used as an alternative to futures contracts in the synthetic strategy as described above.\nThe price of an option is influenced by the underlying security, level of interest rates, expected volatility, time to expiration, and supply and demand.\nThe credit risk associated with the above derivative financial instruments relates to the potential for non-performance by counterparties. Although non-performance is not anticipated, in order to minimize the risk of loss, management monitors the creditworthiness of its counterparties and obtains collateral. The performance of exchange-traded instruments is guaranteed by the exchange on which they trade. For non-exchange-traded instruments, the counterparties are principally banks which must meet certain criteria according to our investment guidelines.\nF-83\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nOther\nIncluded within Other are derivatives intended to reduce potential losses which may arise from certain exposures in our insurance business. The economic benefit provided by these derivatives is similar to purchased reinsurance. For example, \nChubb may,\n from time to time, enter into crop derivative contracts to protect underwriting results in the event of a significant decline in commodity prices.\n(iii) Convertible security investments\nA convertible security is a debt instrument or preferred stock that can be converted into a predetermined amount of the issuer’s equity. The convertible option is an embedded derivative within the host instruments which are classified in the investment portfolio as either available-for-sale or as an equity security. \nChubb\n purchases convertible securities for their total return and not specifically for the conversion feature.\n(iv) TBA\nBy acquiring to be announced mortgage-backed securities (TBAs), we make a commitment to purchase a future issuance of mortgage-backed securities. For the period between purchase of the TBAs and issuance of the underlying security, we account for our position as a derivative in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Chubb purchases TBAs, from time to time, both for their total return and for the flexibility they provide related to our mortgage-backed security strategy.\n(v) Futures contracts on equities\nUnder the MRB program, as the assuming entity, Chubb is obligated to provide coverage until the expiration or maturity of the underlying deferred annuity contracts or the expiry of the reinsurance treaty. We may recognize a loss for changes in fair value due to adverse changes in the capital markets (e.g., declining interest rates and/or declining U.S. and/or international equity markets). To mitigate adverse changes in the capital markets, we maintain positions in exchange-traded equity futures contracts, as noted under section \"(ii) Futures\" above. These futures increase in fair value when the S&P 500 index decreases (and decrease in fair value when the S&P 500 index increases). The net impact of gains or losses related to changes in fair value of the MRB liability and the exchange-traded equity futures are included in Market risk benefits gains (losses) in the Consolidated statements of operations.\nd) Securities lending and secured borrowings\nChubb participates in a securities lending program operated by a third-party banking institution whereby certain assets are loaned to qualified borrowers and from which we earn an incremental return. The securities lending collateral can only be drawn down by Chubb in the event that the institution borrowing the securities is in default under the lending agreement. An indemnification agreement with the lending agent protects us in the event a borrower becomes insolvent or fails to return any of the securities on loan. \nThe collateral is recorded in Securities lending collateral and the liability is recorded in Securities lending payable in the Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of collateral held under securities lending agreements by investment category and remaining contractual maturity of the underlying agreements:\nRemaining contractual maturity\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nOvernight and Continuous\nCollateral held under securities lending agreements:\nCash\n$\n557\n \n$\n555\n \nU.S. Treasury / Agency\n145\n \n33\n \nNon-U.S.\n663\n \n621\n \nCorporate and asset-backed securities\n49\n \n57\n \nMunicipal\n3\n \n6\n \nEquity securities\n28\n \n27\n \nTotal\n$\n1,445\n \n$\n1,299\n \nGross amount of recognized liability for securities lending payable\n$\n1,445\n \n$\n1,299\n \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, our repurchase agreement obligations of $\n2,731\n million and $\n2,833\n million, respectively, were fully collateralized.

With collateral that we pledge, there is a risk that the collateral may not be returned at the expiration of the agreement. If the counterparty fails to return the collateral, Chubb will have free use of the borrowed funds until our collateral is returned. In addition, we may encounter the risk that Chubb may not be able to renew outstanding borrowings with a new term or with an existing counterparty due to market conditions including a decrease in demand as well as more restrictive terms from banks due to increased regulatory and capital constraints. Should this condition occur, Chubb may seek alternative borrowing sources or reduce borrowings. Additionally, increased margins and collateral requirements due to market conditions would increase our restricted assets as we are required to provide additional collateral to support the transaction.\ne) Concentrations of credit risk\nOur investment portfolio is managed following prudent standards of diversification. Specific provisions limit the allowable holdings of a single issue and issuer. We believe that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk associated with our investments. Our three largest corporate exposures by issuer at December 31, 2024, were Bank of America Corp, Morgan Stanley, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Our largest exposure by industry at December 31, 2024, was financial services.\nWe market our insurance and reinsurance worldwide primarily through insurance and reinsurance brokers. We assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers with whom we transact business. Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. generated or placed approximately \n11\n percent of our gross premiums written for each of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. This entity is a large, well-established company, and there are no indications that it is financially troubled at December 31, 2024. No other broker or one insured \naccounted for more than 10 percent\n of our gross premiums written for these years.\nf) Fixed maturities\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, commitments to purchase fixed income securities over the next several years were approximately $\n1.3\n billion and $\n1.0\n billion, respectively.\ng) Private equities\nPrivate equities in the Consolidated balance sheets are investments in limited partnerships and partially-owned investment companies. At December 31, 2024, private equities with a carrying value of $\n14.5\n billion had commitments that could require funding of up to $\n6.4\n billion over the next several years. At December 31, 2023, these investments had a carrying value of $\n13.9\n billion with commitments of up to $\n6.2\n billion. The remaining private equities had no funding commitments.\nF-85\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nh) Letters of credit\nWe have access to capital markets and to credit facilities with letter of credit (LOC) capacity of \n$\n4.1\n billion\n, \n$\n3.0\n billion\n of which can be used for revolving credit. Our existing credit facilities have remaining terms expiring through December 2028, including our \n$\n3.0\n billion\n group syndicated credit facility expiring in October 2027. Our LOC usage was \n$\n978\n million and $\n948\n million a\nt \nDecember 31, 2024 and 2023\n, respectively.\ni) Legal proceedings\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to claims litigation involving disputed interpretations of policy coverages and, in some jurisdictions, direct actions by allegedly-injured persons seeking damages from policyholders. These lawsuits, involving claims on policies issued by our subsidiaries which are typical to the insurance industry in general and in the normal course of business, are considered in our loss and loss expense reserves. In addition to claims litigation, we are subject to lawsuits and regulatory actions in the normal course of business that do not arise from or directly relate to claims on insurance policies. This category of business litigation typically involves, among other things, allegations of underwriting errors or misconduct, employment claims, regulatory activity, or disputes arising from our business ventures. In the opinion of management, our ultimate liability for these matters could be, but we believe is not likely to be, material to our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nj) Lease commitments\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the right-of-use asset was $\n824\n million and $\n784\n million, respectively, recorded within \nOther assets,\n and the lease liability was $\n942\n million and $\n832\n million, respectively, recorded within \nAccounts payable, accrued expenses\n, and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets. These leases consist principally of real estate operating leases that are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, which expire at various dates. As of December 31, 2024, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for the operating leases was \n13.3\n years and \n4.6\n percent, respectively. Rent expense was $\n214\n million, $\n181\n million, and $\n161\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nFuture minimum lease payments under the operating leases are expected to be as follows:\nFor the years ending December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nUndiscounted cash flows:\n2025\n$\n178\n \n2026\n154\n \n2027\n117\n \n2028\n90\n \n2029\n74\n \nThereafter\n759\n \nTotal undiscounted lease payments\n$\n1,372\n \nLess: Present value adjustment\n430\n \nNet lease liabilities reported as of December 31, 2024\n$\n942\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, we have a lease commitment for office space that is not yet recorded on our Consolidated balance sheet and is not included in the total obligations referenced above.

Though the par value of Common Shares is stated in Swiss francs, Chubb continues to use U.S. dollars as its reporting currency for preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements. Under Swiss corporate law, we are generally prohibited from issuing Common Shares below their par value. If there were a need to raise common equity at a time when the trading price of Chubb's Common Shares is below par value, we would need in advance to obtain shareholder approval to decrease the par value of the Common Shares. \nDividend approval\nAt our May 2024 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $\n3.64\n per share, expected to be paid in four quarterly installments of $\n0.91\n per share after the annual general meeting by way of distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment. The Board of Directors (Board) will determine the record and payment dates at which the annual dividend may be paid until the date of the 2025 annual general meeting, and is authorized to abstain from distributing a dividend at its discretion. The first three quarterly installments each of $\n0.91\n per share, have been distributed by the Board as expected.\nAt our May 2023 and 2022 annual general meetings, our shareholders approved annual dividends for the following year of up to $\n3.44\n per share and $\n3.32\n per share, respectively, which were paid in four quarterly installments of $\n0.86\n per share and $\n0.83\n per share, respectively, at dates determined by the Board after the annual general meeting by way of a distribution from capital contribution reserves, transferred to free reserves for payment.\nDividend distributions\nUnder Swiss corporate law, dividends must be stated in Swiss francs though dividend payments are made by Chubb in U.S. dollars.

Under the Amended 2016 LTIP, Common Shares of Chubb are authorized to be issued pursuant to awards, including incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, performance stock units, restricted stock, and restricted stock units. Under the Chubb Deferred Stock Unit Plan, a sub-plan of the Amended 2016 LTIP, eligible participants may defer vested performance stock units and restricted stock units to the extent such awards are U.S.-allocated compensation. \nChubb principally issues restricted stock grants and stock options on a graded vesting schedule, with equal percentages of the award subject to vesting over a number of years (typically three or four). Chubb recognizes compensation cost for vesting of restricted stock and stock option grants with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award were, in-substance, multiple awards. We incorporate an estimate of future forfeitures in determining compensation cost for both grants of restricted stock and stock options.\nIn addition, Chubb grants performance-based restricted stock as performance shares and performance stock units to certain executives that vest based on certain performance criteria as compared to a defined group of peer companies. Performance shares and performance stock units comprise both target and premium awards that cliff vest at the end of a \n3\n-year performance period based on both Chubb tangible book value (Chubb shareholders' equity less goodwill and intangible assets attributable to Chubb, net of tax) per share growth and P&C combined ratio compared to a defined group of peer companies. Premium awards are subject to an additional vesting provision based on total shareholder return (TSR) compared to the peer group. Performance shares and performance stock units representing target awards and premium awards are issued when the awards are approved and are subject to forfeiture if applicable performance criteria are not met at the end of the \n3\n-year performance period. Chubb recognizes compensation cost for performance-based restricted stock when we conclude that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved.\nUnder the Amended 2016 LTIP, \n32,900,000\n Common Shares are authorized to be issued (which includes all shares available for delivery since the establishment of the Chubb Limited 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2016). This is in addition to any shares subject to awards outstanding under the ACE Limited 2004 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2004 LTIP) immediately prior to the effective date of the Amended 2016 LTIP that are forfeited, expired or canceled after such effective date without delivery of shares (or which result in forfeiture of shares back to Chubb). At December 31, 2024, a total of \n10,072,965\n shares remain available for future issuance under the Amended 2016 LTIP, which includes shares forfeited, expired or canceled relating to grants under the 2004 LTIP.\nUnder the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), \n9,000,000\n shares are authorized to be issued. At December 31, 2024, a total of \n2,738,105\n shares remain available for issuance under the ESPP.\nChubb generally issues Common Shares for the exercise of stock options, restricted stock, and purchases under the ESPP from Common Shares in treasury.\nThe following table presents pre-tax and after-tax share-based compensation expense:\nYear Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStock options and shares issued under ESPP:\nPre-tax\n$\n83\n \n$\n71\n \n$\n60\n \nAfter-tax \n(1)\n$\n49\n \n$\n56\n \n$\n38\n \nRestricted stock:\nPre-tax\n$\n274\n \n$\n253\n \n$\n230\n \nAfter-tax \n(1)\n$\n210\n \n$\n202\n \n$\n179\n \n(1)\nThe windfall tax benefit recorded to Income tax expense in the Consolidated statement of operations was $\n42\n million, $\n19\n million, and $\n29\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n \nF-91\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nUnrecognized compensation expense related to the unvested portion of Chubb's employee share-based awards of restricted stock, restricted stock units, and stock options was $\n400\n million at December 31, 2024, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately \n1.5\n years. \n \nStock options\nBoth incentive and non-qualified stock options are principally granted at an option price per share equal to the grant date fair value of Chubb's Common Shares. Stock options are generally granted with a \n3\n-year vesting period and a \n10\n-year term. Stock options vest in equal annual installments over the respective vesting period, which is also the requisite service period.  \nChubb's 2024 share-based compensation expense includes a portion of the cost related to the 2021 through 2024 stock option grants. Stock option fair value was estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model that uses the weighted-average assumptions noted below: \nYear Ended December 31\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDividend yield\n1.4\n \n%\n1.7\n \n%\n1.7\n \n%\nExpected volatility\n22.0\n \n%\n23.0\n \n%\n20.1\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rate\n4.3\n \n%\n4.1\n \n%\n1.9\n \n%\nExpected life\n5.7\n years\n5.7\n years\n5.8\n years\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Restricted stock and restricted stock units are principally granted at market close price on the day of grant. Each service-based restricted stock unit and performance stock unit represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one Common Share upon vesting (or the end of the deferral period, if the unit is under the Chubb Deferred Stock Unit Plan).\nChubb also grants restricted stock awards to non-management directors which vest at the following year's annual general meeting. \nChubb's 2024 share-based compensation expense includes a portion of the cost related to the restricted stock granted in the years 2020 through 2024.\nThe following table presents a roll-forward of our restricted stock awards and restricted stock units.

Delivery of Common Shares on account of these restricted stock units to non-management directors is deferred until after the date of the non-management directors' termination from the Board. Legacy Chubb Corp historically allowed directors and certain key employees of Chubb Corp and its subsidiaries to defer a portion of their compensation earned with respect to services performed in the form of deferred stock units. In addition, legacy Chubb Corp provided supplemental retirement benefits for certain employees through its Defined Contribution Excess Benefit Plan in the form of deferred shares of stock. The minimum vesting period under these legacy Chubb Corp deferred plans was \n1\n-year and the maximum was \n3\n-years. Employees and directors had the option to elect to receive their awards at a future specified date or upon their termination of service with Chubb. At December 31, 2024, there were \n97,982\n deferred restricted stock units.\nF-93\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nESPP \nThe ESPP gives participating employees the right to purchase Common Shares through payroll deductions during consecutive subscription periods at a purchase price of \n85\n percent of the fair value of a Common Share on the exercise date (Purchase Price). Annual purchases by participants are limited to the number of whole shares that can be purchased by an amount equal to \nten\n percent of the participant's compensation or $\n25,000\n, whichever is less. The ESPP has two six-month subscription periods each year, the first of which runs between January 1 and June 30 and the second of which runs between July 1 and December 31. The amounts collected from participants during a subscription period are used on the exercise date to purchase full shares of Common Shares. An exercise date is generally the last trading day of a subscription period. The number of shares purchased is equal to the total amount, at the exercise date, collected from the participants through payroll deductions for that subscription period, divided by the Purchase Price, rounded down to the next full share. Participants may withdraw from an offering before the exercise date and obtain a refund of amounts withheld through payroll deductions. Pursuant to the provisions of the ESPP, during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, employees paid $\n61\n million, $\n54\n million, and $\n48\n million to purchase \n272,350\n shares, \n305,604\n shares, and \n271,650\n shares, respectively.\n17. \nPostretirement benefits\nChubb provides postretirement benefits to eligible employees and their dependents through various defined contribution plans sponsored by Chubb. In addition, for certain employees, Chubb sponsors other postretirement benefit plans and defined benefit pension plans.\n \nDefined contribution plans (including 401(k))\nUnder these plans, employees' contributions may be supplemented by Chubb matching contributions based on the level of employee contribution. These contributions are invested at the election of each employee in one or more of several investment portfolios offered by a third-party investment advisor. Expenses for these plans totaled $\n298\n million, $\n283\n million, and $\n230\n million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nDefined benefit pension plans\nWe maintain non-contributory defined benefit pension plans that cover certain employees located in the U.S., U.K., Canada, and various other statutorily required countries. We account for pension benefits using the accrual method. Benefits under these plans are based on employees' years of service and compensation during final years of service. All underlying plans are subject to periodic actuarial valuations by qualified actuarial firms using actuarial models to calculate the expense and liability for each plan. We use December 31 as the measurement date for our defined benefit pension plans. \nUnder the Chubb Corp plans, prior to 2001, benefits were generally based on an employee’s years of service and average compensation during the last five years of employment. Effective January 1, 2001, the formula for providing pension benefits was changed from the final average pay formula to a cash balance formula. Under the cash balance formula, a notional account is established for each employee, which is credited semi-annually with an amount equal to a percentage of eligible compensation based on age and years of service plus interest based on the account balance. Chubb Corp employees hired prior to 2001 will generally be eligible to receive vested benefits based on the higher of the final average pay or cash balance formulas.\nOther postretirement benefit plans\nOur assumption of Chubb Corp's other postretirement benefit plans, principally healthcare and life insurance, covers retired employees, their beneficiaries, and covered dependents. Healthcare coverage is contributory. Retiree contributions vary based upon the retiree’s age, type of coverage, and years of service requirements. Life insurance coverage is non-contributory. Chubb funds a portion of the healthcare benefits obligation where such funding can be accomplished on a tax-effective basis. Benefits are paid as covered expenses are incurred. We use December 31 as the measurement date for our postretirement benefit plans.\nAmendments to U.S. qualified and excess pension plans and U.S. retiree healthcare plan\nIn 2016, we harmonized and amended several of our U.S. retirement programs to create a unified retirement savings program. The amendments required a remeasurement of the plan assets and benefit obligations with updated assumptions, including discount rates and the expected return on assets. In 2020, we transitioned from a traditional defined benefit pension program that had been in effect for certain employees to a defined contribution program. Additionally, after 2025, we plan to eliminate a subsidized U.S. retiree healthcare and life insurance plan that is currently in place for certain employees. \nF-94\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nObligations and funded status\nThe funded status of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans as well as the amounts recognized in the Consolidated balance sheets and Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) at December 31, 2024 and 2023, was as follows:\nPension Benefit Plans\nOther Postretirement\nBenefit Plans\n2024\n2023\n2024\n2023\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\nU.S. Plans\nNon-U.S. Plans\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nBenefit obligation, beginning of year\n$\n2,833\n \n$\n743\n \n$\n2,781\n \n$\n697\n \n$\n36\n \n$\n43\n \n   Service cost\n—\n \n9\n \n—\n \n7\n \n1\n \n—\n \n   Interest cost\n134\n \n36\n \n138\n \n36\n \n2\n \n2\n \n   Actuarial loss (gain)\n(\n162\n)\n(\n54\n)\n82\n \n29\n \n(\n2\n)\n2\n \n   Benefits paid\n(\n151\n)\n(\n37\n)\n(\n168\n)\n(\n38\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n12\n)\n   Amendments\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n   Curtailments\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n   Settlements\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n5\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n   Foreign currency revaluation and other \n—\n \n(\n14\n)\n—\n \n17\n \n(\n2\n)\n1\n \nBenefit obligation, end of year\n$\n2,654\n \n$\n684\n \n$\n2,833\n \n$\n743\n \n$\n25\n \n$\n36\n \nPlan assets at fair value, beginning of year\n$\n3,589\n \n$\n986\n \n$\n3,316\n \n$\n938\n \n$\n69\n \n$\n81\n \n   Actual return on plan assets\n243\n \n12\n \n417\n \n57\n \n3\n \n4\n \n   Employer contributions\n6\n \n13\n \n24\n \n15\n \n—\n \n1\n \n   Benefits paid\n(\n151\n)\n(\n37\n)\n(\n168\n)\n(\n38\n)\n(\n10\n)\n(\n17\n)\n   Settlements\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \n(\n8\n)\n—\n \n—\n \n   Foreign currency revaluation and other\n—\n \n(\n9\n)\n—\n \n22\n \n—\n \n—\n \nPlan assets at fair value, end of year\n$\n3,687\n \n$\n965\n \n$\n3,589\n \n$\n986\n \n$\n62\n \n$\n69\n \nFunded status at end of year\n$\n1,033\n \n$\n281\n \n$\n756\n \n$\n243\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n33\n \nAmounts recognized in the Consolidated balance sheets:\nAssets\n$\n1,074\n \n$\n335\n \n$\n801\n \n$\n300\n \n$\n57\n \n$\n54\n \nLiabilities\n(\n41\n)\n(\n54\n)\n(\n45\n)\n(\n57\n)\n(\n20\n)\n(\n21\n)\nTotal\n$\n1,033\n \n$\n281\n \n$\n756\n \n$\n243\n \n$\n37\n \n$\n33\n \nAmounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss), pre-tax, not yet recognized in net periodic cost (benefit):\nNet actuarial loss (gain)\n$\n(\n563\n)\n$\n11\n \n$\n(\n404\n)\n$\n29\n \n$\n(\n11\n)\n$\n(\n10\n)\nPrior service cost (benefit)\n—\n \n8\n \n—\n \n8\n \n(\n3\n)\n(\n4\n)\nTotal\n$\n(\n563\n)\n$\n19\n \n$\n(\n404\n)\n$\n37\n \n$\n(\n14\n)\n$\n(\n14\n)\nFor the U.S. pension plans, the $\n162\n million actuarial gain and $\n82\n million actuarial loss experienced in 2024 and 2023, respectively, were principally driven by the change in discount rates.

objective of the pension plan is to provide sufficient funding to cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent level of portfolio risk. The assets of the pension plan are invested, either directly or through pooled funds, in a diversified portfolio of predominately equity securities and fixed maturities. We seek to obtain a rate of return that over time equals or exceeds the returns of the broad markets in which the plan assets are invested. The target allocation of U.S. plan assets is \n55\n percent to \n65\n percent invested in equity securities (including certain other investments measured using NAV), with the remainder primarily invested in fixed maturities and private equity investments. The target allocation of non-U.S. plans varies by country, but the plan assets are principally invested in fixed maturities. We rebalance our pension assets to the target allocation as market conditions permit. We determined the expected long-term rate of return assumption for each asset class based on an analysis of the historical returns and the expectations for future returns. The expected long-term rate of return for the portfolio is a weighted aggregation of the expected returns for each asset class. \nIn order to minimize risk, the Plan maintains a listing of permissible and prohibited investments. In addition, the Plan has certain concentration limits and investment quality requirements imposed on permissible investments options. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis. \nThe following tables present the fair values of the pension plan assets, by valuation hierarchy. For additional information on how we classify these assets within the valuation hierarchy, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDecember 31, 2024\nPension Benefit Plans\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nU.S. Plans:\nShort-term investments\n$\n59\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n59\n \nU.S. Treasury / Agency\n453\n \n88\n \n—\n \n541\n \nNon-U.S. and corporate bonds\n—\n \n593\n \n—\n \n593\n \nMunicipal\n—\n \n6\n \n—\n \n6\n \nEquity securities\n1,547\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,547\n \nInvestment derivative instruments\n1\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \nTotal U.S. Plan assets \n(1)\n$\n2,060\n \n$\n687\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,747\n \nNon-U.S. Plans:\nShort-term investments\n$\n22\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n22\n \nNon-U.S. and corporate bonds\n—\n \n435\n \n—\n \n435\n \nEquity securities\n38\n \n225\n \n5\n \n268\n \nTotal Non-U.S. Plan assets\n (1)\n$\n60\n \n$\n660\n \n$\n5\n \n$\n725\n \n(1)\nExcluded from the table above are $\n714\n million and $\n222\n million of other investments related to the U.S. Plans and Non-U.S. Plans, respectively, private equities of $\n223\n million and $\n18\n million in U.S. Plans and Non-U.S. Plans, respectively, measured using NAV as a practical expedient, and $\n3\n million in cash and accrued income related to the U.S. Plans.\nF-99\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2023\nPension Benefit Plans\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nU.S. Plans:\nShort-term investments\n$\n45\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n45\n \nU.S. Treasury / Agency\n470\n \n86\n \n—\n \n556\n \nNon-U.S. and corporate bonds\n—\n \n637\n \n—\n \n637\n \nMunicipal\n—\n \n6\n \n—\n \n6\n \nEquity securities\n1,466\n \n—\n \n—\n \n1,466\n \nInvestment derivative instruments\n5\n \n—\n \n—\n \n5\n \nTotal U.S. Plan assets \n(1)\n$\n1,986\n \n$\n729\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n2,715\n \nNon-U.S. Plans:\nShort-term investments\n$\n7\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n7\n \nNon-U.S. and corporate bonds\n—\n \n457\n \n—\n \n457\n \nEquity securities\n63\n \n211\n \n4\n \n278\n \nTotal Non-U.S. Plan assets \n(1)\n$\n70\n \n$\n668\n \n$\n4\n \n$\n742\n \n(1)\nExcluded from the table above are $\n634\n million and $\n227\n million of other investments related to the U.S. Plans and Non-U.S. Plans, respectively, private equities of $\n224\n million and $\n17\n million in U.S. Plans and Non-U.S. Plans, respectively, measured using NAV as a practical expedient, and $\n16\n million in cash and accrued income related to the U.S. Plans.\nAt December 31, 2024, the other postretirement benefit plan had $\n62\n million of plan assets, of which $\n23\n million of fixed maturities were categorized as Level 2, and $\n39\n million of other investments were measured using NAV as a practical expedient.

These segments distribute their products through various forms of brokers, agen\ncies, and direct marketing programs. All business segments have established relationships with reinsurance intermediaries. Effective July 1, 2023, the results of Huatai’s life and asset management businesses, included within the Life Insurance segment, and the results of Huatai’s P&C insurance business, included within Overseas General Insurance, are presented gross within Underwriting income (loss), Net investment income (loss), and Other income (expense) as required under consolidation accounting. Huatai’s results prior to July 1, 2023, were included net within Other (income) expense based on our ownership interest as required under equity method accounting. Effective July 1, 2022, the results of the acquired Cigna's business in Asia are included in our Life Insurance segment and, to a lesser extent, Overseas General Insurance segment according to the nature of the business written.\n•\nThe North America Commercial P&C Insurance segment comprises operations that provide P&C and A&H insurance and services to large, middle market, and small commercial businesses in the U.S., Canada, and Bermuda. This segment includes our retail divisions: Major Accounts; Commercial Insurance, including Small Commercial Insurance; Chubb Bermuda, our high excess business; and Westchester, our wholesale and specialty division. These divisions write a variety of coverages, including property, casualty, workers’ compensation, package policies, risk management, fin\nancial lines, marine, construction, environmental, medical risk, cyber risk, surety, excess casualty, and A&H insurance.\n•\nThe North America Personal P&C Insurance segment comprises the business written by Chubb Personal Risk Services division, which includes high net worth personal lines business, with operations in the U.S. and Canada. This segment provides affluent and high net worth individuals and families with homeowners, high value automobile and collector cars, valuable articles (including fine arts), personal and excess liability, travel insurance, and recreational marine insurance and services. \n•\nThe North America Agricultural Insurance segment includes the business written by Rain and Hail Insurance Service, Inc. in the U.S. and Canada, which provides comprehensive multiple peril crop insurance (MPCI) and crop-hail insurance, and Chubb Agribusiness, which offers farm and ranch property as well as specialty P&C coverages, including commercial agriculture products.\n•\nThe Overseas General Insurance segment includes the business written by two Chubb divisions that provides both commercial and consumer P&C insurance and services in the 51 countries and territories outside of North America where the company operates. Chubb International, our retail division, provides commercial P&C, A&H and traditional and specialty personal lines for large corporations, middle markets and small customers through retail brokers, agents and other channels locally around the world. CGM provides commercial P&C excess and surplus lines wholesale business primarily through wholesale brokers in the London market and through Lloyd’s. These divisions write a variety of coverages, including traditional commercial P&C, specialty categories such as financial lines, marine, energy, aviation, political risk and construction, as well as group A&H and traditional and specialty personal lines.\n•\nThe Global Reinsurance segment includes the assumed reinsurance business written by Chubb Tempest Re, comprising Chubb Tempest\n Re Bermuda, Chubb Tempest Re USA, Chubb Tempest Re International, and Chubb Tempest Re Canada. Chubb Tempest Re provides a broad range of traditional and specialty reinsurance coverages to a diverse array of primary P&C companies, including small, mid-sized, and multinational ceding companies.\n•\nThe Life Insurance segment includes our international life operations (Chubb Life), which includes individual life and group benefit insurance primarily in Asia and Latin America. The Life Insurance segment also includes Chubb Tempest Life Re (Chubb Life Re), and the North American supplemental A&H and life insurance business of Combined Insurance.\nF-101\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nCorporate primarily includes the results of all run-off A&E exposures, run-off Brandywine business, Westchester specialty operations for 1996 and prior years, and certain other run-off exposures, including molestation claims and is shown in the tables below as reconciling items. In addition, Corporate includes the results of our non-insurance companies including Chubb Limited, Chubb Group Management and Holdings Ltd., and Chubb INA Holdings LLC. Effective July 1, 2023, the results of Huatai Group’s non-insurance operations, comprising real estate and holding company activity, are included in Corporate. Our exposure to A&E and molestation claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when we purchased Westchester Specialty in 1998, CIGNA’s P&C business in 1999, and Chubb Corp in 2016.\nSegment performance is reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer of Chubb Ltd, our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The CODM is ultimately responsible for evaluating the performance of our six business segments, making strategic operating decisions, and allocating resources. The financial results of our operations are reported in a manner consistent with results reviewed by the CODM in reviewing and assessing the performance of our six business segments. Excluding our Life Insurance segment, the CODM uses Underwriting income (loss) as a basis for segment performance. Chubb calculates Underwriting income (loss) by subtracting Losses and loss expenses, Policy benefits, Policy acquisition costs, and Administrative expenses from Net premiums earned. For both our P&C and Life Insurance segments, another measure of segment performance is Segment income (loss). Segment income (loss) includes Underwriting income (loss), Net investment income (loss), amortization of purchased intangibles acquired by the segment, and other operating income and expense items such as each segment's share of the operating income (loss) related to partially-owned entities, and miscellaneous income and expense items for which the segments are held accountable. We determined that this definition of Segment income (loss) is appropriate and aligns with how the business is managed. We continue to evaluate our segments as our business continues to evolve and may further refine our segments and Segment income (loss) measures. \nRevenue and expenses managed at the corporate level, including Net realized gains (losses), Market risk benefits gains (losses), Interest expense, Integration expenses, Income tax expense, and Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests are reported within Corporate. Integration expenses are one-time costs that are directly attributable to third-party consulting fees, employee-related retention costs, and other professional and legal fees primarily related to the acquisition of Cigna's business in Asia. These items are not allocated to the segment level as they are one-time in nature and are not related to the ongoing business activities of the segment. The CODM does not manage segment results or allocate resources to segments when considering these costs, and therefore integration expenses are excluded from our definition of Segment income (loss). \nCertain items are presented in a different manner for segment reporting purposes than in the Consolidated Financial Statements, including:\n•\nLosses and loss expenses include realized gains and losses on crop derivatives. These derivatives were purchased to provide economic benefit, in a manner similar to reinsurance protection, in the event that a significant decline in commodity pricing impacts underwriting results. We view gains and losses on these derivatives as part of the results of our underwriting operations, and therefore, realized gains (losses) from these derivatives are reclassified to losses and loss expenses.\n•\nPolicy ben\nefits include fair value changes on separate accounts that do not qualify for separate accounting under U.S. G\nAAP. These gains and losses have been reclassified from Other (income) expense. We view gains and losses from fair value changes in both separate account assets and liabilities as part of the results of our underwriting operations, and therefore these gains and losses are reclassified to Policy benefits. Policy benefits also include the impact of realized gains and losses on investment portfolios supporting certain participating policies. These realized gains and losses have been reclassified from net realized gains (losses) to policy benefits. This presentation better reflects the economics of the participating policies by connecting the investment performance that is shared with policyholders to the liability.  \n•\nNet investment income includes investment income reclassified from Other (income) expense related to partially-owned investment companies (private equity partnerships) where our ownership interest is in excess of three percent.

ABR Reinsurance Capital Holdings Ltd., is the parent company of ABR Reinsurance Ltd. (ABR Re), an independent reinsurance company. Through long-term arrangements, Chubb is the sole source of reinsurance risks ceded to ABR Re, and BlackRock, Inc. serves as an investment management service provider. As an investor, Chubb is expected to benefit from underwriting profit generated by ABR Re’s reinsuring a wide range of Chubb’s primary insurance business and the income and capital appreciation BlackRock, Inc. seeks to deliver through its investment management services. In addition, Chubb has an arrangement with BlackRock, Inc. under which both Chubb and BlackRock, Inc. will be entitled to an equal share of the aggregate amount of certain fees, including underwriting and investment management performance related fees, in connection with their respective reinsurance and investment management arrangements with ABR Re. In connection with this arrangement with BlackRock, Inc., we recorded income of $\n12\n million, $\n8\n million, and $\n7\n million in \n2024\n, \n2023\n, and \n2022\n, respectively, which is recorded in Other (income) expense on the Consolidated statements of operations. \nABR Re is a variable interest entity; however, Chubb is not the primary beneficiary and does not consolidate ABR Re because Chubb does not have the power to control and direct ABR Re’s most significant activities, including investing and underwriting. Our ownership interest is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Chubb cedes premiums to ABR Re and recognizes the associated commissio\nns.\nF-107\nTable of Contents\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n \n(continued)\nChubb Limited and Subsidiaries\nTransactions generated under ABR Re agreements were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nConsolidated statements of operations\nCeded premiums written\n$\n476\n \n$\n441\n \n$\n507\n \nCommissions received\n$\n117\n \n$\n119\n \n$\n138\n \nConsolidated balance sheets\nReinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses\n$\n1,372\n \n$\n1,241\n \nCeded reinsurance premium payable\n$\n112\n \n$\n40\n \nAquiline Capital Partners LLC\nChubb invests in private investment funds managed by Aquiline Capital Partners LLC (collectively, Aquiline Funds), of which its chairman is related to a member of our senior management team.

However, Starr continues to provide certain services to Chubb, including claims administration, in respect of insurance policies placed prior to the termination, pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreements. Under the agency agreement, we secured the ability to sell our insurance policies through Starr as one of our non-exclusive agents for writing policies, contracts, binders, or agreements of insurance or reinsurance. Under the claims services agreements, Starr adjusts the claims under policies and arranged for third party treaty and facultative agreements covering such policies. Under the underwriting services agreements, Starr was the underwriter of insurance policies on our behalf and we agreed to reinsure such policies to Starr under quota share reinsurance agreements.

Statutory accounting differs from U.S. GAAP in the reporting of certain reinsurance contracts, investments, subsidiaries, acquisition expenses, fixed assets, deferred income taxes, and certain other items. Some jurisdictions impose complex regulatory requirements on insurance companies while other jurisdictions impose fewer requirements. In some jurisdictions, we must obtain licenses issued by governmental authorities to conduct local insurance business. These licenses may be subject to reserves and minimum capital and solvency tests. Jurisdictions may impose fines, censure, and/or criminal sanctions for violation of regulatory requirements. The 2024 amounts below are based on estimates.\nChubb's insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to insurance laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These regulations include restrictions that limit the amount of dividends or other distributions, such as loans or cash advances, available to shareholders without prior approval of the local insurance regulatory authorities. The amount of dividends available to be paid in 2025 without prior approval totals $\n8.5\n billion. \nThe statutory capital and surplus of our insurance subsidiaries met regulatory requirements for 2024, 2023, and 2022. The minimum amounts of statutory capital and surplus necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements was $\n44.4\n billion and $\n41.0\n billion for December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These minimum regulatory capital requirements were significantly lower than the corresponding amounts required by the rating agencies which review Chubb’s insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries.   \nThe following tables present the combined statutory capital and surplus and statutory net income of our Property and casualty and Life subsidiaries:\nDecember 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\nStatutory capital and surplus\n \nProperty and casualty\n$\n48,253\n \n$\n45,271\n \nLife \n$\n8,970\n \n$\n7,278\n \nYear Ended December 31\n(in millions of U.S. dollars)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStatutory net income\nProperty and casualty\n$\n11,118\n \n$\n8,699\n \n$\n4,028\n \nLife \n$\n548\n \n$\n459\n \n$\n1,425\n \nSeveral insurance subsidiaries follow accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the jurisdiction of domicile that differ from the applicable local statutory practice. The application of prescribed or permitted accounting practices does not have a material impact on Chubb's statutory surplus and income. As prescribed by the Restructuring discussed previously in Note 8, certain of our U.S. subsidiaries discount certain A&E liabilities, which increased statutory capital and surplus by approximately $\n108\n million and $\n115\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nFederal Insurance Company (Federal), a direct subsidiary of Chubb INA Holdings LLC, has a permitted practice granted by the Indiana Department of Insurance that relates to its investment in a foreign affiliate. Under Statement of Statutory Accounting Principles No. 97, Investments in Subsidiary, Controlled and Affiliated Entities, in order for a reporting entity to admit its investments in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, audited financial statements of the subsidiary or affiliate must be obtained to support the carrying value. Such financial statements must be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or alternatively, in accordance with the local statutory requirements in the subsidiary’s or affiliate’s country of domicile, with an audited footnote reconciliation of net income and shareholder’s equity as reported to a U.S. GAAP basis.
