  "item1_summary": " The nature of our business activities subjects us to certain hazards and risks . We could also face additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial . If any of these risks actually occurs, it could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations and the trading price of our shares could decline .\n The company may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms or at all to fund our acquisitions or development activities . The company is vulnerable to risks associated with its primary operations concentrated in a single geographic area. The company's method of accounting for investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairment of asset value .\n U.S. tax legislation, including recently adopted IRA, may negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow . Drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high-risk activities with many uncertainties that may result in a total loss of investment . Cyber incidents could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss .\n The declaration of dividends and any repurchases of our common stock are each within the discretion of our board of directors, and there is no guarantee that we will pay any dividends . The company could face a downgrade in our debt ratings, which could restrict our access to, and negatively impact the terms of, current or future financings or trade credit .\n Oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control . Operating results, profitability, growth and the carrying value of our properties depend on the prevailing prices for oil, natural gas, company says .\n If the prices of oil and natural gas decline, our operations, financial condition and level of expenditures may be materially and adversely affected . We cannot reasonably predict whether production levels will remain at current levels or the full extent of the impact of the events above and any subsequent recovery may have on our industry and our business . If commodity prices fall below current levels, we may be required to record impairments in future periods .\n We use commodity price derivatives, which have historically included swaps, basis swaps, swaptions, roll hedges, costless collars, puts and basis puts, to reduce price volatility associated with certain of our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas sales . Currently, we have hedged a portion of our estimated 2025 and 2026 production .\n The IRA and other risks relating to climate change could accelerate the transition to a low carbon economy and could impose new costs on our operations that may have a material and adverse effect on us . For additional information regarding our outstanding derivative contracts as of December 31, 2024, see Note 13——insuredDerivatives in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data .\n Any of these developments may reduce the demand for products manufactured with (or powered by) hydrocarbons, which would likely have a material adverse impact on us . These developments may also reduce the availability of necessary third-party services and facilities that we rely on, which could increase our ability to produce, produce and process oil and natural gas .\n These incentives and regulations could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower- or zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for, and in turn the prices of, the oil and natural gas that we produce and sell . The IRA imposes the first ever federal fee on the emission of greenhouse gases through a methane emissions charge .\n In recent years, increased attention to global climate change resulted in increased investor attention and an increased risk of public and private litigation . Cities, counties, and other governmental entities in several states in the U.S. have filed lawsuits against energy companies seeking damages allegedly associated with climate change . Any such future actions may result in significant management distraction and potentially significant expense .\n Our targets related to sustainability and emissions reduction initiatives, including our public statements and disclosures regarding them, may expose us to numerous risks . Failure to achieve our announced targets or comply with ethical, environmental or other standards, including reporting standards, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations . We cannot currently predict how regulators’, investors’ and other stakeholders’ views on ESG matters may affect the regulatory and investment landscape .\n It is unclear what effect recent executive orders by President Trump will have on investor and other stakeholders’ near-term and long-term ESG expectations for companies involved in fossil fuel exploration and production . The SEC published final rules on March 28, 2024, relating to the disclosure of a range of climate-related risks and other information .\n A significant portion of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, or acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas . Any reduction in our current drilling program, either through a reduction in capital expenditures or the unavailability of drilling rigs, could result in the loss of acreage through lease expirations .\n In 2024, our total capital expenditures, including expenditures for drilling, completion, infrastructure and additions to midstream assets, were approximately $2.9 billion . Our 2025 capital budget, which gives effect to the pending Double Eagle Acquisition, is currently estimated to be approximately $3.80 billion to $4.20 billion, representing an increase of 40% from our 2024 capital expenditures .\n We cannot assure you that our operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned or future levels of capital expenditures . We may be unable to fund our capital requirements or our costs of capital increase, we may be required to curtail our operations relating to the exploration and development of our prospects . Failure to complete proposed or future infrastructure projects could delay or eliminate potential efficiencies .\n Our future success depends upon our ability to find, develop or acquire additional oil and natural gas reserves that are economically recoverable . Our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted, except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves . Failure to successfully identify, complete and integrate pending and future acquisitions of properties could reduce our earnings and slow our growth .\n Even if we identify attractive acquisition opportunities, we may not be able to complete the acquisition or do so on commercially acceptable terms . Environmental or other regulatory issues may arise with respect to acquired entities or operations years after the acquisitions . Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems .\n As of December 31, 2024, we have approximately 9,188 gross (7,130 net) identified economic potential horizontal drilling locations in multiple horizons on our acreage at an assumed price of approximately $50.00 per Bbl WTI . The process of integrating acquired businesses may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our managerial and financial resources . Possible future acquisitions may be larger and for purchase prices significantly higher than those paid for earlier acquisitions .\n As of December 31, 2024, we have identified approximately 1,657 horizontal drilling locations in intervals in which we have drilled very few or no wells . We cannot predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular drilling location will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable .\n We do not know if the potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas . Initial production rates reported by us or other operators in the Permian Basin may not be indicative of future or long-term production rates . Our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business .\n The inability of one or more of our customers to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results . We may be unable to meet our obligations under our oil purchase agreements, which may result in deficiency payments to certain counterparties or a default under such agreements . The inability or failure of our significant customers or joint working interest owners to meet obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation .\n We account for our oil and natural gas producing activities using the full cost method of accounting . All costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of proved oil and . natural gas properties, including the costs of abandoned properties, dry holes, geophysical costs and annual lease rentals are capitalized . We use the unweighted arithmetic average first day of the month price for oil and gas for the 12-month period preceding the calculation date .\n Our estimated reserves and EURs are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate . Any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties . A substantial portion of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history .\n The present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves may not represent the current market value of our estimated proved oil reserves . The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties . The development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer and may require higher levels of capital expenditures than we currently anticipate .\n Some of the world's largest oil reserves are located in the Perianas region of West Texas . Some of these reserves could be affected by delays in the production process . The company says it is not certain that all of its reserves will be fully accounted for by the end of the year . It is also possible that some of the reserves will have to be reclassified as unproven .\n A significant hurricane or similar weather event could damage refining and other oil and natural gas-related facilities on the Gulf Coast of Texas and Louisiana . Climate change may also increase the frequency and severity of significant weather events over time . Increase in flaring of our natural gas production due to weather-related events or otherwise could make it difficult for us to achieve our publicly-announced sustainability and emissions reduction targets .\n Most of our proved reserves are concentrated in the Wolfberry play in the Midland Basin . Changes in field-wide rules and regulations could cause us to permanently or temporarily shut-in all of our wells within a field . The availability of a ready market for any oil and/or natural gas we produce depends on numerous factors beyond the control of our management .\n The oil and natural gas industry is cyclical, which can result in shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, raw materials (particularly sand and other proppants), supplies and personnel . Shortages of any of these items could delay or restrict our exploration and development operations, which in turn could impair our financial condition and results of operations .\n Some water districts have begun restricting the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to protect local water supply . In 2021, the Texas Legislature directed the Texas Railroad Commission to adopt rules encouraging fluid oil and gas waste recycling . The revised rules will go into effect on July 1, 2025 . If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations, we may be unable to economically drill for or produce oil and natural gas .\n State has adopted rules governing the permitting or re-permitting of wells used to dispose of produced water and other fluids resulting from the production of oil and gas . These restrictions could result in increased operating costs, requiring us or our service providers to truck produced water, recycle it or dispose of it by other means . These factors may make drilling activity in the affected parts of the Permian Basin less economical .\n Risks that we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, spacing of wells to maximize economic return . Some of the new techniques we are adopting, such as infill drilling and multi-well pad drilling, may cause irregularities or interruptions in production . Newer or emerging formations and areas often have limited or no production history and consequently we are less able to predict future drilling results .\n The marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and other facilities, certain of which we do not control . If these facilities are unavailable, our operations could be interrupted and our revenues reduced . Insufficient production from our wells to support the construction of pipeline facilities by our purchasers could adversely impact our ability to deliver to market or produce our oil and natural gas .\n The amount of oil and natural gas that can be produced and sold may be subject to curtailment in certain other circumstances outside of our control . The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months, and in many cases, we are provided with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration .\n Oil and natural gas operations in our operating areas can be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions on drilling activities . Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in sanctions, including administrative, civil or criminal penalties, permit revocations, requirements for additional pollution controls and injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of our operations .\n The designation of previously unprotected species in areas where we operate as threatened or endangered, could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures . The Dodd-Frank Act established federal oversight of the over-the-counter derivatives market and entities, including us, that participate in that market, could have an adverse effect on our ability to hedge risks .\n The CFTC, the SEC and the Prudential Regulators have issued a number of rules to implement the Dodd-Frank Act . There are exceptions, subject to meeting certain filing, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, to the Mandatory Clearing Rule, the Margin Rule and the Position Limit Rule . Most if not all of our swap counterparties will be subject to mandatory clearing and collateral requirements in connection with their hedging activities with other counterparties .\n The Dodd-Frank Act was intended, in part, to reduce the volatility of oil and natural gas prices . Some legislators attributed to speculative trading in derivatives and commodity contracts related to oil and gas . Our revenues could be adversely affected if a consequence of the legislation is to lower commodity prices . Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and our results of operations .\n These proposed changes in the U.S. tax law, if adopted, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow . No accurate prediction can be made as to whether any such legislative changes will be proposed or enacted in the future or, if enacted,  referred to the specific provisions or the effective date of any such legislation .\n The U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and other standard-setting bodies are expected to issue additional guidance on how CAMT, stock buyback excise tax and other provisions of the IRA will be applied . We continue to evaluate the IRA and its effect on our financial results and operating cash flow .\n Operations are subject to all of the hazards and operating risks associated with drilling for and production of oil and natural gas . We do not have employment agreements with our executives and may not be able to assure their retention . The occurrence of any events could result in substantial losses to us due to injury or loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment .\n Under our agreements with our vendors, to the extent responsibility for environmental liability is allocated between the parties, (i) our vendors generally assume all responsibility for control and removal of pollution or contamination which originates above the surface of the land . We generally agree to indemnify our vendors for loss or destruction of vendor-owned property that occurs in the well hole (except for damage that occurs when a vendor is performing work on a footage, rather than day work, basis)\n The occurrence of a significant uninsured claim, a claim in excess of the insurance coverage limits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow . We may also be liable for environmental damage caused by previous owners of properties purchased by us, which liabilities may not be covered by insurance .\n Use of 2-D and 3-D seismic data is subject to interpretation and may not accurately identify the presence of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect the results of our drilling operations . We own interests in certain pipeline projects and other joint ventures, and we may in the future enter into additional joint ventures .\n The oil and natural gas industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements and introductions of new products and services using new technologies . As others use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage . We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures or implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost .\n A terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business . Oil and natural gas related facilities could be direct targets of terrorist attacks . Costs for insurance and other security may increase as a result of these threats, and some insurance coverage may become more difficult to obtain, if available at all . If any of these systems are compromised or unavailable, our business could be adversely affected .\n A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss . The company's reliance on technology has increased due to the increased use of personal devices, remote communications and work-from-home or hybrid work practices that evolved in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and became a common business practice .\n Advances in artificial intelligence (“AI”) may pose serious risks for many of the traditional tools used to identify individuals . In addition, malicious actors may also be used by malicious actors to create more sophisticated cyber-attacks (i.e., more realistic phishing or other attacks) The advancements in AI could lead to an increase in the frequency of identity fraud or cyberattacks .\n A cybersecurity attack on third-party gathering, transportation, processing, fractionation, refining or other facilities could delay or halt our operations . Unauthorized access to, and release of, personal information of employees, vendors, service providers, royalty and working interest owners, or other third parties, could expose us to allegations that we did not sufficiently protect such information .\n A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows . We have engaged third-party consultants to conduct penetration testing and risk assessments . A variety of U.S. federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of personal data .\n Texas recently passed the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, which establishes new laws for collecting, storing, processing, and selling consumer information . As of December 31, 2024, Endeavor’s equityholders held approximately 36% of our common stock . Any violations of applicable privacy-related laws or regulations may require us to address legal claims, sustain monetary penalties or incur other liabilities .\n The interests of the Endeavor equityholders may conflict with the interests of other stockholders . The ability to make scheduled payments of the principal, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control .\n We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations . Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at the time . We incurred a substantial amount of debt to finance the cash consideration of the Endeavor Acquisition and to repay certain existing indebtedness .\n The terms of our and our subsidiaries’ credit facilities do not completely prohibit us from issuing additional debt . If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks could be increased . The holders of that additional debt will be entitled to share in any proceeds distributed in connection with any of the senior notes .\n We cannot assure you that we will choose to or be able to access the capital markets to repay any such future borrowings . We will continue to fund a portion of our capital expenditures with borrowings under the revolving credit facility, cash flow from operations and the proceeds from debt and equity offerings . Restrictive covenants in certain of our existing and future debt instruments may limit our ability to respond to changes in market conditions .\n If a default occurs under our revolving credit facility, the lenders thereunder may elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued interest and other fees, to be immediately due and payable . As a holding company, we depend on our subsidiaries for dividends and other payments . There are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends . If our subsidiaries are unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available, we may not be able to make .\n If we experience liquidity concerns, we could face a downgrade in our debt ratings . A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access financings or trade credit . Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchases or sales and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities, liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix and commodity pricing levels .\n The declaration of base and variable dividends and any repurchases of our common stock are each within the discretion of our board of directors . If interest rates increase, so will our interest costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition . The decision to pay any future dividends is solely within the . discretion of, and subject to approval by, our board .\n Through December 31, 2024, approximately $3.3 billion has been repurchased through the repurchase program . The amount of cash available to return to our stockholders can vary significantly from quarter to quarter . The price of our common stock may deteriorate if we are unable to meet investor expectations with respect to the timing and amount of our return of capital commitment to our shareholders .\n At closing, Endeavor equityholders are subject to a lock-up with respect to 90% of the shares of our common stock . Lock-up will apply to 66.6% and 33.3% of shares issued in the endeavor Acquisition following March 10, 2025 and September 10, 25, respectively, respectively . If the pending Double Eagle Acquisition is consummated, we will issue approximately 6.9 million shares to the seller . Change of control could limit our use of net operating losses .\n An ownership change would establish an annual limitation on the amount of a corporation’s pre-change NOLs or tax credits that could be utilized to offset taxable income in any future taxable year . This limitation, however, may be significantly increased if there is “net unrealized built-in gain” in the assets of the corporation undergoing the ownership change .\n The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock . Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law make it more difficult to effect a change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our stock .\n These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, which may limit the price that investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock . These provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it harder for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions .\n Our cybersecurity program is informed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (“NIST”) Cybersecurity . It is measured by the Maturity and Risk Assessment Ratings associated with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the Capability Maturity Model Integration . The company has engaged third-party consultants to conduct penetration testing and risk assessments .\n Our cybersecurity governance program is led by the Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer, with support from the internal information technology department . Management team takes steps to remain informed about and monitor efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents . Incident response team is responsible for responding to cybersecurity incidents in accordance with our Computer Security Incident Response Plan .\n While board of directors is ultimately responsible for enterprise-wide risk oversight, the board’s committees assist the board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities in certain areas of risk . Cybersecurity plays an integral role in our risk management strategy and continues to be an area of increasing focus for our board, the audit committee and our management team .\n Risks from cybersecurity threats have not materially affected, and are not currently anticipated to materially affect, our Company, including our business strategy, results of operations or financial condition . See, however, . ting periodic reassessments during their engagement with the company . See the results of their engagement. ting ."
