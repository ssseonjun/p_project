  "item1_summary": " The following table sets forth share repurchases, on a trade date basis, for each of the three months of the quarter ended December 31, 2024:  The average price paid per share of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. (CF Holdings) common stock repurchased under the 2022 Share Repurchase Program is the execution price, excluding commissions paid to brokers and excise taxes .\n CF Holdings, Inc. thorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of CF Holdings common stock, which is effective through December 31, 2025 . Includes 44 shares withheld to pay employee tax obligations upon the lapse of restrictions on restricted stock units . This share repurchase program is discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations .\n CF Holdings provides clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably . It is on a path to decarbonize our ammonia production network – the world’s largest – to enable low-carbon hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement, and other industrial activities . CF Holdings' Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 22, 2024 .\n At our core, CF Industries is a producer of ammonia . Products derived from ammonia that are sold primarily to industrial customers include diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), urea liquor, nitric acid and aqua ammonia . CF Industries Nitrogen, LLC (CFN), of which we own approximately 89% and CHS Inc. (CHS) owns the remainder .\n Our strategy is to leverage our unique capabilities to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy . We believe this strategy builds upon our leadership in ammonia production to capture emerging opportunities to produce ammonia with a lower carbon intensity than that of ammonia produced through traditional processes . These opportunities include traditional applications in agriculture to help reduce the carbon footprint of food production and the life cycle carbon intensity of ethanol production .\n At Donaldsonville and Yazoo City complexes, our decarbonization projects are leveraging carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to enable us to convert a portion of our existing ammonia production to low-carbon ammonia . CCS requires the construction of carbon dioxide (CO) dehydration and compression units to enable process CO.2 that captured from the ammonia production process to be transported and sequestered .\n The 20-megawatt alkaline water electrolysis plant to produce hydrogen was suspended due to an issue experienced in the fourth quarter of 2024 . Upon identification and remediation of the issue, we expect to resume commissioning activities . At full electrolyzer capacity, we will be able to produce approximately 20,000 tons of low-carbon ammonia per year .\n We operate in a highly competitive, global industry . We are evaluating and are in various stages of discussions with other companies for long-term offtake . These discussions continue to advance as we gain greater clarity regarding demand for low-carbon ammonia . Global fertilizer demand has been driven primarily by population growth, gross domestic p. mmonia capacity .\n We expect these key variables to continue to have major impacts on long-term fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future . Geopolitical factors such as temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention, shipping delays and/or cost increases resulting from regional conflicts . Supply of fertilizers is generally driven by available capacity and operating rates, raw material costs and availability, government policies and global trade .\n The demand for fertilizer is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers . The development of additional natural gas reserves in North America has decreased natural gas costs, making North American nitrogen fertilizer producers more competitive . Government energy or carbon policies may also affect regional nitrogen supply and demand . Changes in currency values may also alter our cost competitiveness relative to producers in other regions of the world .\n Average selling prices for all of our major products were lower in 2024 than in 2023 . Lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand . The 10% decrease in the average selling price for our products in 2024 compared to 2023 resulted in a year-over-year decrease in net sales of approximately $716 million .\n The acquisition of the Waggaman ammonia production facility closed on December 1, 2023, and therefore provided incremental net sales in the first eleven months of 2024 . The plant downtime led to approximately $75 million of additional costs in first quarter of 2024 for maintenance, repairs and certain unabsorbed fixed costs . Natural gas is a significant cost component of our manufactured nitrogen products, representing approximately 28% and 40% of our production costs .\n In the first quarter of 2024, warmer-than-normal average temperatures in North America drove lower heating demand for natural gas, in spite of a short-lived period of extremely cold temperatures in January 2024 that affected most of North America . North American natural gas supply remained strong through the quarter, with a decline in supply occurring near the end of the quarter as producers responded to a weaker price environment .\n The average daily market price of natural gas at the Henry Hub, the most heavily-traded natural gas pricing point in North America, was $4.25 per MMBtu for the period from January 1, 2025 through February 14, 2025 . Liquefied natural gas exports increased to the highest level of the year due to strong global demand for natural gas .\n Gross margin decreased by $489 million, or 19%, to $2.06 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024 . The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a 10% decrease in average selling prices to $313 per ton in 2024 . Lower natural gas costs increased gross margin by $436 million, excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition .\n On December 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana from Dyno Nobel Louisiana Ammonia, LLC . The facility has a nameplate production capacity of 880,000 tons of ammonia annually . We funded the balance of the initial purchase price on the acquisition date with $1.223 billion of cash on hand .\n Certain items affected the comparability of our financial results during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 . The tax impact is calculated utilizing a marginal effective rate of 23.6% and 23.5% . The Waggaman acquisition, which reflects a    acquisition and integration costs related to the acquisition, reflects a tax impact . The descriptions of items below that refer to amounts in the table refer to the pre-tax amounts .\n In 2024 and 2023, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives of $35 million and $39 million, respectively . The company also recognized income of $16 million pertaining to a policy change to an employee benefit plan that is included in both cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations .\n On December 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana . In 2024, we incurred approximately $4 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of an ammonia facility . In the third quarter of 2023 and due to the terms of the New NGC Contract, we assessed our investment in PLNL for impairment . As a result, we recorded an impairment of  $43 million .\n In the second half of 2022, we paid additional income taxes and related interest of $124 million and $100 million to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) and Alberta Tax and Revenue Administration (Alberta TRA) In the third quarter of 2024, we were informed that the CRA granted us discretionary interest relief for certain tax years from 2006 through 2011 . As a result of the interest relief, we recognized $39 million of income consisting of a $36 million reduction in interest expense and $3 million of interest income .\n U.K. long-lived and intangible asset impairment— .

The average daily market price of natural gas Henry Hub (Louisiana) in COS is $2.40 per day . Excludes unrealized unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on natural gas derivatives . The company's ammonia production has been upgraded on-site into granular urea, UAN, or AN .\n Our total net sales decreased $695 million, or 10%, to $5.94 billion in 2024 compared to $6.63 billion in 2023 . Net sales also include shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers . Sales incentives are reported as a reduction in net sales . The Waggaman acquisition completed on December 1, 2023, increased our net sales by $249 million .\n Cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, purchased product costs, distribution and storage costs, and freight . Total cost of sales decreased $206 million, or 5%, to $3.88 billion in 2024 as compared to $4.09 billion in 2023 . The impact of lower sales volume was a decrease in net sales of approximately $228 million . We expect gross ammonia production for 2025 will be approximately 10 million tons .\n Tural gas costs decreased cost of sales by $436 million, excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition . The impact of lower realized natural gas costs was partially offset by higher costs for planned and unplanned maintenance and repair activities in 2024 . Cost of sales averaged $204 per ton, a 5% decrease from $214 per ton in 2023 .\n In 2023, related to our U.K. operations, we recognized total charges of $10 million . In 2024, we incurred $4 million of integration costs related to the acquisition of an ammonia production facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana . Other operating—net includes administrative costs that do not relate directly to our central operations .\n Equity in earnings (loss) of operating affiliate was $4 million of earnings in 2024 compared to an $8 million loss in 2023 . This includes an impairment of our equity method investment in PLNL of $43 million recognized in the third quarter of 2023, excluding the impact from the impairment charge . Lower equity in earnings of PLNL in 2024 reflects a decrease in operating results as a result of a plant turnaround in the second quarter of 2024 at the PLNL facility .\n Interest income was $123 million in 2024 compared to $158 million in 2023 . The decrease of $35 million was due primarily to a $52 million decrease in interest income on short-term investments in 2024 . Our effective tax rate is impacted by earnings attributable to the noncontrolling interest in CFN, as our consolidated income tax provision does not include a tax provision on the earnings .\n Both 2024 and 2023 were impacted by additional discrete tax items . Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interest decreased $54 million, or 17%, to $259 million in 2024 compared to $313 million in 2023 . Lower earnings of CFN driven by lower average selling prices as described above under “Net Sales,” partially offset by lower natural gas costs .\n Management uses gross margin to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources . Total other operating costs and expenses (consisting primarily of selling, general and administrative expenses and other operating—net) and non-operating expenses are centrally managed and are not included in the measurement of segment profitability reviewed by management . The financial results of the Waggaman facility are included in Ammonia segment from the acquisition date of December 1, 2023 .\n Anhydrous ammonia (ammonia) is the base product that we manufacture, containing 82% nitrogen and 18% hydrogen . The results of our Ammonia segment consist of sales of ammonia to external customers for its nitrogen content as a fertilizer, in emissions control and in other industrial applications . In addition, we upgrade ammonia into other nitrogen products such as granular urea, UAN and AN .\n The financial results of the Waggaman facility are included in the Ammonia segment from the acquisition date of December 1, 2023 . Average selling prices decreased to $425 per ton in 2024 compared to $473 in 2023 as lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand . In January 2024, a winter storm produced extremely cold temperatures that impacted our operations .\n Ammonia sales volume in 2024 was 4.1 million tons, an increase of 15% compared to 3.5 million tons in 2023 . The increase in sales volume reflects both the impact of the Waggaman acquisition completed on December 1, 2023, and 62,000 tons of ammonia purchased and resold at near breakeven margins in order to fulfill sales commitments .\n $160 million, a net increase in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs decreased gross margin by $121 million . A decrease in sales volume, excluding the impact of the Waggaman acquisition, decreased gross margins by $8 million . Gross margin includes a $13 million unrealized net mark-to-market gain on natural gas derivatives in 2024 compared to $11 million gain in 2023 .\n In 2024, net sales in our Granular Urea segment decreased $223 million, or 12%, to $1.60 billion in 2024 . Average selling prices decreased to $354 per ton in 2024 compared to $399 in 2023 . Lower sales volume in the first quarter of 2024 was due to a reduction in ammonia available for upgrade and lower supply availability from the impact of severe weather that caused urea plant outages .\n Gross margin in our Granular Urea segment decreased by $139 million, or 17%, to $674 million in 2024 from $813 million in 2023 . The decrease in gross margin was driven by an 11% decrease in average selling prices, a net increase in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs . Lower realized natural gas costs, including the impact of realized derivatives, partially offset by higher costs associated with maintenance activity in 2024 .\n Net sales in our UAN segment decreased $390 million, or 19%, to $1.68 billion in 2024 compared to $2.07 billion in 2023 . Nutrient tons represent the tons of nitrogen within the product tons . UAN represents between 28% and 32% of nitrogen content, depending on the concentration specified by the customer .\n Cost of sales in our UAN segment averaged $158 per ton, a 9% decrease from $173 per ton in 2023 . Gross margin in our AN segment decreased by $208 million, or 25%, to $609 million in 2024 from $817 million in 2024 . The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a 13% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by $274 million .\n Net sales in our AN segment decreased $78 million, or 16%, to $419 million in 2024 from $497 million in 2023 . Average selling price per nutrient ton decreased to $286 per ton in 2024 compared to $316 per ton . Lower global energy costs reduced the global market clearing price required to meet global demand . Sales volume declined due to lower supply availability resulting from lower production in 2024 .\n Gross margin in our AN segment decreased by $59 million, or 43%, to $79 million in 2024 from $138 million in 2023 . The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a 9% decrease in average selling prices, which decreased gross margin by $65 million . The net decrease in manufacturing, maintenance and other costs reflects lower costs for purchased ammonia in the United Kingdom, partially offset by higher costs for maintenance activity in North America .\n The following table presents summary operating data for our Other segment . Net sales decreased $61 million, or 11%, to $503 million in 2024 from $564 million in 2023 . Average selling prices decreased to $239 per ton in 2024 compared to $25 per ton . Average sales volume by nutrient tons (000s) decreased to 2,101 product tons .\n Cost of sales in our Other segment averaged $143 per ton in 2024, a 4% decrease from $149 in 2023 . The decrease in sales volume was due primarily to lower DEF sales volume, partially offset by higher nitric acid sales volume . Gross margin in the Other segment decreased by $35 million, or 15%, to $201 million in 2024 from $236 million in 2024 .\n As of December 31, 2024, our cash and cash equivalents balance was $1.61 billion, a decrease of $418 million from $2.03 billion at Dec. 31, 2023 . Cash from operations is cash from operations, which includes cash generated by customer advances . We may also utilize our cash to fund acquisitions and repurchases, if any .\n Capital expenditures totaled $518 million in 2024 compared to $499 million in 2023 . Capital expenditures in 2025 are estimated to be in the range of $500 million to $550 million . Planned capital expenditures are generally subject to change due to delays in regulatory approvals or permitting, unanticipated increases in cost, changes in scope and completion time, performance of third parties, delays in receipt of equipment, adverse weather, defects in materials and workmanship .\n On December 1, 2023, we acquired an ammonia production facility located in Waggaman, Louisiana from Dyno Nobel Louisiana Ammonia, LLC (DNLA), a U.S. subsidiary of Incitec Pivot Limited . We funded the balance of the initial purchase price on the acquisition date with $1.223 billion of cash on hand .\n The Board authorized the repurchase of up to $3 billion of CF Holdings common stock commencing upon completion of the 2021 Share Repurchase Program and effective through December 31, 2025 . The manner, timing and amount of repurchases will be determined by our management based on the evaluation of market conditions, stock price, and other factors .\n The impact of changes in governmental policies or laws could have a material impact on fertilizer demand and selling prices . The construction and operation of fertilizer plants often are influenced by economic, political and social objectives . Changing political leadership, including the new U.S. presidential administration and regulatory leadership, have proposed, and may propose further, policy, regulatory, and enforcement changes .\n In the fourth quarter of 2024, we received interest relief from the CRA consisting of interest refunds of $21 million and related interest of $2 million . We expect to receive the interest refunds from the Alberta TRA in the first half of 2025 . We have operations in Canada, the United Kingdom and a 50% interest in a joint venture in Trinidad .\n As of December 31, 2024, approximately $346 million of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance of $1.61 billion was held by our Canadian and United Kingdom subsidiaries . Foreign subsidiary earnings may still be subject to withholding taxes when repatriated to the United States . Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and other general corporate purposes .\n The financial covenant requires that the total net leverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) be not greater than 3.75:1.00 . CF Industries is required to pay an undrawn commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the commitments . The specified margin and the amount of the commitment fee depend on CF Holdings’ credit rating .\n CF Industries is party to a bilateral agreement providing for the issuance of up to $425 million of letters of credit . As of December 31, 2024, we had unused borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement of $750 million . There were no borrowings outstanding under the agreement . CF Industries' long-term debt consists of the following debt securities issued by CF Industries .\n Effective August 23, 2021, these notes are no longer secured, in accordance with the terms of the applicable indenture . The Public Senior Notes are redeemable at our option, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at specified make-whole redemption prices . CF Industries' total deferred debt issuance costs were $23 million and $25 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively .\n Under the indenture governing the 4.500% senior secured notes due 2026, the 2026 Notes are guaranteed by CF Holdings . CF Industries will be required to offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase . In the case of bankruptcy or insolvency, the applicable Public Senior Notes would become due and payable immediately .\n The indenture governing the 2026 Notes provides for customary events of default, such as nonpayment of principal or interest of the notes . CF Industries will be required to offer to repurchase them at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of repurchase events .\n Our reported fertilizer selling prices and margins may differ from market spot prices at the time of shipment . We offer our customers the opportunity to purchase products from us on a forward basis at prices and on delivery dates we propose . As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had $118 million and $130 million in customer advances on our consolidated balance sheets .\n Under our forward sales programs, a customer may delay delivery of an order due to weather conditions or other factors . Such a delay in scheduled shipment or termination of a forward sales contract due to a customer’s inability or unwillingness to perform may negatively impact our reported sales . We use natural gas both as a chemical feedstock and as a fuel to produce ammonia, granular urea, UAN, AN and other products .\n The price of natural gas in North America directly impacts a substantial portion of our operating expenses . Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of our manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products . In 2024 and 2023, we recognized unrealized net mark-to-market gains on natural gas derivatives of $35 million and $39 million .\n Most of our derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as cross default provisions . In the event of certain defaults or termination events, our counterparties may request early termination and net settlement of certain derivative trades . At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had no cash collateral on deposit with counterparties for derivative contracts .\n The CFN Board of Managers approved semi-annual distribution payments for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 . Net earnings in 2024 was $1.48 billion, a decrease of $361 million compared to $2.76 billion in 2023 . The decrease in net earnings was due primarily to a decrease in gross margin, driven by lower average selling prices .\n During 2024, capital expenditures totaled $518 million compared to $499 million in 2023 . Net cash used in financing activities was $2.21 billion in 2024 . In 2024, we paid $1.51 billion for share repurchases . Dividends paid on common stock were $364 million compared to $311 million .\n The following discussion presents information about our most critical accounting estimates . We base our estimates on historical experience, technological assessment, opinions of appropriate outside experts, and the most recent information available to us . Actual results may differ from these estimates . Changes in estimates that may have a material impact on our results are discussed in the context of the underlying financial statements to which they relate .\n Adverse changes in demand for our products, increases in supply and the availability and costs of key raw materials could significantly affect the results of our review . The recoverability and impairment tests of long-lived assets are required only when conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable . For goodwill, impairment tests are required at least annually, or more frequently .\n PLNL is our joint venture investment in Trinidad and operates an ammonia plant that relies on natural gas supplied, under a gas sales contract, by the National Gas Company of Trinidad and Tobago Limited . PLNL experienced past curtailments in the supply of natural gas from NGC, which reduced the ammonia production at PLNL . The New NGC Contract is effective October 2023 through December 2025 .\n Any NGC commitment to supply gas beyond December 2025 will be based on new agreements . If NGC does not make sufficient quantities of natural gas available to PLNL at prices that permit profitable operations, PLNL may cease operating its facility and we would write off the remaining investment in PLNL . Projected benefit obligations (PBOs) for our defined benefit pension plans are affected by plan design, actuarial estimates and discount rates .\n The table below estimates the impact of a 50 basis point increase or decrease in the key assumptions on our December 31, 2024 PBO:  \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits\" The tax laws are complex, and how they apply to our facts is sometimes open to interpretation . The judgments made at a point in time may change from previous conclusions based on the outcome of tax audits, as well as changes to, or furt .\n As of December 31, 2024, we have recorded a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits, including penalties and interest, of $285 million . The taxability of cross border transactions has received an increasing level of scrutiny among regulators across the globe, including the jurisdictions in which we operate . We adjust our income tax provision in the period in which these changes occur .\n A $1.00 per MMBtu change in the price of natural gas would change the cost to produce a ton of ammonia, granular urea, UAN (assuming a 32% nitrogen content) and AN by approximately $33, $22, $14 and $16 . Natural gas is the largest and most volatile component of the manufacturing cost for nitrogen-based products .\n As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had open natural gas derivative contracts for 16.0 million MMBtus and 49.0 million MMBTus, respectively . A $1.00 per MMBtu increase in the forward curve prices of natural gas would result in a favorable change in the fair value of these derivative positions of approximately $14 million .\n Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm: CF Industries Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 . We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting .\n We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. OB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company . The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not providing a separate opinion . We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion .\n The Company’s projected benefit obligation (PBO) associated with its defined benefit pension plans established in North America and the United Kingdom was $278 million and $317 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2024 . We identified the evaluation of the Company's measurements of the PBO as a critical audit matter . Specialized skills were needed to evaluate the discount rates utilized in the measurement of the . PBO represents an actuarially determined estimate of the present value of the vested benefits .\n The Company’s discount rate for the North America plans is based on market trends based on published yield curves and indices . KPMG LLP has served as the Company's auditor since 1983 . The Company's discount rates are based on the PBO cash flows and publicly available yield curves for pension plans in North America, adjusted for the assessment of the timing of payments .\n Operating earnings: $1,746.2,762.5,397.2 (2,230) Net earnings attributable to common stockholders: $1,477 (1,838) Average earnings per share: $6.75 (6.89) Average shares outstanding: $180.7 (180.4) Average share uncommon shares attributes attributable to common stockholders $6.74 (16.45) Average common shares unavailable share outcome attractively - preferred shareholders per share with $7.87 (16)\n Current assets: $2,520,520 – $13,466 – $14,376 – $917 - $7,700 - $1.867 -  $1.5,000 —$0.01 par value,  preferred stockholders’ equity: $2,500,000,000 shares authorized . $1,971 --$1,735 - a purchased to investment in affiliate affiliate and investments with goodwill precipient assets: 2,492 -- $3,495 - an acquired property, plant and equipment previously .\n The company's net earnings are $2,088 per share .

We are on a path to decarbonize our ammonia production network – the world’s largest – to enable low-carbon hydrogen and nitrogen products for energy, fertilizer, emissions abatement, and other industrial activities . The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP)\n \"CF Industries\" refers to CF Industries, Inc., a 100% owned subsidiary of CF Industries Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes clear that the reference is to CF Holdings, Inc. only and not its subsidiaries . Our principal assets as of December 31, 2024 include: six U.S. manufacturing facilities, located in Donaldsonville, Louisiana; Sergeant Bluff, Iowa (our Port Neal complex); Yazoo City, Mississippi; Claremore, Oklahoma (our Verdigris complex) and Woodward, Oklahoma .\n The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities . CHS’ minority equity interest in CFN is included in noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements . See Note 19—Noncontrolling Interest for additional information .\n Control of our products transfers to our customers when the customer is able to direct the use of, and obtain substantially all of the benefits from, our products, which occurs at the later of when title or risk of loss transfers to the customer . Revenue from forward sales programs is recognized on the same basis as other sales regardless of when customer advances are received .\n The carrying values of short-term investments approximate fair values because of the short maturities and the highly liquid nature of these investments . Fixed production costs related to idle capacity are not included in the cost of inventory but are charged directly to cost of sales in the period incurred . The equity method of accounting is used for our investment in an affiliate that we do not consolidate .\n CF INDUSTRIES HOLDINGS, Inc. reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable . Plant turnarounds are accounted for under the deferral method, as opposed to the direct expense or built-in overhaul methods . Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method and are recorded over the estimated useful life of the property, plant and equipment .\n The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset . For property, plant and equipment that is planned for abandonment, we first consider a market or income-based valuation method . Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed .\n We use an income-based valuation method, determining the present value of future cash flows, to estimate fair value .

European Union announced a desire to cap the price that Europe would pay Russia for natural gas deliveries, further contributing to the uncertainty in European energy markets . Given these factors and the lack of a corresponding increase in global nitrogen product market prices, we temporarily idled ammonia production at our Billingham complex in September 2022 .\n The valuation of our asset groups and reporting units required significant judgment in evaluating recent indicators of market activity and estimating future cash flows, discount rates, and other factors . The valuations incorporated assumptions regarding the time it could take for the U.K. energy crisis to be resolved . As a result, in 2023, we recognized total charges of $10.9 million .\n The fair value of our property, plant and equipment in the U.K. operations was estimated using the indirect method of the cost approach by determining the reproduction cost new, or replacement cost, of the assets and applying appropriate adjustments for depreciation including an inutility adjustment based on the cash flows expected to be generated by those asset groups .

In 2023, a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance had been recorded in 2022 was released in the United Kingdom, resulting in a $7.7-million decrease to the deferred . tax assets . of one of our foreign subsidiaries in the . United Kingdom . The excess foreign . tax credits carried forward are not expected to be utilized prior to expiration .\n Based on recent losses generated in the United Kingdom, and projections for future income over the period for which the deferred tax assets will reverse, we believe it is more likely than not that the foreign subsidiary in the U.K. will not realize .
