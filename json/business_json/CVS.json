The Company’s segments maintain separate financial information, and the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“the CODM”) evaluates the segments’ operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The Company’s CODM is the Chief Executive Officer. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based on adjusted operating income (loss). Adjusted operating income is defined as operating income as measured by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance. See the reconciliations of operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income (loss) below for further context regarding the items excluded from operating income in determining adjusted operating income. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the CODM’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company’s segments to the consolidated totals:\nIn millions\nHealth Care\nBenefits\nHealth\nServices \n(1)\nPharmacy &\n Consumer\n Wellness\nCorporate/\nOther\nIntersegment\nEliminations \n(2)\nConsolidated\nTotals\n2024\nTotal revenues\n$\n130,665 \n$\n173,605 \n$\n124,500 \n$\n451 \n$\n(56,412)\n$\n372,809 \nAdjusted operating income (loss)\n307 \n7,243 \n5,774 \n(1,348)\n— \n11,976 \n2023\nTotal revenues\n$\n105,646 \n$\n186,843 \n$\n116,763 \n$\n451 \n$\n(51,927)\n$\n357,776 \nAdjusted operating income (loss)\n5,577 \n7,312 \n5,963 \n(1,318)\n— \n17,534 \n2022\nTotal revenues\n$\n91,350 \n$\n169,576 \n$\n108,596 \n$\n530 \n$\n(47,585)\n$\n322,467 \nAdjusted operating income (loss)\n6,338 \n6,781 \n6,531 \n(1,613)\n— \n18,037 \n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nTotal revenues of the Health Services segment include approximately $11.4 billion, $13.7 billion and $12.6 billion of retail co-payments for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-\n77\nGAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. \n(2)\nThe Company’s net realized capital gains and losses arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of assets that support the payment of insurance liabilities. Net realized capital gains and losses are reflected in net investment income (loss) within each segment. These capital gains and losses are the result of investment decisions, market conditions and other economic developments that are unrelated to the performance of the Company’s business, and the amount and timing of these capital gains and losses do not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding net realized capital gains and losses enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends.\n(3)\nIn 2024, the acquisition-related integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. In 2023, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. The acquisition-related transaction and integration costs are reflected in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment.\n(4)\nIn 2024, the restructuring charges are primarily comprised of a store impairment charge, corporate workforce optimization costs, including severance and employee-related costs, other asset impairment and related charges associated with the discontinuation of certain non-core assets, and a stock-based compensation charge. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and reduce costs. In connection with this restructuring plan, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and determined that it plans to close 271 retail stores in 2025, and, accordingly, it recorded a store impairment charge to write down the associated operating or financing lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company also conducted a review of its various strategic assets and determined that it would discontinue the use of certain non-core assets, at which time impairment losses were recorded to write down the carrying value of these assets to the Company’s best estimate of their fair value. In 2023, the restructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance and employee-related costs, asset impairment charges and a stock-based compensation charge. The restructuring charges associated with the store impairments are reflected within the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, other asset impairments and related charges are reflected within the Corporate/Other and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments and corporate workforce optimization costs, including severance and employee-related costs, as well as stock-based compensation changes, are reflected within the Corporate/Other segment.\n(5)\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company’s evaluation of corporate office real estate space in response to its ongoing flexible work arrangement. The office real estate optimization charges are reflected in operating expenses within each segment. \n(6)\nIn 2024, the opioid litigation charge relates to a change in the Company’s accrual related to ongoing opioid litigation matters. In 2022, the opioid litigation charges relate to agreements to resolve substantially all opioid claims against the Company by certain states and governmental entities. The opioid litigation charges are reflected within the Corporate/Other segment.\n(7)\nIn 2023 and 2022, the loss on assets held for sale relates to the LTC business within the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. During 2022, the Company determined that its LTC business was no longer a strategic asset and committed to a plan to sell it, at which time the LTC business met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and its net assets were accounted for as assets held for sale. The carrying value of the LTC business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and, accordingly, the Company recorded a loss on assets held for sale during 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, a loss on assets held for sale was recorded to write down the carrying value of the LTC business to the Company’s best estimate of the ultimate selling price which reflected its estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of the third quarter of 2023, the Company determined the LTC business no longer met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and, accordingly, the net assets associated with the LTC business were reclassified to held and used at their respective fair values. During 2022, the loss on assets held for sale also relates to the Company’s international health care business domiciled in Thailand (“Thailand business”), which was included in the Commercial Business reporting unit in the Health Care Benefits segment. The sale of the Thailand business closed in the second quarter of 2022, and the ultimate loss on the sale was not material.\n(8)\nIn 2022, the gain on divestiture of subsidiaries represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of bswift, which the Company sold in November 2022, and the pre-tax gain on the sale of PayFlex, which the Company sold in June 2022. The gains on divestitures are reflected as a reduction of operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits segment. \n78\nHealth Care Benefits Segment \nThe following table summarizes the Health Care Benefits segment’s performance for the respective periods:\nChange\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nIn millions, except percentages and basis points (“bps”)\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\nRevenues:\nPremiums\n$\n122,849\n$\n99,144\n$\n85,274\n$\n23,705 \n23.9 \n%\n$\n13,870 \n16.3 \n%\nServices\n6,343\n5,737\n5,600\n606 \n10.6 \n%\n137 \n2.4 \n%\nNet investment income\n1,473\n765\n476\n708 \n92.5 \n%\n289 \n60.7 \n%\nTotal revenues\n130,665\n105,646\n91,350\n25,019 \n23.7 \n%\n14,296 \n15.6 \n%\nHealth care costs\n113,659\n85,504\n71,473\n28,155 \n32.9 \n%\n14,031 \n19.6 \n%\nMBR (Health care costs as a % of premium revenues)\n \n92.5 \n%\n86.2 \n%\n83.8%\n630\nbps\n240\nbps\nOperating expenses\n$\n17,990\n$\n16,193\n$\n14,566\n$\n1,797 \n11.1 \n%\n$\n1,627 \n11.2 \n%\nOperating expenses as a % of total revenues\n13.8 \n%\n15.3 \n%\n15.9 \n%\nLoss on assets held for sale \n$\n— \n$\n— \n$\n41 \n$\n— \n— \n%\n$\n(41)\n(100.0)\n%\nOperating income (loss)\n(984)\n3,949\n5,270\n(4,933)\n(124.9)\n%\n(1,321)\n(25.1)\n%\nOperating income (loss) as a % of total revenues\n(0.8)\n%\n3.7 \n%\n5.8 \n%\nAdjusted operating income \n(1)\n$\n307\n$\n5,577\n$\n6,338\n$\n(5,270)\n(94.5)\n%\n$\n(761)\n(12.0)\n%\nAdjusted operating income as a % of total revenues\n0.2 \n%\n5.3 \n%\n6.9 \n%\nPremium revenues (by business):\nGovernment\n$\n88,433\n$\n70,094\n$\n63,141\n$\n18,339\n26.2 \n%\n$\n6,953\n11.0 \n%\nCommercial\n34,416\n29,050\n22,133\n5,366\n18.5 \n%\n6,917\n31.3 \n%\n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nSee “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Health Care Benefits segment, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.\nCommentary - 2024 compared to 2023\nRevenues\n \n•\nTotal revenues increased $25.0 billion, or 23.7%, in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by growth in the Medicare and individual exchange product lines.\nMedical Benefit Ratio\n•\nMedical benefit ratio is calculated as health care costs divided by premium revenues and represents the percentage of premium revenues spent on medical benefits for the Company’s Insured members. Management uses MBR to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products, understand variances between actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. MBR provides management and investors with information useful in assessing the operating results of the Company’s Insured Health Care Benefits products.\n•\nThe MBR increased from 86.2% to 92.5% in 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased utilization, the unfavorable impact of the Company’s Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2024 payment year and higher acuity in Medicaid following the resumption of redeterminations.\nOperating expenses\n•\nOperating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.\n•\nOperating expenses increased $1.8 billion, or 11.1%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased operating expenses to support the growth across the business. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 13.8% in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 15.3% in the prior year, reflecting improved fixed cost leverage across the business due to membership growth.\n79\nAdjusted operating income\n•\nAdjusted operating income decreased $5.3 billion, or 94.5%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by increased utilization, the unfavorable impact of the Company’s Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2024 payment year and higher acuity in Medicaid. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net investment income and improved fixed cost leverage across the business due to membership growth.\nThe following table summarizes the Health Care Benefits segment’s medical membership as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n2024\n2023\nIn thousands\nInsured\nASC\n \nTotal\nInsured\nASC\nTotal\nMedical membership:\nCommercial\n4,691 \n14,160 \n18,851 \n4,252 \n14,087 \n18,339 \nMedicare Advantage\n4,447 \n— \n4,447 \n3,460 \n— \n3,460 \nMedicare Supplement\n1,282 \n— \n1,282 \n1,343 \n— \n1,343 \nMedicaid\n2,094 \n421 \n2,515 \n2,073 \n444 \n2,517 \nTotal medical membership\n12,514 \n14,581 \n27,095 \n11,128 \n14,531 \n25,659 \nSupplemental membership information:\nMedicare Prescription Drug Plan (standalone)\n4,882 \n6,081 \nMedical Membership\n•\nMedical membership represents the number of members covered by the Company’s Insured and ASC medical products and related services at a specified point in time. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual medical membership and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of medical membership on segment total revenues and operating results.\n•\nMedical membership as of December 31, 2024 of 27.1 million increased 1.4 million members compared with December 31, 2023, reflecting increases in the Medicare and Commercial product lines. \nMedicare Update\nOn April 1, 2024, CMS issued its final notice detailing final 2025 Medicare Advantage payment rates. Final 2025 Medicare Advantage rates resulted in an expected average decrease in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 0.16%, excluding the CMS estimate of Medicare Advantage risk score trend. On January 10, 2025, CMS issued an advance notice detailing proposed 2026 Medicare Advantage payment rates. The 2026 Medicare Advantage rates, if finalized as proposed, will result in an expected average increase in revenue for the Medicare Advantage industry of 2.23%, excluding the CMS estimate of Medicare Advantage risk score trend. CMS intends to publish the final 2026 rate announcement no later than April 7, 2025.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan’s reimbursement to the plan’s “star ratings.” Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for bonus payments. CMS released the Company’s 2025 star ratings in October 2024. The Company’s 2025 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company’s Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2026. Based on the Company’s membership as of December 2024, 88% of the Company’s Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2025 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 91% of the Company’s Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2024 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company’s membership as of December 2023.\n80\nHealth Services Segment\nThe following table summarizes the Health Services segment’s performance for the respective periods:\nChange\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nIn millions, except percentages\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\nRevenues:\nProducts\n$\n162,436\n$\n180,608\n$\n167,019\n$\n(18,172)\n(10.1)\n%\n$\n13,589 \n8.1 \n%\nServices\n10,884\n6,236\n2,557\n4,648 \n74.5 \n%\n3,679\n143.9 \n%\nNet investment income (loss) \n(1)\n285\n(1)\n—\n286 \nNM\n(1)\n(100.0)\n%\nTotal revenues\n173,605\n186,843\n169,576\n(13,238)\n(7.1)\n%\n17,267 \n10.2 \n%\nCost of products sold\n160,036\n175,424\n160,738\n(15,388)\n(8.8)\n%\n14,686 \n9.1 \n%\nHealth care costs\n3,407\n1,607\n—\n1,800 \n112.0 \n%\n1,607 \n100.0 \n%\nOperating expenses\n3,225\n2,970\n2,226\n255 \n8.6 \n%\n744 \n33.4 \n%\nOperating expenses as a % of total revenues\n1.9 \n%\n1.6 \n%\n1.3 \n%\nOperating income\n$\n6,937\n$\n6,842\n$\n6,612\n$\n95 \n1.4 \n%\n$\n230 \n3.5 \n%\nOperating income as a % of total revenues\n4.0 \n%\n3.7 \n%\n3.9 \n%\nAdjusted operating income \n(2)\n$\n7,243\n$\n7,312\n$\n6,781\n$\n(69)\n(0.9)\n%\n$\n531 \n7.8 \n%\nAdjusted operating income as a % of total revenues\n4.2 \n%\n3.9 \n%\n4.0 \n%\nRevenues (by distribution channel):\n \nPharmacy network \n(3)\n$\n91,650\n$\n112,718\n$\n102,968\n$\n(21,068)\n(18.7)\n%\n$\n9,750 \n9.5 \n%\nMail & specialty \n(4)\n70,877\n67,992\n63,825\n2,885 \n4.2 \n%\n4,167 \n6.5 \n%\nOther\n10,793\n6,134\n2,783\n4,659 \n76.0 \n%\n3,351 \n120.4 \n%\nNet investment income (loss)\n (1)\n285\n(1)\n—\n286 \nNM\n(1)\n(100.0)\n%\nPharmacy claims processed\n (5)\n1,917.6\n2,344.3\n2,335.1\n(426.7)\n(18.2)\n%\n9.2 \n0.4 \n%\nGeneric dispensing rate \n(5)\n87.4 \n%\n87.6 \n%\n87.4 \n%\n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nNM represents a percent change that is not meaningful.\n(2)\nSee “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Health Services segment, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.\n(3)\nPharmacy network revenues relate to claims filled at retail and specialty retail pharmacies, including the Company’s retail pharmacies and LTC pharmacies, as well as activity associated with Maintenance Choice, which permits eligible client plan members to fill their maintenance prescriptions through mail order delivery or at a CVS pharmacy retail store for the same price as mail order.\n(4)\nMail & specialty revenues relate to specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect\n®\n claims picked up at a retail pharmacy, as well as mail order and specialty claims fulfilled by the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment.\n(5)\nIncludes an adjustment to convert 90-day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.\nCommentary - 2024 compared to 2023\nRevenues\n•\nTotal revenues decreased $13.2 billion, or 7.1%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by the previously announced loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. These decreases were partially offset by pharmacy drug mix, increased contributions from the Company’s health care delivery assets, including the 2023 acquisitions of Oak Street Health and Signify Health, as well as growth in specialty pharmacy. \nOperating expenses\n•\nOperating expenses in the Health Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; and depreciation and amortization expense.\n•\nOperating expenses increased $255 million, or 8.6%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by operating expenses associated with Oak Street Health which was acquired in May of 2023, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets. \n81\nAdjusted operating income\n•\nAdjusted operating income decreased $69 million, or 0.9%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by continued pharmacy client price improvements and the previously announced loss of a large client. These decreases were largely offset by improved purchasing economics.\n•\nAs you review the Health Services segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n•\nThe Company’s efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company’s ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network “differential” or “spread,” and the Company expects these trends to continue. The “differential” or “spread” is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\nPharmacy claims processed\n•\nPharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through the Company’s pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either its retail network pharmacies or the Company’s mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n•\nThe Company’s pharmacy claims processed decreased 18.2% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by the previously announced loss of a large client. \nGeneric dispensing rate\n•\nGeneric dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Health Services segment’s generic claims processed by its total claims processed. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results. \n•\nThe Health Services segment’s generic dispensing rate decreased to 87.4% in 2024 compared to 87.6% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment’s generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand name GLP-1 pharmacy claims in 2024 compared to 2023.\n82\nPharmacy & Consumer Wellness Segment \nThe following table summarizes the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment’s performance for the respective periods:\nChange\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nIn millions, except percentages\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\nRevenues:\nProducts\n$\n122,028\n$\n113,976\n$\n104,878\n$\n8,052 \n7.1 \n%\n$\n9,098 \n8.7 \n%\nServices\n2,472\n2,792\n3,762\n(320)\n(11.5)\n%\n(970)\n(25.8)\n%\nNet investment income (loss)\n—\n(5)\n(44)\n5 \n100.0 \n%\n39 \n88.6 \n%\nTotal revenues\n124,500\n116,763\n108,596\n7,737 \n6.6 \n%\n8,167 \n7.5 \n%\nCost of products sold \n99,337\n91,447\n82,063\n7,890 \n8.6 \n%\n9,384 \n11.4 \n%\nOperating expenses\n19,646\n19,618\n20,481\n28 \n0.1 \n%\n(863)\n(4.2)\n%\nOperating expenses as a % of total revenues\n15.8 \n%\n16.8 \n%\n18.9 \n%\nRestructuring charges\n$\n747\n$\n—\n$\n—\n$\n747 \n100.0 \n%\n$\n— \n— \n%\nLoss on assets held for sale\n—\n349\n2,492\n(349)\n(100.0)\n%\n(2,143)\n(86.0)\n%\nOperating income\n4,770\n5,349\n3,560\n(579)\n(10.8)\n%\n1,789 \n50.3 \n%\nOperating income as a % of total revenues\n3.8 \n%\n4.6 \n%\n3.3 \n%\nAdjusted operating income \n(1)\n$\n5,774\n$\n5,963\n$\n6,531\n$\n(189)\n(3.2)\n%\n$\n(568)\n(8.7)\n%\nAdjusted operating income as a % of total revenues\n4.6 \n%\n5.1 \n%\n6.0 \n%\nRevenues (by major goods/service lines):\nPharmacy\n$\n100,687\n$\n92,111\n$\n83,480\n$\n8,576 \n9.3 \n%\n$\n8,631 \n10.3 \n%\nFront Store\n21,522\n22,458\n22,780\n(936)\n(4.2)\n%\n(322)\n(1.4)\n%\nOther\n2,291\n2,199\n2,380\n92 \n4.2 \n%\n(181)\n(7.6)\n%\nNet investment income (loss)\n—\n(5)\n(44)\n5 \n100.0 \n%\n39 \n88.6 \n%\nPrescriptions filled \n(2)\n1,715.5\n1,649.1\n1,625.4\n66.4 \n4.0 \n%\n23.7 \n1.5 \n%\nSame store sales increase (decrease): \n(3)\nTotal\n9.4 \n%\n10.7 \n%\n9.1 \n%\nPharmacy\n12.3 \n%\n13.6 \n%\n9.5 \n%\nFront Store\n(2.1)\n%\n0.3 \n%\n7.8 \n%\nPrescription volume \n(2)\n6.8 \n%\n3.9 \n%\n4.0 \n%\nGeneric dispensing rate \n(2)\n88.9 \n%\n88.4 \n%\n87.4 \n%\n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nSee “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of operating income (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating income for the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.\n(2)\nIncludes an adjustment to convert 90‑day prescriptions to the equivalent of three 30‑day prescriptions.

Same store metrics exclude revenues and prescriptions from LTC and infusion services operations. Management uses these metrics to evaluate the performance of existing stores on a comparable basis and to inform future decisions regarding existing stores and new locations. Same-store metrics provide management and investors with information useful in understanding the portion of current revenues and prescriptions resulting from organic growth in existing locations versus the portion resulting from opening new stores.\nCommentary - 2024 compared to 2023\nRevenues\n \n•\nTotal revenues increased $7.7 billion, or 6.6%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by pharmacy drug mix and increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, the impact of recent generic introductions and decreased \n83\nfront store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter (“OTC”) test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n•\nPharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n•\nFront store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\nOperating expenses\n•\nOperating expenses in the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment’s stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n•\nOperating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment’s operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\nRestructuring charges\n•\nDuring 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company’s restructuring program. See Note 3 ‘‘Restructuring’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n Loss on assets held for sale\n•\nDuring 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\nAdjusted operating income\n•\nAdjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing. \n•\nAs you review the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment’s performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n•\nThe segment’s adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\nPrescriptions filled\n•\nPrescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment’s retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n•\nPrescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count. \nGeneric dispensing rate\n•\nGeneric dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment’s generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results. \n84\n•\nThe Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment’s generic dispensing rate increased to 88.9% in 2024 compared to 88.4% in the prior year. The increase in the segment’s generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by the impact of new generic drug introductions and the Company’s ongoing efforts to encourage plan members to use generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate. \n85\nCorporate/Other Segment\nThe following table summarizes the Corporate/Other segment’s performance for the respective periods:\nChange\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nIn millions, except percentages\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\nRevenues:\nPremiums\n$\n47 \n$\n48\n$\n56\n$\n(1)\n(2.1)\n%\n$\n(8)\n(14.3)\n%\nServices\n9 \n9\n68\n— \n— \n%\n(59)\n(86.8)\n%\nNet investment income\n395 \n394\n406\n1 \n0.3 \n%\n(12)\n(3.0)\n%\nTotal revenues\n451 \n451\n530\n— \n— \n%\n(79)\n(14.9)\n%\nCost of products sold\n— \n1\n42\n(1)\n(100.0)\n%\n(41)\n(97.6)\n%\nHealth care costs\n187 \n210\n249\n(23)\n(11.0)\n%\n(39)\n(15.7)\n%\nOperating expenses\n1,939 \n2,130\n1,924\n(191)\n(9.0)\n%\n206 \n10.7 \n%\nRestructuring charges\n432 \n507\n—\n(75)\n(14.8)\n%\n507 \n100.0 \n%\nOpioid litigation charges\n100 \n—\n5,803\n100 \n100.0 \n%\n(5,803)\n(100.0)\n%\nOperating loss\n(2,207)\n(2,397)\n(7,488)\n190 \n7.9 \n%\n5,091 \n68.0 \n%\nAdjusted operating loss\n (1)\n(1,348)\n(1,318)\n(1,613)\n(30)\n(2.3)\n%\n295 \n18.3 \n%\n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nSee “Segment Analysis” above in this MD&A for a reconciliation of Corporate/Other segment operating loss (GAAP measure) to adjusted operating loss, which represents the Company’s principal measure of segment performance.\nCommentary - 2024 compared to 2023\nRevenues\n•\nRevenues primarily relate to products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, such as large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.\n•\nTotal revenues of $451 million in 2024 remained consistent compared to 2023. \nRestructuring charges\n•\nDuring 2024, the Company recorded $432 million of restructuring charges comprised of $129 million of asset impairment and related charges associated with the write-down of certain non-core assets, $293 million of severance and employee-related costs associated with corporate workforce optimization and a $10 million stock-based compensation charge associated with the impacted employees. During 2023, the Company recorded $507 million in pre-tax restructuring charges, comprised of $344 million of severance and employee-related costs associated with corporate workforce optimization, $152 million of asset impairment charges and an $11 million stock-based compensation charge associated with the impacted employees. See Note 3 ‘‘Restructuring’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\nAdjusted operating loss\n•\nAdjusted operating loss of $1.3 billion in 2024 remained relatively consistent compared to 2023. \n86\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nThe Company maintains a level of liquidity sufficient to allow it to meet its cash needs in the short-term. Over the long term, the Company manages its cash and capital structure to maximize shareholder return, maintain its financial condition and maintain flexibility for future strategic initiatives. The Company continuously assesses its regulatory capital requirements, working capital needs, debt and leverage levels, debt maturity schedule, capital expenditure requirements, dividend payouts, potential share repurchases and future investments or acquisitions. The Company believes its operating cash flows, commercial paper program, credit facilities, as well as any potential future borrowings, will be sufficient to fund these future payments and long-term initiatives. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $8.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $3.8 billion of which was held by the parent company or nonrestricted subsidiaries.\nThe net change in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nChange\nYear Ended December 31,\n2024 vs. 2023\n2023 vs. 2022\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\n$\n%\n$\n%\nNet cash provided by operating activities\n$\n9,107 \n$\n13,426 \n$\n16,177 \n$\n(4,319)\n(32.2)\n%\n$\n(2,751)\n(17.0)\n%\nNet cash used in investing activities\n(7,613)\n(20,889)\n(5,047)\n13,276 \n63.6 \n%\n(15,842)\n(313.9)\n%\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n(1,135)\n2,683 \n(10,516)\n(3,818)\n(142.3)\n%\n13,199 \n125.5 \n%\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n$\n359 \n$\n(4,780)\n$\n614 \n$\n5,139 \n107.5 \n%\n$\n(5,394)\n(878.5)\n%\nCommentary - 2024 compared to 2023\n•\nNet cash provided by operating activities \ndecreased by $4.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the impact of elevated Medicare utilization on earnings.\n•\nNet cash used in investing activities \ndecreased by $13.3 billion in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to the acquisitions of Oak Street Health in May 2023 and Signify Health in March 2023, partially offset by higher net purchases of investments. In addition, cash used in investing activities reflected the following activity:\n•\nGross capital expenditures were approximately $2.8 billion and $3.0 billion in 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024, approximately 76% of the Company’s total capital expenditures were for technology, digital and other strategic initiatives and 24% were for store, fulfillment and support and improvements.\n•\nNet cash used in financing activities\n was $1.1 billion in 2024 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $2.7 billion in 2023. The change in cash provided by (used in) financing activities primarily related to lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and higher repayments of long-term debt in 2024 compared to the prior year, as well as higher repurchases of common stock in 2024, partially offset by higher proceeds from commercial paper borrowings compared to the prior year.\nIncluded in net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was the following store development activity: \n(1)\n2024\n2023\n2022\nTotal stores (beginning of year)\n9,395 \n9,674 \n9,939 \nNew and acquired stores \n(2)\n39 \n39 \n41 \nClosed stores \n(2)\n(299)\n(318)\n(306)\nTotal stores (end of year)\n9,135 \n9,395 \n9,674 \nRelocated stores \n(2)\n3 \n5 \n4 \n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nIncludes retail drugstores and pharmacies within retail chains, primarily in Target Corporation (“Target”) stores.\n(2)\nRelocated stores are not included in new and acquired stores or closed stores totals.\n87\nShort-term Borrowings\nCommercial Paper and Back-up Credit Facilities\nThe Company had $2.1 billion of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 4.98% as of December 31, 2024. The Company had $200 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted interest rate of 4.31% as of December 31, 2023. In connection with its commercial paper program, the Company maintains a $2.5 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 11, 2027, a $2.5 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 16, 2028, and a $2.5 billion, five-year unsecured back-up revolving credit facility, which expires on May 16, 2029. The credit facilities allow for borrowings at various rates that are dependent, in part, on the Company’s public debt ratings and require the Company to pay a weighted average quarterly facility fee of approximately 0.03%, regardless of usage. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no borrowings outstanding under any of the Company’s back-up credit facilities.\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn March 25, 2024, the Company entered into a 364-day $3.0 billion term loan credit agreement. The term loan credit agreement allowed for borrowings at various rates that were dependent, in part, on the Company’s public debt ratings. On May 9, 2024, following the issuance of the $5.0 billion in senior notes described under “Long-term Borrowings” below, the term loan credit agreement terminated. There were no borrowings under the term loan credit agreement through the date of termination.\nOn May 1, 2023, the Company entered into a 364-day $5.0 billion term loan agreement. The term loan agreement allowed for borrowings at various rates that were dependent, in part, on the Company’s debt ratings. On May 2, 2023, the Company borrowed $5.0 billion at an interest rate of approximately 6.2% under the term loan agreement to fund a portion of the Oak Street Health acquisition purchase price. On June 2, 2023, the Company repaid the outstanding balance under the term loan agreement.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”)\nA subsidiary of the Company is a member of the FHLBB. As a member, the subsidiary has the ability to obtain cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. The maximum borrowing capacity available from the FHLBB as of December 31, 2024 was approximately $1.2 billion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no outstanding advances from the FHLBB.\nLong-term Borrowings\n2024 Notes\nOn December 10, 2024, the Company issued $2.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 7.0% fixed-to-fixed rate series A junior subordinated notes due March 2055 and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% fixed-to-fixed rate series B junior subordinated notes due December 2054 for total proceeds of approximately $3.0 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The series A junior subordinated notes bear interest at 7.0% per year until March 10, 2030, at which time the rate will reset March 10th of every fifth year, provided that the interest rate will not reset below the initial interest rate. The series B junior subordinated notes bear interest at 6.75% per year until December 10, 2034, at which time the rate will reset December 10th of every fifth year, provided that the interest rate will not reset below the initial interest rate. The series A and series B junior subordinated notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed at any time beginning 90 days prior to their respective first interest rate reset date and on any interest payment date thereafter, in whole or in part at a defined redemption price plus accrued interest. The net proceeds of these offerings were used for the early extinguishment of certain of the Company’s senior notes as described below and the remaining proceeds after the early extinguishment of debt were used for general corporate purposes.\nOn May 9, 2024, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.4% senior notes due June 2029, $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.55% senior notes due June 2031, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.7% senior notes due June 2034, $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due June 2044 and $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 6.05% senior notes due June 2054 for total proceeds of approximately $5.0 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The net proceeds of these offerings were used for general corporate purposes.\n2023 Notes\nOn June 2, 2023, the Company issued $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior notes due January 2029, $750 million aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due January 2031, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.3% senior notes due June 2033, $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due June 2053 and \n88\n$750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.0% senior notes due June 2063 for total proceeds of approximately $4.9 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The net proceeds of these offerings were used, along with cash on hand, to repay the outstanding balance under the term loan agreement described above.\nOn February 21, 2023, the Company issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior notes due February 2026, $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due February 2030, $1.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due February 2033 and $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due February 2053 for total proceeds of approximately $6.0 billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The net proceeds of these offerings were used to fund general corporate purposes, including a portion of the Signify Health acquisition purchase price.\nOak Street Health Convertible Notes\nPrior to the Oak Street Health acquisition, Oak Street Health held 0% convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $920 million (the “Convertible Notes”), which were assumed by the Company in connection with the Oak Street Health acquisition. The Oak Street Health acquisition constituted a fundamental change in the Convertible Notes giving the holders the right to require the Company to repurchase the Convertible Notes. The repurchase price was an amount in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes. On May 31, 2023, the Company issued a notice of repurchase to the holders of the Convertible Notes. In connection with this notice, $917 million of the Convertible Notes were submitted for repurchase and settled on July 21, 2023. Substantially all of the remaining $3 million of the Convertible Notes were submitted for repurchase and settled on October 20, 2023. \nGain on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nIn December 2024, pursuant to a cash tender offer, the Company repaid approximately $2.6 billion of its outstanding senior notes for a cash payment of approximately $2.0 billion. The senior notes purchased include: $226 million of its 4.1% senior notes due March 2025, $398 million of its 4.125% senior notes due April 2040, $883 million of its 2.7% senior notes due August 2040, $274 million of its 4.125% senior notes due November 2042, $463 million of its 3.875% senior notes due August 2047 and $351 million of its 4.25% senior notes due April 2050. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company recognized a total gain on early extinguishment of debt of $491 million, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred fees.\nSee Note 10 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information about debt issuances and debt repayments. \nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. \nDebt Covenants\nThe Company’s back-up revolving credit facilities and unsecured senior notes (see Note 10 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K) contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. These covenants do not include an acceleration of the Company’s debt maturities in the event of a downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings. The Company does not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect its financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.\nDebt Ratings\n \nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company’s long-term debt was rated “BBB” by Fitch Ratings, Inc. (“Fitch”), “Baa3” by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (“Moody’s”) and “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (“S&P”), and its commercial paper program was rated “F2” by Fitch, “P-3” by Moody’s and “A-2” by S&P. In August 2024, Moody’s and S&P changed their outlook on the Company’s long-term debt from “Stable” to “Negative.” In October 2024, Moody’s placed the Company’s long-term debt ratings and the Company’s commercial paper program on review for downgrade. Subsequently, in December 2024, Moody’s downgraded the Company’s long-term debt rating to “Baa3” and the Company’s commercial paper rating to “P3” and changed their outlook on the Company to “Stable”. In December 2024, Fitch initiated ratings coverage on the Company and assigned a first-time “BBB” rating to the Company’s long-term debt and a “F2” rating to the Company’s commercial paper program with the outlook on the Company of “Negative”. In assessing the Company’s credit strength, the Company believes that Moody’s, S&P and Fitch considered, among other things, the Company’s capital structure and financial \n89\npolicies, as well as its consolidated balance sheet, its historical acquisition activity and other financial information, including the Company’s expectations for future earnings and cash flows. Although the Company currently believes its long-term debt ratings will remain investment grade, it cannot predict the future actions of Moody’s, S&P and/or Fitch. The Company’s debt ratings have a direct impact on its future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs. \nShare Repurchase Programs\nThe following share repurchase programs have been authorized by CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Directors (the “Board”):\nThe following share repurchase programs have been authorized by the Board:\nIn billions\nAuthorization Date\nAuthorized\nRemaining as of\nDecember 31, 2024\nNovember 17, 2022 (“2022 Repurchase Program”)\n$\n10.0 \n$\n10.0 \nDecember 9, 2021 (“2021 Repurchase Program”)\n10.0 \n1.5 \nEach of the share Repurchase Programs was effective immediately and permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. Both the 2022 and 2021 Repurchase Programs can be modified or terminated by the Board at any time.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased an aggregate of 39.7 million shares of common stock for approximately $3.0 billion, an aggregate of 22.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.0 billion and an aggregate of 34.1 million shares of common stock for approximately $3.5 billion, respectively, each pursuant to the 2021 Repurchase Program. This activity includes the share repurchases under the ASR transactions described below.\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $3.0 billion fixed dollar ASR with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”). Upon payment of the $3.0 billion purchase price on January 4, 2024, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock equal to 85% of the $3.0 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 31.4 million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2024. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $2.6 billion and a forward contract for $0.4 billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In March 2024, the Company received approximately 8.3 million shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock, representing the remaining 15% of the $3.0 billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in March 2024.\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $2.0 billion fixed dollar ASR with Citibank, N.A. Upon payment of the $2.0 billion purchase price on January 4, 2023, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock equal to 80% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 17.4 million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2023. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $1.6 billion and a forward contract for $0.4 billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In February 2023, the Company received approximately 5.4 million shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $2.0 billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury stock and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in February 2023.\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $1.5 billion fixed dollar ASR with Barclays Bank PLC. Upon payment of the $1.5 billion purchase price on January 4, 2022, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock equal to 80% of the $1.5 billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately 11.6 million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2022. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $1.2 billion and a forward contract for $0.3 billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In February 2022, the Company received approximately 2.7 million shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock, representing the remaining 20% of the $1.5 billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury stock and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in February 2022.\n90\nAt the time they were received, the initial and final receipt of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.\nDividends\nDuring 2024, 2023 and 2022 the quarterly cash dividend was $0.665, $0.605 and $0.55 per share, respectively.  CVS Health Corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company and expects to maintain its quarterly dividend of $0.665 per share throughout 2025. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company’s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Board.\n91\nFuture Cash Requirements\nThe following table summarizes certain estimated future cash requirements under the Company’s various contractual obligations at December 31, 2024, in total and disaggregated into current and long-term obligations. The table below does not include future payments of claims to health care providers or pharmacies because certain terms of these payments are not determinable at December 31, 2024 (for example, the timing and volume of future services provided under fee-for-service arrangements and future membership levels for capitated arrangements). \nIn millions\nTotal\nCurrent\nLong-Term\nOperating lease liabilities \n(1)\n$\n21,189 \n$\n2,683 \n$\n18,506 \nFinance lease liabilities \n(1)\n2,038 \n144 \n1,894 \nContractual lease obligations with Target \n(2)\n2,217 \n— \n2,217 \nCommercial paper \n(3)\n2,119 \n2,119 \n— \nLong-term debt \n(3)\n63,268 \n3,559 \n59,709 \nInterest payments on long-term debt \n(3)\n42,240 \n2,892 \n39,348 \nOpioid litigation settlement obligations \n(4)\n4,792 \n814 \n3,978 \nOther long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets \n(5) \nFuture policy benefits\n (6) \n4,560 \n371 \n4,189 \nUnpaid claims\n (6) \n993 \n280 \n713 \nPolicyholders’ funds \n(6) (7)\n1,270 \n869 \n401 \nTotal\n$\n144,686 \n$\n13,731 \n$\n130,955 \n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nRefer to Note 7 ‘‘Leases’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information regarding the maturity of lease liabilities under operating and finance leases. \n(2)\nThe Company leases pharmacy and clinic space from Target. See Note 7 ‘‘Leases’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information regarding the lease arrangements with Target. Amounts related to such operating and finance leases are reflected within the operating lease liabilities and finance lease liabilities in the table above. Pharmacy lease amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings are reflected in the table above assuming equivalent stores continue to operate through the term of the arrangements. \n(3)\nRefer to Note 10 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information regarding the maturities of debt principal and commercial paper borrowings. Interest payments on long-term debt are calculated using outstanding balances and interest rates in effect on December 31, 2024.\n(4)\nRefer to Note 18 ‘‘Commitments and Contingencies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information regarding the opioid litigation settlement obligations. \n(5)\nPayments of other long-term liabilities exclude Separate Accounts liabilities of approximately $3.3 billion because these liabilities are supported by assets that are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business.\n(6)\nTotal payments of future policy benefits, unpaid claims and policyholders’ funds include $566 million, $911 million and $137 million, respectively, of reserves for contracts subject to reinsurance. The Company expects the assuming reinsurance carrier to fund these obligations and has reflected these amounts as reinsurance recoverable assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(7)\nCustomer funds associated with group life and health contracts of approximately $52 million have been excluded from the table above because such funds may be used primarily at the customer’s discretion to offset future premiums and/or for refunds, and the timing of the related cash flows cannot be determined. Additionally, net unrealized capital losses on debt securities supporting experience-rated products of $25 million, before tax, have been excluded from the table above.\nRestrictions on Certain Payments\nIn addition to general state law restrictions on payments of dividends and other distributions to stockholders applicable to all corporations, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and insurance companies are subject to further regulations that, among other things, may require those companies to maintain certain levels of equity (referred to as surplus) and restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their equity holders. These regulations are not directly applicable to CVS Health Corporation as a holding company since CVS Health Corporation is not an HMO or an insurance company. In addition, in connection with the Aetna Acquisition, the Company made certain undertakings that require prior regulatory approval of dividends by certain of its HMOs and insurance companies. The additional regulations and undertakings applicable to the Company’s HMO and insurance company subsidiaries are not expected to affect the Company’s ability to service the Company’s debt, meet other financing obligations or pay dividends, or the ability of any of the Company’s subsidiaries to service their debt or other financing obligations. Under applicable regulatory requirements and undertakings, at December 31, 2024, the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid by the Company’s insurance and HMO subsidiaries without prior approval by regulatory authorities was $1.6 billion in the aggregate. \nThe Company maintains capital levels in its operating subsidiaries at or above targeted and/or required capital levels and dividends amounts in excess of these levels to meet liquidity requirements, including the payment of interest on debt and \n92\nstockholder dividends. In addition, at the Company’s discretion, it uses these funds for other purposes such as funding share and debt repurchase programs, investments in new businesses and other purposes considered advisable. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held investments of $269 million and $307 million, respectively, that are not accounted for as Separate Accounts assets but are legally segregated and are not subject to claims that arise out of the Company’s business. See Note 4 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on investments related to the 2012 conversion of an existing group annuity contract from a participating to a non-participating contract.\nSolvency Regulation\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) utilizes risk-based capital (“RBC”) standards for insurance companies that are designed to identify weakly-capitalized companies by comparing each company’s adjusted surplus to its required surplus (the “RBC Ratio”). The RBC Ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of insurance companies. Within certain ratio ranges, regulators have increasing authority to take action as the RBC Ratio decreases. There are four levels of regulatory action, ranging from requiring an insurer to submit a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its RBC to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control. At December 31, 2024, all of the Company’s insurance and HMO subsidiaries were above the RBC level that would require regulatory action. The RBC framework described above for insurers has been extended by the NAIC to health organizations, including HMOs. Although not all states had adopted these rules at December 31, 2024, at that date each of the Company’s active HMOs had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or, where adopted, the levels that would require regulatory action under the NAIC’s RBC rules. External rating agencies use their own capital models and/or RBC standards when they determine a company’s rating.\n93\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company prepares the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make certain estimates and apply judgment. Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, the Company reviews its accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements. While the Company believes the historical experience, current trends and other factors considered by management support the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from estimates, and such differences could be material.\nSignificant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K. Management believes the following accounting policies include a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity and, thus, are considered to be critical accounting policies. The Company has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the Audit Committee of the Board (the “Audit Committee”), and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures relating to them.\nRevenue Recognition\nHealth Care Benefits Segment\nHealth Care Benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue related to the Company’s Government business is collected monthly from the U.S. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility. \nSome of the Company’s Government contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such adjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.\nHealth Services Segment\nThe Health Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its specialty and mail order pharmacy offerings and indirectly through the Company’s retail pharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the fulfillment of prescription drugs.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions fulfilled indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.\nRevenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and refunds paid back to the client, (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail order prescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions, and (iii) claims based administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts. Sales taxes are not included in revenues. \nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the Health Services segment:\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the Company’s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the Company has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by specialty and mail order pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the client plan member. At the time of delivery, the Company has performed substantially \n94\nall of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nFor contracts under which the Company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognized using the net method.\nDrug Discounts\nThe Company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. The Company estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients. The estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. The Company adjusts its rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.\nImpairments of Debt Securities\nThe Company regularly reviews its debt securities to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related (yield-related) components. The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). The Company analyzes all facts and circumstances believed to be relevant for each investment when performing this analysis, in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nIn evaluating whether a credit related loss exists, the Company considers a variety of factors including: the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of a security, an industry or geographic area; the payment structure of the security; the failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principle payments; and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. \nAmong the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred are whether the decline results from a change in the quality of the debt security itself, whether the decline results from a downward movement in the market as a whole, and the prospects for realizing the carrying value of the debt security based on the investment’s current and short-term prospects for recovery. For unrealized losses determined to be the result of market conditions (for example, increasing interest rates and volatility due to conditions in the overall market) or industry-related events, the Company determines whether it intends to sell the debt security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the debt security prior to the anticipated recovery of the debt security’s amortized cost basis. If either case is true, the Company recognizes a non-credit related impairment, and the cost basis or carrying amount of the debt security is written down to fair value.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded yield-related impairment losses on debt securities of $73 million, $152 million and $143 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded credit-related losses on debt securities of $9 million, $3 million and $13 million, respectively.\nThe risks inherent in assessing the impairment of a debt security include the risk that market factors may differ from projections and the risk that facts and circumstances factored into the Company’s assessment may change with the passage of time. Unexpected changes to market factors and circumstances that were not present in past reporting periods are among the factors that may result in a current period decision to sell debt securities that were not impaired in prior reporting periods.\nInventory\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method.\n95\nThe value of ending inventory is reduced for estimated inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated. The Company’s accounting for inventory contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate the inventory losses that have occurred during the interim period between physical inventory counts. When estimating these losses, a number of factors are considered which include historical physical inventory results on a location-by-location basis and current physical inventory loss trends.\nThe total reserve for estimated inventory losses covered by this critical accounting policy was $600 million and $607 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Although management believes there is sufficient current and historical information available to record reasonable estimates for estimated inventory losses, it is possible that actual results could differ. In order to help investors assess the aggregate risk, if any, associated with the inventory-related uncertainties discussed above, a ten percent (10%) pre-tax change in estimated inventory losses, which is a reasonably likely change, would increase or decrease the total reserve for estimated inventory losses by approximately $60 million as of December 31, 2024.\nAlthough management believes that the estimates discussed above are reasonable and the related calculations conform to generally accepted accounting principles, actual results could differ from such estimates, and such differences could be material.\nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nRecoverability of Definite-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable. The Company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted).\nThe long-lived asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate each asset group’s future sales, profitability and cash flows. When preparing these estimates, the Company considers historical results and current operating trends and consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic and regulatory conditions, efforts of third party organizations to reduce their prescription drug costs and/or increased member co-payments, the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share and consumer spending patterns.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, in connection with its enterprise-wide restructuring plan, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business, which included evaluating changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health requirements to ensure continued alignment of its retail footprint with consumer needs. In connection with this initiative, in September 2024, the Company determined it planned to close 271 retail stores in 2025. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores’ asset groups, including the associated operating or financing lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. A long-lived asset impairment test was performed during the third quarter of 2024, the results of which indicated that the fair value of certain retail store asset groups were lower than their respective carrying values. Accordingly, in the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of $607 million, consisting of a write down of $483 million related to operating and financing lease right-of-use assets and $124 million related to property and equipment. The charge associated with the store impairments was included in the restructuring charges within the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment.\nRecoverability of Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquisitions over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is tested for impairment on a reporting unit basis. The impairment test is performed by comparing the reporting unit’s fair value with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. The \n96\nfair value of the reporting units is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the net book value (carrying amount) of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the reporting unit’s goodwill is considered to be impaired, and an impairment is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nThe determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires the Company to make significant assumptions and estimates. These assumptions and estimates primarily include the selection of appropriate peer group companies; control premiums and valuation multiples appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; discount rates; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization, income taxes, capital expenditures and future working capital requirements. When determining these assumptions and preparing these estimates, the Company considers each reporting unit’s historical results and current operating trends; consolidated revenues, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts; and industry trends. The Company’s estimates can be affected by a number of factors, including general economic and regulatory conditions; the risk-free interest rate environment; the Company’s market capitalization; efforts of customers and payers to reduce costs, including their prescription drug costs, and/or increase member co-payments; the continued efforts of competitors to gain market share; consumer spending patterns; and the Company’s ability to achieve its revenue growth projections and execute on its cost reduction initiatives. \n2024 Goodwill Impairment Test\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The fair values of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the Government reporting unit and the Health Care Delivery reporting unit which exceeded their carrying values by approximately 4% and 8%, respectively.\nDuring 2024, the Government reporting unit within the Health Care Benefits segment experienced continued elevated utilization pressure in Medicare and higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations in Medicaid, which have resulted in higher medical benefit ratios and lower gross margins than those originally estimated when the prior year annual goodwill impairment test was performed. Upon assessment of the impact of these factors on the Company’s year-to-date 2024 results and its expectations for the full year, the Company determined there were indicators that the Government reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired, and accordingly, performed an interim goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2024. The results of the interim goodwill impairment test showed that the fair value of the Government reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 10%, therefore there was no impairment of goodwill as of the interim testing date. During the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company updated its budget for 2025 and outlook for future years and performed its annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of the impairment test showed that the fair value of the Government reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 4%, therefore there was no impairment of goodwill as of the annual testing date.\nAlthough the Company believes the financial projections used to determine the fair value of the Government reporting unit were reasonable and achievable, continued utilization pressure within the Medicare product line and continued higher acuity in Medicaid may affect the Company’s ability to increase operating income in the Government reporting unit at the rate estimated when such goodwill impairment test was performed. Some of the key assumptions included in the Company’s financial projections to determine the estimated fair value of its Government reporting unit include future health care costs, changes in medical membership, revenue growth rates, operating margins and operating expense ratios. The estimated fair value of the Government reporting unit is also dependent on multiples of market participants in the health insurance industry, as well as the risk-free interest rate environment which impacts the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow method. As of December 31, 2024, the goodwill balance in the Government reporting unit was approximately $21.2 billion.\nIn 2023, the Company formed a new Health Care Delivery reporting unit within the Health Services segment. The Health Care Delivery reporting unit is primarily comprised of the Signify Health and Oak Street Health care delivery assets, which were acquired on March 29, 2023 and May 2, 2023, respectively. These transactions were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires, among other things, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values at the date of acquisition. Given the close proximity of the acquisition dates to the 2024 annual impairment test of goodwill, as expected, the fair value of these two businesses and, therefore, of the Health Care Delivery reporting unit, remained relatively in line with the carrying value of the reporting unit. This fair value estimate is sensitive to significant assumptions including the revenue growth rate, operating income and the discount rate. As of December 31, 2024, the goodwill balance in the Health Care Delivery reporting unit was $10.4 billion.\n2023 Goodwill Impairment Test\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The fair values of the reporting units \n97\nwith goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins, with the exception of the Health Care Delivery reporting unit, which exceeded its carrying value by approximately 9%.\n2022 Goodwill Impairment Test\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date. The fair values of the reporting units with goodwill exceeded their carrying values by significant margins.\nRecoverability of Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment reviews, or more frequent reviews if events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.\nThe indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty since management must use judgment to estimate fair value based on the assumption that, in lieu of ownership of an intangible asset, the Company would be willing to pay a royalty in order to utilize the benefits of the asset. Fair value is estimated by discounting the hypothetical royalty payments to their present value over the estimated economic life of the asset. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including general economic conditions, availability of market information and the profitability of the Company. There were no impairment losses recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nHealth Care Benefits’ IBNR Liabilities\nThe Health Care Benefits segment’s health care costs payable include estimates of the ultimate cost of (i) services rendered to the segment’s Insured members but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid (collectively, “IBNR”). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. IBNR estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the Company’s reserving methodology.\nDuring 2024 and 2023, the segment observed an increase in completion factors relative to those assumed at the prior year end. After considering the claims paid in 2024 and 2023 with dates of service prior to the fourth quarter of the previous year, the segment observed assumed incurred claim weighted average completion factors that were 23 and 4 basis points higher, respectively, than previously estimated, resulting in a decrease of $339 million and $55 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to the prior year. The segment has considered the pattern of changes in its completion factors when determining the completion factors used in its estimates of IBNR as of December 31, 2024. However, based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the estimated weighted average completion factors may vary by plus or minus 9 basis points from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by approximately plus or minus $202 million pretax.\nAlso, during 2024 and 2023, the Health Care Benefits segment observed that health care costs for claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date were lower than previously estimated. Specifically, after considering the claims paid in 2024 and 2023 with claim incurred dates for the fourth quarter of the previous year, the segment observed health care costs that were 3.2% and 4.5% lower, respectively, for each fourth quarter than previously estimated, resulting in a reduction of $546 million and $620 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively, in health care costs payable that related to prior year.\nManagement considers historical health care cost trend rates together with its knowledge of recent events that may impact current trends when developing estimates of current health care cost trend rates. When establishing reserves as of December 31, 2024, the segment increased its assumed health care cost trend rates for the most recent three months by 3.4% from health care cost trend rates recently observed. Based on historical claim experience, it is reasonably possible that the segment’s estimated health care cost trend rates may vary by plus or minus 3.5% from the assumed rates, which could impact health care costs payable by plus or minus $808 million pretax.\n98\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for a description of new accounting pronouncements applicable to the Company.\n99\nTable of Contents\nItem 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nThe Company’s earnings and financial condition are exposed to interest rate risk, credit quality risk, market valuation risk, foreign currency risk, commodity risk and operational risk.\nEvaluation of Interest Rate and Credit Quality Risk\nThe Company manages interest rate risk by seeking to maintain a tight match between the durations of assets and liabilities when appropriate. The Company manages credit quality risk by seeking to maintain high average credit quality ratings and diversified sector exposure within its debt securities portfolio. In connection with its investment and risk management objectives, the Company also uses derivative financial instruments whose market value is at least partially determined by, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets or credit ratings/spreads. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps. These instruments, viewed separately, subject the Company to varying degrees of interest rate, equity price and credit risk. However, when used for hedging, the Company expects these instruments to reduce overall risk.\nInvestments\nThe Company’s investment portfolio supported the following products at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nExperience-rated products \n$\n652 \n$\n723 \nRemaining products\n30,689 \n25,555 \nTotal investments\n$\n31,341 \n$\n26,278 \nInvestment risks associated with experience-rated products generally do not impact the Company’s operating results. The risks associated with investments supporting experience-rated pension and annuity products in the large case pensions business in the Company’s Corporate/Other segment are assumed by the contract holders and not by the Company (subject to, among other things, certain minimum guarantees). Assets supporting experience-rated products may be subject to contract holder or participant withdrawals.\nThe debt securities in the Company’s investment portfolio had an average credit quality rating of A at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, with a fair value of approximately $5.9 billion and $4.6 billion rated AAA at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The fair value of debt securities that were rated below investment grade (that is, having a credit quality rating below BBB-/Baa3) was $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively (of which 1.6% and 1.5% at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, supported experience-rated products).\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held $82 million and $218 million, respectively, of municipal debt securities that were guaranteed by third parties, representing less than 1% and 1% of total investments at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA+ at both December 31, 2024 and 2023, with the guarantee. These securities had an average credit quality rating of AA and AA- at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, without the guarantee. The Company does not have any significant concentration of investments with third party guarantors (either direct or indirect).\nThe Company generally classifies debt securities as available for sale, and carries them at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. At both December 31, 2024 and 2023, less than 1% of debt securities were valued using inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions (categorized as Level 3 inputs in accordance with GAAP). See Note 5 ‘‘Fair Value’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information on the methodologies and key assumptions used to determine the fair value of investments. For additional information related to investments, see Note 4 ‘‘Investments’’ included in Item 8 of this 10-K.\nThe Company regularly reviews debt securities in its portfolio to determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis or carrying value has occurred. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related components. The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other \n100\ncomprehensive income (loss). The impairment of debt securities is considered a critical accounting policy. See ‘‘Critical Accounting Policies - Impairments of Debt Securities” in the MD&A included in Item 7 of this 10-K for additional information.\nEvaluation of Market Valuation Risks\nThe Company regularly evaluates its risk from market-sensitive instruments by examining, among other things, levels of or changes in interest rates (short-term or long-term), duration, prepayment rates, equity markets and/or credit ratings/spreads. The Company also regularly evaluates the appropriateness of investments relative to management-approved investment guidelines (and operates within those guidelines) and the business objectives of its portfolios.\nOn a quarterly basis, the Company reviews the impact of hypothetical net losses in its investment portfolio on the Company’s consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results and cash flows assuming the occurrence of certain reasonably possible changes in near-term market rates and prices. Interest rate changes (whether resulting from changes in treasury yields or credit spreads or other factors) represent the most material risk exposure category for the Company. The Company has estimated the impact on the fair value of market sensitive instruments based on the net present value of cash flows using a representative set of likely future interest rate scenarios. The assumptions used were as follows: an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates (which the Company believes represents a moderately adverse scenario) for long-term debt issued by the Company, as well as its interest rate sensitive investments and an immediate decrease of 15% in prices for publicly traded domestic equity securities in the Company’s investment portfolio.\nAssuming an immediate increase of 100 basis points in interest rates, the theoretical decline in the fair values of market sensitive instruments at December 31, 2024 is as follows:\n•\nThe fair value of long-term debt issued by the Company would decline by approximately $3.3 billion ($4.1 billion pretax). Changes in the fair value of long-term debt do not impact the Company’s operating results or financial condition.\n•\nThe theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive investments partially offset by the theoretical reduction in the fair value of interest rate sensitive liabilities would result in a net decline in fair value of approximately $650 million ($820 million pretax) related to continuing non-experience-rated products. Net reductions in fair value would be reflected as an unrealized loss in equity, as the Company classifies these debt securities as available for sale, and the effect of the interest rate on interest rate sensitive liabilities is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).\nIf the value of the Company’s publicly traded domestic equity securities held within its investment portfolio were to decline by 15%, this would result in a net decline in fair value of $43 million ($54 million pretax).\nBased on overall exposure to interest rate risk and equity price risk, the Company believes that these changes in market rates and prices would not materially affect consolidated near-term financial condition, operating results or cash flows as of December 31, 2024.\nEvaluation of Foreign Currency and Commodity Risk\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company did not have any material foreign currency exchange rate or commodity derivative instruments in place and believes its exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material.\nEvaluation of Operational Risks\nThe Company also faces certain operational risks. Those risks include risks related to information security, including cybersecurity. \nThe Company and its vendors have experienced diverse cyberattacks and expect to continue to experience cyberattacks going forward. As examples, the Company and its vendors have experienced attempts to gain access to systems, denial of service attacks, attempted malware infections, account takeovers, scanning activity and phishing emails. Attacks can originate from external criminals, terrorists, nation states or internal actors. The Company is dedicating and will continue to dedicate significant resources and incur significant expenses to maintain and update on an ongoing basis the systems and processes that are designed to mitigate the information security risks it faces and protect the security of its computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets against attempts by unauthorized parties to obtain access to confidential information, disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage. The impact of cyberattacks has not been material to the Company’s operations or operating results through December 31, 2024. The Board and its Audit Committee are regularly informed \n101\nregarding the Company’s information security policies, practices and status. Please see “Cybersecurity” included in",

See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ for additional information.\n(2)\nCommon stock and capital surplus includes the par value of common stock of $\n18\n million as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n109\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.\nSignificant Accounting Policies \nDescription of Business  \nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, “CVS Health” or the “Company”), is a leading health solutions company building a world of health around every consumer it serves and connecting care so that it works for people wherever they are. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had more than \n9,000\n retail locations, more than \n1,000\n walk-in and primary medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately \n90\n million plan members and expanding specialty pharmacy solutions, and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than \n800,000\n patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated more than \n36\n million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan (“PDP”). The Company is creating new sources of value through its integrated model allowing it to expand into personalized, technology driven care delivery and health services, increasing access to quality care, delivering better health outcomes and lowering overall health care costs.\nThe Company has \nfour\n reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other, which are described below. \nHealth Care Benefits Segment\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation’s leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs and Medicaid health care management services. The Health Care Benefits segment’s primary customers, its members, primarily access the segment’s products and services through employer groups, government-sponsored plans or individually. The Health Care Benefits segment also serves customers who purchase products and services that are ancillary to its health insurance products. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “Insured” and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as “ASC.” The Company sold Insured plans directly to individual consumers through the individual public health insurance exchanges (“Public Exchanges”) in \n17\n states as of December 31, 2024.\nHealth Services Segment\nThe Health Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) solutions, delivers health care services in its medical clinics, virtually, and in the home, and offers provider enablement solutions. PBM solutions include plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services, and specialty and mail order pharmacy services. In addition, the Company provides clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities (“Covered Entities”). The Company operates a group purchasing organization that negotiates pricing for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of its participants and provides various administrative, management and reporting services to pharmaceutical manufacturers. During 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of \ntwo\n key health care delivery assets – Signify Health, Inc. (“Signify Health”), a leader in health risk assessments, value-based care and provider enablement services, and Oak Street Health, Inc. (“Oak Street Health”), a leading multi-payor operator of value-based primary care centers serving Medicare eligible patients. The Company also launched Cordavis\nTM\n, a wholly owned subsidiary that works directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers to commercialize and/or co-produce high quality biosimilar products. The Health Services segment’s clients and customers are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), plans offered on public and private health insurance exchanges and other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the U.S., patients who receive care in the Health Services segment’s medical clinics, virtually or in the home, as well as Covered Entities.\nPharmacy & Consumer Wellness Segment\nThe Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment dispenses prescriptions in its retail pharmacies and through its infusion operations, provides ancillary pharmacy services including pharmacy patient care programs, diagnostic testing and vaccination administration, and sells a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise. The segment also conducts long-term care pharmacy (“LTC”) operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy \n110\nconsulting and ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings, and provides pharmacy fulfillment services to support the Health Services segment’s specialty and mail order pharmacy offerings. As of December 31, 2024, the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment operated more than \n9,000\n retail locations, as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies, retail specialty pharmacy stores, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\nCorporate/Other Segment\nThe Company presents the remainder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:\n•\nManagement and administrative expenses to support the Company’s overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources and finance departments, information technology, digital, data and analytics, as well as acquisition-related transaction and integration costs; and\n•\nProducts for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as its large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of CVS Health and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nReclassifications\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company invests in short-term money market funds, commercial paper and time deposits, as well as other debt securities that are classified as cash equivalents within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as these funds are highly liquid and readily convertible to known amounts of cash. \nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets primarily represents funds held on behalf of members and funds held in escrow in connection with agreements with accountable care organizations. Restricted cash included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets represents amounts held in a trust in one of the Company’s captive insurance companies to satisfy collateral requirements associated with the assignment of certain insurance policies. All restricted cash is invested in demand deposits, time deposits and money market funds.\nThe following is a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets to total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n8,586\n \n$\n8,196\n \n$\n12,945\n \nRestricted cash (included in other current assets)\n95\n \n90\n \n144\n \nRestricted cash (included in other assets)\n203\n \n239\n \n216\n \nTotal cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the consolidated statements of cash flows\n$\n8,884\n \n$\n8,525\n \n$\n13,305\n \n111\nInvestments\nDebt Securities \nDebt securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate and foreign bonds and other debt securities. Debt securities are classified as either current or long-term investments based on their contractual maturities unless the Company intends to sell an investment within the next twelve months, in which case it is classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. Debt securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value. See Note 5 ‘‘Fair Value’’ for additional information on how the Company estimates the fair value of these investments.\nIf a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company has the intent to sell the security, or it is more likely than not that the Company will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost basis of the security is written down to its fair value and the difference is recognized in net income. If a debt security is in an unrealized loss position and the Company does not have the intent to sell and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell such security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company bifurcates the impairment into credit-related and non-credit related (yield-related) components. In evaluating whether a credit related loss exists, the Company considers a variety of factors including: the extent to which the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis; adverse conditions specifically related to the issuer of a security, an industry or geographic area; the payment structure of the security; the failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments; and any changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency. The amount of the credit-related component is recorded as an allowance for credit losses and recognized in net income, and the amount of the non-credit related component is included in other comprehensive income (loss). Interest is not accrued on debt securities when management believes the collection of interest is unlikely.\nThe credit-related component is determined by comparing the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security, considering all reasonably available information relevant to the collectability of the security, with the amortized cost basis of the security. If the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis of the security, the Company records an allowance for credit losses, which is limited by the amount that the fair value is less than amortized cost basis. \nFor mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities, the Company recognizes income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. The Company’s investment in the security is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition of the security, with adjustments recognized in net income.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities with readily available fair values are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.\nMortgage Loans\nMortgage loan investments on the consolidated balance sheets are valued at the unpaid principal balance, net of an allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans with a maturity date or a committed prepayment date within twelve months are classified as current on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company assesses whether its loans share similar risk characteristics and, if so, groups such loans in a risk pool when measuring expected credit losses. The Company considers the following characteristics when evaluating whether its loans share similar risk characteristics: loan-to-value ratios, property type (e.g., office, retail, apartment, industrial), geographic location, vacancy rates and property condition. \nCredit loss reserves are determined using a loss rate method that multiplies the unpaid principal balance of each loan within a risk pool group by an estimated loss rate percentage. The loss rate percentage considers both the expected loan loss severity and the probability of loan default. For periods where the Company is able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected economic conditions (e.g., gross domestic product, employment), the Company adjusts its expected loss rates to reflect these forecasted economic conditions. For periods beyond which the Company is able to make or obtain reasonable and supportable forecasts of expected economic conditions, the Company reverts to historical loss rates in determining expected credit losses. \nInterest income on a potential problem loan (i.e., high probability of default) or restructured loan is accrued to the extent it is deemed to be collectible and the loan continues to perform under its original or restructured terms. Interest income on problem loans (i.e., more than 60 days delinquent, in bankruptcy or in process of foreclosure) is recognized on a cash basis. Cash payments on loans in the process of foreclosure are treated as a return of principal.\n112\nOther Investments\nOther investments consist primarily of the following:\n•\nPrivate equity and hedge fund limited partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the carrying value of the investment is based on the value of the Company’s equity ownership of the underlying investment funds provided by the general partner or manager of the investments, the financial statements of which generally are audited. As a result of the timing of the receipt of the valuation information provided by the fund managers, these investments are generally reported on up to a three month lag. The Company reviews investments for impairment at least quarterly and monitors their performance throughout the year through discussions with the administrators, managers and/or general partners. If the Company becomes aware of an impairment of a limited partnership’s investments through its review or prior to receiving the limited partnership’s financial statements at the financial statement date, an impairment will be recognized by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the limited partnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income. \n•\nInvestment real estate, which is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at depreciated cost, including capital additions, net of write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset. If any real estate investment is considered held-for-sale, it is carried at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. The Company generally estimates fair value using net operating income and applying a capitalization rate in conjunction with comparable sales information. At the time of the sale, the difference between the sales price and the carrying value is recorded as a realized capital gain or loss. \n•\nPrivately-placed equity securities, which are carried on the consolidated balance sheets using the measurement alternative,  at cost less impairments, plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes. Additionally, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston (“FHLBB”), a subsidiary of the Company is required to purchase and hold shares of the FHLBB. These shares are restricted and carried at cost. \nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income on the Company’s investments is recorded when earned and is reflected in the Company’s net income (other than net investment income on assets supporting experience-rated products). Experience-rated products are products in the large case pensions business where the contract holder, not the Company, assumes investment and other risks, subject to, among other things, minimum guarantees provided by the Company. The effect of investment performance on experience-rated products is allocated to contract holders’ accounts daily, based on the underlying investment experience and, therefore, does not impact the Company’s net income (as long as the contract’s minimum guarantees are not triggered). Net investment income on assets supporting large case pensions’ experience-rated products is included in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations and is credited to contract holders’ accounts through a charge to benefit costs. The contract holders’ accounts are reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nRealized capital gains and losses on investments (other than realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products) are included as a component of net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized capital gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis. Purchases and sales of debt and equity securities and alternative investments are reflected on the trade date. Purchases and sales of mortgage loans and investment real estate are reflected on the closing date.\nRealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting large case pensions’ experience-rated products are not included in realized capital gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations and instead are credited directly to contract holders’ accounts. The contract holders’ accounts are reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nUnrealized capital gains and losses on investments (other than unrealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products) are reflected in shareholders’ equity, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Unrealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting large case pensions’ experience-rated products are credited directly to contract holders’ accounts. The contract holders’ accounts are reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company’s use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps.\n113\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are stated net of allowances for credit losses, customer credit allowances, contractual allowances and estimated terminations.\n \nAccounts receivable, net was composed of the following at December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nTrade receivables\n$\n9,881\n \n$\n11,908\n \nVendor and manufacturer receivables\n13,891\n \n15,711\n \nPremium receivables\n4,731\n \n3,714\n \nOther receivables\n7,966\n \n3,894\n \n   Total accounts receivable, net\n$\n36,469\n \n$\n35,227\n \nThe Company’s allowance for credit losses was $\n407\n million and $\n343\n million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nWhen developing an estimate of the Company’s expected credit losses, the Company considers all available relevant information regarding the collectability of cash flows, including historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions over the contractual life of the receivable. The Company’s accounts receivable are short duration in nature and typically settle in less than 30 days.\n \nInventories \nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the weighted average cost method. Physical inventory counts are taken on a regular basis in each retail store and pharmacy, and a continuous cycle count process is the primary procedure used to validate the inventory balances on hand in each distribution center and mail facility to ensure that the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated. During the interim period between physical inventory counts, the Company accrues for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location-by-location basis based on historical results and current physical inventory trends.\n \nReinsurance Recoverables\n \nThe Company utilizes reinsurance agreements primarily to: (a) reduce required capital and (b) facilitate the acquisition or disposition of certain insurance contracts. Ceded reinsurance agreements permit the Company to recover a portion of its losses from reinsurers, although they do not discharge the Company’s primary liability as the direct insurer of the risks reinsured. Failure of reinsurers to indemnify the Company could result in losses; however, the Company does not expect charges for unrecoverable reinsurance to have a material effect on its consolidated operating results or financial condition. The Company evaluates the financial condition of its reinsurers and monitors concentrations of credit risk arising from similar geographic regions, activities or economic characteristics of its reinsurers. At December 31, 2024, the Company’s reinsurance recoverables consisted primarily of amounts due from third parties that are rated consistent with companies that are considered to have the ability to meet their obligations. Reinsurance recoverables are recorded as other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nHealth Care Contract Acquisition Costs\nInsurance products included in the Health Care Benefits segment are cancellable by either the customer or the member monthly upon written notice. Acquisition costs related to prepaid health care and health indemnity contracts are generally expensed as incurred. For certain long-duration insurance contracts, acquisition costs directly related to the successful acquisition of a new or renewal insurance contract, including commissions, are deferred and are recorded as other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Contracts are grouped by product and issue year into cohorts consistent with the grouping used in estimating the associated liability and are amortized on a constant level basis based on the remaining in-force policies over the estimated term of the contracts to approximate straight-line amortization. Changes to the Company’s assumptions, including assumptions related to persistency, are reflected at the cohort level at the time of change and are recognized prospectively over the estimated terms of the contract. The amortization of deferred acquisition costs is recorded in operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\n \n114\nThe following is a roll forward of deferred acquisition costs for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nDeferred acquisition costs, beginning of the period\n$\n1,502\n \n$\n1,219\n \nCapitalizations\n544\n \n548\n \nAmortization expense\n(\n299\n)\n(\n265\n)\nDeferred acquisition costs, end of the period\n$\n1,747\n \n$\n1,502\n \nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment is reported at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Property, equipment and improvements to leased premises are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, or when applicable, the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives generally range from \n1\n to \n40\n years for buildings, building improvements and leasehold improvements and \n3\n to \n10\n years for fixtures, equipment and internally developed software. Repair and maintenance costs are charged directly to expense as incurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated. Application development stage costs for significant internally developed software projects are capitalized and depreciated.\n \nProperty and equipment consisted of the following at December 31, 2024 and 2023: \nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nLand\n$\n1,847\n \n$\n1,958\n \nBuilding and improvements\n4,632\n \n4,571\n \nFixtures and equipment\n11,716\n \n11,024\n \nLeasehold improvements\n6,725\n \n6,511\n \nSoftware\n11,520\n \n9,818\n \nTotal property and equipment\n36,440\n \n33,882\n \nAccumulated depreciation and amortization\n(\n23,447\n)\n(\n20,699\n)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n12,993\n \n$\n13,183\n \nDepreciation expense (which includes the amortization of property and equipment under finance or capital leases) totaled $\n2.6\n billion, $\n2.5\n billion and $\n2.4\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 7 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about the Company’s finance leases. \nRight-of-Use Assets and Lease Liabilities\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at the inception of a contract. Right-of-use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date of the lease, renewal date of the lease or significant remodeling of the lease space based on the present value of the remaining future minimum lease payments. As the interest rate implicit in the Company’s leases is not readily determinable, the Company utilizes its incremental borrowing rate, determined by class of underlying asset, to discount the lease payments. The operating lease right-of-use assets also include lease payments made before commencement and are reduced by lease incentives. \nThe Company’s real estate leases typically contain options that permit renewals for additional periods of up to \nfive years\n each. For real estate leases, the options to extend are not considered reasonably certain at lease commencement because the Company reevaluates each lease on a regular basis to consider the economic and strategic incentives of exercising the renewal options and regularly opens or closes stores to align with its operating strategy. Generally, the renewal option periods are not included within the lease term and the associated payments are not included in the measurement of the right-of-use asset and lease liability. Similarly, renewal options are not included in the lease term for non-real estate leases because they are not considered reasonably certain of being exercised at lease commencement. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheets, and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the short-term lease.\nFor real estate leases, the Company accounts for lease components and nonlease components as a single lease component. Certain real estate leases require additional payments based on sales volume, as well as reimbursement for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance, which are expensed as incurred as variable lease costs. Other real estate leases \n115\ncontain one fixed lease payment that includes real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance. These fixed payments are considered part of the lease payment and included in the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\nSee Note 7 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. \nGoodwill \nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired and identifiable intangible assets to be recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to impairment reviews annually, or more frequently, if necessary, as further described in “Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets” below.\n See Note 6 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about goodwill. \nIntangible Assets\nThe Company’s identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks, trade names, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology and provider networks. These intangible assets arise primarily from the determination of their respective fair market values at the date of acquisition. Amounts assigned to identifiable intangible assets, and their related useful lives, are derived from established valuation techniques and management estimates.\nThe Company’s definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives based upon the pattern of future cash flows attributable to the asset. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if necessary, as further described in “Recoverability of Long-Lived Assets” below.\nSee Note 6 ‘‘Goodwill and Other Intangibles’’ for additional information about intangible assets. \nRecoverability of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are tested for impairment using separate tests described below, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such asset may not be recoverable. The Company groups and evaluates these long-lived assets for impairment at the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified. If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in the analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted). If required, an impairment loss is recorded for the portion of the asset group’s carrying value that exceeds the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, in connection with its enterprise-wide restructuring plan described in Note 3 ‘‘Restructuring’’, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of $\n607\n million, consisting of a write down of $\n483\n million related to operating and financing lease right-of-use assets and $\n124\n million related to property and equipment. In addition, in connection with its enterprise-wide restructuring plan the Company recorded $\n269\n million of other asset impairments and related charges associated with the discontinuation of certain non-core long-lived assets recorded as reductions to property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets. During the year ended December 31, 2023, in connection with its 2023 restructuring program, the Company recorded $\n152\n million of asset impairment charges in connection with the termination of certain transformation initiatives.\nSee Note 3 ‘‘Restructuring’’ for additional information about the Company’s restructuring plan.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the Company recorded office real estate optimization charges of $\n30\n million, $\n46\n million, and $\n117\n million, respectively, primarily related to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the planned reduction of corporate office real estate space in response to its ongoing flexible work arrangement.\nSee Note 7 ‘‘Leases’’ for additional information about the right-of-use asset charges. \n116\nWhen evaluating goodwill for potential impairment, the Company compares the fair value of its reporting units to their respective carrying amounts. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill and concluded there were \nno\n goodwill impairments as of the testing date. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company performed an interim goodwill impairment test of the Government reporting unit after determining there were indicators that the Government reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired. The results of the interim impairment test showed that the fair value of the Government reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, therefore there was \nno\n impairment of goodwill as of the interim testing date.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023 and the third quarter of 2022, the Company performed its required annual impairment test of goodwill and concluded there were \nno\n goodwill impairments as of the testing date or during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. \nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived trademarks using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized, and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.\n There were \nno\n impairment losses recognized on indefinite-lived intangible assets in any of the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nSeparate Accounts\nSeparate Accounts assets and liabilities related to large case pensions products represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contract holders who bear the investment risk. These assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Net investment income (including net realized capital gains and losses) accrue directly to such contract holders. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company’s other businesses. Deposits, withdrawals and net investment income (including net realized and net unrealized capital gains and losses) on Separate Accounts assets are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations or cash flows. Management fees charged to contract holders are included in services revenue and recognized over the period earned.\nHealth Care Costs Payable\nHealth care costs payable within the Health Care Benefits segment consist principally of unpaid fee-for-service medical, dental and pharmacy claims, capitation costs, other amounts due to providers pursuant to risk-sharing arrangements related to the Health Care Benefits segment’s Insured Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid products and accruals for state assessments. Unpaid health care claims include an estimate of payments the Company will make for (i) services rendered to the Company’s Insured members but not yet reported to the Company and (ii) claims which have been reported to the Company but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date (collectively, “IBNR”). Health care costs payable also include an estimate of the cost of services that will continue to be rendered after the financial statement date if the Company is obligated to pay for such services in accordance with contractual or regulatory requirements. Such estimates are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider, among other things, historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, assumed and historical medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in Insured membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors. The Company reflects changes in these estimates in benefit costs in the Company’s consolidated operating results in the period they are determined. Capitation costs represent contractual monthly fees paid to participating physicians and other medical providers for providing medical care, regardless of the volume of medical services provided to the Insured member. Amounts due under risk-sharing arrangements are based on the terms of the underlying contracts with the providers and consider claims experience under the contracts through the financial statement date. Within the Health Services segment, health care costs payable includes estimates of the Company’s obligations for medical care services that have been rendered by third parties on behalf of consumers for which the Company is contractually obligated to pay, but for which claims have either not yet been received, processed or paid.\nThe Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider numerous factors. Of those factors, the Company considers the analysis of historical and projected claim payment patterns (including claims submission and processing patterns) and the assumed health care cost trend rate (the year-over-year change in per member per month health care costs) to be the most critical assumptions. In developing its IBNR estimate, the Company consistently applies \n117\nthese actuarial principles and assumptions each period, with consideration to the variability of related factors. There have been no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company’s estimate of IBNR in 2024.\nThe Company analyzes historical claim payment patterns by comparing claim incurred dates (i.e., the date services were provided) to claim payment dates to estimate “completion factors.” The Company uses completion factors predominantly to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred more than three months before the financial statement date. The Company estimates completion factors by aggregating claim data based on the month of service and month of claim payment and estimating the percentage of claims incurred for a given month that are complete by each month thereafter. For any given month, substantially all claims are paid within \nsix months\n of the date of service, but it can take up to \n48\n months or longer after the date of service before all of the claims are completely resolved and paid. These historically-derived completion factors are then applied to claims paid through the financial statement date to estimate the ultimate claim cost for a given month’s incurred claim activity. The difference between the estimated ultimate claim cost and the claims paid through the financial statement date represents the Company’s estimate of claims remaining to be paid as of the financial statement date and is included in the Company’s health care costs payable. The completion factors the Company uses reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim submission and processing patterns and, to a lesser extent, other factors such as changes in health care cost trend rates, changes in Insured membership and changes in product mix. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than prior periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using the Company’s completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than the ultimate cost of claims.\nBecause claims incurred within three months before the financial statement date are less mature, the Company uses a combination of historically-derived completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rate to estimate the ultimate cost of claims incurred for these months. The Company applies its actuarial judgment and places a greater emphasis on the assumed health care cost trend rate for the most recent claim incurred dates as these months may be influenced by seasonal patterns and changes in membership and product mix.\nThe Company’s health care cost trend rate is affected by changes in per member utilization of medical services as well as changes in the unit cost of such services. Many factors influence the health care cost trend rate, including the Company’s ability to manage benefit costs through product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and medical management programs, as well as the mix of the Company’s business. The health status of the Company’s Insured members, aging of the population and other demographic characteristics, advances in medical technology and other factors continue to contribute to rising per member utilization and unit costs. Changes in health care practices, inflation, new technologies, increases in the cost of prescription drugs (including specialty pharmacy drugs), direct-to-consumer marketing by pharmaceutical companies, clusters of high-cost cases, claim intensity, changes in the regulatory environment, health care provider or member fraud and numerous other factors also contribute to the cost of health care and the Company’s health care cost trend rate.\nFor each reporting period, the Company uses an extensive degree of judgment in the process of estimating its health care costs payable. As a result, considerable variability and uncertainty is inherent in such estimates, particularly with respect to claims with claim incurred dates of three months or less before the financial statement date; and the adequacy of such estimates is highly sensitive to changes in assumed completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rates. For each reporting period the Company recognizes the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable considering the potential volatility in assumed completion factors and health care cost trend rates, as well as other factors. The Company believes its estimate of health care costs payable is reasonable and adequate to cover its obligations at December 31, 2024; however, actual claim payments may differ from the Company’s estimates. A worsening (or improvement) of the Company’s health care cost trend rates or changes in completion factors from those that the Company assumed in estimating health care costs payable at December 31, 2024 would cause these estimates to change in the near term, and such a change could be material.\nEach quarter, the Company re-examines previously established health care costs payable estimates based on actual claim payments for prior periods and other changes in facts and circumstances. Given the extensive degree of judgment in this estimate, it is possible that the Company’s estimates of health care costs payable could develop either favorably (that is, its actual health care costs for the period were less than estimated) or unfavorably. The changes in the Company’s estimate of health care costs payable may relate to a prior quarter, prior year or earlier periods. For a roll forward of the Company’s health care costs payable, see Note 8 ‘‘Health Care Costs Payable.’’ The Company’s reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of its ultimate liability for health care costs payable.\n118\nOther Insurance Liabilities\nUnpaid Claims\nUnpaid claims consist primarily of reserves associated with certain short-duration group disability and term life insurance contracts, including an estimate for IBNR as of the financial statement date. Reserves associated with certain short-duration group disability and term life insurance contracts are based upon the Company’s estimate of the present value of future benefits, which is based on assumed investment yields and assumptions regarding mortality, morbidity and recoveries from the U.S. Social Security Administration. The Company develops its estimate of IBNR using actuarial principles and assumptions which consider, among other things, contractual requirements, claim incidence rates, claim recovery rates, seasonality and other relevant factors. The Company discounts certain claim liabilities related to group long-term disability and life insurance waiver of premium contracts. The discount rates generally reflect the Company’s expected investment returns for the investments supporting all incurral years of these liabilities. The discount rates for retrospectively-rated contracts are set at contractually specified levels. The Company’s estimates of unpaid claims are subject to change due to changes in the underlying experience of the insurance contracts, changes in investment yields or other factors, and these changes are recorded in current and future benefits in the consolidated statements of operations in the period they are determined. The Company estimates its reserve for claims IBNR for life products largely based on completion factors. The completion factors used are based on the Company’s historical experience and reflect judgments and possible adjustments based on data such as claim inventory levels, claim payment patterns, changes in business volume and other factors. If claims are submitted or processed on a faster (slower) pace than historical periods, the actual claims may be more (less) complete than originally estimated using completion factors, which may result in reserves that are higher (lower) than required to cover future life benefit payments. There have been no significant changes to the methodologies or assumptions used to develop the Company’s estimate of unpaid claims IBNR in 2024. As of December 31, 2024, unpaid claims balances of $\n280\n million and $\n713\n million were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, unpaid claims balances of $\n285\n million and $\n834\n million were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively.\nSubstantially all life and disability insurance liabilities have been fully ceded to unrelated third parties through indemnity reinsurance agreements; however, the Company remains directly obligated to the policyholders.\nFuture Policy Benefits\nFuture policy benefits consist primarily of reserves for products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers, including limited payment pension and annuity contracts and long-term care insurance contracts. Contracts are grouped into cohorts by contract type and issue year. The liability for future policy benefits is adjusted for differences between actual and expected experience. \nReserves for limited payment pension and annuity contracts represent the Company’s estimate of the present value of future benefits to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders and are computed using actuarial principles that consider, among other things, assumptions reflecting anticipated mortality and retirement experience. On an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, the Company reviews mortality assumptions against both industry standards and its experience.  \nReserves for long-term care insurance contracts represent the Company’s estimate of the present value of future benefits and settlement costs to be paid to or on behalf of policyholders less the present value of future net premiums. The Company’s estimate of the present value of future benefits under such contracts is based upon mortality, morbidity, lapse and interest rate assumptions. On an annual basis, or more frequently if necessary, the Company reviews its mortality, morbidity and lapse assumptions against its experience. Annually, or each time the assumptions are changed, the net premium ratio used to calculate the future policy benefit liability is updated to reflect actual experience, as well as the impact of any change in assumptions on the Company’s future cash flows. \n \n \nThe Company discounts its future policy benefit liability using a curve of spot rates derived from Single A rated fixed income instruments. At each reporting date, the Company will measure its liability for future policy benefits using both the current spot rate curve and the locked-in discount rate at each cohort’s inception. Any difference between the measured liabilities is recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).\nAs of December 31, 2024, future policy benefits balances of $\n371\n million and $\n4.2\n billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, future policy benefits balances of $\n393\n million and $\n4.6\n billion were recorded in other insurance liabilities and other long-term insurance liabilities, respectively. \n119\nPremium Deficiency Reserves\nThe Company evaluates its short-duration insurance contracts to determine if it is probable that a loss will be incurred. For purposes of determining premium deficiency losses, contracts are grouped consistent with the Company’s method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. For each contract grouping, a premium deficiency reserve is recognized when it is probable that expected future incurred claims, including costs to maintain the contract grouping exceed anticipated future premiums and reinsurance recoveries. Anticipated investment income is not considered in the calculation of premium deficiency reserves. A premium deficiency is first recognized by charging any unamortized acquisition costs to operating expenses, and to the extent the premium deficiency is greater than the unamortized acquisition costs, a premium deficiency reserve liability is established and reflected in health care costs payable on the consolidated balance sheets. Losses recognized as a premium deficiency reserve result in a beneficial effect in subsequent periods as subsequent costs under these contracts are then charged to this previously established liability.\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company determined it had a premium deficiency in its Medicare product line related to the 2024 coverage year and, accordingly, recorded a premium deficiency reserve of $\n766\n million. The premium deficiency reserve consisted of a $\n383\n million write-off of unamortized acquisition costs, which was recorded in operating expenses, and $\n383\n million recorded in health care costs which was subsequently utilized in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company did \nnot\n have any premium deficiency reserves related to its Medicare product line as of December 31, 2024. \nAdditionally, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company established a premium deficiency reserve of $\n270\n million related to its individual exchange product line for the 2024 coverage year. The premium deficiency reserve consisted of an $\n11\n million write-off of unamortized acquisition costs, which was recorded in operating expenses, and $\n259\n million recorded in health care costs which was subsequently utilized in the fourth quarter of 2024. The Company did \nnot\n have any premium deficiency reserves related to its individual exchange product line as of December 31, 2024. \nThe Company did \nnot\n have any premium deficiency reserves as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nSelf-Insurance Liabilities\nThe Company is self-insured for certain losses related to general liability, workers’ compensation and auto liability. The Company obtains third party insurance coverage to limit exposure from these claims. The Company is also self-insured for certain losses related to health and medical liabilities. The Company’s self-insurance accruals, which include reported claims and claims incurred but not reported, are calculated using standard insurance industry actuarial assumptions and the Company’s historical claims experience.\n As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, self-insurance liabilities totaled $\n1.1\n billion and were recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, as well as other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\nFor non-U.S. dollar functional currency locations, (i) assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period exchange rates, (ii) revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates in effect during the period and (iii) equity is translated at historical exchange rates. The resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nFor U.S. dollar functional currency locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet accounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the nonmonetary balance sheet amounts which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in net income.\nGains and losses from foreign currency transactions and the effects of foreign currency remeasurements were not material in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 or 2022. \nRevenue Recognition\nHealth Care Benefits Segment\nHealth Care Benefits revenue is principally derived from insurance premiums and fees billed to customers. Revenue is recognized based on customer billings, which, in the Company’s Commercial business, reflect contracted rates per member and \n120\nthe number of covered members recorded in the Company’s records at the time the billings are prepared. Billings are generally sent monthly for coverage during the following month. Revenue related to the Company’s Government business is collected monthly from the U.S. federal government and various government agencies based on fixed payment rates and member eligibility. \nThe Company’s billings may be subsequently adjusted to reflect enrollment changes due to member terminations or other factors. These adjustments are known as retroactivity adjustments. In each period, the Company estimates the amount of future retroactivity and adjusts the recorded revenue accordingly. As information regarding actual retroactivity amounts becomes known, the Company refines its estimates and records any required adjustments to revenues in the period in which they arise.\nPremium Revenue\nPremiums are recognized as revenue in the month in which the enrollee is entitled to receive health care services. Premiums are reported net of an allowance for estimated terminations and uncollectible amounts. Additionally, premium revenue subject to the minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”) rebate requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (as amended, collectively, the “ACA”) is recorded net of the estimated minimum MLR rebates for the current calendar year. Premiums related to unexpired contractual coverage periods (unearned premiums) are reported as other insurance liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized as revenue when earned.\nSome of the Company’s contracts allow for premiums to be adjusted to reflect actual experience or the relative health status of Insured members. Such adjustments are reasonably estimable at the outset of the contract, and adjustments to those estimates are made based on actual experience of the customer emerging under the contract and the terms of the underlying contract.\nThe ACA established a permanent risk adjustment program to transfer funds from qualified individual and small group insurance plans with below average risk scores to plans with above average risk scores. Based on the risk of the Company’s qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of other qualified plans in comparable markets, as defined by the ACA, the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable (recorded in accounts receivable) or payable (recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities) for the current calendar year and reflects the pro-rata year-to-date impact as an adjustment to premium revenue.\nServices Revenue\nServices revenue relates to contracts that can include various combinations of services or series of services which generally are capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Health Care Benefits segment’s services revenue primarily consists of ASC fees received in exchange for performing certain claim processing and member services for ASC members. ASC fee revenue is recognized over the period the service is provided. Some of the Company’s administrative services contracts include guarantees with respect to certain functions, such as customer service response time, claim processing accuracy and claim processing turnaround time, as well as certain guarantees that a plan sponsor’s benefit claim experience will fall within a certain range. With any of these guarantees, the Company is financially at risk if the conditions of the arrangements are not met, although the maximum amount at risk typically is limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company by the customer involved. Each period the Company estimates its obligations under the terms of these guarantees and records its estimate as an offset to services revenues.\nAccounting for Medicare Part D\n \nRevenues include insurance premiums earned by the Company’s PDPs, which are determined based on the PDP’s annual bid and related contractual arrangements with CMS. The insurance premiums include a beneficiary premium, which is the responsibility of the PDP member, and can be subsidized by CMS in the case of low-income members, and a direct premium paid by CMS. Premiums collected in advance are initially recorded within other insurance liabilities and are then recognized ratably as revenue over the period in which members are entitled to receive benefits.\nRevenues also include a risk-sharing feature of the Medicare Part D program design referred to as the risk corridor. The Company estimates variable consideration in the form of amounts payable to, or receivable from, CMS under the risk corridor, and adjusts revenue based on calculations of additional subsidies to be received from or owed to CMS at the end of the reporting year.\nIn addition to Medicare Part D premiums, the Company receives additional payments each month from CMS related to catastrophic reinsurance, low-income cost-sharing subsidies and coverage gap benefits. If the subsidies received differ from the amounts earned from actual prescriptions transferred, the difference is recorded in either accounts receivable, net or accrued expenses.\n121\nHealth Services Segment\nPharmacy Services\nThe Health Services segment sells prescription drugs directly through its specialty and mail order pharmacy offerings and indirectly through the Company’s retail pharmacy network. The Company’s pharmacy benefit arrangements are accounted for in a manner consistent with a master supply arrangement as there are no contractual minimum volumes and each prescription is considered a separate purchasing decision and distinct performance obligation transferred at a point in time. PBM services performed in connection with each prescription claim are considered part of a single performance obligation which culminates in the fulfillment of prescription drugs.\nThe Company recognizes revenue using the gross method at the contract price negotiated with its clients when the Company has concluded it controls the prescription drug before it is transferred to the client plan members. The Company controls prescriptions fulfilled indirectly through its retail pharmacy network because it has separate contractual arrangements with those pharmacies, has discretion in setting the price for the transaction and assumes primary responsibility for fulfilling the promise to provide prescription drugs to its client plan members while also performing the related PBM services.\nRevenues include (i) the portion of the price the client pays directly to the Company, net of any discounts earned on brand name drugs or other discounts and refunds paid back to the client (see “Drug Discounts” and “Guarantees” below), (ii) the price paid to the Company by client plan members for mail order prescriptions and the price paid to retail network pharmacies by client plan members for retail prescriptions (“retail co-payments”), and (iii) claims based administrative fees for retail pharmacy network contracts. Sales taxes are not included in revenues. \nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those prescription drugs. The Company has established the following revenue recognition policies for the Health Services segment:\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by third party pharmacies in the Company’s retail pharmacy network and associated administrative fees are recognized at the Company’s point-of-sale, which is when the claim is adjudicated by the Company’s online claims processing system and the Company has transferred control of the prescription drug and completed all of its performance obligations.\n•\nRevenues generated from prescription drugs sold by specialty and mail order pharmacies are recognized when the prescription drug is delivered to the client plan member. At the time of delivery, the Company has performed substantially all of its performance obligations under its client contracts and does not experience a significant level of returns or reshipments.\nFor contracts under which the Company acts as an agent or does not control the prescription drugs prior to transfer to the client plan member, revenue is recognized using the net method.\nDrug Discounts\nThe Company records revenue net of manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients based on their plan members’ utilization of brand-name formulary drugs. The Company estimates these rebates at period-end based on actual and estimated claims data and its estimates of the manufacturers’ rebates earned by its clients. The estimates are based on the best available data at period-end and recent history for the various factors that can affect the amount of rebates due to the client. The Company adjusts its rebates payable to clients to the actual amounts paid when these rebates are paid or as significant events occur. Any cumulative effect of these adjustments is recorded against revenues at the time it is identified. Adjustments generally result from contract changes with clients or manufacturers that have retroactive rebate adjustments, differences between the estimated and actual product mix subject to rebates, or whether the brand name drug was included in the applicable formulary. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual manufacturers’ rebate amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.\nGuarantees\nThe Company also adjusts revenues for refunds owed to clients resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.\n122\nWalk-In Medical Clinics\nFor services provided by the Company’s walk-in medical clinics, revenue recognition occurs for completed services provided to patients, with adjustments taken for third party payor contractual obligations and patient direct bill historical collection rates.\nPrimary Care Capitated Revenue \nCapitated revenue related to the Company’s primary care operations consists primarily of capitated fees for medical services it provides under capitated or capitation arrangements directly made with various Medicare Advantage managed care payors or CMS. Under the risk contracts, the Company receives from the third-party payor a fixed payment per patient per month for a defined patient population, and the Company is then responsible for providing, managing and paying for healthcare services for that patient population, including those not provided by the Company. The Company recognizes revenue using the gross method as the Company is the principal in arranging, providing and controlling the managed healthcare services provided to the defined patient population. The Company considers all contracts with customers (enrolled patients) as a single performance obligation to stand ready to provide healthcare services. This performance obligation is satisfied over time as the Company stands ready to fulfill its obligation to enrolled patients.  \nIn-Home Health Evaluations (“IHEs”)\nRevenue generated from IHEs relates to the assessments performed either within the patient’s home, virtually or at a healthcare provider facility as well as certain in-home clinical evaluations performed by the Company’s mobile network of providers. Revenue is recognized when the IHEs are submitted to customers on a daily basis. Submission to the customer occurs after the IHEs are completed and coded, a process which may take one to several days after completion of the evaluation. The pricing for the IHEs is generally based on a fixed transaction fee, which is directly linked to the usage of the service by the customer during a distinct service period. Customers are invoiced for evaluations performed each month and remit payment accordingly. Each IHE represents a single performance obligation for which revenue is recognized at a point in time when control is transferred to the customer upon submission of the completed and coded evaluation.\nPharmacy & Consumer Wellness Segment\nRetail Pharmacy\n \nThe Company’s retail drugstores recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise. For pharmacy sales, each prescription claim is its own arrangement with the customer and is a performance obligation, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under other retail network arrangements. Revenues are adjusted for refunds owed to third party payers resulting from pricing guarantees and performance against defined value-based service and performance metrics. The inputs to these estimates are not subject to a high degree of subjectivity or volatility. The effect of adjustments between estimated and actual pricing and performance refund amounts has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition.\nRevenue from Company gift cards purchased by customers is deferred as a contract liability until goods or services are transferred. Any amounts not expected to be redeemed by customers (i.e., breakage) are recognized based on historical redemption patterns.\nCustomer returns are not material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. Sales taxes are not included in revenues.\nLoyalty and Other Programs\nThe Company’s customer loyalty program, ExtraCare\n®\n, consists of two components, ExtraSavings\nTM\n and ExtraBucks\n®\n Rewards. ExtraSavings are coupons that are recorded as a reduction of revenue when redeemed as the Company concluded that they do not represent a promise to the customer to deliver additional goods or services at the time of issuance because they are not tied to a specific transaction or spending level. \nExtraBucks Rewards are accumulated by customers based on their historical spending levels. Thus, the Company has determined that there is an additional performance obligation to those customers at the time of the initial transaction. The Company allocates the transaction price to the initial transaction and the ExtraBucks Rewards transaction based upon the relative standalone selling price, which considers historical redemption patterns for the rewards. Revenue allocated to ExtraBucks Rewards is recognized as those rewards are redeemed. At the end of each period, unredeemed ExtraBucks Rewards are reflected as a contract liability.\nThe Company also offers a subscription-based membership program, ExtraCare Plus\nTM\n, under which members are entitled to a suite of benefits delivered over the course of the subscription period, as well as a promotional reward that can be redeemed for \n123\nfuture goods and services. Subscriptions are paid for on a monthly or annual basis at the time of or in advance of the Company delivering the goods and services. Revenue from these arrangements is recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nLong-term Care\nRevenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Each prescription claim represents a separate performance obligation of the Company, separate and distinct from other prescription claims under customer arrangements. A significant portion of long-term care revenue from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursed by the federal Medicare Part D program and, to a lesser extent, state Medicaid programs. The Company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources, as well as long-term care facilities and other third-party insurance payors, and reduces revenue at the revenue recognition date to properly account for the variable consideration due to anticipated differences between billed and reimbursed amounts. Accordingly, the total revenues and receivables reported in the Company’s consolidated financial statements are recorded at the amount expected to be ultimately received from these payors. \nPatient co-payments associated with Medicare Part D, certain state Medicaid programs, Medicare Part B and certain third-party payors typically are not collected at the time products are delivered or services are rendered, but are billed to the individuals as part of normal billing procedures and subject to normal accounts receivable collections procedures.\n124\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table disaggregates the Company’s revenue by major source in each segment for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nIn millions\nHealth Care\nBenefits\nHealth\nServices\nPharmacy &\nConsumer\nWellness\nCorporate/\nOther\nIntersegment\nEliminations\nConsolidated\nTotals\n2024\nMajor goods/services lines:\nPharmacy\n$\n—\n \n$\n162,527\n \n$\n100,687\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n52,942\n)\n$\n210,272\n \nFront Store\n—\n \n—\n \n21,522\n \n—\n \n—\n \n21,522\n \nPremiums\n122,849\n \n—\n \n—\n \n47\n \n—\n \n122,896\n \nNet investment income\n1,473\n \n285\n \n—\n \n395\n \n—\n \n2,153\n \nOther\n6,343\n \n10,793\n \n2,291\n \n9\n \n(\n3,470\n)\n15,966\n \nTotal\n$\n130,665\n \n$\n173,605\n \n$\n124,500\n \n$\n451\n \n$\n(\n56,412\n)\n$\n372,809\n \nHealth Services distribution channel:\nPharmacy network\n (1)\n$\n91,650\n \nMail & specialty \n(2)\n70,877\n \nNet investment income\n285\n \nOther\n10,793\n \nTotal\n$\n173,605\n \n2023\nMajor goods/services lines:\nPharmacy\n$\n—\n \n$\n180,710\n \n$\n92,111\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n49,369\n)\n$\n223,452\n \nFront Store\n—\n \n—\n \n22,458\n \n—\n \n—\n \n22,458\n \nPremiums\n99,144\n \n—\n \n—\n \n48\n \n—\n \n99,192\n \nNet investment income (loss)\n765\n \n(\n1\n)\n(\n5\n)\n394\n \n—\n \n1,153\n \nOther\n5,737\n \n6,134\n \n2,199\n \n9\n \n(\n2,558\n)\n11,521\n \nTotal\n$\n105,646\n \n$\n186,843\n \n$\n116,763\n \n$\n451\n \n$\n(\n51,927\n)\n$\n357,776\n \nHealth Services distribution channel:\nPharmacy network\n (1) \n$\n112,718\n \nMail & specialty \n(2)\n67,992\n \nNet investment income (loss)\n(\n1\n)\nOther\n6,134\n \nTotal\n$\n186,843\n \n125\nIn millions\nHealth Care\nBenefits\nHealth\nServices\nPharmacy &\nConsumer\nWellness\nCorporate/\nOther\nIntersegment\nEliminations\nConsolidated\nTotals\n2022\nMajor goods/services lines:\nPharmacy\n$\n—\n \n$\n166,793\n \n$\n83,480\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n(\n45,154\n)\n$\n205,119\n \nFront Store\n—\n \n—\n \n22,780\n \n—\n \n—\n \n22,780\n \nPremiums\n85,274\n \n—\n \n—\n \n56\n \n—\n \n85,330\n \nNet investment income (loss)\n476\n \n—\n \n(\n44\n)\n406\n \n—\n \n838\n \nOther\n5,600\n \n2,783\n \n2,380\n \n68\n \n(\n2,431\n)\n8,400\n \nTotal\n$\n91,350\n \n$\n169,576\n \n$\n108,596\n \n$\n530\n \n$\n(\n47,585\n)\n$\n322,467\n \nHealth Services distribution channel:\nPharmacy network\n (1)\n$\n102,968\n \nMail & specialty \n(2)\n63,825\n \nOther\n2,783\n \nTotal\n$\n169,576\n \n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nHealth Services pharmacy network is defined as claims filled at retail and specialty retail pharmacies, including the Company’s retail pharmacies and LTC pharmacies, as well as activity associated with Maintenance Choice\n®\n, which permits eligible client plan members to fill their maintenance prescriptions through mail order delivery or at a CVS pharmacy retail store for the same price as mail order. \n(2)\nHealth Services mail & specialty is defined as specialty mail claims inclusive of Specialty Connect\n®\n claims picked up at a retail pharmacy, as well as mail order and specialty claims fulfilled by the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment.\n \nContract Balances\nContract liabilities primarily represent the Company’s obligation to transfer additional goods or services to a customer for which the Company has received consideration, and include ExtraBucks\n \nRewards and unredeemed Company gift cards. The consideration received remains a contract liability until goods or services have been provided to the customer. In addition, the Company recognizes breakage on Company gift cards based on historical redemption patterns.\nThe following table provides information about receivables and contract liabilities from contracts with customers as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nTrade receivables (included in accounts receivable, net)\n$\n9,881\n \n$\n11,908\n \nContract liabilities (included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities)\n144\n \n149\n \nCost of Products Sold\nThe Company accounts for cost of products sold as follows:\nHealth Services Segment\nCost of products sold includes: (i) the cost of prescription drugs sold during the reporting period directly through the Company’s specialty and mail order pharmacies and indirectly through the Company’s retail pharmacy network, (ii) the cost of care provided within the Company’s primary care centers, (iii) direct operating costs associated with generating revenues related to services provided, including fees paid to clinicians for performing IHEs, (iv) administrative service fees paid to the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment for specialty and mail order pharmacy fulfillment services and (v) shipping and handling costs. \nThe cost of prescription drugs sold component of cost of products sold includes: (i) the cost of the prescription drugs purchased from manufacturers or distributors and shipped to members in clients’ benefit plans from the Company’s mail order pharmacies, net of any volume-related or other discounts (see “Vendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts” below) and (ii) the cost of prescription drugs sold (including retail co-payments) through the Company’s retail pharmacy network under contracts where the Company is the principal, net of any volume-related or other discounts. \n126\nThe cost of care provided within the Company’s costs of products sold includes the costs incurred to operate the primary care centers and care model. These costs consist of care team and patient support employee-related costs, occupancy costs, patient transportation, medical supplies, insurance, fees paid to specialists and other operating costs. \nPharmacy & Consumer Wellness Segment\nCost of products sold includes: the cost of merchandise sold during the reporting period, including the costs of prescription drugs sold through its retail pharmacies, net of any volume-related or other discounts, the related purchasing costs, warehousing and delivery costs (including depreciation and amortization), the operating costs of the Company’s specialty and mail order pharmacy fulfillment operations and inventory losses.\n \nVendor Allowances and Purchase Discounts \nThe Company accounts for vendor allowances and purchase discounts as follows: \nHealth Services Segment\nThe Health Services segment receives purchase discounts on pharmaceutical products purchased. Contractual arrangements with vendors, including manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies, normally provide for the Health Services segment to receive purchase discounts from established list prices in one, or a combination, of the following forms: (i) a direct discount at the time of purchase, (ii) a discount for the prompt payment of invoices or (iii) when products are purchased indirectly from a manufacturer (e.g., through a wholesaler or retail pharmacy), a discount (or rebate) paid subsequent to dispensing. These rebates are recognized when prescriptions are dispensed and are generally calculated and billed to manufacturers within \n30\n days of the end of each completed quarter. Historically, the effect of adjustments resulting from the reconciliation of rebates recognized to the amounts billed and collected has not been material to the Company’s operating results or financial condition. The Company accounts for the effect of any such differences as a change in accounting estimate in the period the reconciliation is completed. The Health Services segment also receives additional discounts under its wholesaler contracts if it exceeds contractually defined purchase volumes. In addition, the Health Services segment receives fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers for administrative services. Purchase discounts and administrative service fees are recorded as a reduction of cost of products sold. \nPharmacy & Consumer Wellness Segment\nVendor allowances received by the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold, unless they are specifically identified as a reimbursement of incremental costs for promotional programs and/or other services provided. Amounts that are directly linked to advertising commitments are recognized as a reduction of advertising expense (included in operating expenses) when the related advertising commitment is satisfied. Any amounts received in excess of the actual cost incurred also reduce the carrying cost of inventory. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are linked to purchase commitments is initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold over the life of the contract based upon sales volume. The total value of any upfront payments received from vendors that are not linked to purchase commitments is also initially deferred. The deferred amounts are then amortized to reduce cost of products sold on a straight-line basis over the life of the related contract. The total amortization of these upfront payments was not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in any of the periods presented.\n \nAdvertising Costs \nAdvertising costs, which are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed when the related advertising takes place. Net advertising costs, which are included in operating expenses, were $\n989\n million, $\n985\n million and $\n745\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n \nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the stock award (generally \nthree\n to \nfive years\n) using the straight-line method.\n \nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the \n127\nconsolidated financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year or years in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in the tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of such change.\nThe Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and the Company’s recent operating results. The Company establishes a valuation allowance when it does not consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) the Company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority. \nInterest and/or penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in the income tax provision.\nMeasurement of Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Employee Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors defined benefit pension plans (“pension plans”) and other postretirement employee benefit plans (“OPEB plans”) for its employees and retirees. The Company recognizes the funded status of its pension and OPEB plans on the consolidated balance sheets based on the year-end measurements of plan assets and benefit obligations. When the fair value of plan assets are in excess of the plan benefit obligations, the amounts are reported in other current assets and other assets. When the fair value of plan benefit obligations are in excess of plan assets, the amounts are reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities based on the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months included in the benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets. The net periodic benefit income for the Company’s pension and OPEB plans do not contain a service cost component as these plans have been frozen for an extended period of time. Non-service cost components of pension and postretirement net periodic benefit income are included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations.\nEarnings per Share\nEarnings per share is computed using the treasury stock method. The Company calculates basic earnings per share based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. See Note 16 ‘‘Earnings Per Share’’ for additional information.\nShares Held in Trust\nThe Company maintains grantor trusts, which held approximately \none million\n shares of its common stock at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. These shares are designated for use under various employee compensation plans. Since the Company holds these shares, they are excluded from the computation of basic and diluted shares outstanding.\n \nVIEs\nThe Company has various investments that are considered VIEs. The Company does not have a future obligation to fund losses or debts on behalf of these investments; however, it may voluntarily contribute funds. In evaluating whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company considers several factors, including whether the Company has (a) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \nVIEs - Primary Beneficiary\nRed Oak Sourcing, LLC (“Red Oak”)\nIn 2014, the Company and Cardinal Health, Inc. (“Cardinal”) established Red Oak, a generic pharmaceutical sourcing entity in which the Company and Cardinal each own \n50\n%. The Red Oak arrangement had an initial term of \nten years\n. In 2021, the Red Oak arrangement was amended to extend the initial term an additional \nfive years\n, for a total term of \n15\n years. Under this arrangement, the Company and Cardinal contributed their sourcing and supply chain expertise to Red Oak and agreed to source and negotiate generic pharmaceutical supply contracts for both companies through Red Oak; however, Red Oak does not own \n128\nor hold inventory on behalf of either company. No physical assets (e.g., property and equipment) were contributed to Red Oak by either company, and minimal funding was provided to capitalize Red Oak. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of this VIE because it has the ability to direct the activities of Red Oak. Consequently, the Company consolidates Red Oak in its consolidated financial statements within the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. \nCardinal is required to pay the Company quarterly payments, which began in October 2014 and will extend through June 2029. The Company received $\n126\n million from Cardinal during the year ended December 31, 2024 and $\n183\n million from Cardinal during each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. The payments reduce the Company’s carrying value of inventory and are recognized in cost of products sold when the related inventory is sold.\nPhysician Groups\nThe Company has entered into management and/or administrative services agreements with affiliated physician practice organizations (the “Physician Groups”). Physician Groups employ healthcare providers, contract with managed care payors and deliver healthcare services to patients in the markets that the Company serves. Oak Street Health, MSO LLC (“OSH MSO”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, provides management services to the Physician Groups. Activities include but are not limited to operational support of the centers, marketing, information technology infrastructure and the sourcing and managing of health plan contracts. The Company concluded that it has variable interests in the Physician Groups on the basis of its administrative service agreement, which includes the reimbursement of costs and a management fee payable to the Company from the Physician Groups for the management services provided, which are eliminated in consolidation. The Physician Groups are considered VIEs as additional support is needed to finance their operations. Neither shareholders, employees nor their designees have the individual power to direct the activities of the Physician Groups that significantly impact its economic performance. The success or failure of OSH MSO in performing the activities impacting the growth of patients and management of healthcare services of the Physicians Groups’ patient base is significant to the economic performance of the Physician Groups. Therefore, the Company is the primary beneficiary of the Physician Groups and, consequently, consolidates the Physician Groups in its consolidated financial statements within the Health Services segment. \nPhysician Groups VIE assets and liabilities included on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nTotal assets\n$\n2,144\n \n$\n1,515\n \nTotal liabilities\n2,104\n \n1,503\n \n \nThere are no restrictions on the Physician Groups’ assets or on the settlement of its liabilities. The assets of the Physician Groups are all current and can be used to settle obligations of the Company. The Physician Groups are included in the Company’s obligated group; thus, creditors of the Company have recourse to the assets owned by the Physician Groups. There are no liabilities for which creditors of the Physician Groups do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company. There are no restrictions placed on the retained earnings or net income of the Physician Groups with respect to potential dividend payments. \nPhysician Owned Entities\nThe Company’s consolidated VIEs include certain IHE related physician practices that require an individual physician to legally own the equity interests as certain state laws and regulations prohibit non-physician owned business entities from practicing medicine or employing licensed healthcare providers. The Company determined it was the primary beneficiary of these VIEs as it has the obligation to absorb the losses from and direct the activities of these operations. As a result, these VIEs are consolidated and any noncontrolling interest is not presented. The carrying amount of these VIEs’ assets and liabilities are not material to the consolidated balance sheets.\nAccountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”)\nThe Company is the sole member of certain ACOs which are considered VIEs. CMS administers these programs where the goal of the program is to reward the ACO participants when specific quality metrics, established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), are met and expenditures are lowered. These ACOs have a risk model such that the ACOs can either share in both savings and losses or share in only the savings. The governance structure of the VIEs does not provide the Company with the ultimate decision-making authority to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIEs’ economic performance. For certain ACO VIEs, the Company is ultimately liable for losses incurred or is required to secure and have sole authority over all aspects of the repayment of any shared losses incurred in the program in exchange for a higher percentage of savings and, accordingly, the Company is taking on the risk to absorb losses, resulting in a financial responsibility to ensure that \n129\nthese VIEs operate as designed. For these VIEs, the Company has determined it is the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidates the results of these ACOs. The carrying amount of these VIEs’ assets and liabilities are not material to the consolidated balance sheets.\nVIEs - Other Variable Interest Holder\nThe Company has invested in certain VIEs for which it has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary, consisting of the following:\n•\nHedge fund and private equity investments\n - The Company invests in hedge fund and private equity investments in order to generate investment returns for its investment portfolio supporting its insurance businesses.\n•\nReal estate partnerships\n - The Company invests in various real estate partnerships, including those that construct, own and manage low-income housing developments. For the low-income housing development investments, substantially all of the projected benefits to the Company are from tax credits and other tax benefits.\nThe Company is not the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because the nature of the Company’s involvement with the activities of these VIEs does not give the Company the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. The Company records the amount of its investment in these VIEs as long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets and recognizes its share of each VIE’s income or losses in net income. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss from these VIEs is limited to its investment balances as disclosed below and the risk of recapture of previously recognized tax credits related to the real estate partnerships, which the Company does not consider significant.\nOther variable interest holder VIE assets included in long-term investments on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nHedge fund investments\n$\n1,246\n \n$\n859\n \nPrivate equity investments\n934\n \n840\n \nReal estate partnerships\n438\n \n319\n \nTotal\n$\n2,618\n \n$\n2,018\n \nRelated Party Transactions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company made charitable contributions of $\n25\n million to the CVS Health Foundation, a non-profit entity that focuses on health, education and community involvement programs. The charitable contributions were recorded as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations within the Corporate/Other segment for the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company did \nno\nt make any charitable contributions to the CVS Health Foundation during the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2023.\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn connection with certain business dispositions completed between 1995 and 1997, the Company retained guarantees on store lease obligations for a number of former subsidiaries, including Linens ‘n Things and Bob’s Stores, each of which subsequently filed for bankruptcy. The Company’s loss from discontinued operations includes lease-related costs that the Company believes it will likely be required to satisfy pursuant to these lease guarantees.\n See “Lease Guarantees” in Note 18 ‘‘Commitments and Contingencies’’ for additional information. \nResults from discontinued operations were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nSegment Reporting\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-07, \nSegment Reporting\n \n(Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\n. This standard requires the Company to disclose significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and are included within each reported measure of segment operating results. The standard also requires the Company to disclose the total amount of any other items included in segment operating results which were not deemed to be significant expenses for separate disclosure, along with a qualitative description of the composition of these other items. In \n130\naddition, the standard also requires disclosure of the CODM’s title and position, as well as detail on how the CODM uses the reported measure of segment operating results to evaluate segment performance and allocate resources. The standard also aligns interim segment reporting disclosure requirements with annual segment reporting disclosure requirements. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2024 for fiscal year reporting and the standard became effective for interim reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. The standard requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented. While the standard requires additional disclosures related to the Company’s reportable segments, the standard did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated operating results, financial condition or cash flows as of the date of adoption. Refer to Note 19 ‘‘Segment Reporting’’ for the Company’s segment reporting disclosures, including those newly required by this standard.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIncome Taxes \nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09,\n Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n. The standard requires the Company to provide further disaggregated income tax disclosures for specific categories on the effective tax rate reconciliation, as well as additional information about federal, state/local and foreign income taxes. The standard also requires the Company to annually disclose its income taxes paid (net of refunds received), disaggregated by jurisdiction. The Company adopted the standard on January 1, 2025 for fiscal year reporting. The standard is to be applied on a prospective basis, although optional retrospective application is permitted. While the standard requires additional disclosures related to the Company’s income taxes, the standard did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated operating results, financial condition or cash flows. \nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. The standard requires the Company to provide further disaggregated information of relevant expense captions within its consolidated statements of operations, including the purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation and intangible asset amortization, as well as the inclusion of other specific expenses, gains and losses required by existing GAAP. The new standard also requires the Company to disclose its total selling expenses and, on an annual basis, provide a qualitative description of its selling expenses. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. The standard may be applied prospectively or retrospectively. While the standard will require additional disclosures related to certain expenses included in the consolidated statements of operations, the standard is not expected to have any impact on the Company’s consolidated operating results, financial condition or cash flows.\n \n2.\nAcquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales\nOak Street Health Acquisition\nOn May 2, 2023 (the “Oak Street Health Acquisition Date”), the Company acquired \n100\n% of the outstanding shares and voting interest of Oak Street Health for cash (“Oak Street Health Acquisition”). Under the terms of the merger agreement, Oak Street Health stockholders received $\n39.00\n per share in cash. The Company financed the transaction with borrowings of $\n5.0\n billion from a term loan agreement entered into on May 1, 2023 as described in Note 10 ‘‘Borrowings and Credit Agreements’’ and cash on hand. Oak Street Health is a leading multi-payor, senior focused value-based primary care company. Oak Street Health is included within the Health Services segment.

The Company determined that its Omnicare\n®\n long-term care business (“LTC business”), which is included within the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, was no longer a strategic asset and during the third quarter of 2022 committed to a plan to sell the LTC business. At that time, the LTC business met the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\nDuring 2022, the carrying value of the LTC business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell. Accordingly, the Company recorded total losses on assets held for sale of $\n2.5\n billion during the year ended December 31, 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, an incremental loss on assets held for sale of $\n349\n million was recorded to write-down the carrying value of the LTC business to the Company’s best estimate of the ultimate selling price which reflects its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The loss on assets held for sale represents the write-down of long-lived assets and was recorded in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations within the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. During the third quarter of 2023, the Company determined it was no longer probable that a sale would be completed in the near term. At that time, the Company concluded that the LTC business no longer met the criteria to be classified as held for sale and, accordingly, the assets and liabilities associated with this business were reclassified to held and used at their respective fair values on the consolidated balance sheet.\nDivestiture of bswift\nIn November 2022, the Company sold its wholly-owned subsidiary bswift LLC (“bswift”) for approximately $\n735\n million. bswift offers software and services that streamline benefits and human resource administration. The results of this business have historically been recorded within the Health Care Benefits segment. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the divestiture of $\n250\n million in the year ended December 31, 2022, which was reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment.\nDivestiture of PayFlex \nIn June 2022, the Company sold PayFlex for approximately $\n775\n million. PayFlex provides services to employers, their employees, and their former employees in the areas of tax-advantaged account reimbursement administration (flexible spending, health reimbursement, health savings, transit and parking), Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act administration and special-member billing administration. The results of this business have historically been reported within the Health Care Benefits segment. The Company recorded a pre-tax gain on the divestiture of $\n225\n million in the year ended December 31, 2022, which was reflected as a reduction of operating expenses in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations within the Health Care Benefits segment.\nDivestiture of Thailand Health Care Business\nIn March 2022, the Company reached an agreement to sell its international health care business domiciled in Thailand (“Thailand business”), comprised of approximately \n266,000\n medical members, which was included in the Commercial Business reporting unit within the Health Care Benefits segment. At that time, a portion of the Commercial Business goodwill was specifically allocated to the Thailand business. The net assets of the Thailand business were accounted for as assets held for sale at March 31, 2022. The carrying value of the Thailand business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and, accordingly, the Company recorded a $\n41\n million loss on assets held for sale within the Health Care Benefits segment during the first quarter of 2022. The sale of the Thailand business closed in the second quarter of 2022, and the consideration received and ultimate loss on the sale were not material.\nInternational Health Care Benefits Renewal Rights Asset Sale\nIn May 2022, the Company sold the renewal rights of approximately \n200,000\n international medical members outside of the Americas, Thailand and India in connection with an Asset Purchase Agreement. As part of this agreement, the Company introduced and helped migrate these existing international medical members to the purchaser upon renewal. The migration process was completed during 2023. The Company ceased writing any new or renewal business for international medical \n135\nmembers outside of the Americas during the fourth quarter of 2022. The consideration received related to this agreement was not material.\n3.\nRestructuring\n2024 Restructuring Program\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and reduce costs to partially offset the expected return of certain variable expenses in 2025. In connection with this restructuring plan, during 2024, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $\n1.2\n billion, comprised of a $\n607\n million store impairment charge, $\n293\n million of costs associated with corporate workforce optimization, including severance and employee-related costs, a $\n10\n million stock-based compensation charge associated with the impacted employees, which was reflected as an adjustment to common stock and capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheets, and $\n269\n million of other asset impairments and related charges associated with the discontinuation of certain non-core assets.\nStore impairment charge\nThe Company evaluates its retail store right-of-use and property and equipment assets for impairment at the retail store level, which is the lowest level at which cash flows can be identified. For retail stores where there is an indicator of impairment present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows used in the analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to its estimated fair value which is the greater of the asset group’s estimated future cash flows (discounted), or the consideration of what a market participant would pay to lease the assets, net of leasing costs. The Company’s estimate of fair value considers historical results, current operating trends, consolidated sales, profitability and cash flow results and forecasts. For assets which the Company has determined it will be able to sublease, the estimated future cash flows include the estimated sublease income, net of estimated leasing costs. When the carrying value of an asset group exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the value of the asset group to its estimated fair value. As the impaired assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis primarily using unobservable inputs as of the measurement date, the assets are classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. \nDuring the third quarter of 2024, in connection with its enterprise-wide restructuring plan, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business, which included evaluating changes in population, consumer buying patterns and future health requirements to ensure continued alignment of its retail footprint with consumer needs. In connection with this initiative the Company determined it plans to close \n271\n retail stores in 2025. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted stores’ asset groups, including the associated operating or financing lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment.\nA long-lived asset impairment test was performed during the third quarter of 2024, the results of which indicated that the fair value of certain retail store asset groups was lower than their respective carrying values. Accordingly, at that time, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of $\n607\n million, consisting of a write down of $\n483\n million related to operating and financing lease right-of-use assets and $\n124\n million related to property and equipment. The charge associated with the store impairments was included in the restructuring charges within the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. Subsequent to the impairment loss, the fair value of the associated operating and financing lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment were $\n100\n million and $\n39\n million, respectively. \nCorporate workforce optimization costs\nCorporate workforce optimization costs, including severance and employee-related costs, consist primarily of salary continuation benefits, prorated annual incentive compensation, continuation of health care benefits and outplacement services. Severance and employee-related benefits are determined pursuant to the Company’s written severance plans and are recognized when the benefits are determined to be probable of being paid and are reasonably estimable. \nIn connection with its enterprise-wide restructuring plan, the Company recorded corporate workforce optimization costs of $\n293\n million, which were recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company made payments of $\n88\n million related to these costs during the year ended December 31, 2024. This restructuring plan is expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2025. The restructuring charge associated with the corporate workforce optimization costs is reflected within the Corporate/Other segment. \n136\nOther asset impairment charges\nIn connection with its enterprise-wide restructuring plan, the Company also conducted a review of its various strategic assets and determined that it would discontinue the use of certain non-core assets, including certain virtual care services and compounding infusion pharmacies and branches. As a result, management determined that there were indicators of impairment with respect to the impacted long-lived assets and a long-lived asset impairment test was performed during the third quarter of 2024. The results of the long-lived asset impairment test indicated that the respective fair values of certain impacted assets were lower than their respective carrying values and, accordingly, the Company recorded $\n269\n million of other asset impairments and related charges associated with the discontinuation of these assets. The asset impairment charges were recorded as reductions to property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The other asset impairment charges were included in the restructuring charges within the Corporate/ Other and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments. Subsequent to the impairment charges, the fair value of the associated long-lived assets was not material.\n2023 Restructuring Program\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, the Company developed an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and reduce costs. In connection with the development of this plan and the completed acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health, the Company also conducted a strategic review of its various transformation initiatives and determined that it would terminate certain initiatives. In connection with the restructuring plan, during 2023, the Company recorded $\n507\n million in pre-tax restructuring charges, comprised of $\n344\n million of severance and employee-related costs associated with corporate workforce optimization, $\n152\n million of asset impairment charges and an $\n11\n million stock-based compensation charge associated with the impacted employees. These restructuring charges are reflected in the Corporate/Other segment. The severance and employee-related costs were recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and the asset impairments were recorded as a reduction of property and equipment, net, while the stock-based compensation charge was reflected as an adjustment to common stock and capital surplus on the consolidated balance sheet.\nSeverance and employee-related costs consist primarily of salary continuation benefits, prorated annual incentive compensation, continuation of health care benefits and outplacement services. Severance and employee-related benefits are determined pursuant to the Company’s written severance plans and are recognized when the benefits are determined to be probable of being paid and are reasonably estimable. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company made payments of $\n194\n million related to severance and employee-related costs associated with the 2023 restructuring program. During the year ended December 31, 2024, substantially all of the remaining liabilities were paid.\n137\n4.\nInvestments\nTotal investments at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\n2024\n2023\nIn millions\nCurrent\nLong-term\nTotal\nCurrent\nLong-term\nTotal\nDebt securities available for sale\n$\n2,256\n \n$\n23,777\n \n$\n26,033\n \n$\n3,131\n \n$\n18,582\n \n$\n21,713\n \nMortgage loans\n151\n \n1,354\n \n1,505\n \n128\n \n1,183\n \n1,311\n \nOther investments\n—\n \n3,803\n \n3,803\n \n—\n \n3,254\n \n3,254\n \nTotal investments\n$\n2,407\n \n$\n28,934\n \n$\n31,341\n \n$\n3,259\n \n$\n23,019\n \n$\n26,278\n \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company held investments of $\n269\n million and $\n307\n million, respectively, related to the 2012 conversion of an existing group annuity contract from a participating to a non-participating contract.

assigns a credit quality indicator to each loan. The Company’s credit quality indicator is internally developed and categorizes each loan in its portfolio on a scale from 1 to 7. These indicators are based upon several factors, including current loan-to-value ratios, current and future property cash flow, property condition, market trends, creditworthiness of the borrower and deal structure. \n•\nCategory 1 - \nRepresents loans of superior quality.\n•\nCategories 2 to 4 \n- Represent loans where credit risk is minimal to acceptable; however, these loans may display some susceptibility to economic changes.\n•\nCategories 5 and 6\n - Represent loans where credit risk is not substantial, but these loans warrant management’s close attention.\n•\nCategory 7\n - Represents loans where collections are potentially at risk; if necessary, an impairment is recorded.\n141\nBased upon the Company’s assessments at December 31, 2024 and 2023, the amortized cost basis of the Company’s

and liabilities to be reflected at their fair value and others to be reflected on another basis, such as an adjusted historical cost basis. In this note, the Company provides details on the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and how it determines those fair values. The Company presents this information for those financial instruments that are measured at fair value for which the change in fair value impacts net income attributable to CVS Health or other comprehensive income (loss) separately from other financial assets and liabilities.\nFinancial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nCertain of the Company’s financial instruments are measured at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of these instruments are based on valuations that include inputs that can be classified within one of three levels of a hierarchy established by GAAP. The following are the levels of the hierarchy and a brief description of the type of valuation information (“valuation inputs”) that qualifies a financial asset or liability for each level:\n•\nLevel 1 – Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2 – Valuation inputs other than Level 1 that are based on observable market data. These include: quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets in inactive markets, valuation inputs that are observable that are not prices (such as interest rates and credit risks) and valuation inputs that are derived from or corroborated by observable markets.\n•\nLevel 3 – Developed from unobservable data, reflecting the Company’s assumptions.\nFinancial assets and liabilities are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the valuation. When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities are available, the Company uses these quoted market prices to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities and classifies these assets and liabilities in Level 1. In other cases where a quoted market price for identical assets and liabilities in an active market is either not available or not observable, the Company estimates fair value using valuation methodologies based on available and observable market information or by using a matrix pricing model. These financial assets and liabilities are classified in Level 2. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company determines fair value using broker quotes or an internal analysis of each investment’s financial performance and cash flow projections. Thus, financial assets and liabilities may be classified in Level 3 even though there may be some significant inputs that may be observable.\nThe following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, including the general classification of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\nCash and Cash Equivalents \n–\n \nThe carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value as maturities are less than three months. When quoted prices are available in an active market, cash equivalents are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Fair values of cash equivalent instruments that do not trade on a regular basis in active markets are classified as Level 2.\nDebt Securities\n –\n Where quoted prices are available in an active market, debt securities are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company’s Level 1 debt securities consist primarily of U.S. Treasury securities.\nThe fair values of the Company’s Level 2 debt securities are obtained using models, such as matrix pricing, which use quoted market prices of debt securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows to estimate fair value. The Company reviews these prices to ensure they are based on observable market inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets, quoted prices for identical assets in inactive markets and inputs that are observable that are not prices (such as interest rates and credit risks). The Company also reviews the methodologies and the assumptions used to calculate prices from these observable inputs. On a quarterly basis, the Company selects a sample of its Level 2 debt securities’ prices and compares them to prices provided by a secondary source. Variances over a \n143\nspecified threshold are identified and reviewed to confirm the price provided by the primary source represents an appropriate estimate of fair value. In addition, the Company’s internal investment team consistently compares the prices obtained for select Level 2 debt securities to the team’s own independent estimates of fair value for those securities. The Company obtained one price for each of its Level 2 debt securities and did not adjust any of those prices at December 31, 2024 or 2023. \nThe Company also values certain debt securities using Level 3 inputs. For Level 3 debt securities, fair values are determined by outside brokers or, in the case of certain private placement securities, are priced internally. Outside brokers determine the value of these debt securities through a combination of their knowledge of the current pricing environment and market flows. The Company did not have any broker quoted debt securities for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. For some private placement securities, the Company’s internal staff determines the value of these debt securities by analyzing spreads of corporate and sector indices as well as interest spreads of comparable public bonds. Examples of these private placement Level 3 debt securities include certain U.S. and foreign securities and certain tax-exempt municipal securities.\nEquity Securities\n –\n The Company currently has two classifications of equity securities: those that are publicly traded and those that are privately placed. Publicly-traded equity securities are classified in Level 1 because quoted prices are available for these securities in an active market. For privately placed equity securities, there is no active market; therefore, these securities are classified in Level 3 because the Company prices these securities through an internal analysis of each investment’s financial statements and cash flow projections. Significant unobservable inputs consist of earnings and revenue multiples, discount for lack of marketability and comparability adjustments. An increase or decrease in any of these unobservable inputs would have resulted in a change in the fair value measurement. \n144\nThere were \nno\n financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 or 2023. \nFinancial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024

companies. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ for additional information regarding the valuation of investments accounted for under the measurement alternative method.\nSeparate Accounts Measured at Fair Value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nSeparate Accounts assets relate to the Company’s large case pensions products which represent funds maintained to meet specific objectives of contract holders. Since contract holders bear the investment risk of these assets, a corresponding Separate Accounts liability has been established equal to the assets. These assets and liabilities are carried at fair value. Net investment income and capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets accrue directly to such contract holders. The assets of each account are legally segregated and are not subject to claims arising from the Company’s other businesses. Deposits, withdrawals, net investment income and realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on Separate Accounts assets are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity or cash flows.\nSeparate Accounts assets include debt and equity securities. The valuation methodologies used for these assets are similar to the methodologies described above in this Note 5 ‘‘Fair Value.’’ Separate Accounts assets also include investments in common/collective trusts that are carried at fair value. Common/collective trusts invest in other investment funds otherwise known as the underlying funds. The Separate Accounts’ interests in the common/collective trust funds are based on the fair values of the investments of the underlying funds and therefore are classified in Level 2. The assets in the underlying funds primarily consist of equity securities, U.S. corporate securities and U.S. government securities. Investments in common/collective trust funds are valued at their respective net asset value (“NAV”) per share/unit on the valuation date.\n147\nSeparate Accounts financial assets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nDecember 31, 2024\nDecember 31, 2023\nIn millions\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n1\n \n$\n164\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n165\n \n$\n2\n \n$\n166\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n168\n \nDebt securities\n186\n \n669\n \n1\n \n856\n \n558\n \n1,949\n \n—\n \n2,507\n \nCommon/collective trusts\n—\n \n2,478\n \n—\n \n2,478\n \n—\n \n529\n \n—\n \n529\n \nTotal \n(1)\n$\n187\n \n$\n3,311\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n3,499\n \n$\n560\n \n$\n2,644\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n3,204\n \n_____________________________________\n(1)\nExcludes $\n188\n million of other payables and $\n46\n million of other receivables at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company had \nno\n gross transfers of Separate Accounts financial assets into or out of Level 3.\n6.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill\nBelow is a summary of the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nIn millions\nHealth Care\nBenefits\nHealth\nServices\nPharmacy &\nConsumer\nWellness\nTotal\nBalance at December 31, 2022\n$\n44,159\n \n$\n23,615\n \n$\n10,376\n \n$\n78,150\n \nSegment realignment\n(\n109\n)\n109\n \n—\n \n—\n \nAcquisitions\n2,594\n \n10,342\n \n186\n \n13,122\n \nBalance at December 31, 2023\n46,644\n \n34,066\n \n10,562\n \n91,272\n \nBalance at December 31, 2024\n$\n46,644\n \n$\n34,066\n \n$\n10,562\n \n$\n91,272\n \nThere were \nno\n changes to the carrying amount of the Company’s goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2024.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2023, the increase in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by the acquisitions of Oak Street Health and Signify Health. See Note 2 ‘‘Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales’’ for additional information.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024 and 2023, and the third quarter of 2022, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of these impairment tests indicated that there was \nno\n impairment of goodwill. \nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, cumulative goodwill impairments were $\n6.6\n billion.\n148\nIntangible Assets\nThe following table is a summary of the Company’s intangible assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\nIn millions, except weighted average life\nGross\nCarrying\nAmount\nAccumulated\nAmortization\nNet\nCarrying\nAmount\nWeighted\nAverage\nLife (years)\n2024\nTrademarks (indefinite-lived)\n$\n10,498\n \n$\n— \n$\n10,498\n \nN/A\nCustomer contracts/relationships and covenants not to compete\n26,904\n \n(\n13,889\n)\n13,015\n \n14.2\nTechnology\n1,250\n \n(\n1,167\n)\n83\n \n3.0\nProvider networks\n4,203\n \n(\n1,282\n)\n2,921\n \n20.0\nValue of Business Acquired \n590\n \n(\n228\n)\n362\n \n20.0\nOther\n826\n \n(\n382\n)\n444\n \n9.3\nTotal\n$\n44,271\n \n$\n(\n16,948\n)\n$\n27,323\n \n14.5\n2023\nTrademarks (indefinite-lived)\n$\n10,498\n \n$\n— \n$\n10,498\n \nN/A\nCustomer contracts/relationships and covenants not to compete\n26,784\n \n(\n12,241\n)\n14,543\n \n14.2\nTechnology\n1,253\n \n(\n1,104\n)\n149\n \n3.0\nProvider networks\n4,203\n \n(\n1,072\n)\n3,131\n \n20.0\nValue of Business Acquired \n590\n \n(\n201\n)\n389\n \n20.0\nOther\n838\n \n(\n314\n)\n524\n \n9.3\nTotal\n$\n44,166\n \n$\n(\n14,932\n)\n$\n29,234\n \n14.5\nAmortization expense for intangible assets totaled $\n2.0\n billion, $\n1.9\n billion and $\n1.8\n billion for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nThe projected annual amortization expense for the Company’s intangible assets for the next five years is as follows:\nIn millions\n2025\n$\n1,981\n \n2026\n1,704\n \n2027\n1,590\n \n2028\n1,316\n \n2029\n1,239\n \n149\n7.\nLeases\nThe Company leases most of its retail stores, mail order facilities and primary care centers, as well as certain distribution centers and corporate offices under operating or finance leases, typically with initial terms of \n15\n to \n25\n years. The Company also leases certain equipment and other assets under operating or finance leases, typically with initial terms of \n3\n to \n10\n years. \nIn addition, the Company leases pharmacy space at the stores of another retail chain for which the noncancelable contractual term of the pharmacy lease arrangement exceeds the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings. For these pharmacy lease arrangements, the Company concluded that for accounting purposes the lease term was the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings. Consequently, most of these individual pharmacy leases are finance leases.\nThe following table is a summary of the components of net lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nOperating lease cost\n$\n2,423\n \n$\n2,532\n \n$\n2,579\n \nFinance lease cost:\nAmortization of right-of-use assets\n92\n \n84\n \n79\n \nInterest on lease liabilities\n71\n \n73\n \n68\n \nTotal finance lease costs\n163\n \n157\n \n147\n \nShort-term lease costs\n33\n \n22\n \n27\n \nVariable lease costs\n635\n \n635\n \n610\n \nLess: sublease income\n(\n67\n)\n(\n63\n)\n(\n61\n)\nNet lease cost\n$\n3,187\n \n$\n3,283\n \n$\n3,302\n \nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities:\nOperating cash flows paid for operating leases\n$\n2,733\n \n$\n2,756\n \n$\n2,689\n \nOperating cash flows paid for interest portion of finance leases\n71\n \n73\n \n68\n \nFinancing cash flows paid for principal portion of finance leases\n74\n \n70\n \n62\n \nRight-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations:\nOperating leases\n852\n \n1,132\n \n591\n \nFinance leases\n30\n \n(\n4\n)\n232\n \n150\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\nIn millions, except remaining lease term and discount rate\n2024\n2023\nOperating leases:\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n$\n15,944\n$\n17,252\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities\n$\n1,751\n$\n1,741\nLong-term operating lease liabilities\n14,899\n16,034\nTotal operating lease liabilities\n$\n16,650\n$\n17,775\nFinance leases:\n \nProperty and equipment, gross\n$\n1,587\n$\n1,604\nAccumulated depreciation\n(\n447\n)\n(\n375\n)\nProperty and equipment, net\n$\n1,140\n$\n1,229\nCurrent portion of long-term debt\n$\n65\n$\n66\nLong-term debt\n1,295\n1,325\nTotal finance lease liabilities\n$\n1,360\n$\n1,391\nWeighted average remaining lease term \n(in years)\nOperating leases\n10.7\n11.4\nFinance leases\n16.5\n17.3\nWeighted average discount rate\nOperating leases\n4.6\n \n%\n4.5\n \n%\nFinance leases\n5.1\n \n%\n5.0\n \n%\nThe following table summarizes the maturity of lease liabilities under finance and operating leases as of December 31, 2024:\nIn millions\nFinance\nLeases\nOperating\nLeases \n(1)\nTotal\n2025\n$\n144\n \n$\n2,683\n \n$\n2,827\n \n2026\n135\n \n2,528\n \n2,663\n \n2027\n132\n \n2,343\n \n2,475\n \n2028\n129\n \n2,167\n \n2,296\n \n2029\n127\n \n1,911\n \n2,038\n \nThereafter\n1,371\n \n9,557\n \n10,928\n \nTotal lease payments \n(2)\n2,038\n \n21,189\n \n23,227\n \nLess: imputed interest\n(\n678\n)\n(\n4,539\n)\n(\n5,217\n)\nTotal lease liabilities\n$\n1,360\n \n$\n16,650\n \n$\n18,010\n \n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nFuture operating lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $\n297\n million due in the future under noncancelable subleases.\n(2)\nThe Company leases pharmacy and clinic space from Target Corporation. Amounts related to such finance and operating leases are reflected above. Pharmacy lease amounts due in excess of the remaining estimated economic life of the buildings of approximately $\n2.2\n billion are not reflected in this table since the estimated economic life of the buildings is shorter than the contractual term of the pharmacy lease arrangement.\nStore Impairment Charges\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded a store impairment charge of $\n483\n million related to operating and financing lease right-of-use assets in connection with its enterprise-wide restructuring plan. See Note 3 ‘‘Restructuring’’ for additional information on the Company’s store impairment charges. \n151\nOffice Real Estate Optimization Charges \nThe Company evaluates its corporate office real estate space in response to its ongoing flexible work arrangement and evaluates its current real estate space and changes in employee work arrangement requirements to ensure it has the appropriate space to support the business. As a result of this assessment, the Company determined that it would vacate and abandon certain leased corporate office spaces. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded office real estate optimization charges of $\n117\n million, primarily consisting of $\n71\n million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $\n44\n million related to property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $\n46\n million of office real estate optimization charges, primarily consisting of $\n20\n million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $\n18\n million related to property and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded $\n30\n million of office real estate optimization charges, primarily consisting of $\n14\n million related to operating lease right-of-use assets and $\n14\n million related to property and equipment. The office real estate optimization charges were recorded in operating expenses within each segment.\n152\n8.\nHealth Care Costs Payable\nThe following is information about incurred and cumulative paid health care claims development as of December 31, 2024, net of reinsurance, and the total IBNR liabilities plus expected development on reported claims included within the net incurred claims amounts. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ for information on how the Company estimates IBNR reserves and health care costs payable as well as changes to those methodologies, if any. The Company’s estimate of IBNR liabilities is primarily based on trend and completion factors. Claim frequency is not used in the calculation of the Company’s liability. In addition, it is impracticable to disclose claim frequency information for health care claims due to the Company’s inability to gather consistent claim frequency information across its multiple claims processing systems. Any claim frequency count disclosure would not be comparable across the Company’s different claim processing systems and would not be consistent from period to period based on the volume of claims processed through each system.

This development does not directly correspond to an increase in the Company’s operating results as these reductions were offset by estimated current period health care costs when the Company

The series A junior subordinated notes bear interest at \n7.0\n% per year until March 10, 2030, at which time the rate will reset March 10th of every fifth year, provided that the interest rate will not reset below the initial interest rate. The series B junior subordinated notes bear interest at \n6.75\n% per year until December 10, 2034, at which time the rate will reset December 10th of every fifth year, provided that the interest rate will not reset below the initial interest rate. The series A and series B junior subordinated notes pay interest semi-annually and may be redeemed at any time beginning \n90\n days prior to their respective first interest rate reset date and on any interest payment date thereafter, in whole or in part at a defined redemption price plus accrued interest. The net proceeds of these offerings were used for the early extinguishment of certain of the Company’s senior notes as described below and the remaining proceeds after the early extinguishment of debt were used for general corporate purposes.\nOn May 9, 2024, the Company issued $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.4\n% senior notes due June 2029, $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.55\n% senior notes due June 2031, $\n1.25\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.7\n% senior notes due June 2034, $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of \n6.0\n% senior notes due June 2044 and $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n6.05\n% senior notes due June 2054 for total proceeds of approximately $\n5.0\n billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The net proceeds of these offerings were used for general corporate purposes.\n2023 Notes\nOn June 2, 2023, the Company issued $\n1.0\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.0\n% senior notes due January 2029, $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of \n5.25\n% senior notes due January 2031, $\n1.25\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.3\n% senior notes due June 2033, $\n1.25\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.875\n% senior notes due June 2053 and $\n750\n million aggregate principal amount of \n6.0\n% senior notes due June 2063 for total proceeds of approximately $\n4.9\n billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The net proceeds of these offerings were used, along with cash on hand, to repay the outstanding balance under the term loan agreement described above.\nOn February 21, 2023, the Company issued $\n1.5\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.0\n% senior notes due February 2026, $\n1.5\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.125\n% senior notes due February 2030, $\n1.75\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.25\n% senior notes due February 2033 and $\n1.25\n billion aggregate principal amount of \n5.625\n% senior notes due February 2053 for total proceeds of approximately $\n6.0\n billion, net of discounts and underwriting fees. The net proceeds of these offerings were used to fund general corporate purposes, including a portion of the Signify Health Acquisition purchase price.\nOak Street Health Convertible Notes\nPrior to the Oak Street Health Acquisition, Oak Street Health held \n0\n% convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $\n920\n million (the “Convertible Notes”), which were assumed by the Company in connection with the Oak Street Health Acquisition. The Oak Street Health Acquisition constituted a fundamental change in the Convertible Notes giving the holders the right to require the Company to repurchase the Convertible Notes. The repurchase price was an amount in cash equal to \n100\n% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes. On May 31, 2023, the Company issued a notice of repurchase to the holders of the Convertible Notes. In connection with this notice, $\n917\n million of the Convertible Notes were submitted \n161\nfor repurchase and settled on July 21, 2023. Substantially all of the remaining $\n3\n million of the Convertible Notes were submitted for repurchase and settled on October 20, 2023. \nGain on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nIn December 2024, pursuant to a cash tender offer, the Company repaid approximately $\n2.6\n billion of its outstanding senior notes for a cash payment of approximately $\n2.0\n billion. The senior notes purchased include: $\n226\n million of its \n4.1\n% senior notes due March 2025, $\n398\n million of its \n4.125\n% senior notes due April 2040, $\n883\n million of its \n2.7\n% senior notes due August 2040, $\n274\n million of its \n4.125\n% senior notes due November 2042, $\n463\n million of its \n3.875\n% senior notes due August 2047 and $\n351\n million of its \n4.25\n% senior notes due April 2050. In connection with the purchase of such senior notes, the Company recognized a total gain on early extinguishment of debt of $\n491\n million, net of unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred fees.\nDebt Covenants\nThe Company’s back-up revolving credit facilities and unsecured senior notes contain customary restrictive financial and operating covenants. These covenants do not include an acceleration of the Company’s debt maturities in the event of a downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings. The Company does not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect its financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants.\n11.\nPension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits\nDefined Contribution Plans\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company sponsors several active 401(k) savings plans that cover all employees who meet plan eligibility requirements. \nThe Company makes matching contributions consistent with the provisions of the respective plans. At the participant’s option, account balances, including the Company’s matching contribution, can be invested among various investment options under each plan. The CVS Health Future Fund 401(k) Plan offers CVS Health Corporation’s common stock fund as an investment option. The Company also maintains nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans for certain key employees. The plans provide participants the opportunity to defer portions of their eligible compensation and for certain nonqualified plans, participants receive matching contributions equivalent to what they could have received under the CVS Health Future Fund 401(k) Plan absent certain restrictions and limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. The Company’s contributions under its defined contribution plans were $\n610\n million, $\n581\n million and $\n567\n million in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nThe Company sponsors a tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan that was frozen in 2010 and a nonqualified supplemental pension plan that was frozen in 2007. The Company also sponsors several other defined benefit pension plans that are unfunded nonqualified supplemental retirement plans.\n162\nPension Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets\nThe following tables outline the change in pension benefit obligation and plan assets over the specified periods:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nChange in benefit obligation:\nBenefit obligation, beginning of year\n$\n4,736\n \n$\n4,740\n \nInterest cost\n222\n \n231\n \nActuarial loss (gain)\n(\n262\n)\n145\n \nBenefit payments\n(\n347\n)\n(\n380\n)\nBenefit obligation, end of year\n4,349\n \n4,736\n \nChange in plan assets:\nFair value of plan assets, beginning of year\n5,379\n \n5,346\n \nActual return on plan assets\n133\n \n389\n \nEmployer contributions\n23\n \n24\n \nBenefit payments\n(\n347\n)\n(\n380\n)\nFair value of plan assets, end of year\n5,188\n \n5,379\n \nFunded status\n$\n839\n \n$\n643\n \nThe change in the pension benefit obligation during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 was primarily driven by the change in the discount rate during each respective period.\nThe assets (liabilities) recognized on the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2024 and 2023 for the defined benefit pension plans consisted of the following:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nNoncurrent assets reflected in other assets\n$\n1,030\n \n$\n856\n \nCurrent liabilities reflected in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\n(\n22\n)\n(\n24\n)\nNoncurrent liabilities reflected in other long-term liabilities\n(\n169\n)\n(\n189\n)\nNet assets\n$\n839\n \n$\n643\n \nNet Periodic Benefit Cost (Income)\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost (income) for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 are shown below:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost (income):\nInterest cost\n$\n222\n \n$\n231\n \n$\n132\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n(\n327\n)\n(\n326\n)\n(\n309\n)\nAmortization of net actuarial loss\n1\n \n1\n \n3\n \nSettlement losses\n—\n \n—\n \n1\n \nNet periodic benefit cost (income)\n$\n(\n104\n)\n$\n(\n94\n)\n$\n(\n173\n)\nPension Plan Assumptions\nThe Company uses a series of actuarial assumptions to determine its benefit obligation and net periodic benefit income, the most significant of which include discount rates and expected return on plan assets assumptions. \nDiscount Rates\n -\n \nThe discount rate is determined using a yield curve as of the annual measurement date. The yield curve consists of a series of individual discount rates, with each discount rate corresponding to a single point in time, based on high-quality bonds. Projected benefit payments are discounted to the measurement date using the corresponding rate from the yield curve that is consistent with the maturity profile of the expected liability cash flows.\n163\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\n -\n \nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is determined by using the plan’s target allocation and return expectations based on many factors including forecasted long-term capital market real returns and the inflationary outlook on a plan by plan basis. See “Pension Plan Assets” below for additional details regarding the pension plan assets as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nThe Company also considers other assumptions including mortality, interest crediting rate, termination and retirement rates, and cost of living adjustments. \nThe Company determined its benefit obligation based on the following weighted average assumptions as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n2024\n2023\nDiscount rate\n5.6\n \n%\n5.0\n \n%\nThe Company determined its net periodic benefit cost (income) based on the following weighted average assumptions for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDiscount rate\n4.9\n \n%\n5.1\n \n%\n2.3\n \n%\nExpected long-term rate of return on plan assets\n6.3\n \n%\n6.3\n \n%\n4.8\n \n%\nPension Plan Assets\nThe Company’s pension plan assets primarily include debt and equity securities held in separate accounts, common/collective trusts, as well as Private Real Estate, Farmland, Public Real Estate and Public Infrastructure (collectively referred to as “Real Assets”) and private credit. The valuation methodologies used to value these debt and equity securities and common/collective trusts are similar to the methodologies described in Note 5 “Fair Value.” Pension plan assets also include investments in other assets that are carried at fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to value private real estate investments and these additional investments, including the general classification pursuant to the fair value hierarchy.\nPrivate real estate\n - Private real estate investments are valued by independent third-party appraisers. The appraisals comply with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, which include, among other things, the income, cost, and sales comparison approaches to estimating property value. Therefore, these investments are classified in Level 3.\nPrivate equity, private credit and hedge fund limited partnerships\n - Private equity and hedge fund limited partnerships are carried at fair value which is estimated using the NAV per unit as reported by the administrator of the underlying investment fund as a practical expedient to fair value. Therefore, these investments have been excluded from the fair value table below.\n164\nPension plan assets with changes in fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2024 were as follows: \nIn millions\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n32\n \n$\n67\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n99\n \nDebt securities:\n    U.S. government securities\n481\n \n6\n \n—\n \n487\n \n    States, municipalities and political subdivisions\n—\n \n70\n \n—\n \n70\n \n    U.S. corporate securities\n—\n \n2,752\n \n1\n \n2,753\n \n    Foreign securities\n—\n \n98\n \n—\n \n98\n \n    Residential mortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n7\n \n—\n \n7\n \n    Commercial mortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n9\n \n—\n \n9\n \n    Other asset-backed securities\n—\n \n4\n \n—\n \n4\n \n    Redeemable preferred securities\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \nTotal debt securities\n481\n \n2,947\n \n1\n \n3,429\n \nEquity securities:\n    U.S. domestic\n30\n \n—\n \n—\n \n30\n \n    International\n12\n \n—\n \n—\n \n12\n \nTotal equity securities\n42\n \n—\n \n—\n \n42\n \nOther investments:\n    Private real estate\n—\n \n—\n \n276\n \n276\n \n    Common/collective trusts \n(1)\n—\n \n502\n \n—\n \n502\n \n    Derivatives\n—\n \n3\n \n—\n \n3\n \nTotal other investments\n—\n \n505\n \n276\n \n781\n \nTotal pension investments \n(2)\n$\n555\n \n$\n3,519\n \n$\n277\n \n$\n4,351\n \n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nThe assets in the underlying funds of common/collective trusts consist of $\n288\n million of equity securities and $\n214\n million of debt securities. \n(2)\nExcludes $\n267\n million of other receivables as well as $\n290\n million of private equity limited partnership investments and $\n280\n million of hedge fund limited partnership investments as these amounts are measured at NAV per share or an equivalent and are not subject to leveling within the fair value hierarchy. \n165\nPension plan assets with changes in fair value measured on a recurring basis at December 31, 2023 were as follows: \nIn millions\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nTotal\nCash and cash equivalents\n$\n12\n \n$\n69\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n81\n \nDebt securities:\n    U.S. government securities\n518\n \n4\n \n—\n \n522\n \n    States, municipalities and political subdivisions\n—\n \n94\n \n—\n \n94\n \n    U.S. corporate securities\n—\n \n2,649\n \n—\n \n2,649\n \n    Foreign securities\n—\n \n106\n \n—\n \n106\n \n    Residential mortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n17\n \n—\n \n17\n \n    Commercial mortgage-backed securities\n—\n \n9\n \n—\n \n9\n \n    Other asset-backed securities\n—\n \n8\n \n—\n \n8\n \n    Redeemable preferred securities\n—\n \n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \nTotal debt securities\n518\n \n2,888\n \n—\n \n3,406\n \nEquity securities:\n    U.S. domestic\n150\n \n—\n \n—\n \n150\n \n    International\n34\n \n—\n \n—\n \n34\n \nTotal equity securities\n184\n \n—\n \n—\n \n184\n \nOther investments:\n    Private real estate\n—\n \n—\n \n290\n \n290\n \n    Common/collective trusts \n(1)\n—\n \n405\n \n—\n \n405\n \n    Derivatives\n—\n \n(\n14\n)\n—\n \n(\n14\n)\nTotal other investments\n—\n \n391\n \n290\n \n681\n \nTotal pension investments \n(2)\n$\n714\n \n$\n3,348\n \n$\n290\n \n$\n4,352\n \n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nThe assets in the underlying funds of common/collective trusts consist of $\n114\n million of equity securities and $\n291\n million of debt securities. \n(2)\nExcludes $\n314\n million of other receivables as well as $\n461\n million of private equity limited partnership investments and $\n252\n million of hedge fund limited partnership investments as these amounts are measured at NAV per share or an equivalent and are not subject to leveling within the fair value hierarchy.\n \nThe changes in the balances of Level 3 pension plan assets during the year ended December 31, 2024 were as follows:\nIn millions\nPrivate\nreal estate\nU.S. corporate\nsecurities\nTotal\nBeginning balance\n$\n290\n \n$\n—\n \n$\n290\n \nActual return on plan assets\n1\n \n—\n \n1\n \nPurchases, sales and settlements\n(\n15\n)\n1\n \n(\n14\n)\nTransfers out of Level 3\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nEnding balance\n$\n276\n \n$\n1\n \n$\n277\n \nThe changes in the balances of Level 3 pension plan assets during the year ended December 31, 2023 were as follows:\nIn millions\nPrivate\nreal estate\nBeginning balance\n$\n325\n \nActual return on plan assets\n(\n23\n)\nPurchases, sales and settlements\n(\n12\n)\nTransfers out of Level 3\n—\n \nEnding balance\n$\n290\n \n166\nThe Company’s pension plan invests in a diversified mix of assets designed to generate returns that will enable the plan to meet its future benefit obligations. The risk of unexpected investment and actuarial outcomes is regularly evaluated. This evaluation is performed through forecasting and assessing ranges of investment outcomes over short- and long-term horizons and by assessing the pension plan’s liability characteristics. Complementary investment styles and strategies are utilized by professional investment management firms to further improve portfolio and operational risk characteristics. Public and private equity investments are used primarily to increase overall plan returns. Real Assets investments are viewed favorably for their diversification benefits and above-average dividend generation. Fixed income investments provide diversification benefits and liability hedging attributes that are desirable, especially in falling interest rate environments.\nAt December 31, 2024, target investment allocations for the Company’s pension plan were: \n7\n% in equity securities, \n75\n% in fixed income and debt securities, \n7\n% in Real Assets, \n5\n% in private equity limited partnerships,  \n2\n% in private credit limited partnerships and \n4\n% in hedge funds. Actual asset allocations may differ from target allocations due to tactical decisions to overweight or underweight certain assets or as a result of normal fluctuations in asset values. Asset allocations are consistent with stated investment policies and, as a general rule, periodically rebalanced back to target asset allocations. Asset allocations and investment performance are formally reviewed periodically throughout the year by the pension plan’s Investment Subcommittee. Forecasting of asset and liability growth is performed at least annually.\nCash Flows\nThe Company generally contributes to its tax-qualified pension plan based on minimum funding requirements determined under applicable federal laws and regulations. Employer contributions related to the nonqualified supplemental pension plans generally represent payments to retirees for current benefits. The Company contributed $\n23\n million, $\n24\n million and $\n27\n million to its pension plans during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. No contributions were required for the tax-qualified pension plan in 2024. The Company expects to make an immaterial amount of contributions for all other pension plans in 2025.\nThe Company estimates the following future benefit payments, which are calculated using the same actuarial assumptions used to measure the pension benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024: \nIn millions\n2025\n$\n389\n \n2026\n384\n \n2027\n380\n \n2028\n380\n \n2029\n371\n \n2030-2034\n1,712\n \nMultiemployer Pension Plans\nThe Company also contributes to a number of multiemployer pension plans under the terms of collective-bargaining agreements that cover its union-represented employees. The risks of participating in these multiemployer plans are different from single-employer pension plans in the following respects: (i) assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers, (ii) if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers, and (iii) if the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the applicable plan, which is referred to as a withdrawal liability. \nNone of the multiemployer pension plans in which the Company participates are individually significant to the Company. The Company’s contributions to multiemployer pension plans were $\n19\n million, $\n19\n million and $\n20\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \nOther Postretirement Benefits\nThe Company provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain retirees who meet eligibility requirements. The Company’s funding policy is generally to pay covered expenses as they are incurred. For retiree medical plan accounting, the Company reviews external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rates. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company’s other postretirement benefits had an accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $\n147\n million and $\n155\n million, respectively. Net periodic benefit costs related to these other postretirement benefits were $\n6\n million, $\n6\n million and $\n4\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \n167\nThe Company estimates the following future benefit payments, which are calculated using the same actuarial assumptions used to measure the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2024:\nIn millions\n2025\n$\n12\n \n2026\n12\n \n2027\n12\n \n2028\n12\n \n2029\n12\n \n2030-2034\n59\n \nPursuant to various collective bargaining agreements, the Company also contributes to multiemployer health and welfare plans that cover certain union-represented employees. The plans provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to certain employees who meet eligibility requirements.

The IRS has completed its examinations of the Company’s consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns for tax years through 2016, 2018 and 2019. The IRS has substantially completed its examination of the Company’s consolidated U.S. federal income tax return for tax year 2017.\nCVS Health Corporation and its subsidiaries are also currently under income tax examinations by a number of state and local tax authorities. As of December 31, 2024, no examination has resulted in any proposed adjustments that would result in a material change to the Company’s operating results, financial condition or liquidity.\n169\nSubstantially all material state and local income tax matters have been concluded for fiscal years through 2015. Certain state exams are likely to be concluded and certain state statutes of limitations will lapse in 2025, but the change in the balance of the Company’s uncertain tax positions is projected to be immaterial. In addition, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits could change within the next twelve months due to the anticipated conclusion of various examinations with the IRS for certain previous years. An estimate of the range of the possible change cannot be made at this time.\nThe Company records interest expense related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties in the income tax provision. The Company accrued interest expense of approximately $\n45\n million, $\n31\n million and $\n29\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company had approximately $\n165\n million and $\n134\n million accrued for interest and penalties as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. \nAs of December 31, 2024, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the Company’s effective income tax rate is approximately $\n324\n million, after considering the federal benefit of state income taxes.\n13.\nStock Incentive Plans\nThe terms of the CVS Health 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan (“ICP”) provide for grants of annual incentive and long-term performance awards to executive officers and other officers and employees of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, as well as equity compensation to outside directors of CVS Health Corporation. Payment of such annual incentive and long-term performance awards will be in cash, stock, other awards or other property, at the discretion of the Management Planning and Development Committee (the “MP&D Committee”) of the Board. The ICP allows for a maximum of \n92\n million shares of CVS Health Corporation common stock to be reserved and available for grants. As of December 31, 2024, there were approximately \n33\n million shares of CVS Health Corporation common stock available for future grants under the ICP.\nAs of the Oak Street Health Acquisition Date, Oak Street Health common stock subject to awards outstanding under the Oak Street Health, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the “Oak Street Health Plan”) was converted into approximately \n3.9\n million shares of CVS Health Corporation underlying replacement equity awards. In addition, in accordance with the merger agreement, shares which were available for future issuance under the Oak Street Health Plan were converted into approximately \n7\n million shares of CVS Health common stock which were reserved and available for issuance pursuant to future awards as of December 31, 2023. Subsequent to the cancellation of the Oak Street Health plan on May 16, 2024, the ICP is the only compensation plan under which the Company grants stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards to its employees.\nAs of the Signify Health Acquisition Date, Signify Health common stock subject to awards outstanding under the Signify Health, Inc. 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Signify Plan”) was converted into approximately \n3.2\n million shares of CVS Health Corporation underlying replacement equity awards. In addition, in accordance with the merger agreement, shares which were available for future issuance under the Signify Plan were converted into approximately \n9\n million shares of CVS Health common stock which were reserved and available for issuance pursuant to future awards as of December 31, 2023. Subsequent to the cancellation of the Signify Plan on May 16, 2024, the ICP is the only compensation plan under which the Company grants stock options, restricted stock and other stock-based awards to its employees.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nStock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the stock award (generally \nthree\n to \nfive years\n) using the straight-line method. \nThe following table is a summary of stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nRestricted stock units and performance stock units \n$\n461\n \n$\n497\n \n$\n369\n \nStock options and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) \n(1)\n79\n \n91\n \n78\n \nTotal stock-based compensation \n(2)\n$\n540\n \n$\n588\n \n$\n447\n \n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nIncludes the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).\n(2)\nTotal stock-based compensation for the year ended December 31, 2024 included $\n60\n million and $\n41\n million of post-combination expense associated with replacement equity awards granted in connection with the Oak Street Health and Signify Health acquisitions, respectively. Total stock-based \n170\ncompensation for the year ended December 31, 2023 included $\n71\n million and $\n72\n million of post-combination expense associated with replacement equity awards granted in connection with the Oak Street Health and Signify Health acquisitions, respectively.\nRestricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units\nThe Company’s restricted stock units and performance stock units are considered nonvested share awards and require no payment from the employee. The fair value of the restricted stock units is based on the market price of CVS Health Corporation common stock on the grant date and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. For each restricted stock unit granted, employees receive \none\n share of common stock, net of taxes, at the end of the vesting period. \nThe Company’s performance stock units contain performance vesting conditions in addition to a service vesting condition. Vesting of the Company’s performance stock units is dependent upon the degree to which the Company achieves its performance goals, which are generally set for a \nthree-year\n performance period and are approved at the time of grant by the MP&D Committee. \nThe fair value of performance stock units granted with service and performance vesting conditions is based on the market price of CVS Health Corporation common stock on the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period. Certain of the performance stock units also contain a market vesting condition based on the performance of CVS Health Corporation common stock relative to a comparator group. The fair value of these performance stock units is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation as of the grant date and is recognized over the vesting period. \nAs of December 31, 2024, there was $\n829\n million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the Company’s restricted stock units and performance stock units that are expected to vest. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n2.2\n years. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $\n497\n million, $\n525\n million and $\n328\n million, respectively.\nThe following table is a summary of the restricted stock unit and performance stock unit activity for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nIn thousands, except weighted average grant date fair value\nUnits\nWeighted Average\nGrant Date\nFair Value\nOutstanding at beginning of year, nonvested\n16,994\n \n$\n77.65\n \nGranted\n9,978\n \n$\n75.97\n \nVested \n(1)\n(\n6,532\n)\n$\n76.08\n \nForfeited\n(\n1,928\n)\n$\n78.71\n \nOutstanding at end of year, nonvested\n18,512\n \n$\n77.19\n \n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nVested performance stock units have been included at target level performance. Based on actual performance, the number of restricted stock units and performance stock units vested during the year ended December 31, 2024 was \n6.6\n million.\nStock Options and SARs\nAll stock option and SARs grants are awarded at fair value on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options and SARs are estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and stock-based compensation is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock options and SARs granted generally become exercisable over a \nfour-year\n period from the grant date. Stock options granted through 2018 generally expire \nseven years\n after the grant date. Stock options and SARs granted subsequent to 2018 generally expire \nten years\n after the grant date.\nThe following table is a summary of stock option and SAR activity that occurred for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nCash received from stock options exercised (including ESPP)\n$\n361\n \n$\n277\n \n$\n551\n \nPayments for taxes for net share settlement of equity awards\n185\n \n181\n \n370\n \nIntrinsic value of stock options and SARs exercised \n33\n \n31\n \n118\n \nFair value of stock options and SARs vested \n225\n \n227\n \n219\n \n171\nThe fair value of each stock option and SAR is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the following assumptions at the time of grant:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDividend yield \n(1)\n4.29\n \n%\n3.27\n \n%\n2.18\n \n%\nExpected volatility \n(2)\n28.36\n \n%\n28.15\n \n%\n27.34\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rate \n(3)\n4.13\n \n%\n3.55\n \n%\n2.46\n \n%\nExpected life (in years)\n \n(4)\n5.3\n5.9\n6.3\nWeighted-average grant date fair value\n$\n11.31\n \n$\n21.78\n \n$\n24.15\n \n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nThe dividend yield is based on annual dividends paid and the fair market value of CVS Health Corporation stock at the grant date.\n(2)\nThe expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of CVS Health Corporation’s daily stock price over a period equal to the expected life of each option grant after adjustments for infrequent events such as stock splits.\n(3)\nThe risk-free interest rate is selected based on yields from U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the options being valued.\n(4)\nThe expected life represents the number of years the options are expected to be outstanding from grant date based on historical option or SAR holder exercise experience.\nAs of December 31, 2024, unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options and SARs totaled $\n44\n million, which the Company expects to be recognized over a weighted-average period of \n2.24\n years. After considering anticipated forfeitures, the Company expects approximately \n7\n million of the unvested stock options and SARs to vest over the requisite service period.\nThe following table is a summary of the Company’s stock option and SAR activity for the year ended December 31, 2024:\nIn thousands, except weighted average exercise price and remaining contractual term\nShares\nWeighted\nAverage\nExercise\n Price\nWeighted\nAverage\nRemaining\nContractual\nTerm\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nValue\nOutstanding at beginning of year\n15,126\n \n$\n68.13\n \nGranted\n4,435\n \n$\n68.91\n \nExercised\n(\n2,806\n)\n$\n59.61\n \nForfeited\n(\n1,046\n)\n$\n79.05\n \nExpired\n(\n690\n)\n$\n78.69\n \nOutstanding at end of year\n15,019\n \n$\n68.69\n \n5.10\n$\n3,279\n \nExercisable at end of year\n7,579\n \n$\n65.01\n \n3.25\n1,939\n \nVested at end of year and expected to vest in the future\n14,646\n \n$\n68.66\n \n5.02\n3,252\n \nESPP\nThe Company’s ESPP provides for the purchase of up to \n60\n million shares of CVS Health Corporation common stock. Under the ESPP, eligible employees may purchase common stock at the end of each \nsix month\n offering period at a purchase price equal to \n90\n% of the lower of the fair market value on the first day or the last day of the offering period. During 2024, approximately \n4\n million shares of common stock were purchased under the provisions of the ESPP at an average price of $\n58.57\n per share. As of December 31, 2024, approximately \n23\n million shares of common stock were available for issuance under the ESPP.\nThe fair value of stock-based compensation associated with the ESPP is estimated on the date of grant (the first day of the \nsix-month\n offering period) using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\n172\nThe following table is a summary of the assumptions used to value the ESPP awards for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDividend yield \n(1)\n2.01\n \n%\n1.54\n \n%\n1.12\n \n%\nExpected volatility \n(2)\n31.40\n \n%\n25.61\n \n%\n23.54\n \n%\nRisk-free interest rate \n(3)\n5.31\n \n%\n5.17\n \n%\n1.42\n \n%\nExpected life (in years)\n \n(4)\n0.5\n0.5\n0.5\nWeighted-average grant date fair value\n$\n12.39\n \n$\n14.26\n \n$\n16.25\n \n_____________________________________________\n(1)\nThe dividend yield is calculated based on semi-annual dividends paid and the fair market value of CVS Health Corporation stock at the grant date.\n(2)\nThe expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of CVS Health Corporation’s daily stock price over the previous six month period.\n(3)\nThe risk-free interest rate is selected based on the Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected term of ESPP purchases (i.e., six months).\n(4)\nThe expected life is based on the semi-annual purchase period.\n14.\nShareholders’ Equity\nShare Repurchases\nThe following share repurchase programs have been authorized by the Board:\nIn billions\nAuthorization Date\nAuthorized\nRemaining as of\nDecember 31, 2024\nNovember 17, 2022 (“2022 Repurchase Program”)\n$\n10.0\n \n$\n10.0\n \nDecember 9, 2021 (“2021 Repurchase Program”)\n10.0\n \n1.5\n \nEach of the share Repurchase Programs was effective immediately and permit the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) transactions, and/or other derivative transactions. Both the 2022 and 2021 Repurchase Programs can be modified or terminated by the Board at any time.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company repurchased an aggregate of \n39.7\n million shares of common stock for approximately $\n3.0\n billion, an aggregate of \n22.8\n million shares of common stock for approximately $\n2.0\n billion and an aggregate of \n34.1\n million shares of common stock for approximately $\n3.5\n billion, respectively, each pursuant to the 2021 Repurchase Program. This activity includes the share repurchases under the ASR transactions described below.\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $\n3.0\n billion fixed dollar ASR with Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”). Upon payment of the $\n3.0\n billion purchase price on January 4, 2024, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock equal to \n85\n% of the $\n3.0\n billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately \n31.4\n million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2024. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $\n2.6\n billion and a forward contract for $\n0.4\n billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In March 2024, the Company received approximately \n8.3\n million shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock, representing the remaining \n15\n% of the $\n3.0\n billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in March 2024.\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $\n2.0\n billion fixed dollar ASR with Citibank, N.A. Upon payment of the $\n2.0\n billion purchase price on January 4, 2023, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock equal to \n80\n% of the $\n2.0\n billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately \n17.4\n million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2023. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $\n1.6\n billion and a forward contract for $\n0.4\n billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In February 2023, the Company received approximately \n5.4\n million shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock, representing the remaining \n20\n% of the $\n2.0\n billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury stock and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in February 2023.\n173\nPursuant to the authorization under the 2021 Repurchase Program, the Company entered into a $\n1.5\n billion fixed dollar ASR with Barclays Bank PLC. Upon payment of the $\n1.5\n billion purchase price on January 4, 2022, the Company received a number of shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock equal to \n80\n% of the $\n1.5\n billion notional amount of the ASR or approximately \n11.6\n million shares, which were placed into treasury stock in January 2022. The ASR was accounted for as an initial treasury stock transaction for $\n1.2\n billion and a forward contract for $\n0.3\n billion. The forward contract was classified as an equity instrument and was recorded within capital surplus. In February 2022, the Company received approximately \n2.7\n million shares of CVS Health Corporation’s common stock, representing the remaining \n20\n% of the $\n1.5\n billion notional amount of the ASR, thereby concluding the ASR. These shares were placed into treasury stock and the forward contract was reclassified from capital surplus to treasury stock in February 2022.\nAt the time they were received, the initial and final receipt of shares resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.\nDividends\nThe quarterly cash dividend declared by the Board was $\n0.665\n, $\n0.605\n and $\n0.55\n per share in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. CVS Health Corporation has paid cash dividends every quarter since becoming a public company. Future dividend payments will depend on the Company’s earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors considered relevant by the Board.\nRegulatory Requirements\nThe Company’s insurance business operations are conducted through subsidiaries that principally consist of health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) and insurance companies. The Company’s HMO and insurance subsidiaries report their financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed by state regulatory authorities which may differ from GAAP. \nThe combined statutory net income for the years ended and estimated combined statutory and capital surplus at December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 for the Company’s insurance and HMO subsidiaries were as follows:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nStatutory net income (loss)\n$\n(\n1,185\n)\n$\n2,757\n \n$\n2,851\n \nEstimated statutory capital and surplus\n20,085\n \n16,961\n \n15,503\n \nThe Company’s insurance and HMO subsidiaries paid $\n755\n million of gross dividends to the Company for the year ended December 31, 2024.\nIn addition to general state law restrictions on payments of dividends and other distributions to stockholders applicable to all corporations, HMOs and insurance companies are subject to further regulations that, among other things, may require those companies to maintain certain levels of equity and restrict the amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their equity holders. In addition, in connection with the acquisition of Aetna, the Company made certain undertakings that require prior regulatory approval of dividends by certain of its HMOs and insurance companies. \nAt December 31, 2024, these amounts were as follows:\nIn millions\nEstimated minimum statutory surplus required by regulators\n$\n11,691\n \nInvestments on deposit with regulatory bodies\n713\n \nEstimated maximum dividend distributions permitted in 2025 without prior regulatory approval\n1,561\n \nNoncontrolling Interests\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, noncontrolling interests were $\n170\n million and $\n175\n million, respectively, primarily related to third party interests in the Company’s operating entities. The noncontrolling entities’ share is included in total shareholders\n’\n equity on the consolidated balance sheets.\n174\n15.\nOther Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nShareholders’ equity included the following activity in accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nAt December 31,\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNet unrealized investment gains (losses):\nBeginning of year balance\n$\n(\n429\n)\n$\n(\n1,519\n)\n$\n798\n \nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications \n($(\n177\n), $\n612\n and $(\n3,021\n) pretax)\n(\n170\n)\n603\n \n(\n2,556\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) \n($\n226\n, $\n566\n and $\n315\n pretax)\n \n(1)\n200\n \n487\n \n239\n \nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n30\n \n1,090\n \n(\n2,317\n)\nEnd of year balance\n(\n399\n)\n(\n429\n)\n(\n1,519\n)\nChange in discount rate on long-duration insurance reserves:\nBeginning of period balance\n152\n \n219\n \n(\n651\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications \n($\n146\n, $(\n92\n), and $\n1,126\n pretax)\n113\n \n(\n67\n)\n870\n \nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n113\n \n(\n67\n)\n870\n \nEnd of period balance\n265\n \n152\n \n219\n \nForeign currency translation adjustments:\nBeginning of year balance\n—\n \n—\n \n—\n \nOther comprehensive loss before reclassifications\n(\n4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nOther comprehensive loss\n(\n4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nEnd of year balance\n(\n4\n)\n—\n \n—\n \nNet cash flow hedges:\nBeginning of year balance\n244\n \n239\n \n222\n \nOther comprehensive income before reclassifications \n($\n0\n, $\n25\n and $\n38\n pretax)\n—\n \n19\n \n28\n \nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income \n($(\n20\n), $(\n19\n) and $(\n15\n) pretax)\n \n(2)\n(\n15\n)\n(\n14\n)\n(\n11\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n15\n)\n5\n \n17\n \nEnd of year balance\n229\n \n244\n \n239\n \nPension and other postretirement benefits:\nBeginning of year balance\n(\n264\n)\n(\n203\n)\n(\n35\n)\nOther comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications \n($\n71\n, $(\n81\n) and $(\n229\n) pretax)\n53\n \n(\n61\n)\n(\n170\n)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss \n($\n0\n, $\n0\n and $\n3\n pretax) \n(3)\n—\n \n—\n \n2\n \nOther comprehensive income (loss) \n53\n \n(\n61\n)\n(\n168\n)\nEnd of year balance\n(\n211\n)\n(\n264\n)\n(\n203\n)\nTotal beginning of year accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n(\n297\n)\n(\n1,264\n)\n334\n \nTotal other comprehensive income (loss)\n177\n \n967\n \n(\n1,598\n)\nTotal end of year accumulated other comprehensive loss\n$\n(\n120\n)\n$\n(\n297\n)\n$\n(\n1,264\n)\n_______________________________________\n(1)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for specifically identified debt securities are included in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations. \n(2)\nAmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income for specifically identified cash flow hedges are included within interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Stock options and SARs to purchase \n8\n million, \n8\n million and \n4\n million shares of common stock were outstanding, but were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, because their exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the common shares and, therefore, the effect would be antidilutive. \nThe following is a reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\nIn millions, except per share amounts\n2024\n2023\n2022\nNumerator for earnings per share calculation:\nNet income attributable to CVS Health\n$\n4,614\n \n$\n8,344\n \n$\n4,311\n \nDenominator for earnings per share calculation:\nWeighted average shares, basic\n1,259\n \n1,285\n \n1,312\n \nRestricted stock units and performance stock units\n2\n \n3\n \n6\n \nStock options and SARs\n1\n \n2\n \n5\n \nWeighted average shares, diluted\n1,262\n \n1,290\n \n1,323\n \nEarnings per share:\nBasic\n$\n3.67\n \n$\n6.49\n \n$\n3.29\n \nDiluted\n$\n3.66\n \n$\n6.47\n \n$\n3.26\n \n17.\nReinsurance\nThe Company utilizes reinsurance agreements primarily to: (a) reduce required capital and (b) facilitate the acquisition or disposition of certain insurance contracts. Ceded reinsurance agreements permit the Company to recover a portion of its losses from reinsurers, although they do not discharge the Company’s primary liability as the direct insurer of the risks reinsured.\nIn January 2025, the Company entered into \nthree\n \nfour-year\n reinsurance agreements with an unrelated reinsurer that allow it to reduce required capital and provide collateralized excess of loss reinsurance coverage on a portion of the Health Care Benefits segment’s group Commercial Insured business.\nReinsurance recoverables (recorded as other current assets or other assets on the consolidated balance sheets) at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were as follows:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\nReinsurer\nHartford Life and Accident Insurance Company\n$\n1,119\n \n$\n1,314\n \nLincoln Life & Annuity Company of New York\n444\n \n480\n \nIndividual State Reinsurance Programs\n189\n \n61\n \nFresenius Medical Care Reinsurance Company (Cayman) Ltd. \n75\n \n54\n \nResolution Life Group Holdings Ltd.\n33\n \n35\n \nAll Other\n67\n \n54\n \nTotal\n$\n1,927\n \n$\n1,998\n \n176\nDirect, assumed and ceded premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDirect\n$\n123,629\n \n$\n99,753\n \n$\n85,670\n \nAssumed\n471\n \n350\n \n432\n \nCeded\n(\n1,204\n)\n(\n911\n)\n(\n772\n)\nNet premiums\n$\n122,896\n \n$\n99,192\n \n$\n85,330\n \nThe impact of reinsurance on health care costs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was as follows:\nIn millions\n2024\n2023\n2022\nDirect\n$\n115,974\n \n$\n86,738\n \n$\n71,357\n \nAssumed\n431\n \n223\n \n379\n \nCeded\n(\n1,284\n)\n(\n714\n)\n(\n663\n)\nNet health care costs\n$\n115,121\n \n$\n86,247\n \n$\n71,073\n \nThere is not a material difference between premiums on a written basis versus an earned basis.\nThe Company also has various agreements with unrelated reinsurers that do not qualify for reinsurance accounting under GAAP, and consequently are accounted for using deposit accounting. The Company entered into these contracts to reduce the risk of catastrophic loss which in turn reduces the Company’s capital and surplus requirements. Total deposit assets and liabilities related to reinsurance agreements that do not qualify for reinsurance accounting under GAAP were not material as of December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n18.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nGuarantees\nThe Company had the following significant guarantee arrangements at December 31, 2024:\n•\nASC Claim Funding Accounts - The Company has arrangements with certain banks for the processing of claim payments for its ASC customers. The banks maintain accounts to fund claims of the Company’s ASC customers. The customer is responsible for funding the amount paid by the bank each day. In these arrangements, the Company guarantees that the banks will not sustain losses if the responsible ASC customer does not properly fund its account. The aggregate maximum exposure under these arrangements is generally limited to $\n300\n million. The Company can limit its exposure to these guarantees by suspending the payment of claims for ASC customers that have not adequately funded the amount paid by the bank. \n•\nSeparate Accounts Assets - Certain Separate Accounts assets associated with the large case pensions business in the Corporate/Other segment represent funds maintained as a contractual requirement to fund specific pension annuities that the Company has guaranteed. Minimum contractual obligations underlying the guaranteed benefits in these Separate Accounts were approximately $\n857\n million and $\n834\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ for additional information on Separate Accounts. Contract holders assume all investment and mortality risk and are required to maintain Separate Accounts balances at or above a specified level. The level of required funds is a function of the risk underlying the Separate Account’s investment strategy. If contract holders do not maintain the required level of Separate Accounts assets to meet the annuity guarantees, the Company would establish an additional liability. Contract holders’ balances in the Separate Accounts at December 31, 2024 exceeded the value of the guaranteed benefit obligation. As a result, the Company was not required to maintain any additional liability for its related guarantees at December 31, 2024. \nLease Guarantees\nBetween 1995 and 1997, the Company sold or spun off a number of subsidiaries, including Bob’s Stores, Linens ‘n Things and Marshalls. In many cases, when a former subsidiary leased a store, the Company provided a guarantee of the former subsidiary’s lease obligations for the initial lease term and any extension thereof pursuant to a renewal option provided for in the lease prior to the time of the disposition. When the subsidiaries were disposed of and accounted for as discontinued operations, the Company’s guarantees remained in place, although each initial purchaser agreed to indemnify the Company for \n177\nany lease obligations the Company was required to satisfy. If any of the purchasers or any of the former subsidiaries fail to make the required payments under a store lease, the Company could be required to satisfy those obligations. As of December 31, 2024, the Company guaranteed \n61\n such store leases (excluding the lease guarantees related to Linens ‘n Things, which have been recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets), with the maximum remaining lease term extending through 2035.\nGuaranty Fund Assessments, Market Stabilization and Other Non-Voluntary Risk Sharing Pools\nUnder guaranty fund laws existing in all states, insurers doing business in those states can be assessed (in most states up to prescribed limits) for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. The life and health insurance guaranty associations in which the Company participates that operate under these laws respond to insolvencies of long-term care insurers and life insurers as well as health insurers. The Company’s assessments generally are based on a formula relating to the Company’s health care premiums in the state compared to the premiums of other insurers. Certain states allow assessments to be recovered over time as offsets to premium taxes. Some states have similar laws relating to HMOs and/or other payors such as not-for-profit consumer-governed health plans established under the ACA.\nIn 2009, the Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner placed long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and one of its subsidiaries (collectively, “Penn Treaty”) in rehabilitation, an intermediate action before insolvency, and subsequently petitioned a state court to convert the rehabilitation into a liquidation. Penn Treaty was placed in liquidation in March 2017. The Company has recorded a liability for its estimated share of future assessments by applicable life and health insurance guaranty associations. It is reasonably possible that in the future the Company may record a liability and expense relating to other insolvencies which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, financial condition and cash flows. While historically the Company has ultimately recovered more than half of guaranty fund assessments through statutorily permitted premium tax offsets, significant increases in assessments could lead to legislative and/or regulatory actions that limit future offsets.\nHMOs in certain states in which the Company does business are subject to assessments, including market stabilization and other risk-sharing pools, for which the Company is assessed charges based on incurred claims, demographic membership mix and other factors. The Company establishes liabilities for these assessments based on applicable laws and regulations. In certain states, the ultimate assessments the Company pays are dependent upon the Company’s experience relative to other entities subject to the assessment, and the ultimate liability is not known at the financial statement date. While the ultimate amount of the assessment is dependent upon the experience of all pool participants, the Company believes it has adequate reserves to cover such assessments.\nThe Company’s total guaranty fund assessments liability was immaterial at both December 31, 2024 and 2023.\nLitigation and Regulatory Proceedings\nThe Company has been involved or is currently involved in numerous legal proceedings, including litigation, arbitration, government investigations, audits, reviews and claims. These include routine, regular and special investigations, audits and reviews by \nCMS, state insurance and health and welfare departments, \nthe U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”), \nstate Attorneys General, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”), the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and other governmental authorities.\nLegal proceedings, in general, and securities, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, and governmental special investigations, audits and reviews can be expensive and disruptive. Some of the litigation matters may purport or be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. The Company also may be named from time to time in\n qui tam\n actions initiated by private third parties that could also be separately pursued by a governmental body. The results of legal proceedings, including government investigations, are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in these matters can be substantial, regardless of the outcome.\nThe Company records accruals for outstanding legal matters when it believes it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company evaluates, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal matters that could affect the amount of any accrual and developments that would make a loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable. If a loss contingency is not both probable and reasonably estimable, the Company does not establish an accrued liability. Other than the controlled substances litigation accruals described below, none of the Company’s accruals for outstanding legal matters are material individually or in the aggregate to the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\n178\nExcept as otherwise noted, the Company cannot predict with certainty the timing or outcome of the legal matters described below, and the Company is unable to reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss in excess of amounts already accrued for these matters. The Company believes that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings, however, do sometimes occur, which could result in judgments against the Company, entry into settlements or a revision to its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations. In addition, as a result of governmental investigations or proceedings, the Company may be subject to damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions including possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or exclusion from participating in government programs. The outcome of such governmental investigations of proceedings could be material to the Company.\nUsual and Customary Pricing Litigation\nThe Company is named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that allege that the Company’s retail pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process. These actions are brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs, including plan members, private payors and government payors, and are based on different legal theories. Some of these cases are brought as putative class actions, and in some instances, classes have been certified. The Company is defending itself against these claims.\nPBM Litigation and Investigations\nThe Company is named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is subject to a number of investigations concerning its PBM practices.\nThe Company is facing multiple lawsuits, including by the FTC, state Attorneys General, governmental subdivisions, private parties and several putative class actions, regarding drug pricing and its rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers. These complaints, brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs under a variety of legal theories, generally allege that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products. The majority of these cases have now been transferred into a multi-district litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. The Company is defending itself against these claims. The Company has also received subpoenas, civil investigative demands (“CIDs”), and other requests for documents and information from, and is being investigated by, the DOJ, the HHS, the FTC and Attorneys General of several states and the District of Columbia regarding its PBM practices, including pharmacy contracting practices and reimbursement, pricing and rebates. While the FTC has released a number of interim staff reports related to its studies of PBM practices under Section 6(b) of the FTC Act, which allows the FTC to conduct studies, among other activities, it has not yet released a final report. The Company has been providing documents and information in response to these subpoenas, CIDs, and requests for information. \nIn September 2024, the FTC filed an administrative complaint against the three largest PBMs (the “PBM Group”) and their affiliated group purchasing organizations, including subsidiaries of the Company. The complaint alleged that the PBM Group and their affiliated group purchasing organizations engaged in anti-competitive and unfair practices that “artificially” increased insulin costs. The Company is aggressively defending itself against the complaint. In November 2024, the PBM Group filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri challenging the constitutionality of the FTC’s administrative complaint.\nUnited States ex rel. Behnke v. CVS Caremark Corporation, \net al. (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania). In April 2018, the Court unsealed a complaint filed in February 2014. The government has declined to intervene in this case. The relator alleges that the Company submitted, or caused to be submitted, to Part D of the Medicare program Prescription Drug Event data and/or Direct and Indirect Remuneration reports that misrepresented true prices paid by the Company’s PBM to pharmacies for drugs dispensed to Part D beneficiaries with prescription benefits administered by the Company’s PBM. The Company is defending itself against these claims.\nControlled Substances Litigation, Audits and Subpoenas\nForty-five\n states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories are participating in a settlement resolving substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by participating states and political subdivisions but not private plaintiffs. A high percentage of eligible subdivisions within the participating states also have elected to join the settlement. The settlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com. The Company has separately entered into settlement \n179\nagreements with \nfour\n states – Florida, West Virginia, New Mexico and Nevada – and a high percentage of eligible subdivisions within those states also have elected to participate.\nThe final settlement agreement contains certain contingencies related to payment obligations. Because these contingencies are inherently unpredictable, the assessment requires judgments about future events. The amount of ultimate loss may differ from the amount accrued by the Company.\nThe State of Maryland has elected not to participate, and thus subdivisions within the State of Maryland may not participate, in the settlement. The State of Maryland has issued a civil subpoena for information from the Company, \nand litigation is pending with certain subdivisions within the State of Maryland as well as other non-participating subdivisions in other geographies, including the City of Philadelphia, and private parties such as hospitals and third-party payors. The Company is defending itself against the claims made in these cases.\nIn November 2021, the Company was among the chain pharmacies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; in August 2022, the court issued a judgment jointly against the three defendants in the amount of $\n651\n million to be paid over \n15\n years and also ordered certain injunctive relief. In December 2024, following an appeal by the Company, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that Ohio law precluded the claim on which the verdict and judgment were based. \nBecause of the many uncertainties associated with any settlement arrangement or other resolution of opioid-related litigation matters, and because the Company continues to actively defend ongoing litigation for which it believes it has defenses and assertions that have merit, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioid-related litigation matters at this time. The outcome of these legal matters could have a material effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows. \nIn December 2024, the DOJ intervened in a previously sealed \nqui tam\n action and filed an amended complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, alleging, among other claims, violations of the federal Controlled Substances Act and the federal False Claims Act based on the filling of opioid and other controlled substance prescriptions at CVS Pharmacy locations nationwide. The Company is defending itself against the claims made in this case. Separately, the Company was served in December 2024 with a subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, seeking records related to, among other things, commercial arrangements between the Company’s PBM and opioid manufacturers.\nPrescription Processing Litigation and Investigations\nThe Company is named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is subject to a number of investigations concerning its prescription processing practices, including related to billing government payors for prescriptions, and the following:\nU.S. \nex rel.\n Bassan\n et al.\n v. Omnicare, Inc. and CVS Health Corp. \n(U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York). In December 2019, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York filed a complaint-in-intervention in this previously sealed \nqui tam\n case. The complaint alleges that for certain non-skilled nursing facilities, Omnicare improperly filled prescriptions beyond one year where a valid prescription did not exist and that these dispensing events violated the federal False Claims Act. The Company is defending itself against these claims.\nU.S. ex rel. Gill et al. v. CVS Health Corp. et al.\n (U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois). In July 2022, the Delaware Attorney General’s Office moved for partial intervention as to allegations under the Delaware false claims act related to not escheating alleged overpayments in this previously sealed \nqui tam\n case. The federal government and the remaining states declined to intervene on other additional theories in the relator’s complaint, except that the federal government filed a notice of intervention for the limited purpose of defending the constitutionality of the \nqui tam\n provisions of the False Claims Act. The Company is defending itself against all of the claims.\nProvider Proceedings\nThe Company is named as a defendant in purported class actions and individual lawsuits arising out of its practices related to the payment of claims for services rendered to its members by providers with whom the Company has a contract and with whom the Company does not have a contract (“out-of-network providers”). Among other things, these lawsuits allege that the Company paid too little to its health plan members and/or providers for out-of-network services (including COVID-19 testing) and/or otherwise allege that the Company failed to timely or appropriately pay or administer claims and benefits (including the \n180\nCompany’s post payment audit and collection practices). Other major health insurers are the subject of similar litigation or have settled similar litigation.\nThe Company also has received subpoenas and/or requests for documents and other information from, and been investigated by, state Attorneys General and other state and/or federal regulators, legislators and agencies relating to claims payments, and the Company is involved in other litigation regarding its out-of-network benefit payment and administration practices. It is reasonably possible that others could initiate additional litigation or additional regulatory action against the Company with respect to its out-of-network benefit payment and/or administration practices.\nCMS Actions\nCMS regularly audits the Company’s performance to determine its compliance with CMS’s regulations and its contracts with CMS and to assess the quality of services it provides to Medicare beneficiaries. CMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate and adjust premium payments to the Company’s and other companies’ Medicare plans by considering the applicable health status of Medicare members as supported by information prepared, maintained and provided by providers. The Company collects claim and encounter data from providers and generally relies on providers to appropriately code their submissions to the Company and document their medical records, including the diagnosis data submitted to the Company with claims. CMS pays increased premiums to Medicare Advantage plans and Medicare PDP plans for members who have certain medical conditions identified with specific diagnosis codes. Federal regulators review and audit the providers’ medical records to determine whether those records support the related diagnosis codes that determine the members’ health status and the resulting risk-adjusted premium payments to the Company. In that regard, CMS has instituted risk adjustment data validation (“RADV”) audits of various Medicare Advantage plans, including certain of the Company’s plans, to validate coding practices and supporting medical record documentation maintained by providers and the resulting risk-adjusted premium payments to the plans. CMS may require the Company to refund premium payments if the Company’s risk-adjusted premiums are not properly supported by medical record data. The Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the “OIG”) also is auditing the Company’s risk adjustment-related data and that of other companies. The Company expects CMS and the OIG to continue these types of audits.\nIn 2012, in the “Notice of Final Payment Error Calculation for Part C Medicare Advantage Risk Adjustment Validation Data (“RADV”) Contract-Level Audits,” CMS revised its audit methodology for RADV contract-level audits to determine refunds payable by Medicare Advantage plans for contract year 2011 and forward. Under the revised methodology, among other things, CMS announced extrapolation of the error rate identified in the audit sample along with the application of a process to account for errors in the government’s traditional fee-for-service Medicare program (“FFS Adjuster”). For contract years prior to 2011, CMS did not extrapolate sample error rates to the entire contract, nor did CMS propose to apply a FFS adjuster. By applying the FFS Adjuster, Medicare Advantage organizations would have been liable for repayments only to the extent that their extrapolated payment errors exceeded the error rate in Original Medicare, which could have impacted the extrapolated repayments to which Medicare Advantage organizations are subject. This revised contract-level audit methodology increased the Company’s exposure to premium refunds to CMS based on incomplete medical records maintained by providers. In the RADV audit methodology CMS used from 2011-2013, CMS selected only a few of the Company’s Medicare Advantage contracts for various contract years for contract-level RADV audits. In October 2018, CMS in the proposed rule announced a new methodology for RADV audits targeting certain health conditions and members with many diagnostic conditions along with extrapolation for the error rates identified without use of a FFS Adjuster. While the rule was under proposal, CMS initiated contract-level RADV audits for the years 2014 and 2015 with this new RADV methodology without a final rule. \nOn January 30, 2023, CMS released the final rule (“RADV Audit Rule”), announcing it may use extrapolation for payment years 2018 forward, for both RADV audits and OIG contract level audits, and eliminated the application of a FFS Adjuster in Part C contract-level RADV audits of Medicare Advantage organizations. In the RADV Audit Rule, CMS indicated that it will use more than one audit methodology going forward and indicated CMS will audit contracts it believes are at the highest risk for overpayments based on its statistical modeling, citing a 2016 Governmental Accountability Office report that recommended selection of contract-level RADV audits with a focus on contracts likely to have high rates of improper payment, the highest coding intensity scores, and contracts with high levels of unsupported diagnoses from prior RADV audits.\nThe Company is currently unable to predict which of its Medicare Advantage contracts will be selected for audit, the amounts of any retroactive refunds for years prior to 2018 or prospective adjustments to Medicare Advantage premium payments made to the Company, the effect of any such refunds or adjustments on the actuarial soundness of the Company’s Medicare Advantage bids, or whether any RADV audit findings would require the Company to change its method of estimating future premium revenue in future bid submissions to CMS or compromise premium assumptions made in the Company’s bids for prior contract years, the current contract year or future contract years. Any premium or fee refunds or adjustments resulting \n181\nfrom regulatory audits, whether as a result of RADV, Public Exchange-related or other audits by CMS, the OIG or otherwise, including audits of the Company’s minimum loss ratio rebates, methodology and/or reports, could be material and could adversely affect the Company’s operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition.\nThe RADV Audit Rule does not apply to the CMS Part C Improper Payment Measures audits nor the HHS RADV programs.\nMedicare and Medicaid Litigation and Investigations\nThe Company has received CIDs from the Civil Division of the DOJ in connection with investigations of the Company’s identification and/or submission of diagnosis codes related to risk adjustment payments, including patient chart review processes, under Parts C and D of the Medicare program. The Company is cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to these CIDs.\nIn May 2017, the Company received a CID from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York requesting documents and information concerning possible false claims submitted to Medicare in connection with reimbursements for prescription drugs under the Medicare Part D program. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to this CID.\nSince January 2022, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts has issued subpoenas to Aetna Life Insurance Company seeking, among other things, information in connection with its relationship and compensation arrangements with certain brokers, and the Company may receive similar inquiries in the future. The Company is cooperating with the investigation.\nStockholder Matters\nBeginning in February 2019, multiple class action complaints, as well as a derivative complaint, were filed by putative plaintiffs against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors. The plaintiffs in these cases assert a variety of causes of action under federal securities laws that are premised on allegations that the defendants made certain omissions and misrepresentations relating to the performance of the Company’s LTC business unit. Since filing, several of the cases have been consolidated, and two have resolved. In February 2025, the District of Rhode Island granted the Company’s motion to dismiss \nIn re CVS Health Corp. Securities Act Litigation\n (formerly known as \nWaterford\n). A derivative case in the District of Rhode Island, \nLovoi v. Aguirre\n, had been stayed pending the outcome of the \nWaterford\n case, and the court has scheduled a status conference. In \nIn re CVS Health Corp. Securities Litigation\n (formerly known as \nCity of Warren\n and \nFreundlich\n), the Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the superior court’s order granting the Company’s motion to dismiss in January 2025. The Company and its current and former officers and directors are defending themselves against remaining claims. \nBeginning in December 2021, the Company has received \nthree\n demands for inspection of books and records pursuant to Delaware General Corporation Law Section 220 (“Section 220 demands”), as well as a derivative complaint (\nVladimir Gusinsky Revocable Trust v. Lynch, et al.\n) that was filed in January 2023, which the defendants moved to dismiss. The Section 220 demands and the complaint purport to be related to potential breaches of fiduciary duties by the Board in relation to certain matters concerning opioids. Following the Company’s response to the Section 220 demands, two of the three stockholders sent demand letters to the Board containing allegations substantially similar to those made in the earlier Section 220 demands and the derivative matter, and requested that it take certain actions, including consideration of its governance and policies with respect to controlled substances. The Board deferred consideration of these two demands until after the motion to dismiss the \nGusinsky\n case was decided. In July 2024, the court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the \nGusinsky\n case. In September 2024, the Board received a third demand letter containing similar allegations and requesting the Board take action. The Board has formed a demand review committee to evaluate the demands.\nIn January 2022, a shareholder class action complaint was filed in the Northern District of Illinois, \nAllison v. Oak Street Health, Inc., et al.\n Defendants include Oak Street Health and certain of its pre-acquisition officers and directors. The putative plaintiffs assert causes of action under various securities laws premised on allegations that defendants made omissions and misrepresentations to investors relating to marketing conduct they allege may violate the False Claims Act. \nIn May 2024, the parties reached agreement in principle to settle this action for an amount immaterial to the Company. The court granted approval of the settlement in December 2024.\nBeginning in July 2024, \ntwo\n purported class action complaints, as well as multiple derivative complaints, were filed by putative plaintiffs against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors. The plaintiffs in these cases assert a variety of causes of action under federal securities laws and state law that are premised on allegations that the defendants made certain \n182\nomissions and misrepresentations relating to the profitability of the Health Care Benefits segment. \nTwo\n purported class actions were filed and have been consolidated in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York under \nNixon v. CVS Health Corporation, et al. \nTwo\n derivative cases were also filed in the Southern District of New York and have been consolidated as \nIn re CVS Health Corporation Derivative Litigation\n. \nTwo\n derivative cases filed in the District of Rhode Island have been consolidated as \nIn re CVS Health Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation\n. The consolidated derivative actions have been stayed pending the outcome of any motion to dismiss in the consolidated \nNixon\n securities class action.\n \nThree\n additional derivative cases were filed in Rhode Island Superior Court:\n \nGoff v. Lynch, et al., Brodin v. Lynch, et al., \nand \nDavidow v. Lynch, et al.\n \nThe Company and the individual defendants are defending themselves against these claims. In January 2025, the Board received a stockholder demand containing allegations substantially similar to those made in the class action and derivative matters, and requesting that it take certain actions, including investigating whether any Board members or officers breached their fiduciary duties related to those allegations, and bringing litigation to recover the Company’s damages if any such misconduct is found. The Board is evaluating the demand.\nOther Legal and Regulatory Proceedings\nThe Company is also a party to other legal proceedings and is subject to government investigations, inquiries and audits, and has received and is cooperating with the government in response to CIDs, subpoenas, or similar process from various governmental agencies requesting information. These other legal proceedings and government actions include claims of or relating to bad faith, medical or professional malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, claims processing, dispensing of medications, the use of medical testing devices in the in-home evaluation setting, non-compliance with state and federal regulatory regimes, marketing misconduct, denial of or failure to timely or appropriately pay or administer claims and benefits, provider network structure (including the use of performance-based networks and termination of provider contracts), rescission of insurance coverage, improper disclosure or use of personal information, anticompetitive practices, the Company’s participation in the 340B program, general contractual matters, product liability, intellectual property litigation, discrimination and employment litigation. Some of these other legal proceedings are or are purported to be class actions or derivative claims. The Company is defending itself against the claims brought in these matters.\nAwards to the Company and others of certain government contracts, particularly Medicaid contracts and other contracts with government customers in the Company’s Health Care Benefits segment, frequently are subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders. These protests may result in awards to the Company being reversed, delayed, or modified. The loss or delay in implementation of any government contract could adversely affect the Company’s operating results. The Company will continue to defend contract awards it receives.\nThere also continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities and legislators of, and increased litigation regarding, the Company’s and the rest of the health care and related benefits industry’s business and reporting practices, including premium rate increases, utilization management, development and application of medical policies, complaint, grievance and appeal processing, information privacy, provider network structure (including provider network adequacy, the use of performance-based networks and termination of provider contracts), provider directory accuracy, calculation of minimum MLRs and/or payment of related rebates, delegated arrangements, rescission of insurance coverage, limited benefit health products, student health products, PBM practices (including manufacturers’ rebates, pricing, the use of narrow networks and the placement of drugs in formulary tiers), sales practices, customer service practices, vendor oversight, and claim payment practices (including payments to out-of-network providers).\nAs a leading national health solutions company, the Company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above. These government actions may prevent or delay the Company from implementing planned premium rate increases and may result, and have resulted, in restrictions on the Company’s businesses, changes to or clarifications of the Company’s business practices, retroactive adjustments to premiums, refunds or other payments to members, beneficiaries, states or the federal government, withholding of premium payments to the Company by government agencies, assessments of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs.\nThe Company can give no assurance that its businesses, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected, or that the Company will not be required to materially change its business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations as they may relate to one or more of the Company’s businesses, one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally; (iii) pending or future federal or state government investigations of one or more of the Company’s businesses, one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally; (iv) pending or future government audits, investigations or enforcement actions against the Company; (v) \n183\nadverse developments in any pending \nqui tam\n lawsuit against the Company, whether sealed or unsealed, or in any future \nqui tam\n lawsuit that may be filed against the Company; or (vi) adverse developments in pending or future legal proceedings against the Company or affecting one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally.\n19.\nSegment Reporting\nThe Company has \nfour\n reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other. The Company’s segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the segments’ operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based on adjusted operating income. Total assets by segment are not used by the CODM to assess the performance of, or allocate resources to, the Company’s segments, therefore total assets by segment are not disclosed.\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses, and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company’s ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenues from the federal government accounted for \n24\n%, \n19\n% and \n18\n%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company’s segments to the consolidated totals:\n184\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nIn millions\nHealth Care\nBenefits\nHealth\nServices \n(1)\nPharmacy &\nConsumer

$\n11.4\n billion, $\n13.7\n billion and $\n12.6\n billion of retail co-payments for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. See Note 1 ‘‘Significant Accounting Policies’’ for additional information about retail co-payments.\n(2)\nIntersegment revenue eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur between the Health Care Benefits segment, the Health Services segment, and/or the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment.\n(3)\nOther segment items for each reportable segment includes operating expenses, which primarily consists of selling, general and administrative expenses. Other segment items excludes the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company’s business nor reflect the Company’s underlying business performance. \n(4)\nThe Company’s acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting which consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider networks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment when events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in operating expenses within each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company’s GAAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n(5)\nThe Company’s net realized capital gains and losses arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of assets that support the payment of insurance liabilities. Net realized capital gains and losses are reflected in net investment income (loss) within each segment. These capital gains and losses are the result of investment decisions, market conditions and other economic developments that are unrelated to the performance of the Company’s business, and the amount and timing of these capital gains and losses do not directly relate to the underwriting of the Company’s insurance products, the services performed for the Company’s customers or the sale of the Company’s products or services. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding net realized capital gains and losses enhances the Company’s and investors’ ability to compare the Company’s past financial performance with its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. \n187\n(6)\nIn 2024, the acquisition-related integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. In 2023, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relate to the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. The acquisition-related transaction and integration costs are reflected in operating expenses within the Corporate/Other segment.\n(7)\nIn 2024, the restructuring charges are primarily comprised of a store impairment charge, corporate workforce optimization costs, including severance and employee-related costs, other asset impairment and related charges associated with the discontinuation of certain non-core assets and a stock-based compensation charge. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and reduce costs. In connection with this restructuring plan, the Company completed a strategic review of its retail business and determined that it plans to close \n271\n retail stores in 2025, and, accordingly, it recorded a store impairment charge to write down the associated operating or financing lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment. In addition, during the third quarter of 2024, the Company also conducted a review of its various strategic assets and determined that it would discontinue the use of certain non-core assets, at which time impairment losses were recorded to write down the carrying value of these assets to the Company’s best estimate of their fair value. In 2023, the restructuring charges are primarily comprised of severance and employee-related costs, asset impairment charges and a stock-based compensation charge. The restructuring charges associated with the store impairments are reflected within the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, other asset impairments and related charges are reflected within the Corporate/Other and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments and corporate workforce optimization costs, including severance and employee-related costs, as well as stock-based compensation charges, are reflected within the Corporate/Other segment.\n(8)\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, the office real estate optimization charges primarily relate to the abandonment of leased real estate and the related right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company’s evaluation of corporate office real estate space in response to its ongoing flexible work arrangement. The office real estate optimization charges are reflected in operating expenses within each segment.\n(9)\nIn 2024, the opioid litigation charge relates to a change in the Company’s accrual related to ongoing opioid litigation matters. In 2022, the opioid litigation charges relate to agreements to resolve substantially all opioid claims against the Company by certain states and governmental entities. The opioid litigation charges are reflected within the Corporate/Other segment.\n(10)\nIn 2023 and 2022, the loss on assets held for sale relates to the LTC business within the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment. During 2022, the Company determined that its LTC business was no longer a strategic asset and committed to a plan to sell it, at which time the LTC business met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and its net assets were accounted for as assets held for sale. The carrying value of the LTC business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and, accordingly, the Company recorded a loss on assets held for sale during 2022. During the first quarter of 2023, a loss on assets held for sale was recorded to write down the carrying value of the LTC business to the Company’s best estimate of the ultimate selling price which reflected its estimated fair value less costs to sell. As of the third quarter of 2023, the Company determined the LTC business no longer met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and, accordingly, the net assets associated with the LTC business were reclassified to held and used at their respective fair values. During 2022, the loss on assets held for sale also relates to the Company’s Thailand business, which was included in the Commercial Business reporting unit in the Health Care Benefits segment. The sale of the Thailand business closed in the second quarter of 2022, and the ultimate loss on the sale was not material.\n(11)\nIn 2022, the gain on divestiture of subsidiaries represents the pre-tax gain on the sale of bswift, which the Company sold in November 2022, and the pre-tax gain on the sale of PayFlex, which the Company sold in June 2022. The gains on divestitures are reflected as a reduction of operating expenses within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n(12)\nIn 2024, the gain on early extinguishment of debt relates to the Company’s repayment of approximately $\n2.6\n billion of its outstanding senior notes in December 2024, pursuant to its tender offer for such senior notes.\n188\nIndex to Consolidated Financial Statements\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited CVS Health Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, CVS Health Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2024 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 12, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. \nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ \nErnst & Young LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 12, 2025 \n189\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of CVS Health Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CVS Health Corporation (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated\n \nFramework\n \nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 12, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nValuation of goodwill for the Government reporting unit\nDescription of the Matter\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company’s consolidated goodwill was $91.3 billion. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an annual impairment review, or more frequent reviews, if events and circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. \nAuditing the Company’s estimate of fair value related to the Government reporting unit was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions, such as the discount rate and projected health care costs, that are forward-looking and affected by future economic and market conditions. \n190\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s goodwill impairment review process, including controls over management’s review of the significant assumptions described above.\nTo test the estimated fair value of the Government reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing methodologies and testing the significant assumptions discussed above and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis. We compared the significant assumptions to the reporting unit’s historical results and third-party industry data. We assessed the historical accuracy of management’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the significant assumptions. We involved valuation specialists to assist in our assessment of the methodology and evaluation of the discount rate used by the Company.\nValuation of health care costs payable\nDescription of the Matter\nAt December 31, 2024, the incurred but not reported liabilities within the Health Care Benefits segment represented a significant portion of the health care costs payable. As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s liability for health care costs payable includes estimated payments for (1) services rendered to members but not yet reported and (2) claims that have been reported but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date (collectively, “IBNR”). The estimated IBNR liability is developed utilizing actuarial principles and assumptions that include historical and projected claim submission and processing patterns, historical and assumed medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claim inventory levels, changes in membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors to record the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. There is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management’s actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. In particular, the estimate is sensitive to the assumed completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rates. \nAuditing management’s actuarial best estimate of IBNR reserves for health care costs payable within the Health Care Benefits segment involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management’s assumptions used in the valuation process.\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process for estimating IBNR reserves. This included, among others, controls over the completeness and accuracy of data used in the actuarial projections, the transfer of data between underlying source systems, and the review and approval processes that management has in place for the actuarial principles and assumptions used in estimating the health care costs payable.   \nTo test IBNR reserves, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claim and membership data used in the calculation of IBNR reserves. We involved actuarial specialists to assist with our audit procedures, which included, among others, evaluating the methodologies applied by the Company in determining the actuarially determined liability, evaluating management’s actuarial principles and assumptions used in their analysis based on historical claim experience, and independently calculating a range of reserve estimates for comparison to management’s actuarial best estimate of the liability for health care costs payable. Additionally, we performed a review of the prior period liabilities for incurred but not paid claims to subsequent claims development.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2007.\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 12, 2025\n191\nTable of Contents\nItem 9.

Controls and Procedures.\nEvaluation of disclosure controls and procedures\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, after evaluating the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15 (f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of December 31, 2024, have concluded that as of such date the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were adequate and effective at a reasonable assurance level and designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries would be made known to such officers on a timely basis.\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial r\neporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of \nthe assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In order to ensure the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective, management regularly assesses such control and did so most recently for its financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.\nManagement conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the criteria established in \nInternal Control-Integrated Framework\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 Framework). This evaluation included review of the documentation, evaluation of the design effectiveness and testing of the operating effectiveness of controls. The Company\n’\ns system of internal control over financial reporting is enhanced by periodic reviews by the Company’s internal auditors, written policies and procedures and a written Code of Conduct adopted by CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Directors, applicable to all employees of the Company. In addition, the Company has an internal Disclosure Committee, comprised of management from each functional area within the Company, which performs a separate review of disclosure controls and procedures. There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting.\nBased on management’s assessment, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective and provides reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and that the financial records are reliable for preparing financial statements as of December 31, 2024.\nErnst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, is appointed by CVS Health Corporation’s Board of Directors and ratified by CVS Health Corporation’s stockholders.

Omnibus Incentive Plan, as amended  (the “Amended Oak Street Health Plan”), (iv) 747 thousand shares of common stock underlying outstanding equity awards pursuant to the Signify Health, Inc. 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “Signify Plan”), and (v) 45 thousand shares of common stock underlying outstanding equity awards pursuant to the Signify Health, Inc. 2021 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended  (the “Amended Signify Plan”).\nThe Company elected to continue to grant awards under the Aetna Plan to employees of Aetna and its subsidiaries following the completion of the Company’s acquisition of Aetna. The Aetna Plan was designed to promote Aetna’s interests and those of its stockholders and to further align the interests of stockholders and employees by tying awards to total return to stockholders, enabling plan participants to acquire additional equity interests and providing compensation opportunities dependent upon the Company’s performance. The Aetna Plan was not submitted to the Company’s stockholders and expired on May 21, 2020. Under the Aetna Plan, eligible participants could be granted stock options to purchase shares of CVS Health Corporation common stock, SARs, time-vesting and/or performance-vesting incentive stock or incentive units and other stock-based awards.\nThe Oak Street Plan and the Signify Plan were each approved by their respective company stockholders prior to their acquisition by CVS Health and have not been approved by the Company’s stockholders. The purpose of the Oak Street Plan was to enhance the profitability and value of Oak Street Health for the benefit of its stockholders by enabling it to offer eligible individuals stock- and cash-based incentives in order to attract, retain, and reward such individuals and strengthen the mutuality of interests between such individuals and stockholders. Under the Oak Street Plan, eligible participants could be granted time-based restricted stock units and awards. The purpose of the Signify Plan was to motivate and reward employees and other individuals to perform at the highest level and contribute significantly to the success of Signify Health, thereby furthering the best interests of its stockholders. Under the Signify Plan, eligible participants could be granted stock options to purchase shares of CVS Health Corporation common stock and time-based restricted stock units.\nThe Company elected to continue to grant awards under the Oak Street Plan and the Signify Plan until July 28, 2023, when the Amended Oak Street Plan and the Amended Signify Plan became effective. The Amended Oak Street Plan and the Amended Signify Plan, while not approved by the Company’s stockholders, have terms consistent with those of the CVS Health 2017 Incentive Compensation Plan. The Amended Oak Street Plan and the Amended Signify Plan expired on May 16, 2024, and no further shares may be granted under the terms thereof.\nItem 13.
