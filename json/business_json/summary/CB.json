  "item1_summary": " Our long-term business strategy focuses on sustained growth in book value achieved through a combination of underwriting and investment income . We are organized along a profit center structure by line of business and territory that does not necessarily correspond to corporate legal entities . Profit centers are expected to generate P&C underwriting income, life segment income, and appropriate risk-adjusted returns .\n Claims payments in any short-term period are highly unpredictable due to the random nature of loss events and the timing of claims awards or settlements . Value of investments held to pay future claims is subject to market forces such as the level of interest rates, stock market volatility, and credit events such as corporate defaults . Invested assets are substantially held in liquid, investment grade fixed income securities of relatively short duration .\n The following discussion provides more information regarding the estimates and assumptions required to arrive at these amounts . We believe our accounting policies for these items are of critical importance to our Consolidated Financial Statements . With the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, and certain reserves for unsettled claims, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money .\n The estimate of the liabilities includes provisions for claims that have been reported but are unpaid at the balance sheet date (case reserves) Loss reserves also include an estimate of expenses associated with processing and settling unpaid claims (loss expenses) The process of establishing loss reserves for property and casualty claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty .\n Case reserves for those claims reported by insureds or ceding companies to us prior to the balance sheet date are determined by our claims personnel as appropriate based on the circumstances of the claim(s), standard claim handling practices, and professional judgment . Reserve estimates for casualty lines are particularly uncertain given the lengthy reporting patterns and corresponding need for IBNR .\n Management's recorded reserves represent management's best estimate of the provision for unpaid claims as of the balance sheet date . New information or emerging trends that differ from our assumptions may lead to future development of losses and loss expenses that is significantly greater or less than the recorded reserve . For information on our reserving process, refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n It is difficult to convey, in a simple and quantitative manner, the impact that a change to a single assumption will have on our best estimate . In the examples below, we attempt to give an indication of the potential impact by isolating a single change for a specific reserving method that would be pertinent in establishing the best estimate for the product line described .\n A five percentage point change in the tail factor (e.g., 1.10 changed to either 1.15 or 1.05) would cause a change of approximately $0.8 billion, either positive or negative, for the projected net loss and loss expense reserves . This represents an impact of about 18 percent relative to recorded net loss .\n Certain long-tail lines, such as casualty and financial lines, are particularly susceptible to changes in loss trend and claim inflation . Heightened perceptions of tort and settlement awards around the world can increase the demand for these products as well as contributing to the uncertainty in the reserving estimates . The main drivers of volatility in the Personal Lines business are relatively short-term in nature and relate to things like natural catastrophes .\n The lengthening of our selected loss development patterns by six months would increase reserve estimates on long-tail casualty and financial lines for accident years 2022 and prior by approximately $500 million . This represents an impact of 10.1 percent relative to recorded net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately $4.9 billion .\n The estimation of unpaid losses and loss expenses for assumed reinsurance includes certain risks and uncertainties that are unique relative to our direct insurance business . These include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following: The reported claims information could be inaccurate; the historical claims data for a particular reinsurance contract can be limited; the actual number of claims may be susceptible to significant variability .\n For IBNR, we use historical experience and other statistical information, depending on the type of business, to estimate the ultimate loss . At December 31, 2024, the case reserves, net of retrocessions, reported to us by our ceding companies, approximated our recorded case reserves . Our policy is to post additional case reserves when our evaluation of the ultimate value of a reported claim is different than that of our cedant .\n The underlying source and selection of the final development patterns can have a significant impact on the selected ultimate net losses and loss expenses . For example, a 20 percent shortening of the development patterns used for U.S. long-tail lines would cause the loss reserve estimate to change by approximately $184 million . The estimation of our A&E liabilities is particularly sensitive to future changes in the legal, social, and economic environment .\n Chubb's exposure to molestation claims principally arises out of liabilities acquired when it purchased CIGNA's P&C business in 1999 and Chubb Corp in 2016 . The vast majority of the current liability relates to exposure from recently enacted \"reviver\" legislation in certain states that allow civil claims relating to molesting policyholders to be asserted against policyholders .\n Chubb issues contracts that are classified as long-duration, which generally cover accident and supplemental health (A&H) products; term, credit, and whole life products (both participating and non-participating); endowment products; and annuities . Chubb establishes a liability for future policy benefits (FPBL) which comprises the present value of estimated future policy benefit to be paid along with certain related expenses . The FPBL is established using a net premium valuation methodology .\n Best estimate assumptions are reviewed and updated at least annually, and may be updated in interim periods if we observe a material change indicative of a long-term trend . Discount rates used to measure the carrying value of the FPBL are updated quarterly, and the differences between the liability balances calculated using the locked-in discount rates and the updated discount rates are recognized in Other comprehensive income .\n New information or emerging trends that impact best estimate assumptions may have a material effect on the FPBL and future operating results . Reserves for limited-payment contracts, under which benefits extend beyond the period of premium collection, also include a deferred profit liability (DPL) DPL represents gross premiums received in excess of expected net premiums . The amortization of DPL is included in Policy benefits on the Consolidated statements of operations .\n Changes in best estimate assumptions could result in impacts to the Consolidated Financial Statements that are in excess of the amounts illustrated . The FPBL has increased or (decrease) of the FPBL as a result of changes in various best estimates assumptions . ile we consider each of the following assumption changes to represent a reasonably likely deviation, actual development may be materially different .\n We amortize VOBA as a component of Policy acquisition costs in the Consolidated statements of operations in relation to the profit emergence of the underlying contracts . At least annually, we perform a VOBA asset recoverability review using a premium deficiency test to ensure that the unamortized portion does not exceed the expected recoverable amounts . Unrecoverable costs are expensed in the period identified .\n Contracts that include fixed premium (i.e., premium not subject to adjustment based on loss experience under the contract) for fixed coverage generally transfer risk . For such contracts, risk transfer must be specifically assessed for each contract by developing expected cash flow analyses at contract inception . Cash flow analyses must demonstrate that a significant loss is reasonably possible .\n We entered into a few multi-year excess of loss retrospectively-rated contracts, principally in 2002 . These contracts provided severity protection for specific product divisions . All of these contracts transferred risk and were accounted for as reinsurance . We have not purchased any other retroactive ceded reinsurance contracts since 1999 . For certain insurance contracts that have been written for which risk transfer criteria had not been met, a risk transfer review of the contract prior to binding is triggered .\n The amount of unpaid losses and loss expenses is determined as part of the recovery process . The amount is determined by the amount of money owed to the company and the amount that is owed to be paid back . The recovery process is called “referred” and ‘rewarded’ by the government .\n The majority of the recoverable balance will not be due for collection until sometime in the future . Economic conditions and operational performance of a particular reinsurer may impact their ability to meet these obligations . Changes in the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance are reflected in net income . Ceded IBNR is allocated to reinsurance contracts because it is not generally calculated on a contract by contract basis .\n The allocation of reinsurance recoverable by reinsurer will be reviewed and may change . While such change is unlikely to result in a large percentage change in the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance, it could, nevertheless, have a material effect on our net income in the period recorded . The definition of collateral for this purpose requires some judgment and is generally limited to assets held in a Chubb-only beneficiary trust .\n The default factor we apply is based on a historical default factor of a major rating agency applicable to the particular rating class . Default factors applied for financial ratings of AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B, and CCC, are 0.4%, 1.1% and 1.5% . For balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which our ceded reserve is below a certain threshold, we generally apply a default factor .\n The valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is based on a default analysis of all balances outstanding, net of collateral . For captives and other recoverables, management determines the valuation allowance based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each company's insolvency . The following table summarizes reinsurance recoverables and the valuation allowances for each type of recoverable balance at December 31, 2024 .\n At December 31, 2024, the use of different assumptions within our approach could have a material effect on the valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance . To the extent the creditworthiness of our reinsurers was to deteriorate due to an adverse event affecting the reinsurance industry, such as a large number of major catastrophes, could be significantly greater than our valuation allowance .\n Accounting guidance defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants . At December 31, 2024, the Consolidated balance sheet reflects a deferred tax asset of $1.60 billion . The realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of the existence  of the amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements .\n At December 31, 2024, the valuation allowance of $1.08 billion reflects management's assessment that it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized due to the inability of certain subsidiaries to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax law .\n Impairment is tested at the reporting unit level, which is the same as, or one level below, an operating segment . Based on our impairment testing for 2024, we determined no impairment was required and none of our reporting units were at risk for impairment . For Goodwill balances, refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n P&C net premium written were $51.47 billion, up 8.7 percent, or 9.2 percent in constant dollars . Net income in 2024 was driven by record underwriting results and net investment income . Net earnings in 2024 includes the one-time deferred tax benefit of $1.14 billion, reflecting the enactment of Bermuda’s new income tax law .\n P&C combined ratio was 86.6 percent compared with 86.5 percent in 2023 . Commercial insurance up 6.3 percent and consumer insurance up 12.9 percent . Life insurance deposits collected increased $981 million, up 61.8 percent in constant dollars . Pre-tax net investment income was a record $5.93 billion .\n We anticipate robust growth in operating earnings and earnings per share driven by P&C underwriting, investment income, and life insurance . We acknowledge the challenges posed by natural disasters, we are well-positioned to continue delivering outstanding results in 2025 . Our resilient business model and unwavering support for policyholders will guide us as we move forward .\n The increase in consolidated net premiums written in 2024 reflects growth across most product lines driven by strong premium retention, including rate and exposure increases, and strong new business . Growth also benefited from the consolidation of Huatai on July 1, 2023 . Financial lines declined due to lower renewal retention due to a competitive market environment where pricing does not provide an adequate return .\n P&C net premiums earned increased 8.1 percent, or 8.4 percent in constant dollars in 2024 . Growth also benefited from the consolidation of Huatai Group's life business . Catastrophe losses are net of reinsurance and include reinstatement premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences .\n PPD includes adjustments relating to either profit commission reserves or policyholder dividend reserves based on actual claim experience that develops after the policy period ends . The expense adjustments correlate to the prior period loss development on these same policies . Catastrophe losses were primarily from the following events: Hurricane Helene of $390 million and Hurricane Milton of $309 million .\n Pre-tax net favorable PPD for 2023 was $1,050 million in our active companies, including favorable development of $921 million in short-tail lines, mainly in property, and surety lines . 66 million related to legacy asbestos and environmental exposures, and $58 million  related to molestation claims .\n P&C CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased in 2024, reflecting a higher percentage of net premiums earned from property lines, and the contemplation of a higher underwriting gain in MPCI for the current crop year . These factors were offset by price changes not keeping pace with loss trends in financial lines, a change in mix of business away from products that have a lower policy acquisition cost ratio . Policy benefits represent losses on contracts classified as long-duration and generally include accident and supplemental health products, term and whole life products, endowment products, and annuities .\n We operate through six business segments: North America Commercial P&C Insurance, North America Personal P& C Insurance, . North America Agricultural Insurance, Overseas General Insurance, Global Reinsurance, and Life Insurance . The results of our run-off Brandywine business are presented within Corporate . The consolidated consolidation of Huatai Group is primarily due to the consolidation .\n Premium premiums written increased $1,352 million, or 7.0 percent, in 2024, reflecting strong new business and retention . Catastrophe losses were primarily from the following events: Flooding in the U.S., hail, tornadoes, wind events, winter storm losses, Hurricane Helene, and Hurricane Milton . The increase in premiums reflects growth of 7.4 percent in the North America Major Accounts and Specialty Insurance division .\n The North America Personal P&C Insurance segment comprises operations that provide high net worth personal lines products, including homeowners and complementary products such as valuable articles, excess liability, automobile, and recreational marine insurance and services in the U.S. and Canada . The combined ratio increased in 2024, reflecting higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable prior period development . The CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was relatively flat in 2024 .\n Catastrophe losses were primarily from the following events: Flooding in the U.S., hail, tornadoes, wind events, winter storm losses, and other severe weather-related events in the United States . Net premiums written increased $654 million, or 11.1 percent, in 2024, driven by strong new business and retention, including positive rate and exposure increases in all lines .\n CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased in 2024 . North America Agricultural Insurance segment comprises our North American based businesses that provide a variety of coverages in the U.S. and Canada including crop insurance, primarily Multiple Peril Crop Insurance (MPCI) and crop-hail through Rain and Hail Insurance Service, Inc. (Rain and Hail)\n Catastrophe losses were primarily from the following events: Flooding in the U.S., hail, tornadoes, wind events, and Hurricane Helene . CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses decreased in 2024, reflecting higher favorable prior period development, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses . Premium premiums written decreased $485 million, or 15.2 percent, in 2024 .\n Chubb International comprises our international commercial P&C traditional and specialty lines serving large corporations, middle market and small customers . Chubb Global Markets (CGM) includes Lloyd's of London (Lloyd's) Syndicate 2488 . Effective July 1, 2023, the Overseas General Insurance segment includes 100 percent of the results of Huatai Group's P/C business as required under consolidation accounting .\n Catastrophe losses were primarily from the following events: Rio Grande Storms, Hurricane Helene, Hurricane Milton, and International weather-related events . Losses from these events were mainly from the . Rio Grande . Storms in New Zealand, international weather- related events, and Hurricane Otis losses. Hurricane Ian losses, international . weather-based events, including storms in Australia and Rio Grande storms .\n Net premiums written increased $1,397 million in 2024, or $1.475 million on a constant-dollar basis . Commercial growth was driven by higher new business, higher retention, and positive rate increases, primarily in property and casualty lines . Consumer lines increased primarily due to new business growth in A&H and personal lines .\n The CAY combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses was relatively flat in 2024 . The combined ratio increased in 2024 primarily reflecting lower favorable prior period development and higher catastrophe losses . Global Reinsurance markets its reinsurance products worldwide primarily through reinsurance brokers under the Chubb Tempest Re brand name . The Global Reinsurance segment represents our reinsurance operations .\n Catastrophe losses were primarily from the following events: Hurricane Milton, Hurricane Helene, and other severe weather-related events in the U.S., Europe, and Canada . The combined ratio increased in 2024, primarily reflecting the impact of higher catastrophe losses and lower favorable prior period development . Net premiums written in 2024 also benefited from a large one-off structured transaction in the second quarter .\n The decrease reflects the favorable impact of higher net premiums earned on the administrative expense ratio, partially offset by the impact of the large one-off structured transaction described above . The Life Insurance segment includes 100 percent of the results of Huatai Group's life and asset management business as required under consolidation accounting . Net premiums written increased $861 million in 2024, or $987 million on a constant-dollar basis .\n Life deposits collected increased $981 million in 2024, primarily in Taiwan and from the consolidation of Huatai Life business effective July 1, 2023 . Life deposits are not reflected as revenues in our Consolidated statements of operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, new life deposits are an important component of production . Life Insurance segment income increased $49 million in 2024 .\n Effective July 1, 2023, 100 percent of Huatai Group’s non-insurance operations results, comprising real estate and holding company activity, are included in Corporate . The company's losses and loss expenses increased in 2024 primarily due to adverse development relating to our legacy asbestos and environmental exposures, and non-A&E run-off casualty exposure, including molestation .\n The Chief Executive Officer does not manage segment results or allocate resources to segments when considering these costs and they are therefore excluded from our definition of segment income . The effective tax rate (ETR) was 15.8 percent, 5.4 percent, and 19.1 percent in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively .\n The effect of market movements on fixed maturities related to consolidated investment products and investments supporting certain participating products in the Huatai portfolio impact Net realized gains (losses) Net income is impacted through the reporting of changes in the fair value of public and private equity securities and derivatives . For a further discussion related to how we assess the valuation allowance for expected credit losses and the related impact on Net income, refer to Note 1 f)  to the Consolidated Financial Statements .\n In presenting our results, we included and discussed certain non-GAAP measures, which may be defined differently by other companies, are important for an understanding of our overall results of operations and financial condition . However, they should not be viewed as a substitute for measures determined in accordance with GAAP . 2023 includes a one-time realized gain of $135 million as a result of the consolidation of Huatai Group . 2024 includes a net decrease of the valuation allowance of expected credit losses of $86 million on fixed maturities and impairments of $94 million .\n P&C combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss expense ratio, policy acquisition cost ratio and the administrative expense ratio excluding the life business and including the realized gains and losses on the crop derivatives . We believe these measures are useful and meaningful to investors as they are used by management to assess the company’s P&C operations which are the most economically similar .\n Combined ratio numerator is adjusted to exclude CATs, PPD, and expense adjustments on PPD . Reinstatement premiums are additional premiums paid on certain reinsurance agreements in order to reinstate coverage that had been exhausted by loss occurrences . In periods where there are adjustments on loss sensitive policies, these adjustments are excluded from PPD and net premiums earned .\n The following tables present the calculation of combined ratio as reported for each segment to P&C combined ratio, adjusted for CATs and PPD combined ratio . The tables are presented for the year ended December 31, 2024, 2024 and 2015 . The results are based on the combined ratio used for each policy to determine the number of policies covered by the insurance industry .\n The ratios above are calculated using whole U.S. dollars except for ratios . Letters A, B, C, D, E, and F included in the table are references for calculating the ratios above . North America Commercial P&C Insurance. North America Agricultural Insurance.

Policy acquisition costs and administrative expenses are calculated at a loss-and-loss expense ratio of 9,416 . P.A/E premiums earned excluding adjustments on P.PD are determined at a cost of $17,107 per person .\n Letters A, B, C, D, E and F included in the table are references for calculating the ratios above . Letters used to calculate the ratios may differ from rounded amounts . Excludes investment income from our private equities where we own more than 3 percent interest . Includes $16 million, $21 million, and $41 million of amortization expense related to the fair value adjustment of acquired invested assets .\n Interest expense was $741 million, $672 million, and $570 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 . Interest expense increased in 2024 primarily due to newly issued debt . Amortization of purchased intangibles expense in 2025 is expected to be $298 million, or approximately $75 million each quarter .\n At December 31, 2024, the deferred tax liability associated with the Other intangible assets (excluding the fair value adjustment on Unpaid losses and loss expenses) was $1,478 million . The investment portfolio is invested primarily in publicly traded, investment grade, fixed income securities with an average credit quality of A/A as rated by the independent investment rating services Standard and Poor’s .\n The average duration of our fixed income securities, including the effect of futures, options, and swaps, was 5.1 years and 4.8 years at December 31, 2024 and 2023 . We hold no collateralized debt obligations in our investment portfolio, and we provide no credit default protection . The following table shows the fair value and cost/amortized cost, net of valuation allowance, of our invested assets .\n The fair value of our total investments increased $14.0 billion during the year ended December 31, 2024 . Fair value reflects the investing of operating cash flow, partially offset by unrealized losses on fixed maturities mainly due to interest rate increases . The following table presents our 10 largest global exposures to corporate bonds by fair value .\n The following table shows the fair value and amortized cost, net of valuation allowance, of our mortgage-backed securities . The average credit quality of our non-U.S. fixed income securities is A/A and 39 percent of our holdings are r/A . The portfolio is highly diversified primarily in state general obligation bonds and essential service revenue bonds .\n Government and corporate bond holdings are highly diversified across industries and geographies . Issuer limits are based on credit rating (AA—two percent, A—one percent, BBB—0.5 percent of the total portfolio) and are monitored daily via an internal compliance system . We manage our indirect exposure using the same credit rating-based investment approach .\n At December 31, 2024, our corporate fixed income investment portfolio included below-investment grade and non-rated securities which, in total, comprised approximately 14 percent of our fixed income portfolio . The countries that are listed in the non-U.S. corporate portfolio above represent the ultimate parent company's country of risk . The portfolio includes over 1,600 issuers, with the greatest single exposure being $178 million .\n Chubb faces claims relating to policies issued to manufacturers, distributors, installers, and other parties in the chain of commerce for asbestos and products containing asbestos . Derivative and structured securities (e.g., credit default swaps and collateralized debt obligations) are not permitted in the high-yield portfolio .\n The survival ratios provide only a very rough depiction of reserves and are significantly impacted by a number of factors such as aggressive settlement practices, variations in gross to ceded relationships within the asbestos or environmental claims, and levels of coverage provided . Chubb uses internal and external data together with sophisticated, analytical catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques to ensure an appropriate understanding of risk across different product lines and territories .\n Chubb’s PML for worldwide and key U.S. peril regions are based on our in-force portfolio at October 1, 2024, and reflect the reinsurance program as well as inuring reinsurance protection coverage . Chubb increased retention in North America by $500 million and increased limits by $1.7 billion . For the model, for the 1-in-100 return period scenario, there is a one percent chance that our pre-tax annual aggregate aggregate losses incurred in any year could be in excess of $3,831 million (or 6.0 percent)\n Models are reliant upon significant meteorology, seismology, and engineering assumptions to estimate catastrophe losses . Models are not always a representation of actual events and ensuing additional loss potential; There is no universal standard in the preparation of insured data for use in the models, the running of the modeling software, and interpretation of loss output . Chubb climate scientists reveal potential for increases in the frequency and severity of key natural perils .\n We have substantial exposure to losses resulting from man-made catastrophes including terrorism, cyber-attack, financial events, and other catastrophe events, including pandemics . We actively monitor terrorism risk and manage exposures through set risk limits based on modeled losses from certain terrorism attack scenarios, the purchase of reinsurance, and the reliance on government-sponsored terrorism reinsurance programs . In 2024, TRIPRA covers 81 percent of insured losses above a deductible .\n Cyber risk does not represent a material component of our net premiums written . We engage in significant risk mitigation through our underwriting and use of reinsurance . We are exposed to material losses in the event of a systemic cyber-attack . The volatility of our losses may force us to liquidate securities, which may cause us to incur capital losses .\n The majority of our exposure in these products may be impacted by an adverse economic climate such as an economic recession or depression . An outbreak of pandemic disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations . We monitor credit exposures to single counterparties and to sectors of interest from sources across our operations .\n Chubb renewed its Global Property Catastrophe Reinsurance Program for our North American and International operations effective April 1, 2024, through March 31, 2025 . The program consists of three layers in excess of losses retained by Chubb on a per occurrence basis . Chubb renewed its terrorism coverage (excluding nuclear, biological, chemical and radiation coverage, with an inclusion of coverage for biological and chemical coverage for personal lines) for the United States .\n Chubb is one of the world's leading underwriters of political risk and credit insurance . Chubb has a global portfolio spread across more than 150 countries and is also a member of The Berne Union . Political risk insurance is a specialized coverage that provides clients with protection against unexpected, catastrophic political or macroeconomic events, primarily in emerging markets .\n CGM writes political risk and credit insurance business out of underwriting offices in London, Germany, Brazil, Singapore; Singapore; Tokyo, Japan; and in the U.S. in the following locations: Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Our political risk insurance products provide protection to commercial lenders against defaults on cross border loans, cover investors against equity losses .\n Political risk and credit insurance policies do not cover currency devaluations, bond defaults, movements in overseas equity markets, transactions deemed illegal . CGM has limited capacity for Specialist Credit insurance products which provide coverage for project finance and working capital loans for large corporations and banks . It also provides coverage to trade finance banks, exporters, and trading companies, with exposure to trade-related financing instruments .\n We provide protection throughout the U.S. on a variety of crops and are therefore geographically diversified . Given its concentration of risk exposed to temperature, moisture, drought, hail, and more frequent and severe storms associated with climate change, crop insurance is a business with catastrophe-like features . We have a dedicated Country and Credit Risk management team responsible for the portfolio .\n Chubb recognizes net premiums written as soon as estimable on our MPCI business, which is generally when we receive acreage reports from policyholders on the various crops throughout the U.S. This allows us to best determine the premium associated with the liability that is being planted . There were no significant changes in the terms and conditions from the 2024 SRA and, therefore, the new SRA does not impact Chubb's outlook .\n The pricing of MPCI premium is determined using a number of factors including commodity prices and related volatility . A majority of the crops that are covered in the program are typically subject to the SRA in effect at the beginning of the year . A substantial written and earned premium impact is seen in the second and third quarters .\n Chubb does not have enough information to quantify the preliminary estimated impact to our underwriting results until the fourth quarter . The policy primarily protects farmers against yield reduction caused by hail and/or fire, and related costs such as transit to storage . Chubb Limited's cash flows depend primarily on dividends and other statutorily permissible payments .\n Dividends and other statutorily permitted payments have come primarily from Chubb's Bermuda-based operating subsidiaries . Funds are used at our various companies primarily to pay claims, operating expenses, and dividends; to service debt; to purchase investments; and to fund acquisitions . We anticipate that positive cash flows from operations (underwriting activities and investment income) should be sufficient to cover cash outflows under most loss scenarios .\n If paid losses accelerate beyond our ability to fund such paid losses from current operating cash flows, we might need to liquidate a portion of our investment portfolio or arrange for financing . Potential events causing such a liquidity strain could include several significant catastrophes occurring in a relatively short period of time, large uncollectible reinsurance recoverables on paid losses .\n The payment of dividends or other statutorily permissible distributions from our operating companies are subject to the laws and regulations applicable to each jurisdiction . Chubb Limited received dividends of $1.7 billion and $3.3 billion from its Bermuda subsidiaries in 2024 and 2023 . The U.S. insurance subsidiaries of Chubb INA may pay dividends, without prior regulatory approval, subject to restrictions set out in state law .\n Chubb INA received cash dividends of $3.5 billion and $2.4 billion in 2024 and 2023 . At December 31, 2024, the amount of dividends available to be paid to Chubb in 2025 from its subsidiaries without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities . Chubb's international subsidiaries are also subject to insurance laws and regulations particular to the countries in which the subsidiaries operate .\n Operating cash flows were $16.2 billion in 2024, compared to $12.6 billion in 2023 . Increase was partially offset by higher net losses paid, income taxes paid, and lower net proceeds from sales of consolidated investment products (CIP) from Huatai's asset management companies . Increase of $6.3 billion is primarily due to higher net purchases of fixed maturities, short-term investments, and equity securities . Increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $504 million, reflecting the acquisition of Healthy Paws .\n At December 31, 2024, there were $2.7 billion, including variable interest entities balances of $815 million, in repurchase agreements outstanding with various maturities over the next five months . Chubb has agreements with a third-party bank provider which implemented two international multi-currency cash pooling programs . The programs allow us to optimize investment income by avoiding portfolio disruption .\n In March 2024, Chubb INA issued $1.0 billion of 5.00 percent senior notes due March 2034 . In November 2024, Huatai Life issued 800 million Chinese yuan renminbi ($111 million based on the foreign exchange rate at the date of issuance) of 2.90 percent notes due November 2034. These notes are classified as regulatory capital . The ratios of financial debt to total capitalization in the table above are lower .\n Chubb INA's €700 million of 0.3 percent Euro denominated senior notes due December 2024 was paid upon maturity . We believe our financial strength provides us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain available funds externally through debt or equity financing on both a short-term and long-term basis . Our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on, among other things, market conditions and our perceived financial strength .\n The Board authorized the repurchase of up to $5.0 billion of Chubb's Common Shares effective through June 30, 2023, with no expiration date . Share repurchases may be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, block trades, accelerated repurchased and/or through option or other forward transactions .\n At our May 2023 annual general meeting, our shareholders approved an annual dividend for the following year of up to $3.44 per share . The first three quarterly installments each of $0.91 per share, have been distributed by the Board as expected . At December 31, 2024, our long-term cash requirements under our various contractual obligations and commitment .\n Total cash requirements are not determinable from underlying contracts and must be estimated . Gross loss payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are estimated at $84.1 billion with $23.8 billion estimated due over the next twelve months . Amount and timing of actual loss payments are likely to differ from these estimates and the differences could be material .\n At December 31, 2024, there were $2.7 billion in repurchase agreements outstanding with various maturities over the next five months . Deposit liabilities, including contract holder deposit funds, are $14.5 billion with $0.8 billion due over next twelve months . Repurchase agreements are used as a low-cost funding alternative .\n Chubb Limited and its subsidiaries are assigned credit and financial strength (insurance) ratings from internationally recognized rating agencies, including S&P, AM Best, Moody's, and Fitch . Independent ratings are one of the important factors that establish our competitive position in the insurance markets .

Our group syndicated credit facility has capacity of $3.0 billion and expires in October 2027 .\n In the event we are required to provide alternative security to clients, the security could take the form of additional insurance trusts supported by our investment portfolio or funds withheld using our cash resources . To date, we have not experienced difficulty accessing our credit facilities or establishing additional facilities when needed . Failure to comply with the covenants under any credit facility would, subject to grace periods in the case of certain covenants, result in a default .\n Failure to repay material financial obligations would result in an event of default under the facility . Changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates will have an immediate effect on Shareholders' equity and Comprehensive income and, in certain instances, Net income . The effect of market movements on fixed maturities related to consolidated investment products in the Huatai portfolio impacts Net income (through Net realized gains (losses)\n At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our notional exposure to derivative instruments was $10.2 billion . These instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities in our Consolidated Financial Statements . Changes in the fair value of TBAs are included in Net realized gains (losses) and, therefore, have an immediate effect on both our Net income and Shareholders' equity . We do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures .\n The following table presents the impact at December 31, 2024 and 2023, on the fair value of our fixed income portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 bps applied instantly across the U.S. yield curve (an immediate time horizon was used as this presents the worst case scenario): The actual results could differ from those reflected in the tables .\n Changes in interest rates could have a material impact on fair value of our debt obligations . Chubb entities transact business in multiple currencies . The company's policy is to generally match assets, liabilities and required capital for each individual jurisdiction in local currency . The following table summarizes the unhedged portion of net assets (liabilities) in non-U.S. currencies at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and excludes noncontrolling interests .\n Chubb holds certain cross-currency swaps designated as fair value hedges and net investment hedges for foreign currency exposure associated with portions of our euro denominated debt and the net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries . The unhedged net assets denominated in foreign currencies comprised goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately 47 percent and 52 percent at December 31, 2024 and 2023 .\n The objective of the net investment cross-currency swaps is to hedge the foreign currency exposure in the net investments of certain foreign subsidiaries . Chubb views its MRB reinsurance business as having a similar risk profile to that of catastrophe reinsurance . Adverse changes in market factors and policyholder behavior will have an impact on both MRB gains (losses) and net income .\n The tables below are estimates of the sensitivities to instantaneous changes in economic inputs (e.g., equity shock, interest rate shock, etc.) at December 31, 2024 . The current hedge portfolio is sensitive only to U.S. equity markets . Equity shocks impact all global equity markets equally . Interest rate shocks assume a parallel shift in the U .S. yield curve . AA-rated credit spreads are a proxy for both our own credit spreads and the credit spreads of the ceding insurers .\n Actual sensitivity of our net income may differ from those disclosed in the tables below due to fluctuations in short-term market movements . The tables below present the net amount at risk at December 31, 2024, following an immediate change in equity market levels, assuming all global equity markets are impacted equally . Reinsurance covering the GMDB risk  includes annual or aggregate claim limits and many include an aggregate deductible .\n The shocks in the table above become incrementally more negative, the impacts begin to drop due to the specific nature of these claim limits . The treaty limits function as a ceiling as equity markets fall . There is also an impact due to a portion of the reinsurance under which claims are positively correlated to equity markets .\n There have been no changes in Chubb's internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended December 31, 2024 .

Table of Contents includes: Management's RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND WITHINTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCE REPORTING.\n The Board of Directors (Board), operating through its Audit Committee, provides oversight of the financial reporting process and safeguarding of assets against unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition . The Audit Committee annually recommends the appointment of an independent registered public accounting firm and submits its recommendation to the Board for approval . The consolidated financial statements have been audited by an audit firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which has access to all financial records and related data .\n Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America .

Internal control may not prevent or detect misstatements, and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequatized .\n The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole . The majority of the Company’s net unpaid losses and loss expenses arise from long-tail casualty business (such as general liability and professional liability), U.S. sourced workers’ compensation, asbestos-related, environmental pollution and other exposures with high estimation uncertainty .\n The reserves for the various product lines each require different qualitative and quantitative assumptions and judgments, including changes in business mix or volume, changes in ceded reinsurance structures and changes in claims handling practices . The reserve liability led to a high degree of auditor subjectivity and judgment in performing procedures relating to the valuation of unpaid losses and loss expenses .\n PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has served as the Company’s auditor since 1985 . Performing these procedures involved testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management . The procedures also included the involvement of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in performing one or a combination of procedures, including (i) independently estimating reserves on a sample basis using actual historical data and loss development patterns .\n Private equities (includes VIE balances of $22.769.  and $1,078) and $2,549.2,621  Securities lending collateral (including restricted cash) Private equity investments include $4,538.538 and $3,773.773 private equity investments .

Chubb generally develops expected discounted cash flow analyses at contract inception . Deposit accounting is used for contracts that do not meet risk transfer requirements .

Default factors require considerable judgment and are determined using the current financial strength rating, or rating equivalent, of each reinsurer as well as other key considerations and assumptions . The determination of the default factor is principally .\n Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries. t considers an assessment of the creditworthiness of the particular entity, industry benchmarks, or other factors as considered appropriate. We then apply the applicable default factor for that rating class. For balances recoverable from unrated reinsurers for which the ceded reserve is below a certain threshold, we generally apply a default factor of ipient11.2 percent .\n Prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers applicable to the unexpired coverage terms of the reinsurance contracts in-force . For information on high deductible policies, refer to section k) Unpaid losses and loss expenses, below . The methods used to determine the valuation allowance for uncollectible high deductible recoverable amounts and valuation allowance are similar to the processes used to . determine . the valuation . allowance for insurance and reinsurance balances receivable .\n AFS securities are evaluated for potential credit loss on an individual security level, but evaluation may use assumptions consistent with expectations of credit losses for a group of similar securities . Prepayment fees or call premiums that are only payable when a security is called prior to its maturity are earned when received and reflected in Net investment income . The entire impairment loss will be recorded through income to Net realized gains and losses .\n Chubb developed the projected cash flows using market data, issuer-specific information, and credit ratings . In general, a security is considered uncollectible no later than when all efforts to collect contractual cash flows have been exhausted . When all or a portion of a fixed maturity security is identified to be uncollectable and written off, the valuation allowance for expected credit losses is reduced .\n Chubb pooled HTM securities and calculated the current expected credit loss for each pool using Moody's corporate bond default average, corporate bond recovery rate, and economic cycle multiplier . Private debt held-for-investment relates principally to investments in the funding of public and private projects that are mostly infrastructure related and were acquired as part of Huatai’s investment portfolio upon consolidation .\n Investments over which Chubb cannot exercise significant influence, generally, when we own less than three percent of the investee's shares . Investment income, realized gains or losses are included in the portion of equity earnings reflected in Other (income) expense . Chubb retains the investment company accounting in applying the equity method .\n Chubb has elected to account for these investments using the fair value option so that changes in fair value of the fixed maturities are recorded in Net realized gains (losses) as opposed to a component within AOCI, to offset corresponding changes in policyholder liabilities within Policy benefits . Insurance policies are carried at policy cash surrender value and income is reflected in Other (income) expense . Investments in partially-owned insurance companies are reported at fair value .\n Chubb participates in a securities lending program operated by a third-party banking institution . Borrowers provide collateral, in the form of either cash or approved securities, at a minimum of 102 percent of the fair value of the loaned securities . An indemnification agreement protects us in the event a borrower becomes insolvent or fails to return any of the securities on loan .\n The fair value of the underlying securities is included in fixed maturities .

The following table presents, by investment category, the expected liquidation period, and maximum future funding commitments for private equities .\n Investment funds are investments for which Chubb will never have the contractual option to redeem but receives distributions based on the liquidation of the underlying assets . Chubb does not have the ability to sell or transfer the investments without the consent from the general partner of individual funds . The underlying investments across various partnerships, geographies, industries, and investment strategies provide risk diversification within the limited partnership portfolio .\n Included in this category are investments for which Chubb has the option to redeem at agreed upon value as described in each investment fund’s subscription agreement . If Chubb wishes to redeem an investment fund investment, it must first determine if the investment fund is still in a lock-up period (a time when Chubb cannot redeem its investment) Chubb must then notify investment fund manager of its intention to redeem by the notification date prescribed by the subscription agreement, and notice periods for redemption are up to 270 days .\n Chubb is required to maintain assets on deposit with various regulatory authorities to support its insurance and reinsurance operations . These requirements are generally promulgated in the statutory regulations of the individual jurisdictions .

The assets of these VIEs are not available to our creditors, and the investors in these . VIE’s have no recourse to Chubb in excess of the assets contained within the . assets .\n The fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities is estimated based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance . The guidance defines fair value as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants . Fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data .\n We use pricing services to obtain fair value measurements for the majority of our investment securities . All applicable investments have been valued in accordance with U.S. GAAP . The pricing services evaluate each asset class based on relevant market and credit information, perceived market movements, and sector news . We do not adjust prices obtained from pricing services .\n The extent of the use of each input is dependent on the asset class and the market conditions . Fixed maturities valuation is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market-based inputs (i.e., stale pricing) and may require the use  of  F-30F-30 metrics .\n Certain of our long-duration contracts are supported by assets that do not qualify for separate account treatment under U.S. GAAP . Short-term investments for which pricing is unobservable are classified within Level 3 . Other investments principally include fixed maturities carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through Net realized gains (losses) on the Consolidated statements of operations .\n Certain of our derivatives are cross-currency swaps designated as fair value and net investment hedging instruments . We maintain positions in exchange-traded equity futures contracts designed to limit exposure to a severe equity market decline, which would cause an increase in expected market risk benefits (MRB) claims . Other derivative instruments are recorded in either Other assets or Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities .\n Chubb also maintains positions in convertible securities that contain embedded derivatives . Separate account assets represent segregated funds where investment risks are borne by the customers, except to the extent of certain guarantees made by Chubb . Convertible securities are recorded in either Fixed maturities available-F-31-31 or Equity securities available-for-sale .\n Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries. nts.

Short-term debt, long-term . debt, repurchase agreements, and hybrid debt are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy . The value of repurchase . agreements, debt held-for-investment. greements, and hybrids debt are estimated using discounted cash flow calculations .\n The amounts for net premiums written and net premiums earned in the Consolidated statements of operations are net of reinsurance . Reinsurance agreements contractually obligate Chubb's reinsurers to reimburse it for the agreed-upon portion of its gross paid losses, but they do not discharge its primary liability .

The following tables present a listing, at December 31, 2024, of the categories of Chubb's reinsurers:. At the end of the 2024, the gross recoverable exceeds one percent of Total Chubb shareholders' equity.\n The following tables present a roll-forward of deferred policy acquisition costs on long-duration contracts included in the Life Insurance Group . The valuation allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is principally based on an analysis of the credit quality of the reinsurer and collateral balances . It generally is our policy to obtain collateral equal to expected losses .\n The following table presents a roll-forward of Goodwill by segment: North America Commercial P&C Insurance, North America Persurance, and Overseas General Insurance segments . The U.S. urance segment: The North America Urance segment is the largest in the world and has the largest number of U.K. urances in the industry .\n The following table presents, as of December 31, 2024, the expected estimated estimated pre-tax amortization expense related to VOBA at current foreign currency exchange rates, for the next five years .

The increase in gross and net unpaid losses and loss expense in 2023 reflects underlying exposure growth and the consolidation of Huatai .\n Businesses excluded from loss development tables include corporate segment business, agricultural insurance segment business and agricultural segment business . Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries are excluded from the loss development table presentation . The company's loss portfolio transfers are recorded to the policy period of the transaction, even though the accidenary period of transactions is not the time of the transactions .\n Changes in incurred loss and cash flow patterns are volatile and sufficiently different from those of typical insureds . This category includes the Alternative Risk Solutions business within the North America Commercial P&C Insurance segment . We also underwrite certain high attachment, high limit, multiple-line and excess of aggregate coverages for large commercial clients . t dates of the claims covered may be a decade or more in the past .\n Exposure and experience-based actuarial methods are most commonly used on relatively immature origin years (i.e., the year in which the losses were incurred — “accident year” or “report year’s . Exposure-based methods are more commonly used . Chubb's Chief Actuary and senior management review reserves .\n The data presented in this disclosure was prepared on a more aggregated basis and with a focus on changes in incurred loss estimates over time as well as associated cash flows . We perform an actuarial reserve review for each product line at least once a year . For most product lines, one or more standard actuarial reserving methods may be used to determine estimates of ultimate losses and loss expenses .\n A single actuarial central estimate is an input to the reserve committee process described above . For the few product lines that do not lend themselves to standard actuarial reserving methods, appropriate techniques are applied . For example, run-off asbestos and environmental liability estimates are better suited to the application of account-specific exposure-based analyses .\n The expected loss ratio method arrives at an ultimate loss estimate by multiplying the expected ultimate loss ratio by the corresponding premium base . This method is most commonly used as the basis for an actuarial central estimate for immature origin periods on product lines where the actual paid or reported loss experience is not yet deemed sufficiently credible to serve as the principal basis for the selection of ultimate losses .\n The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method is a combination of the expected loss ratio method and the loss development method . We typically assign credibility to methods that incorporate actual loss emergence . We usually apply this method using reported loss data although paid data may also be used . This approach allows a logical transition between the expected and loss development methods which are typically utilized at later maturities .\n The reserving process for short-tail losses arising from catastrophic events typically involves an assessment by the claims department, in conjunction with underwriters and actuaries, of our exposure and estimated losses immediately following an event . This includes most casualty lines such as general liability, D&O, and workers' compensation . Long-tail business describes lines of business for which specific losses may not be known/reported for some period .\n The difficulty in estimating loss trends, claims inflation (e.g., medical and judicial) and underlying economic conditions . The need for professional judgment to estimate loss development patterns beyond that represented by historical data using supplemental internal or industry data, extrapolation, or a blend of both . The applicability of the price change data used to estimate ultimate loss ratios for most recent origin years .\n The tables were designed to present business with similar risk characteristics which exhibit like development patterns and generally similar trends, in order to provide insight into the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows related to our claims liabilities . The incurred loss triangle includes both reported case reserves and IBNR liabilities . All data presented in the triangles is net of reinsurance recoverables . The tables are presented retrospectively with respect to acquisitions where these are material and doing so is practicable .\n Historical dollar amounts are presented on a constant-dollar basis, which is achieved by assuming constant foreign exchange rates for all periods in the loss triangles . The impact of this conversion is to show the change between periods exclusive of the effect of fluctuations in exchange rates, which would otherwise distort the change in incurred loss and cash flow patterns shown .\n Claims are counted on a direct basis without consideration of ceded reinsurance . Use of the presented claim counts in analysis of company experience has significant limitations, including: Claims for certain events and/or product lines, such as portions of our A&H business, are not reported on an individual basis, but rather in bulk .\n The triangle below shows all loss and allocated expense development for the workers' compensation product line . The triangle includes the exposure base due to payroll audits and involuntary pool assumptions (premiums and losses) on a lagged basis . In our prior period development disclosure, we exclude any loss development where there is a directly related premium adjustment .\n Chubb Limited and Subsidiaries al. al. re-expect future liabilities for loss and Allocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (in millions of U.S. dollars) Al.C.A. l.P&C Insurance — Workers' Compensation — Long-tail (continued) North America Commercial P&C.

These hedges are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in Other comprehensive income (OCI) The gains or losses on the fair value hedges offsetting the foreign currency remeasurement on the hedged euro denominated senior notes are reclassified from OCI into Net realized gains (losses) and an additional portion is reclassified into Interest expense .\n The mark-to-market adjustments for foreign currency changes will remain in CTA until the underlying hedge subsidiary is deconsolidated or hedge accounting is discontinued . Changes in fair value recorded in Cumulative translation adjustments (CTA) within OCI and a portion reclassified to Interest expense . The following table presents net gains (losses) related to derivative instrument activity in the Consolidated statements of operations .\n A foreign currency forward contract (forward) is an agreement between participants to exchange specific currencies at a future date . MRB uses forwards to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies as discussed above .
