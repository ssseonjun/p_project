  "item1_summary": " The following table summarizes the investment record by strategy of Apollo’s significant commitment-based funds that have a defined maturity date in which investors make a commitment to provide capital at the formation of such funds and deliver capital when called as investment opportunities become available . All amounts are as of December 31, 2024, unless otherwise noted .\n The following table summarizes the investment record for distressed investments made in our traditional private equity fund portfolios since the Company’s inception . Accord funds have investment periods shorter than 24 months, therefore Gross and Net IRR are presented after 12 months of investing . The general partners and managers of Funds I, II and MIA, as well as the general partner of Fund III, were excluded assets in connection with the reorganization of the Company that occurred in 2007 .\n The distressed investment strategy includes distressed for control, non-control distressed and other credit . Other credit is defined as investments in debt securities of issuers other than portfolio companies that are not considered to be distressed . Amounts for Fund I, II, III, IV, V, VI and VII are included in the table above but not presented below as their remaining value is less than $100 million, the fund has been liquidated or the fund commenced investing capital less than 24 months prior to December 31, 2024 .\n An initial public offering (“IPO”) year represents the year in which the vehicle commenced trading on a national securities exchange . The returns presented are a gross return based on NAV. The returns are for their respective Class I shares and are net returns . The net returns were 15% and 26% for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively .\n The table below sets forth a reconciliation of net income attributable to Apollo Global Management, Inc. common stockholders to Segment Income and Adjusted Net Income . Other also includes AUM of $7.6 billion related to third-party capital within AAA.  fees, but for which Apollo does not provide management or advisory services, as of September 30, 2024 .\n The Apollo Apollo Group reported $5,558.5 billion in adjusted net income . The company reported $3,246 million in adjusted adjusted net earnings . The Company reported $4,565 billion in non-operating expenses . The group reported $1.6 billion in pre-taxed net earnings, adjusted net profit and adjusted net profits .\n Athene’s total investments, including related parties, to net invested assets: $291,167 $238,941 Derivative assets; $1,933 $2,816 Accrued investment income; $1,738,932 Gross invested assets $248,643 $217,427 $964 .\n At December 31, 2024, the Company had $15.4 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, as well as $5.1 billion of available funds from the AGM credit facility, AHL credit facility and AHL liquidity facility . The Company’s primary liquidity needs include the cash-flow requirements relating to its corporate activities, including its day-to-day operations, dividend payments and strategic transactions .\n In the long term, Apollo will be able to grow Apollo’s Assets Under Management and generate positive investment performance in the funds we manage, which we expect will allow us to grow management fees and performance fees and (ii) grow the investment portfolio of retirement services, in each case in amounts sufficient to cover our long-term liquidity requirements . The section below discusses in more detail the primary sources and uses of cash and the primary drivers of cash flows .\n The assets of our consolidated funds and VIEs, on a gross basis, could have a substantial effect on the accompanying statement of cash flows . The Company’s operating activities support its Asset Management, Retirement Services and Principal Investing activities . The primary sources of cash within operating activities include (a) management fees, (b) advisory and transaction fees, and (c) realized performance revenues, (d) realized principal investment income, (e) investment sales .\n The primary uses of cash within operating activities include: (a) compensation and non-compensation related expenses, (b) interest and taxes, (c) investment purchases from our consolidated funds and VIEs, (d) benefit payments and (e) other operating expenses . During the year ended December 31, 2024, cash provided by operating activities reflects cash inflows of management fees, advisory and transaction fees, realized performance revenues, realized principal investment income, and net investment income .\n The Company’s investing activities support the growth of its business . The primary sources of cash within investing activities include: (a) distributions from investments and (b) sales, maturities and repayments of investments . The Company's financing activities reflect its capital market transactio. tment income, as well as cash received from pension group annuity transactions .\n The primary sources of cash within financing activities includes: (a) proceeds from debt and preferred equity issuances, (b) inflows on Athene’s investment-type policies and contracts, (c) changes of cash collateral for derivative transactions posted by counterparties, (d) capital contributions, and (e) Proceeds from other borrowing activities .\n During the year ended December 31, 2023, cash provided by financing activities primarily reflects cash received from the strong organic inflows from retail, flow reinsurance and funding agreements . The Company’s commitments are primarily fulfilled by the Company's commitments, contingencies and contractual obligations, see note 19 to the consolidated financial statements and “—Contractual Obligations, Commitments and Contingencies”\n The primary sources and uses of cash at Apollo’s consolidated funds and VIEs include: (a) raising capital from their investors, (b) using capital to make investments, (c) generating cash flows from operations, (d) distributing cash flow to investors, and (e) issuing debt to finance investments (CLOs)\n The ability of these operating subsidiaries to make distributions to AGM will depend on satisfying applicable law with respect to such distributions, including surplus and minimum solvency requirements among others, as well as making prior distributions on AHL outstanding preferred stock . The size and timing of any such repurchases will be determined at AGM’s discretion .\n At December 31, 2024, the asset management business had $2.7 billion of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, as well as $1.25 billion of available funds from AGM credit facility . There were 28,750,000 shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of Dec. 11, 2023 . The Company may seek to raise proceeds through the issuance of additional debt or equity instruments .\n Our liquidity will depend on a number of factors, such as our ability to project our financial performance, project our projected costs, fund performance, access to credit facilities, compliance with existing credit agreements, as well as industry and market trends . An increase in the fair value of the investments of the funds we manage, by contrast, could favorably impact our liquidity .\n The AGM credit facility has a final maturity date of November 21, 2029 . The tax receivable agreement provides for the payment to the Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners of 85% of the amount of cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes that AGM and its subsidiaries realize subject to the agreement .\n As of December 31, 2024, the remaining investments and escrow cash of Fund VIII was valued at 86% of the fund’s unreturned capital . As a result, the fund is required to place in escrow current and future performance fee distributions to the general partner until the specified return ratio of 115% is met .\n Athene manages its liquidity position by matching projected cash demands with adequate sources of cash and other liquid assets . Athene’s investment portfolio is structured to ensure a strong liquidity position over time to permit timely payment of policy and contract benefits without requiring asset sales at inopportune times or at depressed prices .\n Athene has access to additional liquidity through its AHL credit facility and AHL liquidity facility . Athene is also the counterparty to repurchase agreements with several different financial institutions, pursuant to which it may obtain short-term liquidity, to the extent available. Athene proactively manages its liquidity posi. n assets that are generally considered less liquid for liquidity monitoring purposes .\n Athene analyzes its cash-flow liquidity over the upcoming 12 months by modeling potential demands on liquidity under a variety of scenarios . Athene’s policyholder obligations are generally long-term in nature . Uses of cash include investment purchases, payments to policyholders for surrenders, withdrawals and payout benefits, interest and principal payments on funding agreements and outstanding debt .\n Athene is eligible to borrow under variable rate short-term federal funds arrangements to provide additional liquidity . Athene has issued funding agreements to the FHLB in the aggregate principal amount of $15.6 billion and $6.5 billion . As of December 31, 2024, approximately 33% of Athene’s net reserve liabilities were generally non-surrenderable, while 54% were subject to penalty upon surrender .\n As of December 31, 2024, Athene’s total maximum borrowing capacity under the FHLB facilities was limited to $49.5 billion . Athene's ability to borrow under the facilities is constrained by the availability of assets that qualify as eligible collateral under the . facilities and certain other limitations . Considering these limitations, as of December 31, 2024,. Athene had the . ability to draw up to an estimated $18.9 billion, inclusive of borrowings then outstanding .\n Athene is a holding company whose primary liquidity needs include the cash-flow requirements relating to its corporate activities, including its day-to-day operations, debt servicing, preferred and common stock dividend payments and strategic transactions . The ability of AHL’s insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends is limited by applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions where the subsidiaries are domiciled .\n Athene's Bermuda insurance subsidiaries are prohibited from paying a dividend in an amount exceeding 25% of the prior year’s statutory capital and surplus . Athene does not currently plan on having the U.S. subsidiaries pay any dividends to their parents . The maximum distribution permitted by law is not necessarily indicative of the insurance subsidiaries’ actual ability to pay such distributions .\n The level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength ratings from rating agencies is of particular concern when determining the amount of capital available for distributions . Athene may seek to secure additional funding at the AHL level by means other than dividends from subsidiaries . The AHL credit facility contains various standard covenants with which Athene must comply, including maintaining a consolidated debt-to-capitalization ratio of not greater than 35% .\n Athene had long-term debt of $6.3 billion as of December 31, 2024, which includes notes with maturities in 2028, 2030, 2031, 2034, 2051, 2052, 2054 and 2064 . Athene measures capital sufficiency using various internal capital metrics which reflect management’s view on the various risks inherent to its business .\n Athene is currently assessing deferred taxes that may be recorded on a statutory basis as a result of the enactment of the Bermuda CIT, which could have a positive impact on the statutory capital and surplus of its Bermuda insurance companies . Panies presented herein excludes the impact of any deferred taxes . Athene's financial statements are based upon the consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP .\n A summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements . Actual results could differ from these estimates . The assessment of whether an entity is a variable interest entity and the determination of whether Apollo should consolidate requires judgment . Judgments are also made in determining whether a    equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses .\n Certain RSUs granted by the Company vest subject to continued employment and the Company’s receipt of performance fees, within prescribed periods, sufficient to cover the associated equity-based compensation expense . Evaluation an entity to determine whether it meets the characteristics of an investment company under U.S. GAAP is qualitative in nature and may involve significant judgment .\n The fair value of all RSU grants is based on the grant date fair value, which considers the public share price of AGM . Plan Grants may or may not provide the right to receive dividend equivalents until the RSUs vest and the underlying shares are generally issued by March 15th after the year in which they vest . Bonus Grants and Performance Grants provide the . right to . receive dividend . equivalents on both vested and unvested RSUs .\n The Finnerty Model provides for a valuation discount reflecting the holding period restriction embedded in a restricted security preventing its sale over a certain period of time . Assumes a discount rate that was equivalent to the opportunity cost of foregoing distributions on unvested Plan Grant and Performance Grant RSUs as of the valuation date .\n The weighted average for the inputs utilized for the shares granted are presented in the table below for Plan Grants, Bonus Grants and Performance Grants . Calculated based on the historical dividends paid during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 and the Company’s common stock price as of the measurement date of the grant on a weighted average basis .\n The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period during which the change is enacted . The fair values of the investments in the funds we manage can be impacted by changes to the assumptions used in the underlying valuation models . The Company performs various back-testing procedures to validate their valuation approaches, including comparisons between expected and observed outcomes, forecast evaluations and variance analyses .\n There have been no material changes to the valuation approaches utilized during the periods that our financial results are presented in this report . The actual realized gains or losses will depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale .\n Incentive fees are performance fees structured as a contractual fee arrangement rather than a capital allocation . The determination of performance allocations and contingent repayment considers both the terms of the respective partnership agreements and the current fair value of the underlying investments within the funds . For a majority of our incentive fees, once the incentive fees have been determined, there is no look-back to prior periods for a potential contingent repayment .\n Management fees related to credit funds we manage can be based on net asset value, gross assets, adjusted cost of all unrealized portfolio investments, capital commitments, adjusted assets, capital contributions, or stockholders’ equity, all as defined in the respective partnership agreements . There is significant judgment involved in determining if the incentive fees are probable to not be significantly reversed .\n Employees are generally allocated approximately 30% to 61% of the total performance fees which is driven primarily by changes in fair value of the underlying fund’s investments . Profit sharing expenses paid may be subject to clawback from employees and former employees to the extent not indemnified . The actual general partner receivable, however, would not become realized until the end of a fund's life . The accrual for potential clawback of previously distributed profit sharing amounts is a component of due from related parties .\n There is no assurance that the Company will continue to compensate individuals through the same types of arrangements in the future . Amounts earned by participants as a result of their performance fee rights (whether dedicated or incentive pool) will vary year-to-year depending on the overall realized performance of the Company . The Company is responsible for the fair value measurement of investments presented in the consolidated financial statements .\n The Company typically recognizes its investment, including those for which it has elected the fair value option, based on net asset value information provided by the general partner or related asset manager . The Company uses both internally-developed and commercially-available cash flow models to analyze the reasonableness of fair values using credit spreads and other market assumptions, where appropriate .\n The valuation of securities involves judgment, is subject to considerable variability and is revised as additional information becomes available . The estimate of fair value is the price that would be received to sell a security in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal market or the most advantageous market in the absence of a principal market, for that security .\n For fixed maturity securities, the Company obtains the fair values, when available, based on quoted prices in active markets that are regularly and readily obtainable . Fair value is based on market standard valuation techniques, giving priority to observable inputs . For certain fixed maturity . securities without an active market, an internally-developed discounted cash flow or other approach is utilized to calculate the fair value .\n Athene issues and reinsures products, primarily indexed annuity products, or purchases investments that contain embedded derivatives . For mortgage loans, the Company uses independent commercial pricing services . Discounted cash flow analysis is performed through which the loans’ contractual cash flows are modeled and an appropriate discount rate is determined to discount the cash flows to arrive at a present value . Financial factors, credit factors, collateral characteristics and current market conditions are all taken into consideration .\n The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects Athene’s own credit rating . The fair value of the embedded derivative represents the present value of cash flows attributable to the indexed strategies . Contracts acquired through a business combination which contain an embedded derivative are re-bifurcated as of the acquisition date .\n Athene believes it is suitable to hedge with options that align with the index terms of its indexed annuity products because policyholder accounts are credited with index performance at the end of each index term . Athene had embedded derivative liabilities classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy of $11.2 billion as of December 31, 2024 .\n Athene has considered current market conditions, as well as the market level of discount rates that can reasonably be anticipated over the near-term . Liabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established using accepted actuarial valuation methods . Athene bases certain key assumptions related to policyholder behavior on industry standard data .\n Athene uses a single A rate to calculate the present value of reserves related to its immediate annuities with life contingencies and assumed whole life products . Athene’s reserve for future policy benefits associated with life-contingent payout annuity will decrease when longevity decreases . Changes in the discount rate in periods after a cohort has closed will not impact interest expense recognition within the consolidated statements of operations .\n Athene issues and reinsures deferred annuity contracts, which include both traditional deferred and indexed annuities, that contain GLWB and GMDB riders . These riders meet the criteria for and are classified as market risk benefits . At contract inception, Athene assesses the fees and assessments that are collectible from the policyholder, which includes explicit rider fees and other contract fees, and allocates them to the extent they are attributable to the market risk benefit .\n Determining the projected benefits in excess of the projected account balance requires judgment for economic and actuarial assumptions . Economic assumptions include interest rates and implied equity volatilities throughout the duration of the liability . For riders on indexed annuities, this also includes assumptions about projected equity returns, which impact expected index credits and future equity option costs .\n Athene tracks and updates this assumption as experience emerges . Mortality assumptions are set at the product level and are generally based on standard industry tables . The discount rate used to present value the projected cash flows is a significant assumption, with the change in risk-free rates expected to drive most of the movement in discount rates between periods .\n If the discount rates used were to fluctuate, there would be a resulting change in reserves for the market risk benefits recorded through the consolidated statements of operations, except for the portion related to the change in nonperformance risk . The increase (decrease) to the net market risk benefit balance from hypothetical changes in the discount rate is summarized as follows .\n The obligations for debt payments include contractual maturities of principal and estimated future interest payments based on the terms of the debt agreements . The tax receivable agreement requires us to pay to our Former Managing Partners and Contributing Partners 85% of any tax savings received by AGM and its subsidiaries . Future interest payments on floating rate repurchase agreements were calculated using the December 31, 2024 interest rate .\n In connection with the acquisition of Griffin Capital’s U.S. asset management business on May 3, 2022, Apollo agreed to pay the former owners certain share-based consideration contingent on specified AUM and capital raising thresholds . These contingent consideration liabilities are remeasured to fair value at each reporting period until the obligations are satisfied . In exchange for the purcha. wer a specified percentage of any future performance fees earned from certain of the Stone Tower funds, CLOs and strategic investment accounts .\n Atlas originally received approximately $0.4 billion in cash and a portfolio of senior secured warehouse assets, subject to debt, with approximately $1 billion of tangible equity value . Atlas also benefits generally from the net spread earned on these assets in excess of its cost of financing . The guarantee related to the Company’s aforementioned assurance letter is not probable of payment and, therefore, a liability has not been reflected on the consolidated financial statements .\n The following tables present summarized financial information of AGM, as the issuer of the debt securities, and the Guarantors on a combined basis . Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities will have a direct claim only against AGM as issuer. ions from their respective subsidiaries to meet their future obligations under the notes and the guarantees, respectively . The 2033 Senior Notes, the 2054 Senior Notes . and the 2053 Subordinated Notes are not guaranteed by any fee generating businesses, Apollo-managed funds .\n Athene’s risk management frameworks are designed to identify, assess and prioritize risks to ensure that senior management understands and can manage our risk profile . Athene's retirement services business is exposed to market risk through its investment portfolio, its counterparty exposures and its hedging and reinsurance activities . The Company's primary market risk exposures are to credit risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk and inflation risk .\n The audit committee of the board of directors of AGM is tasked with reviewing major financial risk exposures of the Company and management’s risk assessment and risk management policies . Risk management processes are tailored to each respective investment portfolio subject to our overall risk tolerance and philosophy . The AAM Global Risk Committee (“AGRC”) is tasked .\n Managing risk is the responsibility of all AAM employees . The risk management function is designed to ensure that the risk profile is consistent with its stated risk profile . Risk management groups of the AAM’s risk management groups provide summary analysis of market and credit risk to the heads of the funds managed by AAM .\n Athene’s risk management framework includes a governance committee structure that supports accountability in current risk-based decision making and effective risk management . Business management retains the primary responsibility for day-to-day management of risk . Risk management team consists of eight teams: Business and Operational Risk, ALM, Regulatory and Risk Analytics, Risk Policy and Derivatives Risk, Derivative and Structured Solutions and Risk Operations and Change Management .\n The proportion of our management fees that are based on NAV is dependent on the number and types of funds in existence and the current stage of each fund’s life cycle . Management fees could be impacted by changes in market risk factors, including (i) changes in invested capital or in market values to below cost, due to which management could consider an investment permanently impaired .\n Advisory and transaction fees will be impacted by changes in market risk factors to the extent that they limit our opportunities to engage in credit and equity transactions . The impact is heavily dependent on the prior and future performance of each fund, and therefore is not readily predicted or estimated . Market risk is inherent in each of the investments of the funds we manage, including e .\n The Company is subject to a concentration risk related to the investors in the funds it manages . No individual investor accounts for more than 10% of the total committed capital to Apollo’s active funds . Interest rate risk represents exposure we and the funds we manage have to instruments whose values vary with the change in interest rates .\n Certain of the funds we manage are subject to certain inherent risks through their investments . The money market funds invest primarily in government securities and other short-term, highly-term instruments with a low risk of loss . As of December 31, 2024, we do not expect any client to default on its obligations . We seek to minimize risk exposure by limiting the amount of collateral .\n Certain investments of the funds we manage include lower-rated and comparable quality unrated distressed investments and other instruments . Investments in such debt instruments are accompanied by a greater degree of loss due to default by the issuer . Instruments used to mitigate this risk are foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures and forwards . We seek to minimize risk exposure by subjecting each prospective investment to rigorous credit analysis .\n Athene is subject to risk of loss from currency fluctuations, social instability, changes in governmental policies or policies of central banks, expropriation, nationalization, unfavorable political and diplomatic developments and changes in legislation relating to non-U.S. ownership . Athene manages credit risk by avoiding idiosyncratic risk concentrations .\n Athene manages its systematic exposure to economic and market conditions through stress testing, monitoring investment activity daily and distinguishing between price and default risk from credit exposures . Athene is also exposed to credit risk from its counterparty exposures related to derivative hedging and reinsurance activities . Derivative counterparty risk is managed by trading on a collateralized basis with counterparties under IAP documents .\n Management of interest rate risk at the various levels is one of the main risk management activities . Risk management personnel and the RC and/or IALC (together, ‘AHL’) are notified in the event of an interest rate loss . The company has established a set of exposure and stress limits to communicate its risk tolerance .\n Athene seeks to minimize the equity risk from its liabilities by economically defeasing this equity exposure with granular, policy-level-based hedging . Athene’s investment portfolio can be invested in strategies involving public and private equity positions, though in general, it has limited appetite for passive, public equity investments .\n The portfolio risks are measured overnight and rebalanced daily to ensure that the risk profile remains within risk appetite . Athene is also exposed to equity risk in its alternative investment portfolio . Alternative investments are comprised of several categories, including at the most liquid end of the spectrum “liquid strategies” (which is mostly exposure to publicly traded equities), followed by “equity” and “credit” strategies .\n Athene manages its inflation risk to maintain minimal exposure to changes in purchasing power . Athene attempts to hedge the majority of inflation risk arising from the pension group annuity business that it reinsures . The alternative investment portfolio is monitored to ensure diversification across asset classes and strategy . The portfolio's performance under stress scenarios is evaluated routinely as part of management .\n Athene calibrates recessionary shocks to several key risk factors (including but not limited to default rates, recoveries, credit spreads and U.S. Treasury yields) Athene uses default probabilities from the 2008-2009 period, along with recovery and ratings migration rates, to estimate impairment impacts . Management reviews the impacts of its stress test analyses on a quarterly basis .\n A 10% decline in the rate of exchange of all foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar would result in the following declines in management fees and investment income (loss) Management fees would decrease by approximately $21 million and $22 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively .\n Management fees earned that were dependent upon estimated fair value during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 would decrease by approximately $75 million and $58 million if the fair values of the investments held by such funds were 10% lower . Changes in values of investments could indirectly affect future management fees from such funds by, among other things, reducing the funds’ access to capital or liquidity .\n A 10% decline in the fair value of investments at December 31, 2024 and 2023 would result in an approximate $230 million and $247 million decrease in principal investment income and net gains (losses) from investment activities . Athene assesses interest rate exposure for financial assets and liabilities using hypothetical stress tests and exposure analyses .\n As of December 31, 2024 Athene’s balance in cash and cash equivalents plus restricted cash, net investment payables and receivables, reinsurance impacts and the net derivative collateral offsetting the related cash positions, was $6.8 billion, net of the amount attributable to the non-controlling interests . The decrease in sensitivity to spread related earnings due to the change in net investment spread from floating rate assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024, when compared to December  31, 2023, was driven by the growth experienced in 2024 .\n Changes in interest rates that impact the cost of the projected GLWB and GMDB rider benefits, included within Athene’s market risk benefit reserve, are amortized within cost of funds in spread related earnings . Athene is unable to make forward-looking estimates regarding the impact on net income (loss)\n Athene assesses public equity market risk for financial assets and liabilities using hypothetical stress tests and exposure analyses . The models used to estimate the impact of changes in market interest rates incorporate numerous assumptions, require significant estimates and assume an immediate change in interest rates without any discretionary management action to counteract such a change . Athene’s potential changes in valuations indicated by these simulations will likely be different from the actual changes experienced .\n The increase in sensitivity to point-in-time income (loss) before income tax (provision) benefit from changes in the fair value of these financial instruments as of December 31, 2024, when compared to December 31, 2023 . The financial instruments included in the sensitivity analysis are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recognized in earnings .\n The Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) The financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Apollo Global Management, Inc. and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years .\n Management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting . We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) We are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB .\n A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting . Internal control may not prevent or detect misstatements, and may not be able to detect misstatement . The company's internal control includes policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company .\n The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not providing a separate opinion . The fair value of the underlying investments held by the funds is the significant input into the calculation of performance allocations to be recognized in investment income . Certain funds may hold significant illiquid investments whose fair values are based on unobservable inputs .\n The valuation of certain investments without readily determinable fair values used in the calculation of performance allocations was a critical audit matter because of the valuation techniques, assumptions, market impacts and the degree of subjectivity of certain unobservable inputs . Auditing the fair value of these investments required a high degree of auditor judgment and increased effort, including the involvement of our internal fair value specialists .\n Investments in certain structured Level 3 asset-backed securities held by the Company, through its retirement services business, are reported at fair value in the consolidated financial statements . These investments without readily determinable market  are valued using significant unobservable inputs that involve considerable judgment by management . The Company uses internal modeling techniques based on projected cash flows and certain other unobservedable inputs .\n The Company determines estimated valuations of Market Risk Benefits and Interest Sensitive Contract Liabilities, which include embedded derivatives . The Company’s valuations are based on actuarial methodologies and include significant unobservable inputs associated with underlying economic and future policyholder behavior assumptions . Certain Assumptions are applied by the Company in determining these assumptions .\n Audit procedures related to these economic and policyholder behavior assumptions determined by the Company included the following . The auditing these estimates requires a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of our fair value and actuarial specialists, including those who helped plan and perform audit procedures . We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls over management’s development of these assumptions . We evaluated the methods, models, and judgements applied by management in determining these assumptions, including evaluating the results of experience studies .\n Investments: Investments: $6,086.7 billion; $377,895 in cash and cash equivalents; $1.8 billion in debt . $1,9 billion in liabilities: $1,7 billion in non-controlling interests; $2,8 million in debt; $3.3 billion in interest and interest . $3,637 in debt, $1 billion in taxes, $2.2 billion in expenses, $3 million in interest, and $1 million in taxes . $2 million in expenses .\n ApoLLO Global Management, Inc. has disclosed that Apollo Global Management Inc. made the most significant changes in the company's net worth in the first half of the year .

Any ownership interest other than the Company’s interest in its subsidiaries is reflected as a non-controlling interest .\n The Company believes that separate presentation provides a more informative view of the Company’s consolidated financial condition and results of operations than an aggregated presentation . The Company consolidates entities where it has a controlling financial interest unless there is a specific scope exception that prevents consolidation . The types of entities with which the Company is involved generally include: . Subsidiaries, which includes AAM and its subsidiaries, including management companies and . general partners of funds that the Company manages .\n The funds managed by the Company that meet the investment company criteria reflect their investments at fair value . The Company has retained this specialized accounting for investment companies in consolidation . VIEs are entities that do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support . Company is deemed the primary beneficiary when it has a controlling financial interest in the VIE .\n The Company does not consolidate those VOEs in which substantive kick-out rights have been granted to unrelated investors to either dissolve the fund or remove the general partner . For additional disclosures regarding VIEs, see notes 6 and 18. The portion of the income or loss and corresponding equity is allocated to owners other than the Company .\n The Company considers all highly liquid short-term investments, including money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities, with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents . Interest income from cash and cash equivalents is recorded in other income for asset management and net investment income for retirement .\n The carrying values of the money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities represent their fair values due to their short-term nature . Restricted cash consists of cash and cash equivalents held in funds in trust as part of certain coinsurance agreements to secure statutory reserves and liabilities of the coinsured parties . Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into the currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the end of each period .\n The change in unrealized foreign currency exchange of any non-U.S. dollar denominated AFS securities are included in other comprehensive income (“OCI) unless they are designated as part of a fair value hedge . Under the equity method of accounting, the Company records its share of the underlying income or loss of such entities adjusted for distributions .\n A repurchase agreement is a transaction in which the Company sells financial instruments to a buyer, typically in exchange for cash, and simultaneously enters into an agreement to repurchase the same or substantially the same financial instruments from the buyer at a fixed and determinable price at a future date . Although reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements generally involve the legal transfer of ownership of financial instruments, they are accounted for as financing arrangements .\n The Company measures both the financial assets and financial liabilities of consolidated CLOs in its consolidated financial statements in both cases using the fair value of financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever are more observable . For retirement services, the receivable under the reverse repurchase agreement is recorded as investment for the principal amount loaned under the agreement and the payable under repurchase agreements is recognized as payables for collateral on derivatives and securities to repurchase on the consolidated statements of financial condition .\n The net income (loss) attributable to Apollo Global Management, Inc. reflects the Company’s own economic interests in the consolidated CLOs, including (i) changes in the fair value of the beneficial interests retained by the Company and (ii) beneficial interests that represent compensation for collateral management services . The resulting amount is allocated to the individual financial assets using a reasonable and consistent methodology .\n The fair value of a financial instrument is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction . The actual realized gains or losses will depend on, among other factors, future operating results, the value of the assets and market conditions at the time of disposition, any related transaction costs and the timing and manner of sale .\n Financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values . Financial instruments that are included in this category generally include investments where the fair value is based on observable inputs as well as unobservable inputs . These financial instruments exhibit higher levels of liquid market observability as compared to Level 3 financial instruments .\n Apollo's pricing procedures are valued based on Apollo’s pricing procedures, which utilize third party pricing vendors, broker dealers and closing prices from exchanges . Valuations are based on independent market quotations obtained from market participants, recognized pricing services or other sources deemed relevant . When market quotations are not available, a model-based approach is used to determine fair value .\n The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2024 and 2023 and did not identify any impairment . Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of an acquired business. Goodwill is recorded in separate line items for both the Asset Management and Retirement Services segments. Other assets are primarily comprised of deferred tax assets, leases and fixed assets .\n The Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may be impaired . Profit sharing amounts are recognized as the related performance revenues are earned . Compensation costs are recorded in compensation and benefits for asset management and policy and other operating expense for retirement services in the consolidated statements of operations .\n The two-class method of computing earnings per share is used for all periods presented for common stock and participating securities as if all earnings for the period had been distributed . During periods of net income, the net income is first reduced for distributions declared on all classes of securities to arrive at undistributed earnings . The denominator includes all outstanding shares of common stock . The numerator is adjusted for any changes in income or loss that would result from the issuance of these potential shares .\n The Company accounted for share repurchases as constructive retirement, whereby it reduced common stock and additional paid-in capital by the amount of the original issuance . Under this method, issued and outstanding shares are reduced by the shares repurchased, and no treasury stock is recognized on the consolidated statements of financial condition . Athene is a Delaware corporation and generally all of its income is subject to U.S. corporate income taxes .\n The Company’s tax positions are reviewed and evaluated quarterly to determine whether the Company has uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition . If a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained, then no benefits of the position are recognized . The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period during which the change is enacted .\n The guidance is mandatorily effective for the Company for annual periods beginning in 2025; however, early adoption is permitted . The Company expects the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements to be immaterial . The guidance requires assets that meet certain conditions be accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income .\n FASB issued guidance in ASU 2024-01 that clarifies how an entity determines whether it is required to account for profits interest awards . The Company expects the impact of the new standard on its consolidated financial statements to be immaterial . The guidance is mandatorily effective for the Company on January 1, 2025, while retrospective application may be elected for a joint venture formed before the effective date .\n The Company early adopted the guidance on October 1, 2023, and there was no impact to the consolidated financial statements upon adoption .

The advisory agreements with the portfolio companies vary in duration and the associated fees are received monthly, quarterly, or annually . There was $155 million of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2024 that was previously deferred .\n Redeemable non-controlling interests are attributable to VIEs and, for periods prior to December 31, 2023, primarily represented the shares issued by the Company’s previously consolidated SPACs . Management fees, advisory and transaction fees, net, investment income, and incentive fees are included in deferred revenue .\n The revenue guidance also requires disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized . Management fees are generally based on (1) a percentage of the capital committed during the commitment period, and thereafter based on the remaining invested capital of unrealized investments .\n Apollo incurs certain costs related to certain transactions that are not consummated, or “broken deal costs” These costs (e.g. rdance with the terms of the related legal agreements when determining whether there is an identifiably distinct performance obligation . The amounts due from fund portfolio companies are recorded in due from related parties on the consolidated statements of financial condition .\n In the event the deal is deemed broken, all of the costs are reimbursed by the funds and then included as a component of the calculation of the management fee offset . If a deal is successfully completed, Apollo is reimbursed for all costs incurred and no offset is generated . Apollo recognizes performance allocations within investment income along with the related principal investment income (as described further below)\n When applicable, Apollo may record a general partner obligation to return previously distributed performance allocations . Principal investment income includes Apollo’s income or loss from equity method investments . Incentive fees differ from performance allocations in that incentive fees do not represent an allocation of capital but rather a contractual fee arrangement with the entity .\n Profit sharing amounts can be reversed during periods when there is a decline in performance . Apollo requires that a portion of certain of the performance revenues distributed to its employees be used to purchase restricted common stock issued under the Equity Plan . Profit sharing amounts previously distributed may be subject to clawback from employees and former employees .\n Apollo has performance-based incentive arrangements for certain employees designed to more closely align compensation on an annual basis with the overall realized performance of the Company’s asset management business .

Trading activity related to these investments is not intended to be an income strategy based on active trading . Equity securities include common stock, mutual funds and non-redeemable preferred stock .\n The initial allowance for credit losses for PCD investments is recorded through a gross-up adjustment to the initial amortized cost . For structured securities classified as beneficial interests, the initial allowance is calculated as the present value of the difference between contractual cash flows adjusted for expected prepayments and expected cash flows at the date of recognition . Interest income and prepayment fees are reported in net investment income on the consolidated statements of operations .\n Athene typically accounts for such investments using the equity method, where the cost is recorded as an investment in the fund, or it has elected the fair value option . Contributions paid or distributions received by Athene are recorded directly to the investment fund balance as an increase to carrying value or as a return of capital .\n Athene elected the fair value option on the term loans and other uncollateralized loans . Other investments include, but are not limited to, term loans collateralized by mortgages on residential and commercial real estate . Corporate owned life insurance is held at cash surrender value . Changes in fair value are reported in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations .\n ApoLLO GLOBAL MANAGEMENT, Inc. (AOPOLLO) (COOOO) (AOCOOO)  receives)   realized gains and losses on sales of investments are included in investment related gains (losses) on the consolidated statements of operations . Athene evaluates whether the decline in fair value has resulted from a credit loss .\n For structured AFS securities, the qualitative assessment is bypassed, and any securities having experienced a decline in fair value below amortized cost move directly to a quantitative analysis . A structured security’s cash flow estimates are based on security-specific facts and circumstances that may include collateral characteristics, expectations of delinquency and default rates, loss severity, prepayments and structural support .\n Athene uses a quantitative probability of default and loss given default methodology to develop the estimate of expected credit loss . The allowance for expected credit losses considers past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions or macroeconomic forecasts . Athene has elected to present accrued interest receivable separately in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial condition .\n Athene invests in derivatives to hedge the risks experienced from ongoing operations, such as equity, interest rate, foreign currency and market volatility . Athene may designate derivatives as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges. Athene elects to present any derivatives subject to master netting provisions as a gross asset or liability and gross of collateral .\n A derivative designated as a hedging instrument must be assessed as being highly effective in offsetting the designated risk of the hedged item . Hedge effectiveness is formally assessed at inception and periodically throughout the life of the hedge accounting relationship . For a cash flow hedge, all changes in the fair value of the . hedging derivative are reported within AOCI and the related gains or losses on the derivative are reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations .\n Embedded Derivatives continue to be carried on the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value . Changes in fair value recognized in investment related gains (losses) Changes in the derivative’s fair value and any income received or paid on derivatives at the settlement date are included in investment related gains . Embedded derivatives carry on the same line item as the host contract .\n The fair value of the embedded derivatives represents the present value of cash flows attributable to the indexed strategies . The embedded derivative cash flows are discounted using a rate that reflects Athene’s own own rate of interest . Contracts acquired through a business combination which contain an embedded derivative are re-bifurcated as of the acquisition date .\n Athene assumes and cedes insurance and investment contracts under coinsurance, funds withheld, modco, and yearly renewable term bases . Reinsurance accounting is applied for transactions that provide indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk (risk transfer) Athene generally applies the same measurement guidance for Athene’s directly issued or assumed contracts .\n For reinsurance of in-force contracts that pass risk transfer, the issue year used for the purpose of measuring the reinsurance recoverable is dependent on the effective date of reinsurance agreement . The issue year informs the locked-in discount rate used for purposes of interest accretion . Athene attempts to minimize its counterparty credit risk through the structuring of the terms of its reinsurance agreements .\n Athene records accruals based on the best available information at the time, which includes the reinsurance agreement terms and historical experience . Athene periodically compares actual and anticipated experience to the assumptions used to establish reinsurance assets and liabilities . For insurance contracts, the change in the direct or assumed and ceded reserves and benefits are presented net in future policy and other policy benefits .\n The net cost of reinsurance is amortized on a basis consistent with the methodologies and assumptions used to amortize DAC and deferred sales inducements (“DSI”), or on a consistent basis with deferred profit liability dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract . Athene replaces expected experience with actual experience to determine the related amortization expense .\n Athene establishes VOBA for blocks of insurance contracts acquired through the acquisition of insurance entities . Reserves are established using Athene’s best estimate assumptions as of the business combination date . VOBA can be either positive or negative and is amortized in relation to respective policyholder liabilities . Athene performs periodic tests to determine if positive VOBA remains recoverable .\n Certain of Athene’s universal life-type policies and investment contracts are offered with additional contract features that meet the definition of a market risk benefit . Positive VOBA is recorded in deferred acquisition costs, deferred sales inducements and value of business acquired on the consolidated statements of financial condition as the associated reserves .\n Unearned revenue liabilities are established when amounts are assessed against the policyholder for services to be provided in future periods . These balances are amortized consistent with the methodologies and assumptions used to amortize DAC and DSI . Liabilities for nonparticipating long-duration contracts are established as the estimated present value of benefits we expect to pay to or on behalf of the policyholders .\n Athene bases certain key assumptions, such as longevity, mortality and morbidity, on industry standard data adjusted to align with actual company experience, if needed . Athene has elected to use expense assumptions that are locked in at issuance for each cohort . All other cash flow assumptions are established at contract issuance and reviewed annually .\n The liability for nonparticipating long-duration contracts is discounted using an upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yield aligned to the characteristics of the liability, including the duration and currency of the underlying cash flows . Athene establishes future policy benefits for no-lapse guarantees by estimating the expected value of death benefits . The liability is never recorded at an amount less than zero for the cohort .\n Athene’s deferred annuity contracts which contain GLWB and GMDB riders that meet the criteria for, and are classified as, market risk benefits . Athene periodically revises the key assumptions used in the calculation of the liabilities that result in revisions to the expected excess benefits and assessments . The effects of changes in assumptions are recorded as unlocking in the period in which the changes are made .\n These attributed fees are used in the valuation of the market risk benefits and are never negative or exceed total explicit fees collectible from the policyholder . If fees are sufficient to cover the benefits, a non-option based valuation model is used . If the fees are insufficient, an option-based valuation is used to compute the liability at contract inception, with an equal and offsetting adjustment recognized in interest sensitive contract liabilities .\n Premiums for long-duration contracts are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders . When premiums are due over a significantly shorter period than the period over which benefits are provided, a deferred profit liability is established equal to the excess of the gross premium over the net premium . ivatives within fixed indexed annuity contracts is included in interest sensitive contract benefits on the consolidated statements of operations .\n Apollo and Athene completed the previously announced merger transactions pursuant to the Merger Agreement . As a result of the Mergers, AAM and AHL became subsidiaries of AGM . AGM issued one-time grants of fully vested RSUs and options to certain executives and stockholders of Athene vesting upon consummation of the merger .\n The pre-existing relationship related to receivables, payables, and dividends between Apollo and Athene . Total fees payable to AGM by Athene for asset management and advisory services were approximately $147.2 million . The fair value of Athene’s preferred shares and third-party investors in ACRA 1 was determined using the discounted distribution model approach . Athene's assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimates of their fair values as of the Merger Date .\n The financial statements were not retrospectively adjusted for the changes to the provisional values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed that occurred in subsequent periods . Goodwill is primarily attributable to the scale, skill sets, operations, and synergies that can be achieved subsequent to the Mergers . The goodwill recorded is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill on the consolidated statements of financial position includes the impacts of foreign currency translation .\n The Company finalized purchase accounting during the fourth quarter of 2022 . During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded adjustments which decreased provisional goodwill by $108 million . The adjustments were comprised of $25 million for measurement period adjustments and $83 million to adjust the valuation of an investment . The measurement period adjustments were primarily related to decreases in interest sensitive contract liabilities and future policy benefits .\n Athene’s revenues of $8,199 revenue and net income (loss) of $2,166 million are included in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 .
