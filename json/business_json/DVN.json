    "item1": "Item 1A.\n \nRi\nsk Factors\n \n\n\nOur business and operations, and our industry in general, are subject to a variety of risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face, as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently believe are immaterial. If any of the following risks should occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity could be materially and adversely impacted. As a result, holders of our securities could lose part or all of their investment in Devon.\n\n\nRisks Related to Our Industry\n\n\nVolatile Oil, Gas and NGL Prices Significantly Impact Our Business\n\n\nOur financial condition, results of operations and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the general supply and demand for oil, gas and NGLs, which impact the prices we ultimately realize on our sales of these commodities. Historically, market prices and our realized prices have been volatile. For example, over the last five years, monthly NYMEX WTI oil and NYMEX Henry Hub gas prices ranged from highs of over $120 per Bbl and $9.50 per MMBtu, respectively, to lows of under $30 per Bbl and $1.50 per MMBtu, respectively. Such volatility is likely to continue in the future due to numerous factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n•\nthe domestic and worldwide supply of and demand for oil, gas and NGLs;\n\n\n•\nvolatility and trading patterns in the commodity-futures markets;\n\n\n•\nclimate change incentives and conservation and environmental protection efforts;\n\n\n•\nproduction levels of members of OPEC, Russia, the U.S. or other producing countries;\n\n\n•\ngeopolitical risks, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the Israel-Gaza and Hezbollah conflicts and hostilities in Yemen and the Red Sea, as well as other hostilities or political and civil unrest in the Middle East, Africa, Europe and South America;\n\n\n•\nadverse weather conditions, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, such as tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes and acts of terrorism;\n\n\n15\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\n•\npandemics (such as COVID-19) and epidemics of infectious diseases and other public health events, as well as any related governmental actions; \n\n\n•\nregional pricing differentials, including in the Delaware Basin and other areas of our operations;\n\n\n•\ndiffering quality of production, including NGL content of gas produced;\n\n\n•\nthe level of imports and exports of oil, gas and NGLs and the level of global oil, gas and NGL inventories;\n\n\n•\nthe price and availability of alternative energy sources;\n\n\n•\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption and production, including with respect to electric vehicles;\n\n\n•\nstockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration and production of oil and natural gas in order to reduce GHG emissions;\n\n\n•\nthe overall economic environment, including inflationary pressures and fluctuations in interest rates;\n\n\n•\nmarket and geopolitical uncertainty as a result of shifts or potential further shifts in domestic and international policies following the 2024 U.S. presidential and congressional elections;\n\n\n•\nchanges in trade relations and policies, such as (i) the imposition of tariffs by the U.S., China or other countries, (ii) environmental performance standards or similar fossil fuel import restrictions in certain international markets, (iii) economic sanctions, including embargoes, on Russia or other producing countries or (iv) restrictions on oil, gas and NGL exports by the U.S.; and\n\n\n•\nother governmental regulations and taxes.\n\n\nEstimates of Oil, Gas and NGL Reserves Are Uncertain and May Be Subject to Revision\n\n\nThe process of estimating oil, gas and NGL reserves is complex and requires significant judgment in the evaluation of available geological, engineering and economic data for each reservoir, particularly for new discoveries. Because of the high degree of judgment involved, different reserve engineers may develop different estimates of reserve quantities and related revenue based on the same data. In addition, the reserve estimates for a given reservoir may change substantially over time as a result of several factors, including additional development and appraisal activity and the related impact to spacing assumptions for future drilling locations, the viability of production under varying economic conditions, including commodity price declines, and variations in production levels and associated costs. Consequently, material revisions to our existing reserves estimates may occur as a result of changes in any of these or other factors. Such revisions to proved reserves could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and the value of our properties, as well as the estimates of our future net revenue and profitability. Our policies and internal controls related to estimating and recording reserves are included in “Items 1 and 2. Business and Properties” of this report.\n\n\nDiscoveries or Acquisitions of Reserves Are Needed to Avoid a Material Decline in Reserves and Production, and Such Activities Are Capital Intensive\n\n\nThe production rates from oil and gas properties generally decline as reserves are depleted, while related per unit production costs generally increase due to decreasing reservoir pressures and other factors. Moreover, our current development activity is focused on unconventional oil and gas assets, which generally have significantly higher decline rates as compared to conventional assets. Therefore, our estimated proved reserves and future oil, gas and NGL production will decline materially as reserves are produced unless we conduct successful exploration and development activities, such as identifying additional producing zones in existing properties, utilizing secondary or tertiary recovery techniques or acquiring additional properties containing proved reserves. Consequently, our future oil, gas and NGL production and related per unit production costs are highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves.\n\n\nOur business requires significant capital to find and acquire new reserves. Although we plan to primarily fund these activities from cash generated by our operations, we have also from time to time relied on other sources of capital, including by accessing the debt and equity capital markets. There can be no assurance that these or other financing sources will be available in the future on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to generate sufficient funds from operations or raise additional capital for any reason, we may be unable to replace our reserves, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n\n16\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nOur Operations Are Uncertain and Involve Substantial Costs and Risks\n\n\nOur operating activities are subject to numerous costs and risks, including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs. Drilling for oil, gas and NGLs can be unprofitable, not only from dry holes, but from productive wells that do not return a profit because of insufficient revenue from production or high costs. Substantial costs are required to locate, acquire and develop oil and gas properties, and we are often uncertain as to the amount and timing of those costs. Our cost of drilling, completing, equipping and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences. Declines in commodity prices and overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomic or less economic than forecasted. While both exploratory and developmental drilling activities involve these risks, exploratory drilling involves greater risks of dry holes or failure to find commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. In addition, our oil and gas properties can become damaged, our operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled and the costs of such operations may increase as a result of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n•\nunexpected drilling conditions, pressure conditions or irregularities in reservoir formations;\n\n\n•\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\n\n•\nfires, explosions, blowouts, cratering or loss of well control, as well as the mishandling or underground migration of fluids and chemicals;\n\n\n•\nadverse weather conditions, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, severe thunderstorms and extreme temperatures, the severity and frequency of which could potentially increase as a consequence of climate change;\n\n\n•\nother natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods and wildfires;\n\n\n•\nterrorism, vandalism, equipment theft, extreme activism directed against fossil fuel operations or assets, cybersecurity incidents and pandemics or other widespread health concerns;\n\n\n•\nissues with title or in receiving governmental permits or approvals;\n\n\n•\nrestricted takeaway capacity for our production, including due to inadequate midstream infrastructure or constrained downstream markets;\n\n\n•\nenvironmental hazards or liabilities;\n\n\n•\nrestrictions in access to, or disposal of, water used or produced in drilling and completion operations;\n\n\n•\nlimited access to electrical power sources or other infrastructure used in our operations; and\n\n\n•\nshortages or delays in the availability of services or delivery of material or equipment.\n\n\nMany of the factors described above have negatively impacted and currently impact our operations and may do so again in the future. The occurrence of one or more of these factors could result in a partial or total loss of our investment in a particular property, as well as significant liabilities. Moreover, certain of these events historically have, and in the future could, result in environmental pollution and impact to third parties, including persons living in proximity to our operations, our employees and employees of our contractors, leading to possible injuries, death or significant damage to property and natural resources. For example, we have from time to time experienced well-control events that have resulted in various remediation and clean-up costs and certain of the other impacts described above.\n\n\nIn addition, we rely on our employees, consultants and independent contractors to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws and standards. Any violation of such laws or standards by these individuals, whether through negligence, harassment, discrimination or other misconduct, could result in significant liability for us and adversely affect our business. For example, negligent operations by employees could result in serious injury, death or property damage, and sexual harassment or racial, gender or age discrimination could result in legal claims and reputational harm.\n\n\nOur Hedging Activities Limit Participation in Commodity Price Increases and Involve Other Risks\n\n\nWe enter into financial derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our production to manage our exposure to oil, gas and NGL price volatility. To the extent that we engage in price risk management activities to protect ourselves from commodity price declines, we will be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of commodity price increases above the prices established by our hedging contracts. In addition, our hedging arrangements may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances,\n \n\n\n17\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nincluding instances in which the contract counterparties fail to perform under the contracts. Moreover, many of our contract counterparties have become subject to increasing governmental oversight and regulations in recent years, which could adversely affect the cost and availability of our hedging arrangements.\n \n\n\nWe Have Limited Control Over Properties and Investments Operated by Others or through Joint Ventures\n\n\nCertain of the properties and investments in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and may involve third-party working interest owners. We have limited influence and control over the operation or future development of such properties and investments, including compliance with EHS regulations or the amount and timing of required future capital expenditures. In addition, we conduct certain of our operations through joint ventures in which we may share control with third parties, and the other joint venture participants may have interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or us. These limitations and our dependence on such third parties could result in unexpected future costs or liabilities and unplanned changes in operations or future development, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, any bankruptcy involving, or any misconduct or other improper activities committed by, our business partners or other counterparties could negatively impact our own business or reputation.\n\n\nMidstream Capacity Constraints and Interruptions Impact Commodity Sales\n\n\nWe rely on midstream facilities and systems owned and operated by others to process our gas production and to gather and transport our oil, gas and NGL production to downstream markets. All or a portion of our production in one or more regions may be interrupted or shut in from time to time due to losing access to plants, pipelines or gathering systems. Such access could be lost due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, weather conditions and natural disasters, terrorism or sabotage, cybersecurity incidents, accidents, field labor issues or strikes. Additionally, midstream operators have in the past been, and in the future may be, subject to constraints that limit their ability to construct, maintain or repair the facilities needed to gather, process and transport our production. Such interruptions or constraints could adversely impact our operations, including by requiring us to curtail our production or obtain alternative takeaway capacity on less favorable terms.\n\n\nCompetition for Assets, Materials, People and Capital Can Be Significant\n\n\nStrong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties. We also compete for the equipment, materials, services and personnel required to explore, develop and operate properties, such as drilling rigs, well materials and oilfield services. The rising costs and scarcity caused by this competitive pressure will generally increase during periods of higher commodity prices and can be further exacerbated by higher inflation rates and supply chain disruptions in the broader economy, including as a result of tariffs or changes in trade policy. For example, we experienced higher operating costs throughout 2023 due to steep cost inflation. Although cost inflation moderated somewhat in 2024, such inflationary pressures could continue or increase in 2025. Competition is also prevalent in the marketing of oil, gas and NGLs. Certain of our competitors have resources substantially greater than ours and may have established superior strategic long-term positions and relationships. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for assets or services and accessing capital and downstream markets. In addition, many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for oil and gas production, such as changing worldwide price and production levels, the cost and availability of alternative energy sources and the application of government regulations.\n \n\n\nLegal, Regulatory and Environmental Risks\n\n\nWe Are Subject to Extensive Governmental Regulation, Which Can Change and Could Adversely Impact Our Business\n\n\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations, including with respect to environmental matters, worker health and safety, land and wildlife conservation, the gathering and transportation of oil, gas and NGLs, resource management and conservation policies, reporting obligations, royalty payments, unclaimed property and the imposition of taxes. Such regulations include requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances (such as surety bonds) covering drilling, completion and well operations and decommissioning obligations. If permits are delayed or not issued, or if unfavorable restrictions or conditions are imposed on our drilling or completion activities, we may not be able to conduct our operations as planned. Moreover, certain regulations require the plugging and abandonment of wells, removal of production facilities and other restorative actions by current and former operators, including corporate successors of former operators, which means that we are exposed to the risk that owners or operators of assets acquired from us (or our predecessors) become unable to satisfy plugging or abandonment and other restorative obligations that attach to those assets. In that event, due to\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\noperation of law, we may be required to assume such obligations, which could be material. We have incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating and remediation costs as a result of these and other laws, regulations, permits and orders to which we are subject.\n\n\nChanges in public policy have affected, and in the future could further affect, our operations. For example, various policy makers have expressed support for, and have taken steps to implement, efforts to transition the economy away from fossil fuels and to promote stricter environmental regulations, and such proposals could impose new and more onerous burdens on our industry and business. The IRA, for instance, contains hundreds of billions of dollars in incentives for the development of renewable energy, clean fuels and carbon capture and sequestration, among other provisions, potentially further accelerating the transition toward lower-or zero-carbon emissions alternatives to fossil fuels. These and other regulatory and public policy developments could, among other things, restrict production levels, delay necessary permitting, impose price controls, change environmental protection requirements, impose restrictions on pipelines or other necessary infrastructure, raise taxes, royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies and otherwise increase our operating costs. In addition, changes in public policy may indirectly impact our operations by, among other things, increasing the cost of supplies and equipment and fostering general economic uncertainty. Although we are unable to predict changes to existing laws and regulations, such changes could significantly impact our profitability, financial condition and liquidity, particularly changes related to the matters discussed in more detail below.\n \n\n\nFederal Lands\n – Federal policy makers have from time to time expressed support for, and have taken steps to implement, additional regulation of oil and gas leasing, permitting and development on federal lands. For example, the Department of the Interior adopted a final rule in April 2024 revising various terms for future federal leases and wells, including by enhancing bonding requirements and increasing royalty rates, rental rates and minimum bids. Moreover, non-governmental organizations, trade groups and other private parties have filed lawsuits challenging leasing, permitting and other regulatory decisions relating to our and other industry participants’ oil and gas development on federal lands, which, if successful, could further hinder development activities or otherwise adversely impact operations. While it is not possible at this time to predict the ultimate impact of these actions or any other future regulatory changes, including any potential actions by the Trump Administration, any additional restrictions or burdens on our ability to operate on federal lands could adversely impact our business in the Delaware and Powder River Basins, as well as other areas where we operate under federal leases.\n\n\nHydraulic Fracturing\n – Various federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, the EPA has issued regulations under the federal Clean Air Act establishing performance standards for oil and gas activities, including standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing, and it previously finalized regulations that prohibit the discharge of wastewater from hydraulic fracturing operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Moreover, several state and local governments in areas in which we operate have adopted, or stated intentions to adopt, laws or regulations that mandate further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, such as requiring disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, imposing more stringent permitting, disclosure and well-construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing operations and establishing standards for the capture of air emissions released during hydraulic fracturing. Beyond these regulatory efforts, various policy makers, regulatory agencies and political leaders at the federal, state and local levels have proposed implementing even further restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including prohibiting the technology outright. Although it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these or other proposals, any new restrictions on hydraulic fracturing that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business could potentially result in increased compliance costs, delays or cessation in development or other restrictions on our operations.\n\n\nEnvironmental Laws Generally\n – In addition to regulatory efforts focused on hydraulic fracturing, we are subject to various other federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on us for the cost of remediating pollution that results from our operations or prior operations on assets we have acquired. Environmental laws may impose strict, joint and several liability, and failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal fines and penalties, as well as injunctions limiting operations in affected areas. Any future environmental costs of fulfilling our commitments to the environment are uncertain and will be governed by several factors, including future changes to regulatory requirements. Any such changes could have a significant impact on our operations and profitability.\n\n\nWater Disposal\n – Earthquakes in southeastern New Mexico, western Texas and elsewhere have prompted concerns about seismic activity and possible relationships with the oil and gas industry, particularly the disposal of wastewater in salt-water disposal wells. In addition, similar concerns have been raised about the potential connection between water disposal activities and certain surface uplift, subsidence and other ground movement in western Texas and other areas of industry activity. Increased regulation and attention given to water disposal activities could lead to greater efforts, including through litigation, to limit or prohibit oil and gas\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nactivities relying on injection wells for produced water disposal. For example, New Mexico implemented protocols requiring operators to take various actions with respect to salt-water disposal wells within a specified proximity of certain seismic activity, including a requirement to limit injection rates if the seismic event is of a certain magnitude. Separately, the Railroad Commission of Texas has shown increasing regulatory focus on seismicity and the oil and gas industry in recent years, including by suspending all disposal well permits that inject into deep strata within the Northern Culberson-Reeves area due to increasing seismicity concerns. These or similar actions directed at our operating areas could limit the takeaway capacity for produced water in the impacted area, which could increase our operating expenses, require us to curtail our development plans or otherwise adversely impact our operations.\n \n\n\nTax Matters\n – We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income, capital and other taxes in various U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions, and our operating cash flow is sensitive to the amount of taxes we must pay. In the jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or previously operated, income taxes are assessed on our earnings after consideration of all allowable deductions and credits. Changes in the types of earnings that are subject to income tax, the types of costs that are considered allowable deductions and the timing of such deductions, or the rates assessed on our taxable earnings could significantly increase our tax obligations, adversely impacting our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, more generally, a change in any U.S. federal, state or local or foreign tax law, treaty, policy, statute, rule, regulation or ordinance, or in the interpretation thereof, in any jurisdiction in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate, or in which we or any of our subsidiaries are organized, could result in us incurring a materially higher tax expense, which would also adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, the IRA included a 15% CAMT on certain financial statement income, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has adopted a set of model international tax rules known as the “Pillar Two” framework, a central component of which is the imposition of a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15% on certain multinational enterprises. While we are still assessing the potential impacts of the CAMT and the Pillar Two rules to our business, any incremental taxes attributable to CAMT, Pillar Two or any other tax law changes, or a change in our current interpretation thereof, could be significant and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, we are regularly audited by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax positions are reasonable and properly supported, if one or more of our tax positions are challenged by the IRS or other tax authorities (in a tax audit or otherwise), material cash payments or adjustments to tax expense may occur, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nClimate Change and Related Regulatory, Social and Market Actions May Adversely Affect Our Business\n\n\nContinuing and increasing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in legislative, regulatory and other initiatives, including international agreements, to reduce GHG emissions, such as carbon dioxide and methane. Policy makers and regulators at both the U.S. federal and state levels have from time to time imposed, or stated intentions to impose, laws and regulations designed to quantify and limit the emission of GHG. For example, in December 2023, the EPA finalized more stringent methane rules for new, modified and reconstructed facilities, known as OOOOb, as well as standards for existing sources for the first time ever, known as OOOOc. The final rule includes, among other things, enhanced leak detection survey requirements using optical gas imaging and other advanced monitoring, zero-emission requirements for certain devices, and reduction of emissions by 95% through capture and control systems. The final rule also establishes a “super emitter” response program that allows third parties to make reports to the EPA of large methane emissions events, triggering certain investigation and repair requirements. Fines and penalties for violations of these rules can be substantial. The rules have been subject to legal challenge, although OOOOb is already in effect. Relatedly, the IRA imposed a new charge or fee with respect to excess methane emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas facilities starting in 2024 and annually increasing through 2026, and we cannot predict whether or how the Trump Administration may seek to revise or repeal these rules or the timing of any such actions. In addition to these federal efforts, the states where we operate have already imposed, or stated intentions to impose, laws or regulations designed to reduce methane emissions from oil and gas exploration and production activities, including by mandating new leak detection and retrofitting requirements.\n \n\n\nPolicy makers have also advocated for expanding existing, or creating new, reporting and disclosure requirements regarding GHG emissions and other climate-related matters. For example, the EPA adopted amendments in May 2024 to its GHG Reporting Program, which, among other things, added well blowouts and other abnormal events as new categories of sources for GHG emissions reporting. In addition, the SEC finalized rules in March 2024 that require public companies to include extensive climate-related disclosures in their SEC filings, such as new disclosures on (i) material Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, including an independent assurance report, and (ii) financial statement information regarding the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions.  In April 2024, the SEC stayed the effectiveness of these rules pending the completion of a judicial review of certain legal challenges.  Similarly, California enacted legislation in October 2023 requiring extensive climate-related disclosures for companies deemed to be doing business in California, and other states are considering similar laws. The European Union has also recently adopted a set of policy initiatives, including the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive, which impose expansive sustainability reporting and due diligence requirements for both European Union and certain\n \n\n\n20\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nnon-European Union companies. While we are still assessing the applicability of the European Union directives and California legislation and are awaiting resolution of the review of the SEC climate change rules, we would expect to incur substantial additional compliance costs to the extent these or similar disclosure requirements apply to us. We further anticipate the costs and other risks associated with any such disclosure requirements to be particularly heightened, given that reporting frameworks on GHG emissions and other climate-related metrics are still maturing and often require the use of numerous assumptions and judgments.\n \n\n\nWith respect to more comprehensive regulation, policy makers and political leaders have made, or expressed support for, a variety of proposals, such as the development of cap-and-trade or carbon tax programs. At the international level, over 190 countries have signed the Paris Agreement, which requires member nations to submit non-binding GHG emissions reduction goals every five years. Subsequent United Nations climate conferences have called for additional action to transition away from fossil fuels or otherwise reduce GHG emissions. The Trump Administration re-withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement in January 2025, and the United States’ participation in future United Nations climate-related efforts is unclear. At the state level, there have been attempts to introduce legislation whereby certain entities found responsible for contributing toward climate change over a period of time are required to pay into a fund used for climate-related projects. For example, in December 2024, New York passed its “Climate Superfund Law,” which provides for the assessment of a fee for emitters that have a sufficient nexus to the state and are found to have released more than one billion tons of carbon dioxide during 2000 through 2018. Vermont passed a similar law in May 2024, and similar legislation has been proposed in California, Massachusetts and New Jersey. We have been identified by New York as a potentially responsible party under the law; however, to date, we have not received any cost recovery demand. These and other initiatives could negatively impact our business through restrictions or cancellations of oil and natural gas activities, greater costs of compliance or consumption (thereby reducing demand for our products) or an impairment in our ability to continue our operations in an economic manner.\n\n\nIn addition to regulatory risk, other market and social initiatives relating to climate change present risks for our business. For example, in an effort to promote a lower-carbon economy, there are various public and private initiatives subsidizing or otherwise encouraging the development and adoption of alternative energy sources and technologies, including by mandating the use of specific fuels or technologies. These initiatives may reduce the competitiveness of carbon-based fuels, such as oil and gas. Moreover, an increasing number of financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital have restricted or eliminated their investment in oil and natural gas activities due to their concern regarding climate change. Such restrictions in capital could decrease the value of our business and make it more difficult to fund our operations. In addition, governmental entities and other plaintiffs have brought, and may continue to bring, claims against us and other oil and gas companies for purported damages caused by the alleged effects of climate change. The increasing attention to climate change may result in further claims or investigations against us, and heightened societal or political pressures may increase the possibility that liability could be imposed on us in such matters without regard to our causation of, or contribution to, the asserted damage or violation, or to other mitigating factors.\n \n\n\nFinally, climate change may also result in various enhanced physical risks, such as an increased frequency or intensity of extreme weather events or changes in meteorological and hydrological patterns, that may adversely impact our operations. Such physical risks may result in damage to our facilities or otherwise adversely impact our operations, such as if we are subject to water use curtailments in response to drought, or demand for our products, such as to the extent warmer winters reduce demand for energy for heating purposes. These and the other risks discussed above could result in additional costs, new restrictions on our operations and reputational harm to us, as well as reduce the actual and forecasted demand for our products. These effects in turn could impair or lower the value of our assets, including by resulting in uneconomic or “stranded” assets, and otherwise adversely impact our profitability, liquidity and financial condition.\n\n\nOur Environmental Performance Targets and Other ESG Initiatives May Expose Us to Risks\n\n\nWe have developed, and may continue to develop, voluntary targets related to our ESG initiatives, including our environmental performance targets and strategy. Any public statements related to these initiatives reflect our current plans and expectations and are not a guarantee the targets will be achieved or achieved on the currently anticipated timeline. Additionally, such statements are often based on assumptions or hypothetical scenarios which are necessarily uncertain. Our ability to achieve any targets is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control, including market factors, unanticipated changes in societal behavior, capital constraints, the pace of technological advancement and governmental policies or priorities. Moreover, as emission measurement protocols mature and related technologies continue to develop, we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals or otherwise revise the strategies outlined in our ESG initiatives. If our ESG initiatives do not meet our investors’ or other stakeholders’ evolving expectations and standards, investment in us may be viewed as less attractive and our reputation and business may be adversely impacted.\n\n\n21\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nAdditionally, public statements with respect to environmental targets or other ESG-related goals are becoming increasingly subject to heightened scrutiny from public and governmental authorities, as well as other parties, with respect to the risk of potential “greenwashing,” i.e., misleading information or false claims overstating potential ESG benefits. Certain regulators, such as the SEC and various state agencies, as well as non-governmental organizations and other private actors have filed lawsuits under various securities and consumer protection laws alleging that certain ESG statements were misleading, false or otherwise deceptive. Conversely, “anti-ESG” sentiment has gained momentum among some governmental and private actors, and various federal and state policy makers have enacted or proposed “anti-ESG” policies, legislation and other initiatives, including efforts targeting certain practices and programs related to diversity, equity and inclusion. As a result, we may also face heightened scrutiny, reputational risk, lawsuits or market access restrictions from these parties regarding our ESG initiatives.\n\n\nClaims, Litigation, Audits and Other Proceedings, Including Relating to Historic and Legacy Operations, May Adversely Impact Us\n\n\nDevon is subject to claims, litigation, audits, investigations and other proceedings, including proceedings by governments, taxing authorities and other regulatory bodies, involving a wide range of issues, such as royalty underpayment claims, tax audits, alleged environmental law violations and claims for alleged environmental damages or remediation obligations. The outcomes of these matters are inherently unpredictable and subject to numerous uncertainties, and estimating associated reserves or loss exposure involves significant judgment that may not reflect the full range of possible results. Moreover, a number of these claims and proceedings relate to historic operations or the operations of predecessor entities, which can increase the difficulty in making reserve or loss determinations due to the age of the underlying matter, limited access to relevant information or other factors. Until the final resolution of such matters, Devon may be exposed to losses in excess of any liabilities recorded, and such amounts could be material. Should any of our estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\n\nPrice Controls, Export Restrictions and Other Governmental Interventions in Energy Markets May Adversely Impact our Business\n\n\nDomestic and foreign governmental bodies have from time to time intervened in energy markets by imposing price controls, restricting exports, limiting production or otherwise taking actions to impact the availability and price of oil, natural gas and NGLs. For instance, members of the European Union agreed to a price-cap framework in December 2022 for the trading of natural gas in response to rising energy costs in Europe. Similarly, during 2021 and 2022, President Biden authorized several releases from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to lower domestic energy prices. More recently, in May 2024, the European Union approved new regulations imposing fossil fuel import standards, which include disclosure, emission mitigation work practices and methane intensity threshold requirements, which could impact our ability to sell production in European markets. Governments may take similar actions in the future, particularly in the event of disruption in energy markets or national emergency. Any such interventions could adversely impact our business, including by depressing the price of our production and generally introducing greater uncertainty to our operations.\n\n\nGeneral and Other Risks Facing our Business\n\n\nThe Credit Risk of Our Counterparties Could Adversely Affect Us\n\n\nWe enter into a variety of transactions that expose us to counterparty credit risk. For example, we have exposure to financial institutions and insurance companies through our hedging arrangements, our 2023 Senior Credit Facility and our insurance policies. Disruptions in the financial markets or otherwise may impact these counterparties and affect their ability to fulfill their existing obligations and their willingness to enter into future transactions with us.\n\n\nIn addition, we are exposed to the risk of financial loss from trade, joint interest billing and other receivables. We sell our oil, gas and NGLs to a variety of purchasers, and, as an operator, we pay expenses and bill our non-operating partners for their respective share of costs. We also frequently look to buyers of oil and gas properties from us or our predecessors to perform certain obligations associated with the disposed assets, including the removal of production facilities and plugging and abandonment of wells. Certain of these counterparties or their successors may experience insolvency, liquidity problems or other issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities (including contingent liabilities) owed to, and assumed from, us, particularly during a depressed or volatile commodity price environment. Any such default may result in us being forced to cover the costs of those obligations and liabilities. Our business has been adversely impacted by counterparty defaults in the past, and we may experience similar defaults again in the future.\n\n\n22\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nOur Debt May Limit Our Liquidity and Financial Flexibility, and Any Downgrade of Our Credit Rating Could Adversely Impact Us\n\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had total indebtedness of $8.9 billion. Our indebtedness and other financial commitments have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n•\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our liquidity to debt service payments, thereby limiting our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\n\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including low commodity price environments; and\n\n\n•\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing due to higher costs and more restrictive covenants.\n\n\nIn addition, we receive credit ratings from rating agencies in the U.S. with respect to our debt. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include, among others, debt levels, planned asset sales and purchases, liquidity, size and scale of our production and commodity prices. Certain of our contractual obligations require us to provide letters of credit or other assurances. Any credit downgrades could adversely impact our ability to access financing and trade credit, require us to provide additional letters of credit or other assurances under contractual arrangements and increase our interest rate under the 2023 Senior Credit Facility and the Term Loan, as well as the cost of any other future debt.\n \n\n\nCybersecurity Incidents May Adversely Impact Our Operations\n\n\nWe rely heavily on information systems, operational technologies and other digital technologies to conduct our business, and we anticipate expanding the use of and reliance on these systems and technologies, including through artificial intelligence, process automation and data analytics. Concurrent with the growing dependence on technology is a greater sensitivity to cyberattacks and other cyber-related incidents, which have increasingly targeted our industry. Perpetrators of cyberattacks often attempt to gain unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating confidential, proprietary or personal information, intellectual property or financial assets, corrupting data or causing operational disruptions, as well as preventing users from accessing systems or information for the purpose of demanding payment in order for users to regain access. A wide variety of individuals or groups may perpetuate cyberattacks, ranging from highly sophisticated criminal organizations and state-sponsored actors to disgruntled employees, and the nature of, and methods used in, cyberattacks are similarly diverse and constantly evolving, with examples including phishing attempts, distributed denial of service attacks or ransomware. In addition, our vendors (including third-party cloud and IT service providers), midstream providers and other business partners may separately suffer disruptions or breaches from cyberattacks or other cyber-related incidents, which, in turn, could adversely impact our operations and compromise our information. Moreover, we and other upstream companies rely on extensive oil and gas infrastructure and distribution systems to deliver our production to market, which, in turn, depend upon digital technologies; we also rely on other critical infrastructure to operate our business, such as communication networks and power grids. Any cyberattack directed at such infrastructure or systems could adversely impact our business and operations, including by limiting our ability to transport and market our production. Furthermore, human error by our employees, contractors or third-party business partners may also cause or exacerbate a cybersecurity incident, and geopolitical instability may heighten the risk of cyberattacks against us or the infrastructure we rely upon.\n \n\n\nAs of the date of this report, though the Company and certain of our service providers have experienced certain cybersecurity incidents, we are not aware of any previous cybersecurity incidents that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company. However, there is no assurance that such a breach has not already occurred and we are unaware of it, or that we will not suffer such a loss in the future. We devote significant resources to prevent cybersecurity incidents and protect our data, but our systems and procedures for identifying and protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient due to system vulnerabilities, human error or malfeasance or other factors. Any such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business, operations or reputation and lead to remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. Moreover, as the sophistication and volume of cyberattacks continue to increase, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities, and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm.\n\n\n23\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nInsurance Does Not Cover All Risks\n\n\nAs discussed above, our business is hazardous and is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration, development and production of oil, gas and NGLs. To mitigate financial losses resulting from these operational hazards, we maintain comprehensive general liability insurance, as well as insurance coverage against certain losses resulting from physical damages, loss of well control, business interruption and pollution events that are considered sudden and accidental. We also maintain workers’ compensation and employer’s liability insurance. However, our insurance coverage does not provide 100% reimbursement of potential losses resulting from these operational hazards and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. Additionally, we have limited or no insurance coverage for a variety of other risks, including pollution events that are considered gradual, war and political risks and fines or penalties assessed by governmental authorities. The occurrence of a significant event against which we are not fully insured could have an adverse effect on our profitability, financial condition and liquidity.\n \n\n\nOur Business Could Be Adversely Impacted by Shareholder Activism, Proxy Contests or Similar Actions\n\n\nIn recent years, proxy contests and other forms of shareholder activism have been directed against numerous public companies. Investors may from time to time seek to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction and operations of the Company, whether by stockholder proposals, public campaigns, proxy solicitations or otherwise. These actions may be prompted or exacerbated by unfavorable recommendations or ratings from proxy advisory firms or other third parties, including with respect to our performance (or the perception of our performance) under ESG metrics. Such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting our Board of Directors and employees from our long-term strategy, requiring us to incur increased advisory fees and related costs, interfering with our ability to successfully execute on core business operations and strategic transactions or plans and provoking perceived uncertainty about the future direction of our business. Such perceived uncertainty may, in turn, make it more difficult to retain employees and could result in significant fluctuation in the market price of our common stock.\n\n\nOur Acquisition and Divestiture Activities Involve Substantial Risks\n\n\nOur business depends, in part, on making acquisitions, including by merger and other similar transactions, that complement or expand our current business and successfully integrating any acquired assets or businesses. We cannot ensure that any acquisitions we attempt will be completed on the terms announced, or at all. If we are unable to make attractive acquisitions, our future growth could be limited. Furthermore, even if we do make acquisitions, such as the recently completed Grayson Mill acquisition, they may not result in an increase in our cash flow from operations or otherwise result in the benefits anticipated due to various risks, including, but not limited to:\n\n\n•\nmistaken estimates or assumptions about reserves, potential drilling locations, revenues and costs, including synergies and the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\n\n•\ndifficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired assets or business; and\n\n\n•\nunknown and unforeseen liabilities or other issues related to any acquisition for which contractual protections prove inadequate, including environmental liabilities and title defects.\n\n\nIn addition, from time to time, we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain of our properties or businesses as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio and to help enhance our liquidity. These transactions also have inherent risks, including possible delays or failures in closing, the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the disposed assets or business and potential post-closing liabilities and claims for indemnification, as well as secondary liability for any obligations to third parties guaranteed by us. Moreover, volatility in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders, unsuccessful sales efforts and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing.\n\n\nOur Ability to Declare and Pay Dividends and Repurchase Shares Is Subject to Certain Considerations\n\n\nDividends, whether fixed or variable, and share repurchases are authorized and determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and depend upon a number of factors, including the Company’s financial results, cash requirements and future prospects, as well as such other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. We can provide no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or execute share repurchases at the current rate or at all. Any elimination of, or downward revision in, our dividend payout or share repurchase program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\n\n\n24\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents",

We employ a variety of tools designed to identify, assess and manage cybersecurity threats, including monitoring and detection programs, network security measures, firewall monitoring devices and encryption of critical data. The Program includes a cybersecurity incident response plan that provides the framework for categorizing and responding to cybersecurity incidents. \nAs part of the Program, we perform cybersecurity risk assessments of certain third-party vendors of the Company, including technology vendors and key operational suppliers and service providers.\n These assessments are intended to identify potential risks to Devon associated with our use of third-party vendors and, where appropriate, to recommend and implement mitigating controls or solutions. In addition, Devon maintains disaster recovery plans related to cybersecurity incidents as part of our broader corporate emergency preparedness program, and our employees and contractors receive cybersecurity awareness training as part of both onboarding and through periodic training opportunities, including phishing simulations.\nWe have made efforts to align the Program with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework for risk management, and we conduct an annual assessment to identify areas for potential improvement and benchmark maturity relative to peers and other companies, as well as industry and other relevant standards. Moreover, we perform regular internal testing of our systems and programs, including disaster recovery exercises and tabletop exercises. We supplement these internal efforts by periodically \nengaging\n third-party organizations to separately review and stress-test the Program.\nThe Program is administered by our Digital Security team, which is led by our Manager of Digital Security. The Digital Security team meets at least weekly to discuss any cybersecurity incidents and related response actions, emerging cybersecurity threats facing the Company and preventative measures.\n \nIt is important to Devon that members of our Digital Security team have the necessary expertise to oversee the Program and its related technologies, platforms and applications, whether through educational background, experience, technical certifications or other training.\n The Manager of Digital Security has approximately 15 years of cybersecurity experience, a degree in management information systems and multiple certifications relating to security, risk and information systems, including a security leadership certification\n. \nCybersecurity risk is an area of focus for our Board of Directors, and we include cybersecurity and related risks in our enterprise-wide risk-management framework that annually assesses risks to the Company. This year-round assessment of risk is guided by our Internal Audit team and involves our Board of Directors, management and certain internal subject matter experts. \nThe Audit Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight of Devon’s risks from cybersecurity threats and reviews the steps management has taken to monitor and address such risks. Our management team provides quarterly updates to the Audit Committee on activities and other developments impacting Devon’s cybersecurity.\n These updates cover a variety of topics, including, among other things, (i) regular reviews of certain cybersecurity metrics for the Company, (ii) status reviews of our cybersecurity initiatives and the results of benchmarking or other assessments of the Program and (iii) briefings on current events or trends relating to cybersecurity. \nOur full Board of Directors also receives regular updates from our management team regarding the Program, as well as reports from the Audit Committee.\nAs of the date of this report, though the Company and certain of our service providers have experienced certain cybersecurity incidents, Devon is not aware of any previous cybersecurity threats that have \nmaterially affected\n or are reasonably likely to materially affect Devon.

    "item1a": "Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this report. Consequently, we systematically hedge a portion of our production through various financial transactions. The key terms to our oil and gas derivative financial instruments as of December 31, 2024 are presented in \nNote 3\n in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.\n\n\nThe fair values of our commodity derivatives are largely determined by estimates of the forward curves of the relevant price indices. At December 31, 2024, a 10% change in the forward curves associated with our commodity derivative instruments would have changed our net positions by approximately $300 million.\n\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had total debt of $8.9 billion. $7.9 billion of this debt was comprised of debentures and notes that have fixed interest rates which average 5.7%. We also have a $1.0 billion Term Loan which has a variable interest rate that is adjusted monthly. The interest rate on the Term Loan was 5.81% at December 31, 2024.\n \n\n\n45\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nItem 8.\n \nFinancial Statemen\nts and Supplementary Data\n \n\n\nINDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n\nAND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Earnings\n\n\n \n\n\n49\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\n\n \n\n\n50\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n\n\n \n\n\n51\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\n\n\n \n\n\n52\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n\n \n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n\n \n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 2 – Acquisitions and Divestitures\n\n\n \n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 3 – Derivative Financial Instruments\n\n\n \n\n\n63\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 4 – Share-Based Compensation\n\n\n \n\n\n65\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 5 – Other, Net\n\n\n \n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 6 – Income Taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n67\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 7 – Net Earnings Per Share\n\n\n \n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 8 – Other Comprehensive Earnings (Loss)\n\n\n \n\n\n69\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 9 – Supplemental Information to Statements of Cash Flows\n\n\n \n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 10 – Accounts Receivable\n\n\n \n\n\n70\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 11 – Property, Plant and Equipment\n \n\n\n \n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 12\n \n–\n Investments\n\n\n \n\n\n71\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 13 – Debt and Related Expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n73\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 14 – Leases\n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 15 – Asset Retirement Obligations\n\n\n \n\n\n77\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 16 – Retirement Plans\n\n\n \n\n\n77\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 17 – Stockholders’ Equity\n\n\n \n\n\n81\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 18 – Commitments and Contingencies\n\n\n \n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 19 – Fair Value Measurements\n\n\n \n\n\n84\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 20\n \n–\n Reportable Segments\n\n\n \n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote 21 – Supplemental Information on Oil and Gas Operations (Unaudited)\n\n\n \n\n\n86\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAll financial statement schedules are omitted as they are inapplicable or the required information has been included in the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.\n\n\n46\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\nReport of Independent Regist\nered Public Accounting Firm\n\n\n \n\n\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nDevon Energy Corporation:\n\n\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Devon Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\n issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nThe Company acquired Grayson Mill during 2024, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, Grayson Mill’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets of $5.6 billion and total revenues of $687 million included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Grayson Mill.\n\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)\n \n\n\n47\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \n\n\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n\nCritical Audit Matter\n\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n\nEstimate of proved oil and gas reserves used in the depletion of proved oil and gas properties\n\n\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company calculates depletion for its proved oil and gas properties subject to amortization using a units-of-production method. The rates used to deplete the balance of oil and gas properties subject to amortization are set using the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves by common operating field. Under the units-of-production method, a rate is set annually using the beginning of year balance of oil and gas properties subject to amortization and estimated proved oil and gas reserves for each common operating field. That rate is then applied to production throughout the year to determine the amount of depletion expense to be recorded by common operating field. The Company also periodically evaluates whether changes in the estimated proved oil and gas reserves for each common operating field have occurred that would require a change in the rate of depletion to be applied to the production realized. The Company’s internal reservoir engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves, and the Company engages external reservoir engineers to perform an independent evaluation of a portion of the estimates of proved oil and gas reserves. The company recorded depletion expense of $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\nWe identified the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves used in the depletion of proved oil and gas properties as a critical audit matter. There was a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating the Company’s estimate of the proved oil and gas reserves used as an input to determine depletion for each common operating field.\n\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s depletion expense process, including controls related to the estimate of proved oil and gas reserves. We analyzed and assessed the determination of depletion expense for compliance with industry and regulatory standards. To assess the Company’s ability to accurately estimate proved oil and gas reserves, we compared the estimated future production quantities assumptions used by the Company in prior periods to the actual production amounts realized and the current year-end future production quantities forecasted. We compared the estimated future production quantities used by the Company in the current period to historical production trends and investigated differences. We evaluated (1) the professional qualifications of the Company’s internal reservoir engineers as well as the external reservoir engineers and external engineering firm, (2) the knowledge, skills, and ability of the Company’s internal and external reservoir engineers, and (3) the relationship of the external reservoir engineers and external engineering firm to the Company. We read and considered the report of the Company’s external reservoir engineers in connection with our evaluation of the Company’s reserve estimates.\n\n\n/s/ KPMG, LLP\n\n\nWe have served as the

STATEMENTS\n\n\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n\nDevon is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Devon’s operations are concentrated in various onshore areas in the U.S.\nOn September 27, 2024, Devon acquired the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill for total consideration of approximately $\n5.0\n billion, consisting of $\n3.5\n billion of cash and approximately \n37.3\n million shares of Devon common stock, including purchase price adjustments. The transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.\nAccounting policies used by Devon and its subsidiaries conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. and reflect industry practices. The more significant of such policies are discussed below.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Devon, entities in which it holds a controlling interest and VIEs for which Devon is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Undivided interests in oil and natural gas exploration and production joint ventures are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in non-controlled entities, over which Devon has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for using the equity method. In applying the equity method of accounting, the investments are initially recognized at cost and subsequently adjusted for Devon’s proportionate share of earnings, losses, contributions and distributions. Investments in non-controlled entities over which Devon does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are initially recognized at cost and subsequently adjusted for contributions and distributions.\nVariable Interest Entity\nIn 2019, Devon and an affiliate of QL Capital Partners, LP (“QLCP”) formed CDM, a joint venture in the Delaware Basin. Devon holds a controlling interest in CDM and the portions of CDM’s net earnings and equity not attributable to Devon’s controlling interest are shown separately as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings and consolidated balance sheets. CDM is considered a VIE to Devon.\nDevon, through its controlling interest in CDM, has the power to direct the activities that significantly affect the economic performance of CDM and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to CDM; therefore, Devon is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates CDM. CDM maintains its own capital structure that is separate from Devon. During 2024, 2023 and 2022, QLCP distributions from CDM were approximately $\n51\n million, $\n45\n million and $\n30\n million, respectively. During 2024 and 2023 QLCP contributions to CDM were approximately $\n52\n million and $\n37\n million, respectively.\nThe assets of CDM cannot be used by Devon for general corporate purposes and are included in and disclosed parenthetically on Devon's consolidated balance sheets. The carrying amount of liabilities related to CDM for which the creditors do not have recourse to Devon's assets are also included in and disclosed parenthetically, if material, on Devon's consolidated balance sheets.\nSegment Information\nDevon’s oil and gas exploration and production activities are solely focused in the U.S. For financial reporting purposes, Devon aggregates its U.S. operating segments into one reporting segment due to the similar nature of these operations.\n\n\n53\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates, and changes in these estimates are recorded when known. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the following:\n•\nproved reserves and related present value of future net revenues;\n•\nevaluation of suspended well costs;\n•\nthe carrying and fair values of oil and gas properties, other property and equipment and product and equipment inventories;\n•\nderivative financial instruments;\n•\nthe fair value of reporting units and related assessment of goodwill for impairment;\n•\nincome taxes;\n•\nasset retirement obligations;\n•\nobligations related to employee pension and postretirement benefits;\n•\npurchase accounting estimates used for assets acquired and liabilities assumed;\n•\nlegal and environmental risks and exposures; and\n•\ngeneral credit risk associated with receivables and other assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nUpstream Revenues\nUpstream revenues include the sale of oil, gas and NGL production. Oil, gas and NGL sales are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price, delivery has occurred, control has transferred and collectability of the revenue is probable. Devon’s performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time. This occurs when control is transferred to the purchaser upon delivery of contract-specified production volumes at a specified point. The transaction price used to recognize revenue is a function of the contract billing terms. Revenue is invoiced, if required, by calendar month based on volumes at contractually based rates with payment typically received within \n30\n days of the end of the production month. Taxes assessed by governmental authorities on oil, gas and NGL sales are presented separately from such revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings.\nDevon acts as a principal in sales transactions when control of the product is retained prior to delivery to the ultimate third-party customer or acts as an agent when services are rendered on behalf of the principal in the transactions. A control-based assessment is performed to identify whether Devon is a principal or an agent in the transaction, which determines whether revenue and the related expenses are presented on a gross or net basis, respectively.\nOil sales\nDevon’s oil sales contracts are generally structured in one of two ways. First, production is sold at the wellhead at an agreed-upon index price, net of pricing differentials. In this scenario, revenue is recognized when control transfers to the purchaser at the wellhead at the net price received. Alternatively, production is delivered to the purchaser at a contractually agreed-upon delivery point where the purchaser takes custody, title and risk of loss of the product. Under this arrangement, a third party is paid to transport the product and Devon receives a specified index price from the purchaser with no transportation deduction. In this scenario, revenue is recognized when control transfers to the purchaser at the delivery point based on the price received from the purchaser. The\n \n\n\n54\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nthird-party costs are recorded as gathering, processing and transportation expense as a component of production expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings.\nNatural gas and NGL sales\nUnder Devon’s natural gas processing contracts, natural gas is delivered to a midstream processing entity at the wellhead or the inlet of the midstream processing entity’s system. The midstream processing entity gathers and processes the natural gas and remits proceeds for the resulting sales of NGLs and residue gas. In these scenarios, Devon evaluates whether it is the principal or the agent in the transaction. Devon has concluded it is the principal under these contracts and the ultimate third party is the customer. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis, with gathering, processing and transportation fees presented as a component of production expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings.\nIn certain natural gas processing agreements, Devon may elect to take residue gas and/or NGLs in-kind at the tailgate of the midstream entity’s processing plant and subsequently market the product. Through the marketing process, the product is delivered to the ultimate third-party purchaser at a contractually agreed-upon delivery point, and Devon receives a specified index price from the purchaser. In this scenario, revenue is recognized when control transfers to the purchaser at the delivery point based on the index price received from the purchaser. The gathering, processing and compression fees attributable to the gas processing contract, as well as any transportation fees incurred to deliver the product to the purchaser, are presented as gathering, processing and transportation expense as a component of production expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings.\nMarketing Revenues\nMarketing revenues are generated primarily as a result of Devon selling commodities purchased from third parties. Marketing revenues are recognized when performance obligations are satisfied. This occurs at the time contract-specified products are sold to third parties at a contractually fixed or determinable price, delivery occurs at a specified point or performance has occurred, control has transferred and collectability of the revenue is probable. The transaction price used to recognize revenue and invoice customers is based on a contractually stated fee or on a third party published index price plus or minus a known differential. Devon typically receives payment for invoiced amounts within \n30\n days. Marketing revenues and expenses attributable to oil, gas and NGL purchases are reported on a gross basis when Devon takes control of the products and has risks and rewards of ownership.\nMidstream Revenues\nDevon’s reported midstream revenue primarily relates to its interest in CDM. CDM provides gathering, compression and dehydration services to Devon and other producers’ natural gas production. An evaluation is performed to determine whether CDM is a principal or agent in these transactions. Under the terms of these gathering, compression and dehydration contracts, CDM has concluded it is the agent as title to the gas production remains with the CDM affiliate producer or a third-party producer. Revenue is recognized on a net basis since CDM is strictly providing a service. Costs to maintain CDM’s assets are presented as marketing and midstream expenses in the consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings. Revenue is recognized for sales at the time the gathering, compression and dehydration service has been rendered or performed.\nSatisfaction of Performance Obligations and Revenue Recognition\nBecause Devon has a right to consideration from its customers in amounts that correspond directly to the value that the customer receives from the performance completed on each contract, Devon recognizes revenue for sales at the time the crude oil, natural gas or NGLs are delivered at a fixed or determinable price.\nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nMost of Devon’s contracts are short-term in nature with a contract term of one year or less. Devon applies the practical expedient exempting the disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations if the performance obligation is part of a contract that has an original expected duration of one year or less. For contracts with terms greater than one year, Devon applies the practical expedient exempting the disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance\n \n\n\n55\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nobligations if the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation. Under Devon’s contracts, each unit of product typically represents a separate performance obligation; therefore, future volumes are wholly unsatisfied and disclosure of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is not required.\nContract Balances\nCash received relating to future performance obligations is deferred and recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met. Contract liabilities generated from such deferred revenue are not considered material as of December 31, 2024. Devon’s product sales and marketing contracts do not give rise to contract assets.\n \nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table presents revenue from contracts with customers that are disaggregated based on the type of good.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOil\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n9,368\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,879\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n10,281\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n398\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n703\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,948\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNGL\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,410\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,209\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,853\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOil, gas and NGL sales\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,176\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n10,791\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n14,082\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOil\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,405\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,018\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,305\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGas\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n517\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n572\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,163\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNGL\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n821\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n759\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,277\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing and midstream revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,743\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,349\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,745\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues from contracts with customers\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,919\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,140\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n19,827\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCustomers\n \nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, no customer accounted for more than \n10\n% of Devon's sales revenue.

For the year ended December 31, 2022, sales to \none\n customer accounted for approximately \n15\n% of Devon's sales revenue.\n \nIf any one of Devon’s major customers were to stop purchasing our production, the Company believes there are a number of other purchasers to whom the company could sell Devon’s production. If multiple significant customers were to discontinue purchasing Devon’s production abruptly, the Company believes it would have the resources needed to access alternative customers or markets and avoid or materially mitigate associated sales disruptions.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDevon is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations, including risks related to commodity prices and interest rates. As discussed more fully below, Devon uses derivative instruments primarily to manage commodity price risk. Devon does not intend to issue or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nDevon enters into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of its oil, gas and NGL production to hedge future prices received. Additionally, Devon periodically enters into derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of its oil, gas and NGL marketing activities. These instruments are used to manage the inherent uncertainty of future revenues resulting from commodity price volatility. Devon’s derivative financial instruments typically include financial price swaps, basis swaps and costless price collars. Under the terms of the price swaps, Devon receives a fixed price for its production and pays a variable market price to the contract counterparty. For the basis swaps, Devon receives a fixed differential between two regional index prices and pays a variable differential on the same two index prices to the contract counterparty. For price collars, Devon primarily utilizes two-way price collars. The two-way price collars set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production. If the applicable monthly price indices\n \n\n\n56\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nare outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, Devon will cash-settle the difference with the counterparty.\nAll derivative financial instruments are recognized at their current fair value as either assets or liabilities in the balance sheet. Amounts related to contracts allowed to be netted upon payment subject to a master netting arrangement with the same counterparty are reported on a net basis in the balance sheet. Changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met. For derivative financial instruments held during the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, Devon chose not to meet the necessary criteria to qualify its derivative financial instruments for hedge accounting treatment. Cash settlements with counterparties on Devon’s derivative financial instruments are also recorded in earnings.\n \nBy using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices, Devon is exposed to credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the hedging instruments are placed with a number of counterparties whom Devon believes are acceptable credit risks. It is Devon’s policy to enter into derivative contracts only with investment-grade rated counterparties deemed by management to be competent and competitive market makers. Additionally, Devon’s derivative contracts generally require cash collateral to be posted if either its or the counterparty’s credit rating falls below certain credit rating levels. As of December 31, 2024, Devon held \nno\n cash collateral of its counterparties \nno\nr posted collateral to its counterparties.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nG&A is reported net of amounts reimbursed by working interest owners of the oil and gas properties operated by Devon.\n \nShare-Based Compensation\nDevon grants share-based awards to members of its Board of Directors, management and employees. All such awards are measured at fair value on the date of grant and are generally recognized as a component of G&A in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings over the applicable requisite service periods.\nGenerally, Devon uses new shares from approved incentive programs to grant share-based awards and to issue shares upon stock option exercises. Shares repurchased under approved programs are generally available to be issued as part of Devon’s share-based awards. However, Devon has historically canceled these shares upon repurchase.\nIncome Taxes\nDevon is subject to current income taxes assessed by the federal and various state jurisdictions in the U.S. and by other foreign jurisdictions. In addition, Devon accounts for deferred income taxes related to these jurisdictions using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nDeferred tax assets are also recognized for the future tax benefits attributable to the expected utilization of existing tax net operating loss carryforwards and other types of carryforwards. If the future utilization of some portion of the deferred tax assets is determined to be unlikely, a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the recorded tax benefits from such assets. Devon periodically weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not required is difficult when there is significant negative evidence, such as cumulative losses in recent years.\n \nDevon recognizes the financial statement effects of tax positions when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. Recognized tax positions are initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing\n \n\n\n57\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nauthority. Liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to such tax positions are included in other long-term liabilities unless the tax position is expected to be settled within the upcoming year, in which case the liabilities are included in other current liabilities. Interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are included in current income tax expense.\nDevon estimates its annual effective income tax rate in recording its provision for income taxes in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Statutory tax rate changes and other significant or unusual items are recognized as discrete items in the period in which they occur.\nNet Earnings Per Share Attributable to Devon\nDevon’s basic earnings per share amounts have been computed based on the average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Devon applies the two-class method to stock awards deemed to be participating securities. The two-class method requires allocating net earnings to both common shares and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method to reflect the assumed issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive securities. Such securities primarily consist of unvested restricted stock awards and unvested performance share units.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nDevon considers all highly liquid investments with original contractual maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Devon also considers cash balances subject to legal and contractual restrictions as restricted cash.\nAccounts Receivable\nDevon’s accounts receivable balance primarily consists of oil and gas sales receivables, marketing and midstream revenue receivables and joint interest receivables. Devon does not require collateral security for joint interest receivables.\nDevon records an allowance for credit losses based on a forward-looking “expected loss” model. Credit risk is assessed by class of account type, which includes cash equivalents and oil and gas, marketing and midstream, joint interest and other accounts receivable. These classes are further evaluated using a probability-weighted scenario assessment based on historical losses and a probability of future default. This evaluation is supported by an assessment of risk factors such as the age of the receivable, current macro-economic conditions, credit rating of the counterparty and our historical loss rate.\nInventory\nDevon’s inventories primarily consist of oil and NGL inventory and equipment inventory. Oil and NGL inventory are recorded at weighted average cost and carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Equipment inventory is valued at weighted average cost and reviewed periodically for obsolescence or impairment when market conditions indicate.\n \nProperty and Equipment\nOil and Gas Property and Equipment\nDevon follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties. Exploration costs, such as exploratory geological and geophysical costs, and costs associated with nonproductive exploratory wells, delay rentals and exploration overhead are charged against earnings as incurred. Costs of drilling successful exploratory wells along with acquisition costs and the costs of drilling development wells, including those that are unsuccessful, are capitalized. Devon groups its oil and gas properties with a common geological structure or stratigraphic condition (“common operating field”) for purposes of computing DD&A, assessing proved property impairments and accounting for asset dispositions.\nExploratory drilling costs and exploratory-type stratigraphic test wells are initially capitalized, or suspended, pending the determination of proved reserves. If proved reserves are found, drilling costs remain capitalized as proved properties. Costs of unsuccessful wells are charged to exploration expense. For exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot be classified as proved\n \n\n\n58\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nwhen drilling is completed, costs continue to be capitalized as suspended exploratory well costs if there have been sufficient reserves found to justify completion as a producing well and sufficient progress is being made in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If management determines that future appraisal drilling or development activities are unlikely to occur, associated suspended exploratory well costs are expensed. In some instances, this determination may take longer than one year. Devon reviews the status of all suspended exploratory drilling costs quarterly.\nCapitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties are depleted by an equivalent unit-of-production method, converting gas to oil at the ratio of six Mcf of gas to one Bbl of oil. Proved leasehold acquisition costs, less accumulated amortization, are depleted over total proved reserves, which includes proved undeveloped reserves. Capitalized costs of wells and related equipment and facilities, including estimated asset retirement costs, net of estimated salvage values and less accumulated amortization are depreciated over proved developed reserves associated with those capitalized costs. Depletion is calculated by applying the DD&A rate (amortizable base divided by beginning of period proved reserves) to current period production.\n \nCosts associated with unproved properties are excluded from the depletion calculation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to such properties. Devon assesses its unproved properties for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Significant unproved properties are assessed individually.\nProved properties are assessed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes based on a common operating field. If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, the asset is assessed for potential impairment by management through an established process. If, upon review, the sum of the undiscounted pre-tax reserve cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value. Because there is usually a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants or by comparable transactions. The expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are typically based on judgmental assessments of future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs, and capital investment plans, considering all available information at the date of review.\n \nGains or losses are recorded for sales or dispositions of oil and gas properties which constitute an entire common operating field or which result in a significant alteration of the common operating field’s DD&A rate. These gains and losses are classified as asset dispositions in the accompanying statements of comprehensive earnings. Partial common operating field sales or dispositions deemed not to significantly alter the DD&A rates are generally accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized.\n \nDevon capitalizes interest costs incurred that are attributable to material unproved oil and gas properties and major development projects of oil and gas properties.\nOther Property and Equipment\nCosts for midstream assets that are in use are depreciated over the assets’ estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method. Depreciation and amortization of other property and equipment, including corporate and leasehold improvements, are provided using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives ranging from \nthree\n to \n60\n years. Interest costs incurred and attributable to major corporate construction projects are also capitalized.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\n \nDevon \nrecognizes liabilities for retirement obligations associated with tangible long-lived assets, such as producing well sites when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of such assets and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its fair value, with an offsetting asset retirement cost recorded as an increase to the associated property and equipment on the consolidated balance sheet unless the associated asset has already been disposed. When the assumptions used to estimate a recorded asset retirement obligation change, a revision is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost. Devon’s asset retirement obligations also include estimated environmental remediation costs which arise from normal operations and are associated with the retirement of such long-lived assets.\n \n\n\n59\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nThe \nasset retirement cost is depreciated using a systematic and rational method similar to that used for the associated property and equipment.\nLeases\nDevon establishes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases with a term longer than 12 months. Devon’s right-of-use operating lease assets are for certain leases related to real estate, drilling rigs and other equipment related to the exploration, development and production of oil and gas. Devon’s right-of-use financing lease assets primarily relate to real estate. Certain of Devon’s lease agreements include variable payments based on usage or rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation.\n \nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of business combinations over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Such test includes a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, then a quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, an impairment charge will be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. The fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based upon market capitalization, comparable transactions of similar companies and premiums paid.\nDevon performed impairment tests of goodwill in the fourth quarters of 2024, 2023 and 2022. \nNo\n impairment was required as a result of the annual tests in these time periods.\n \nCommitments and Contingencies\nLiabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims, assessments, litigation or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities for environmental remediation or restoration claims resulting from allegations of improper operation of assets are recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Expenditures related to such environmental matters are expensed or capitalized in accordance with Devon’s accounting policy for property and equipment.\nFair Value Measurements\nCertain of Devon’s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value at each reporting date. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. This price is commonly referred to as the “exit price.” Fair value measurements are classified according to a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs underlying the valuation techniques. This hierarchy consists of three broad levels:\n•\nLevel 1 – Inputs consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and have the highest priority. When available, Devon measures fair value using Level 1 inputs because they generally provide the most reliable evidence of fair value.\n•\nLevel 2 – Inputs consist of quoted prices that are generally observable for the asset or liability. Common examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets not considered to be active.\n•\nLevel 3 – Inputs are not observable from objective sources and have the lowest priority. The most common Level 3 fair value measurement is an internally developed cash flow model.\n\n\n60\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nNoncontrolling Interests\nNoncontrolling interests represent third-party ownership in the net assets of Devon’s consolidated subsidiaries and are presented as a component of equity. Changes in Devon’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in deconsolidation are recognized in equity.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\n \nBeginning in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Devon adopted ASU 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segments Disclosures. Under this ASU, the scope and frequency of segment disclosures has increased to provide investors with additional detail about information utilized by an entity's \"Chief Operating Decision Maker.\" See \nNote 20\n for Devon's disclosure.\n \nRecently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures. ASU 2023-09 intends to provide investors with enhanced information about an entity’s income taxes by requiring disclosure of items such as disaggregation of the effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information regarding income taxes paid. This ASU will result in additional disclosures for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued. This ASU will result in additional disclosures for Devon beginning with our 2025 annual reporting and interim periods beginning in 2026.\n \nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. ASU 2024-03 requires disclosures about specific types of expenses included in the expense captions presented on the face of the statement of operations as well as disclosures about selling expenses. This ASU is effective for Devon beginning with its 2027 annual reporting and interim periods beginning in 2028. Devon is evaluating the impact this ASU will have on the disclosures that accompany its consolidated financial statements.\n\n\n2.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\n\n\nGrayson Mill Acquisition\nOn September 27, 2024, Devon completed its acquisition of the Williston Basin business of Grayson Mill for total consideration of approximately $\n5.0\n billion, consisting of $\n3.5\n billion of cash and approximately \n37.3\n million shares of Devon common stock, including purchase price adjustments. Devon funded the cash portion of the purchase price through cash on hand and debt financing. For additional information regarding the debt financing, see \nNote 13\n.\n \nPurchase Price Allocation\nThis transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Grayson Mill and its subsidiaries have been recorded at their respective fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition and added to Devon’s. The preliminary purchase price assessment remains an ongoing process and is subject to change for up to one year subsequent to the closing date of the acquisition. Determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities of Grayson Mill requires judgment and certain assumptions to be made, the most significant of these being related to the valuation of Grayson Mill’s oil and gas properties. The inputs and assumptions related to the oil and gas properties are categorized as level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\n\n61\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nThe following table represents the preliminary allocation of the total purchase price of Grayson Mill to the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair values as of the acquisition date\n.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPurchase\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nPrice Allocation\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nas of December 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Consideration:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Devon common stock issued\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n37.3\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Devon closing price on September 27, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n38.96\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Total common equity consideration\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,455\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cash consideration\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,567\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Total consideration\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Assets acquired:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n147\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Accounts receivable\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n219\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Inventory\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n44\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Other current assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Proved oil and gas property and equipment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,056\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Unproved oil and gas property and equipment\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,771\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Other property and equipment, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n210\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Right-of-use assets\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Total assets acquired\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,485\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Liabilities assumed:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Accounts payable\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n145\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Revenue and royalties payable\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n209\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Other current liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n16\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Asset retirement obligations\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n75\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Lease liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n18\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Total liabilities assumed\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n463\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Net assets acquired\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nGrayson Mill Revenues and Earnings\nFrom the date of the acquisition through December 31, 2024, revenues and net earnings included in Devon's consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings associated with these assets totaled $\n687\n million and $\n122\n million, respectively\n.\nPro Forma Financial Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information is based on our historical consolidated financial statements adjusted to reflect as if the Grayson Mill acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2023.

The exchange is expected to close at the beginning of the second quarter of 2025.\n \nIn the third quarter of 2022, Devon completed its acquisition of producing properties and leasehold interests located in the Eagle Ford and Williston Basin for cash consideration of approximately $\n1.7\n billion and $\n830\n million, respectively, net of purchase price adjustments. The total estimated proved reserves associated with these Eagle Ford and Williston Basin assets were approximately \n87\n MMBoe and \n66\n MMBoe, respectively. Each of these acquisitions were accounted for as asset acquisitions as substantially all of the fair value was concentrated in a group of similar assets. Each of the acquisitions resulted in the purchase of producing properties and leasehold interests in a defined geographical and geological area, and substantially all of the assets have similar risk characteristics.\n \nContingent Earnout Payments\nDevon was entitled to contingent earnout payments associated with the sale of its Barnett Shale assets in 2020 with upside participation beginning at a $\n2.75\n Henry Hub natural gas price or a $\n50\n WTI oil price. \nThe contingent payment period commenced on January 1, 2021 and had a term of four years.\n Devon received $\n20\n million in contingent earnout payments related to this transaction in the first quarter of 2025, $\n20\n million in the first quarter of 2024 and $\n65\n million in the first quarter of 2023.

Generally, the service requirement for vesting ranges from \none\n to \nfour years\n. Dividends declared during the vesting period with respect to restricted stock awards and units will not be paid until the underlying award vests. Devon estimates the fair values of restricted stock awards and units as the closing price of Devon’s common stock on the grant date of the award, which is expensed over the applicable vesting period.\nPerformance Share Units\nPerformance share units are granted to certain members of Devon’s management and employees. Each unit that vests entitles the recipient to one share of Devon common stock. The vesting of these units is based on comparing Devon’s TSR to the TSR of a predetermined group of peer companies and certain indices over the specified \nthree-year\n performance period. Subject to certain limits, the vesting of units may be between \nzero\n and \n200\n% of the units granted depending on Devon’s TSR as compared to the peer group as of the end of the performance period.\nAt vesting, recipients receive dividend equivalents with respect to the number of units vested. The fair value of each performance share unit is estimated as of the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation with the following assumptions used for all grants made under the plan: (i) a risk-free interest rate based on U.S. Treasury rates as of the grant date; (ii) a volatility assumption based on the historical realized price volatility of Devon and the designated peer group; and (iii) an estimated ranking of Devon among the designated peer group. The fair value of the unit on the date of grant is expensed over the applicable vesting period. \nThe following table presents the assumptions related to performance share units granted.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Grant-date fair value\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n56.99\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n81.70\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n68.68\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n Risk-free interest rate\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.28\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4.15\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1.81\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Volatility factor\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n46.03\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n61.43\n\n\n%\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n70.1\n\n\n%\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Contractual term (years)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.89\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.89\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2.89\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n5.\nOther, \nNet \nThe following table summarizes Devon’s other expenses (income) presented in the accompanying consolidated comprehensive statements of earnings.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated future obligation under a performance guarantee\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n28\n\n\n)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n144\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsset retirement obligation accretion\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n39\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n29\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n25\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRestructuring & transaction costs\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n76\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n24\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n96\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n38\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n(\n95\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n66\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nDevon has guaranteed performance through 2026 for a minimum volume commitment associated with assets divested in 2018.

Under the terms of the arrangement, Devon and a holding company owned by the other joint venture investors each have a \n50\n% voting interest in the joint venture legal entity, and HEP serves as the operator. Through 2038, Devon’s production from \n50,000\n net acres in the Stateline area of the Delaware Basin has been dedicated to Catalyst subject to fixed-fee oil gathering and natural gas processing agreements. Devon accounts for the investment in Catalyst as an equity method investment. Devon's investment in Catalyst is shown within investments on the consolidated balance sheets, and Devon's share of Catalyst earnings are reflected as a component of other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings.\nIn 2023, Devon made an investment in the Water JV, a joint venture entity formed with an affiliate of WaterBridge NDB LLC (“WaterBridge”), for the purpose of providing increased capacity and flexibility in disposing of produced water in the Delaware Basin and Eagle Ford. Under terms of the arrangement, Devon contributed water infrastructure assets and committed to a water gathering and disposal dedication to the Water JV through 2038, in exchange for a \n30\n% voting interest in the joint venture legal entity. WaterBridge contributed water infrastructure assets to the Water JV, in exchange for a \n70\n% voting interest in the joint venture legal entity and is serving as the operator.

Devon accounts for the investment in the Water JV as an equity method investment. Devon's investment in the Water JV is shown within investments on the consolidated balance sheets, and Devon's share of the Water JV earnings are reflected as a component of other, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive earnings.\nIn 2024, Devon invested approximately $\n117\n million in Fervo, a company that generates energy from geothermal wells. The investment allows Devon to exercise significant influence over Fervo, and the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.

Devon's investment in Matterhorn does not give it the ability to exercise significant influence over Matterhorn.\nDevon has other investments largely focused on midstream, new technologies and energy transition initiatives.

At any time prior to the dates in the following schedule, Devon has the option to redeem some or all of the notes at a specified “make whole” premium as described in such documents. Other than with respect to the notes identified in the schedule below, Devon's senior notes generally include more limited redemption provisions, such as \"par call\" rights near the maturity date or “make whole” redemption rights.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOptional Redemption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.25% due October 15, 2027\n\n\n \n\n\nOctober 15, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.875% due June 15, 2028\n\n\n \n\n\nJune 15, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.50% due January 15, 2030\n\n\n \n\n\nJanuary 15, 2025\n\n\n\n\n \nCredit Lines\nIn 2023, Devon amended and restated its 2018 Senior Credit Facility to provide for a new $\n3.0\n billion revolving 2023 Senior Credit Facility. \nIn the first quarter of 2024, Devon exercised its option to extend the 2023 Senior Credit Facility maturity date from March 24, 2028 to March 24, 2029\n. Devon has the option to extend the March 24, 2029 maturity date by two additional one-year periods subject to lender consent. As of December 31, 2024, Devon had \nno\n outstanding borrowings under the 2023 Senior Credit Facility and had issued $\n4\n million in outstanding letters of credit under this facility. Interest rates on borrowings under the 2023 Senior Credit Facility are determined based on the applicable loan type elected by Devon and a pricing grid set forth in the credit agreement and vary according to the credit ratings of the Company. The 2023 Senior Credit Facility currently provides for an annual facility fee of approximately $\n5\n million.\n The 2023 Senior Credit Facility contains only one material financial covenant. This covenant requires Devon's ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization, as defined in the credit agreement, to be no greater than \n65\n%. Under the terms of the credit agreement, total capitalization is adjusted to add back non-cash financial write-downs such as impairments. As of December 31, 2024, Devon was in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to capitalization ratio of \n26.5\n%.\nCommercial Paper\nDevon’s 2023 Senior Credit Facility supports its $\n3.0\n billion of short-term credit under its commercial paper program. Commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between 1 and 90 days, although it can have a maturity of up to 365 days, and bears interest at rates agreed to at the time of the borrowing. As of December 31, 2024, Devon had \nno\n outstanding commercial paper borrowings.\n \nTerm Loan Credit Agreement\n \nIn August 2024, Devon entered into a delayed draw term loan credit agreement (the “Term Loan Credit Agreement”), providing for delayed draw term loans in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $\n2.0\n billion, including a 364-day tranche of $\n500\n million and a two-year tranche of $\n1.5\n billion. On September 27, 2024, Devon borrowed $\n1.0\n billion on the two-year tranche (the “Term Loan”) to partially fund the closing of the Grayson Mill acquisition. In connection with the borrowing of the Term Loan, the undrawn commitments under the Term Loan Credit Agreement automatically terminated. The Term Loan bears interest at a rate based on term SOFR plus a spread adjustment that varies based on Devon's credit ratings. The interest rate on the Term Loan was \n5.81\n% as of December 31, 2024.\nThe Term Loan \nCredit Agreement contains substantially the same financial covenant as the 2023 Senior Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2024, Devon was in compliance with this covenant with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of \n26.5\n%\n.\n \nIssuance of Senior Notes\n \nIn August 2024, Devon issued $\n1.25\n billion of \n5.20\n% senior notes due 2034 and $\n1.0\n billion of \n5.75\n% senior notes due 2054. Devon used the net proceeds to partially fund the Grayson Mill acquisition.

Devon’s right-of-use financing lease assets primarily relate to real estate. Certain of Devon’s lease agreements include variable payments based on usage or rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Devon’s financing lease arrangement contains various covenants, including covenants similar to the 2023 Senior Credit Facility.\nOn February 14, 2025, Devon’s Board of Directors approved an early extinguishment of an approximately $\n300\n million real estate finance lease included in the table below for a cash payment of approximately $\n275\n million. This extinguishment and acquisition of the associated real estate is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2025. In conjunction with extinguishing the lease, Devon expects to sell the associated real estate and considers the related real estate assets held for sale as of February 14, 2025. In the first quarter of 2025, Devon expects to recognize a non-cash loss of approximately $\n160\n million, consisting of an asset impairment of approximately $\n185\n million partially offset by an approximately $\n25\n million gain on early lease extinguishment. Upon lease extinguishment and sale of the associated real estate and related sales proceeds received, Devon's annual net financing costs and DD&A will be reduced by approximately $\n18\n million and $\n11\n million, respectively.\nThe following table presents Devon’s right-of-use assets and lease liabilities.\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nDecember 31, 2023\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFinance\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOperating\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nFinance\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOperating\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight-of-use assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n248\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n55\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n303\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n246\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n21\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n267\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLease liabilities:\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent lease liabilities \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n25\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n28\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n53\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n21\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n12\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n33\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong-term lease liabilities\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n293\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n27\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n320\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n286\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n9\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n295\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal lease liabilities\n (2)\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n318\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n55\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n373\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n307\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n21\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n328\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nCurrent lease liabilities are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)\nDevon has entered into certain leases of equipment related to the exploration, development and production of oil and gas that had terms not yet commenced as of December 31, 2024 and are therefore excluded from the amounts shown above.\n\n\n75\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nT\nhe following table presents Devon’s total lease cost.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating lease cost\n\n\nProperty and equipment;

During this same time period, Devon also increased its asset retirement obligations by approximately $\n27\n million primarily due to inflation-driven increases in cost estimates.\n\n\n16.\nRetirement Plans\n\n\nDefined Contribution Plans\nDevon sponsors defined contribution plans covering its employees. Such plans include its 401(k) plan and enhanced contribution plan. Devon makes matching contributions and additional retirement contributions, with the matching contributions being primarily based upon percentages of annual compensation and years of service. In addition, each plan is subject to regulatory limitations by the U.S. government. Devon contributed $\n44\n million, $\n38\n million and $\n37\n million to these plans in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nDevon has various non-contributory defined benefit pension plans, including qualified plans and nonqualified plans covering eligible employees and former employees meeting certain age and service requirements.

Devon has established certain investment strategies, including target allocation percentages and permitted and prohibited investments, designed to mitigate risks inherent with investing. Devon’s target allocations for its plan assets are \n70\n% fixed income and \n30\n% equity. See the following discussion for Devon’s pension assets by asset class.\nFixed-income\n – Devon’s fixed-income securities consist of U.S. Treasury obligations, bonds issued by investment-grade companies from diverse industries and asset-backed securities. These fixed-income securities do not consistently trade actively in an established market. The fair values of these Level 2 securities are estimated based upon rates available for securities with similar terms and maturity when active trading is not available and were $\n286\n million and $\n418\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n \nEquity \n– Devon’s equity securities include commingled global equity funds that invest in large, mid and small capitalization stocks across the world’s developed and emerging markets and international large cap equity securities. These equity securities can be sold on demand but are not actively traded. The fair values of these securities are based upon the net asset values provided by the investment managers and were $\n97\n million and $\n44\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nOther\n – Devon’s other securities include short-term investment funds that invest both long and short term using a variety of investment strategies. The fair value of these securities is based upon the net asset values provided by investment managers and were $\n64\n million and $\n14\n million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\nDefined Postretirement Plans\nDevon also has defined benefit postretirement plans that provide benefits for substantially all qualifying retirees. Benefit obligations for such plans are estimated based on Devon’s future cost-sharing intentions. Devon’s funding policy for the plans is to fund the benefits as they become payable with available cash and cash equivalents.\n\n\n78\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nBenefit Obligations and Funded Status\nThe following table summarizes the benefit obligations, assets, funded status and balance sheet impacts associated with Devon’s defined pension and postretirement plans.

discounted based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled, considering the timing of expected future cash flows related to the plans. This rate is based on high-quality bond yields, after allowing for call and default risk.\n \nExpected return on plan assets\n – This was determined by evaluating input from external consultants and economists, as well as long-term inflation assumptions and consideration of target allocation of investment types.\nMortality rate\n – Devon utilized the Society of Actuaries produced mortality tables.\n \nOther assumptions\n – For measurement of the 2024 benefit obligation for the other postretirement medical plans, a \n6.6\n% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2024. The rate was assumed to decrease annually to an ultimate rate of \n5\n% in the year 2033 and remain at that level thereafter.\n \nExpected Cash Flows\nDevon expects benefit plan payments to average approximately $\n52\n million a year for the next five years and $\n239\n million total for the five years thereafter.

The dividend is payable in the first quarter of \n2025\n and is expected to total approximately $\n156\n million.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nThe noncontrolling interests’ share of CDM’s net earnings and the contributions from and distributions to the noncontrolling interests are presented as components of equity.\n\n\n18.\nCommitments and Contingencies\n\n\nDevon is party to various legal actions arising in connection with its business. Matters that are probable of unfavorable outcome to Devon and which can be reasonably estimated are accrued. Such accruals are based on information known about the matters, Devon’s estimates of the outcomes of such matters and its experience in contesting, litigating and settling similar matters. None of the actions are believed by management to likely involve future amounts that would be material to Devon’s financial position or results of operations after consideration of recorded accruals. Actual amounts could differ materially from management’s estimates.\nRoyalty Matters\nNumerous \noil and natural gas producers and related parties, including Devon, have been named in various lawsuits alleging royalty underpayments. Devon is currently named as a defendant in a number of such lawsuits, including some lawsuits in which the plaintiffs seek to certify classes of similarly situated plaintiffs. Among the allegations typically asserted in these suits are claims that Devon used below-market prices, made improper deductions, paid royalty proceeds in an untimely manner without including required interest, used improper measurement techniques and entered into gas purchase and processing arrangements with affiliates that resulted in underpayment of royalties in connection with oil, natural gas and NGLs produced and sold. Devon is also involved in governmental agency proceedings and royalty audits and is subject to related contracts and regulatory controls in the ordinary course\n \n\n\n82\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nof \nbusiness, some that may lead to additional royalty claims. As of December 31, 2024, Devon has accrued approximately $\n70\n million in other current liabilities pertaining to such royalty matters.\nEnvironmental and Climate Change Matters\nDevon’s business is subject to numerous federal, state, tribal and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties, as well as remediation costs. Although Devon believes that it is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on its business, there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future.\nThe Company has previously received separate NOVs from the EPA alleging emissions and permitting violations relating to certain of our historic operations in North Dakota, western Texas and New Mexico, respectively. The Company has been engaging with the EPA to resolve each of these matters, and Devon is actively negotiating a draft consent decree with the EPA and the Department of Justice with respect to the North Dakota NOV matter. If finalized, the consent decree may include monetary sanctions and obligations to complete mitigation projects and implement specific injunctive relief. Given that negotiations of the draft consent decree are ongoing and the uncertainty as to the ultimate result of the North Dakota NOV matter, we are currently unable to provide an estimate of potential loss; however, the costs associated with the resolution of the North Dakota NOV matter or any of the other NOV matters could be significant in amount and may include monetary penalties.\n \nBeginning in 2013, various parishes in Louisiana filed suit against numerous oil and gas companies, including Devon, alleging that the companies’ operations and activities in certain fields violated the State and Local Coastal Resource Management Act of 1978, as amended, and caused substantial environmental contamination, subsidence and other environmental damages to land and water bodies located in the coastal zone of Louisiana. The plaintiffs’ claims against Devon relate primarily to the operations of several of Devon’s corporate predecessors. The plaintiffs seek, among other things, payment of the costs necessary to clear, re-vegetate and otherwise restore the allegedly impacted areas. Although Devon cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, Devon denies the allegations in these lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend against these claims.\nThe State of Delaware has filed legal proceedings against numerous oil and gas companies, including Devon, seeking relief to abate alleged impacts of climate change. These proceedings include far-reaching claims for monetary damages and injunctive relief. Although Devon cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, Devon denies the allegations asserted in this lawsuit and intends to vigorously defend against these claims.\nOther Indemnifications and Legacy Matters\nPursuant to various sale agreements relating to divested businesses and assets, Devon has indemnified various purchasers against liabilities that they may incur with respect to the businesses and assets acquired from Devon. Additionally, federal, state and other laws in areas of former operations may require previous operators (including corporate successors of previous operators) to perform or make payments in certain circumstances where the current operator may no longer be able to satisfy the applicable obligation. Such obligations may include plugging and abandoning wells, removing production facilities, undertaking other restorative actions or performing requirements under surface agreements in existence at the time of disposition. For example, a predecessor entity of a Devon subsidiary previously sold certain private, state and federal oil and gas leases covering properties in shallow waters off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of America. These assets are generally referred to as the East Bay Field. The current operator of the East Bay Field has filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and may be unable to satisfy the eventual decommissioning obligations associated with the East Bay Field. Other companies in the chain of title of the East Bay Field have also sought bankruptcy protection and may be similarly unable to satisfy the eventual decommissioning obligations associated with the East Bay Field. Depending upon the outcome of these bankruptcy proceedings, amounts available under decommissioning bonds and a cash security account and other factors, Devon may be required to perform or fund certain decommissioning obligations associated with the East Bay Field under state and federal regulations applicable to predecessor operators. As a result of these factors and uncertainties, we are currently unable to provide an estimate of potential loss.\n\n\n83\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nCommitments\nThe following table presents Devon’s commitments that have initial or remaining noncancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2024.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYear Ending December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\nDrilling and Facility Obligations\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOperational\n Agreements\n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nOffice and Equipment Leases and Other\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2025\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n142\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n594\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n128\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2026\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n19\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n534\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n159\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2027\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n23\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n465\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n118\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2028\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n36\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n451\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n105\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n2029\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n401\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n86\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThereafter\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n—\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,289\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n432\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n224\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,734\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n1,028\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n(1)\nTotal costs incurred under take-or-pay and throughput obligations were approximately $\n800\n million, $\n750\n million and $\n650\n million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\nDevon has certain drilling and facility obligations under contractual agreements with third-party service providers to procure drilling rigs and other related services for developmental and exploratory drilling and facilities construction.

The fair values of its debt are estimated based on rates available for debt with similar terms and maturity when active trading is not available. Our variable rate debt is non-public and consists of our Term Loan. The fair value of our variable rate debt approximates the carrying value as the underlying SOFR resets every month based on the prevailing market rate.\nLevel 3 Fair Value Measurements\nContingent Earnout Payments\n – Devon had the right to receive contingent consideration related to the Barnett asset divestiture based on future oil and gas prices. 2024 was the last performance period related to this contingent consideration. These values were derived using a Monte Carlo valuation model and qualify as a level 3 fair value measurement. For additional information, see \nNote 2\n.\n\n\n20.\nRep\nortable S\negments\nDevon is a leading independent energy company engaged primarily in the exploration, development and production of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Devon’s oil and gas exploration and production activities are solely focused in the U.S. For financial reporting purposes, Devon aggregates its U.S. operating segments into one reporting segment due to the similar nature of these operations.\nDevon’s chief operating decision maker is the executive committee, which includes the chief executive officer, chief operating officers and chief financial officer. To assess the performance of our assets, we use net earnings. We believe net earnings provides information useful in assessing our operating and financial performance across periods.\n\n\n85\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nThe following table reflects Devon's net earnings, assets and capital expenditures for the time periods presented below.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\nYear Ended December 31,\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2024\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2023\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2022\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal revenues\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,940\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n15,258\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n19,169\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOE\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,574\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,428\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,071\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nGathering, processing & transportation\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n790\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n702\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n693\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction and property taxes\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n819\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n798\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,033\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal significant expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,183\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,928\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,797\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarketing and midstream expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,792\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n4,409\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n5,780\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD&A\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n3,255\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,554\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n2,223\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nG&A\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n500\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n408\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n395\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancing costs, net\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n363\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n308\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n309\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome tax expense\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n770\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n841\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n1,738\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther segment items \n(1)\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n135\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n28\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n(\n110\n\n\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal expenses\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n12,998\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n11,476\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n13,132\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet earnings\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n2,942\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,782\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n6,037\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotal assets\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n30,489\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n24,490\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n23,271\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital expenditures, including acquisitions\n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n8,919\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n3,907\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n$\n\n\n5,301\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n(1)\nOther segment items included in segment net earnings are exploration expenses, asset dispositions and other, net.\n\n\n21.\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Operations (Unaudited)\n\n\nSupplemental unaudited information regarding Devon’s oil and gas activities is presented in this note.

In total, we recorded modest upward revisions in the Delaware Basin (\n7\n MMBoe), Eagle Ford (\n5\n MMBoe), Anadarko Basin (\n4\n MMBoe) and Powder River Basin (\n2\n MMBoe) which were offset by downward revisions in the Williston Basin (-\n19\n MMBoe) due to reduced well performance compared to previous estimates.\n2022\n – Total revisions other than price (-\n49\n MMBoe) were driven by higher operating costs across all areas of operation and revisions to proved undeveloped reserves. These downward revisions were partially offset by upward revisions due to well performance exceeding previous estimates primarily in the Delaware Basin. In total, after accounting for these compensating factors, we recorded negative revisions across each of our operating areas with the most significant changes being located in the Delaware Basin (-\n33\n MMBoe), followed by the Powder River Basin (-\n5\n MMBoe) and the Anadarko Basin (-\n4\n MMBoe).\n \nExtensions and Discoveries\nEach year, Devon’s proved reserves extensions and discoveries consist of adding proved undeveloped reserves to locations classified as undeveloped at year-end and adding proved developed reserves from successful development wells drilled on locations outside the areas classified as proved at the previous year-end. Therefore, it is not uncommon for Devon’s total proved extensions and discoveries to differ from the extensions and discoveries for Devon’s proved undeveloped reserves. Furthermore, because annual additions are classified according to reserve determinations made at the previous year-end and because Devon operates a multi-basin portfolio with assets at varying stages of maturity, extensions and discoveries for proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves can differ significantly in any particular year.\n2024\n – Of the \n340\n MMBoe of additions from extensions and discoveries, \n252\n MMBoe were in the Delaware Basin, \n36\n MMBoe were in the Williston Basin, \n30\n MMBoe were in the Anadarko Basin, \n16\n MMBoe were in Eagle Ford and \n6\n MMBoe were in the Powder River Basin.\n2023\n – Of the \n322\n MMBoe of additions from extensions and discoveries, \n212\n MMBoe were in the Delaware Basin, \n33\n MMBoe were in the Anadarko Basin, \n32\n MMBoe were in Eagle Ford, \n26\n MMBoe were in the Powder River Basin and \n19\n MMBoe were in the Williston Basin.\n2022\n – Of the \n278\n MMBoe of additions from extensions and discoveries, \n255\n MMBoe were in the Delaware Basin, \n7\n MMBoe were in the Powder River Basin, \n6\n MMBoe were in Eagle Ford, \n5\n MMBoe were in the Anadarko Basin and \n5\n MMBoe were in the Williston Basin.\n\n\n89\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n \nDEVON ENERGY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (Continued)\n \n\n\nPurchase of Reserves\n \nDuring 2024, Devon had reserve additions due to the acquisition of \n247\n MMBoe in the Williston Basin.

Under the supervision and with the participation of Devon’s management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in \nInternal Control – Integrated Framework\n issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “2013 COSO Framework”). Based on this evaluation under the 2013 COSO Framework, which was completed on February 19, 2025, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\nManagement’s assessment and conclusion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 excludes an assessment of the internal control over financial reporting of Grayson Mill, which was acquired in a business combination on September 27, 2024. See \nNote 2\n in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report for further details on the Grayson Mill acquisition.  The total revenues of Grayson Mill represent $687 million of the related consolidated financial statement amounts for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the total fair value of the Grayson Mill assets acquired as of the Grayson Mill acquisition closing date represent $5.6 billion of the total assets of the consolidated Company as of December 31, 2024.\n\n\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm who audited our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024, as stated in their report, which is included under “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this report.\n\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\n\nOther than incorporating Grayson Mill's processes and procedures, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2024 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\n\nItem 9B.\n \nOther\n Information\n \n\n\nNo\nt applicable.\n\n\n92\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nItem 9\nC.\n \nDisclosure Regarding Foreign Jurisdictions that Prevent Inspections\n \n\n\nNot applicable.\n\n\n93\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPART \nIII\n\n\nItem 10.\n \nDirectors, Executive O\nfficers and Corporate Governance\n\n\nThe information called for by this Item 10 is incorporated herein by reference to the definitive Proxy Statement to be filed by Devon pursuant to Regulation 14A of the General Rules and applicable information in Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 no later than 120 days following the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\nItem 11.\n \nExecuti\nve Compensation\n\n\nThe information called for by this Item 11 is incorporated herein by reference to the definitive Proxy Statement to be filed by Devon pursuant to Regulation 14A of the General Rules and applicable information in Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 no later than 120 days following the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\nItem 12.\n \nSecurity Ownership of Certain Beneficial O\nwners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters\n\n\nThe information called for by this Item 12 is incorporated herein by reference to the definitive Proxy Statement to be filed by Devon pursuant to Regulation 14A of the General Rules and applicable information in Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 no later than 120 days following the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\nItem 13.\n \nCertain Relationships and Related T\nransactions, and Director Independence\n\n\nThe information called for by this Item 13 is incorporated herein by reference to the definitive Proxy Statement to be filed by Devon pursuant to Regulation 14A of the General Rules and applicable information in Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 no later than 120 days following the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\nItem 14.\n \nPrincipal Acc\nountant Fees and Services\n\n\nThe information called for by this Item 14 is incorporated herein by reference to the definitive Proxy Statement to be filed by Devon pursuant to Regulation 14A of the General Rules and applicable information in Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 no later than 120 days following the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n\n \n\n\n94\n\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\nPAR\nT IV\n\n\nItem 15.\n \nExhibits and Fin\nancial Statement Schedules\n\n\n(a) The following documents are included as part of this report:\n\n\n1.
